        "Recent research in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) tends to incorporate more linguistically grammatical information into the translation model known as linguistically motivated syntax-based models.",
        "To develop such models, the phrasal structure parse tree is usually adopted as the representation of bilingual sentence pairs either on the source side (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006) or on the target side (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006), or even on both sides (Graehl and Knight, 2004; Zhang et al., 2007).",
        "Most of the above models either construct a pipeline to transform from/to tree structure, or synchronously generate two trees in parallel (i.e., synchronous parsing).",
        "Both cases require syntactically rich translational equivalences to handle non-local reordering.",
        "However, most current works obtain the syntactic translational equivalences by initially conducting alignment on the word level.",
        "To employ word alignment as a hard constraint for rule extraction has difficulty in capturing such non-local phenomena and will fully propagate the word alignment error to the later stage of rule extraction.",
        "Alternatively, some initial attempts have been made to directly conduct syntactic structure alignment.",
        "As mentioned in Tinsley et al.",
        "(2007), the early work usually constructs the structure alignment by hand, which is time-consuming.",
        "Recent research tries to automatically align the bilingual syntactic sub-trees.",
        "However, most of these works suffer from the following problems.",
        "Firstly, the alignment is conducted based on heuristic rules, which may lose extensibility and generality in spite of accommodating some common cases (Groves et al., 2004).",
        "Secondly, various similarity computation methods are used based merely on lexical translation probabilities (Tinsley et al., 2007; Imamura, 2001) regardless of structural features.",
        "We believe the structure information is an important issue to capture the non-local structural divergence of languages by modeling beyond the plain text.",
        "To address the above issues, we present a statistical framework based on Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model.",
        "Specifically, we consider subtree alignment as a binary classification problem and use Maximum Entropy model to classify each instance as aligned or unaligned.",
        "Then, we perform a greedy search within the reduced search space to conduct sub-tree alignment links based on the alignment probabilities obtained from the classifier.",
        "Unlike the previous approaches that can only measure the structural divergence via lexical features, our approach can incorporate both lexical and structural features.",
        "Additionally, instead of explicitly describing the instances of sub-tree pairs as factorized sub-structures, we frame most of our features as score based feature functions, which helps solve the problem using limited sub-tree alignment annotated data.",
        "To train the model and evaluate the alignment performance, we adopt",
        "Figure 1 : Sub-tree alignment as referred to Node alignment",
        "HIT Chinese-English parallel tree bank for gold standard evaluation.",
        "To explore its effectiveness in SMT systems, we also manually annotate sub-tree alignment on automatically parsed tree pairs and perform the noisy data evaluation.",
        "Experimental results show that by only using limited sub-tree aligned data of both corpora, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline method (Tinsley et al., 2007).",
        "The proposed features are very effective in modeling the bilingual structural similarity.",
        "We further apply the sub-tree alignment to relax the constraint of word alignment for both phrase and syntax based SMT systems and gain an improvement in BLEU.",
        "Problem definition",
        "A sub-tree alignment process pairs up the subtrees across bilingual parse trees, whose lexical leaf nodes covered are translational equivalent, i.e., sharing the same semantics.",
        "Grammatically, the task conducts links between syntactic constituents with the maximum tree structures generated over their word sequences in bilingual tree pairs.",
        "In general, sub-tree alignment can also be interpreted as conducting multiple links across internal nodes between sentence-aligned tree pairs as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "The aligned sub-tree pairs usually maintain a non-isomorphic relation with each other especially for higher layers.",
        "We adapt the same criteria as Tinsley et al.",
        "(2007) in our study:",
        "(i) a node can only be linked once;",
        "(ii) descendants of a source linked node may only link to descendants of its target linked counterpart;",
        "(iii) ancestors of a source linked node may only link to ancestors of its target linked counterpart.",
        "where the term \"node\" refers to root of a subtree, which can be used to represent the sub-tree.",
        "We solve the problem as binary classification and employ MaxEnt model with a greedy search.",
        "Given a bilingual tree pair and , (s-l, ...,S[, ...,S/} is the source tree consisting of / sub-trees, where / is also the number of nodes in the source tree S .",
        "T] = {tL,...,tj,...,t}} is the target tree consisting of sub-trees, where is also the number of nodes in the target tree T.",
        "For each sub-tree pair in the given bilingual parse trees , the sub-tree alignment probability is given by:",
        "Feature functions are defined in a quadruple ( a, si,tj,6).",
        "6 is an additional variable to incorporate new dependencies other than the sub-tree pairs.",
        "For each feature function ( ), a weight is applied to tailor the distribution.",
        "After classifying the candidate sub-tree pairs as aligned or unaligned, we perform a greedy search within the reduced search space to conduct sure links based on the conditional probability Pr(a\\si,tj6) obtained from the classifier.",
        "The alignment probability is independently normalized for each sub-tree pair and hence suitable as a searching metric.",
        "The greedy search algorithm can be described as an automaton.",
        "A state in the search space is a partial alignment with respect to the given bilingual tree pair.",
        "A transition is to add one more link of node pairs to the current state.",
        "The initial state has no link.",
        "The terminal state is a state where no more links can be added according to the definition in Section 2.",
        "We use greedy search to generate the best-links at the early stage.",
        "There are cases that the correctly-aligned tree pairs have very few links, while we have a bunch of candidates with lower alignment probabilities.",
        "However, the sum of the lower probabilities is larger than that of the correct links', since the number of correct links is much fewer.",
        "This makes the alignment results biased to be with more links.",
        "The greedy search helps avoid this asymmetric problem.",
        "Feature Functions",
        "In this section, we introduce a variety of feature functions to capture the semantically equivalent counterparts and structural divergence across languages.",
        "For the semantic equivalence, we define lexical and word alignment feature functions.",
        "Since those feature functions are directional, we describe most of these functions as conditional feature functions based on the conditional lexical probabilities.",
        "We also introduce the tree structural features to deal with the structural divergence of bilingual parse trees.",
        "Inspired by Burkett and Klein (2008), we introduce the feature functions in an internal-external manner based on the fact that the feature scores for an aligned sub-tree pair tend to be high inside both sub-trees, while they tend to be low inside one sub-tree and outside the other.",
        "Internal Lexical Features",
        "We use this feature to measure the degree of semantic equivalence of the sub-tree pair.",
        "According to the definition of sub-tree alignment in Section 2, the word sequence covered by the sub-tree pair should be translational equivalence.",
        "Therefore, the lexicons within the two corresponding sub-spans should be highly related in semantics.",
        "We define the internal lexical features as follows:",
        "where refers to the lexical translation probability from the source word to the target word within the sub-tree spans, while refers to that from target to source; refers to the word set for the internal span of the source sub-tree si, while in(t;) refers to that of the target sub-tree .",
        "span and large outer span, the sum of internal-external scores may be overestimated.",
        "As a result, we change the sum operation into max, which is easy to be normalized.",
        "Although the word alignment information within bilingual sentence pairs is to some extent not reliable, the links of word alignment account much for the co-occurrence of the aligned terms.",
        "We define the internal word alignment features as follows:",
        "P(s t,tj) where",
        "The binary function is introduced to trigger the computation only when a word aligned link exists for the two words within the subtree span.",
        "Similar to lexical features, we also introduce internal-external word alignment features as follows:",
        "Internal-External Lexical Features",
        "Intuitively, lexical translation probabilities tend to be high within the translational equivalence, while low within the non-equivalent counterparts.",
        "According to this, we define the internal-external lexical feature functions as follows:",
        "where refers to the word set for the external span of the source sub-tree , while refers to that of the target sub-tree .",
        "We choose a representation different from the internal lexical feature scores, since for cases with small inner",
        "In addition to the lexical correspondence, we also capture the structural divergence by introducing the tree structural features as follows:",
        "Span difference: Translational equivalent subtree pairs tend to share similar length of spans.",
        "Thus the model will penalize the candidate subtree pairs with largely different length of spans.",
        "Number of Descendants: Similarly, the number of the root's descendants of the aligned subtrees should also correspond.",
        "where R(. )",
        "refers to the descendant set of the root to an individual sub-tree.",
        "Tree Depth difference: Intuitively, translational equivalent sub-tree pairs tend to have similar depth from the root node of the parse tree.",
        "We can further allow the model to penalize the candidate sub-tree pairs with different distance from the root node.",
        "In the previous sections, we design some score based feature functions to describe syntactic tree structural similarities, rather than directly using the substructures.",
        "This is because for limited annotated tree alignment data, features like tokens and grammar rules are rather sparse.",
        "In spite of this, we still have a closed set of grammatical tags which can be covered by a small amount of data.",
        "Therefore, we use the combination of root grammar tags of the sub-tree pairs as binary features."

        "We also find that sub-tree alignment benefits the STSSG based model less compared with other systems.",
