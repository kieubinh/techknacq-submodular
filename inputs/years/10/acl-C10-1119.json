        "A number of verb classifications have been built to support natural language processing (nlp) tasks (Grishman et al., 1994; Miller, 1995; Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005; Kipper-Schuler, 2005; Hovy et al., 2006).",
        "These include both syntactic and semantic classifications, as well as ones which integrate aspects of both.",
        "Classifications which integrate a wide range of linguistic properties can be particularly useful for nlp applications suffering from data sparseness.",
        "One such classification is VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005).",
        "Building on the taxonomy of Levin (1993), VerbNet groups verbs (e.g. deliver, post, dispatch) into classes (e.g. send) on the basis of their shared meaning components and syntactic behaviour, identified in terms of meaning preserving diathesis alternations.",
        "Such classes can be identified across the entire lexicon, and they may also apply across",
        "Cedric Messiant",
        "languages, since their meaning components are said to be cross-linguistically applicable (Jackendoff, 1990).",
        "Offering a powerful tool for generalization, abstraction and prediction, VerbNet classes have been used to support many important nlp tasks, including e.g. computational lexicography, parsing, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information extraction, question-answering, and machine translation (Swier and 2005; Abend et al., 2008).",
        "However, to date their exploitation has been limited because for most languages, no Levin style classification is available.",
        "Since manual classification is costly (Kipper et al., 2008) automatic approaches have been proposed recently which could be used to learn novel classifications in a cost-effective manner (Joanis et al., 2008; Li and Brew, 2008; O Seaghdha and Korhonen, 2009).",
        "However, most work on Levin type classification has focussed on English.",
        "Large-scale research on other languages such as German (Schulte im Walde, 2006) and Japanese (Suzuki and Fukumoto, 2009) has focussed on semantic classification.",
        "Although the two classification systems have shared properties, studies comparing the overlap between VerbNet and WordNet (Miller, 1995) have reported that the mapping is only partial and many to many due to fine-grained nature of classes based on synonymy (Shi and Mi-halcea, 2005; Abend et al., 2008).",
        "Only few studies have been conducted on Levin style classification for languages other than English.",
        "In their experiment involving 59 verbs and three classes, Merlo et al.",
        "(2002) applied a supervised approach developed for English to Italian, obtaining high accuracy (86.3%).",
        "In another experiment with 60 verbs and three classes, they showed that features extracted from Chinese translations of English verbs can improve English classification.",
        "These results are promising, but those from a later experiment by Ferrer (2004) are not.",
        "Ferrer applied a clustering approach developed for English to Spanish, and evaluated it against the manual classification of Vazquez et al.",
        "(2000), constructed using criteria similar (but not identical) to Levin's.",
        "This experiment involving 514 verbs and 31 classes produced results only slightly better than the random baseline.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the cross-linguistic potential of Levin style classification further.",
        "In past years, verb classification techniques - in particular unsupervised ones - have improved considerably, making investigations for a new language more feasible.",
        "We take a recent verb clustering approach developed for English (Sun and Korhonen, 2009) and apply it to French - a major language for which no such experiment has been conducted yet.",
        "Basic nlp resources (corpora, taggers, parsers and subcategorization acquisition systems) are now sufficiently developed for this language for the application of a state-of-the-art verb clustering approach to be realistic.",
        "Our investigation reveals similarities between the English and French classifications, supporting the linguistic hypothesis (Jackendoff, 1990) and the earlier result of Merlo et al.",
        "(2002) that Levin classes have a strong cross-linguistic basis.",

        "These more sophisticated features may suffer from data sparseness in our French experiment since although we required the minimum of 150 occurrences per verb, verb clustering performance tends to improve when more data is available, and given the fine-grained nature of LexShem SCFs it is likely that more data is required for optimal performance.",
        "We therefore performed another experiment with French on the full set of 147 verbs, using S PEC, where we investigated the effect of instance filtering on the performance of the best features from each feature group: F3, F7, F13 and F17.",
        "The results shown in Table 3 reveal that the performance of the features remains fairly similar until the instance threshold of 1000.",
        "When 2000 occurrences per verb are used, the differences become clearer, until at the threshold of 4000, it is obvious that the most sophisticated SCF-SP feature F17 is by far the best feature for French (65.4 F) and the SCF feature F3 the second best (60.5 F).",
        "The COfeature F7 and the LP feature F13 are not nearly as good (53.4 and 51.0 F).",
        "Although the results at different thresholds are not comparable due to the different number of verbs and classes (see columns 2-3), the results for features at the same threshold are.",
        "Those results suggest that when 2000 or more occurrences per verb are used, most features perform like they performed for English in the experiment of Sun and Korhonen (2009), with CO being the least informative and SCF-SP being the most informative feature.",
        "The only exception is the lp feature which performed better than c o in English.",
        "We conducted qualitative analysis of the clusters for French: those created using spec with Fl7 and F3.",
        "Verbs in the gold standard classes 29.2, 36.l, 37.3, 37.7 and 47.3 (Table l) performed particularly well, with the majority of member verbs found in the same cluster.",
        "These verbs are ideal for clustering because they have distinctive syntactic-semantic characteristics.",
        "For example, verbs in 29.2 characterize class (e.g. concevoir, considérer, dépeindre) not only have a very specific meaning but they also take high frequency scfs involving the preposition comme (Eng.",
        "as)",
        "available for a verb, CO outperforms all the other features in French, compensating for data sparseness.",
        "which is not typical to many other classes.",
        "Interestingly, Levin classes 29.2, 36.l, 37.3, and 37.7 were among the best performing classes also in the supervised verb classification experiment of Sun et al.",
        "(2008) because these classes have distinctive characteristics also in English.",
        "The benefit of sophisticated features which integrate also semantic (sp) information (Fl7) is particularly evident for classes with non-distinctive syntactic characteristics.",
        "For example, the intransitive verbs in 43.l light emission class (e.g. briller, etinceler, flamboyer) are difficult to cluster based on syntax only, but semantic features work because the verbs pose strong sps on their subjects (entities capable of light emission).",
        "In the experiment of Sun et al.",
        "(2008), 43.l was the worst performing class, possibly because no semantic features were used in the experiment.",
        "The most frequent source of error is syntactic idiosyncracy.",
        "This is particularly evident for classes l0.l remove and 45.4 change of state.",
        "Although verbs in these classes can take similar scfs and alternations, only some of them are frequent in data.",
        "For example, the scf oter X a Y is frequent for verbs in l0.l, but not oter X de Y.",
        "Although class l0.l did not suffer from this problem in the English experiment of Sun et al.",
        "(2008), class 45.4 did.",
        "Class 45.4 performs particularly bad in French also because its member verbs are low in frequency.",
        "Some errors are due to polysemy, caused partly by the fact that the French version of the gold standard was not controlled for this factor.",
        "Some verbs have their predominant senses in classes which are missing in the gold standard, e.g. the most frequent sense of retenir is memorize, not keep as in the gold standard class l3.5.l.",
        "get.",
        "Finally, some errors are not true errors but demonstrate the capability of clustering to learn novel information.",
        "For example, the change of state class 45.4 includes many antonyms (e.g. weaken vs. strenghten).",
        "Clustering (using Fl7) separates these antonyms, so that verbs adoucir, atténuer and temperer appear in one cluster and consolider and renforcer in another.",
        "Although these verbs share the same alternations, their sps are different.",
        "The opposite effect can be observed when clustering maps together classes which are semantically and syntactically related (e.g. 36.l correspond and 37.7 speak).",
        "Such classes are distinct in Levin and VerbNet, although should ideally be related.",
        "Cases such as these show the potential of clustering in discovering novel valuable information in data.",

        "When sufficient corpus data is available, there is a strong correlation between the types of features which perform the best in English and French.",
        "When the best features are used, many individual Levin classes have similar performance in the two languages.",
        "Due to differences in data sets direct comparison of performance figures for English and French is not possible.",
        "When considering the general level of performance, our best performance for French (65.4 f) is lower than the best performance for English in the experiment of Sun and Korhonen (2009).",
        "However, it does compare favourably to the performance of other state-of-the-art (even supervised) English systems (Joa-nis et al., 2008; Li and Brew, 2008; O Seaghdha and Copestake, 2008; Vlachos et al., 2009).",
        "This is impressive considering that we experimented with a fully unsupervised approach originally developed for another language.",
        "When aiming to improve performance further, employing larger data is critical.",
        "Most recent experiments on English have employed bigger data sets, and unlike us, some of them have only considered the predominant senses of medium-high frequency verbs.",
        "As seen in section 7.l, such differences in data can have significant impact on performance.",
        "However, parser and feature extraction performance can also play a big role in overall accuracy, and should therefore be investigated further (Sun and Korhonen, 2009).",
        "The relatively low performance of basic lp features in French suggests that at least some of the current errors are due to parsing.",
        "Future research should investigate the source of error at different stages of processing.",
        "In addition, it would be interesting to investigate whether language-specific tuning (e.g. using language specific features such as auxiliary classes) can further improve performance on French.",
        "Earlier works most closely related to ours are those of Merlo et al.",
        "(2002) and Ferrer (2004).",
        "Our results contrast with those of Ferrer who showed that a clustering approach does not transfer well from English to Spanish.",
        "However, she used basic scf and named entity features only, and a clustering algorithm less suitable for high dimensional data.",
        "Like us, Merlo et al.",
        "(2002) created a gold standard by translating Levin classes to another language (Italian).",
        "They also applied a method developed for English to Italian, and reported good overall performance using features developed for English.",
        "Although the experiment was small (focussing on three classes and a few features only) and involved supervised classification, the results agree with ours.",
        "These experiments support the linguistic hypothesis that Levin style classification can be cross-linguistically applicable.",
        "A clustering technique such as the one presented here could be used as a tool for investigating whether classifications are similar across a wider range of more diverse languages.",
        "From the nlp perspective, the fact that an unsupervised technique developed for one language can be applied to another language without the need for substantial tuning means that automatic techniques could be used to hypothesise useful Levin style classes for further languages.",
        "This, in turn, could facilitate the creation of multilingual VerbNets in the future."
