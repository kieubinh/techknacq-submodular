        "Semi-supervised learning of structured variables is a difficult problem that has received considerable attention recently, but most results have been negative (Abney, 2008).",
        "This paper uses stacked learning (Wolpert, 1992) to reduce structured variables, i.e. dependency graphs, to multinomial variables, i.e. attachment and labeling decisions, which are easier to manage in semi-supervised learning scenarios, and which can later be combined into dependency trees using parsing algorithms for arc-factored dependency parsing.",
        "Our approach thus combines ensemble-based methods and semi-supervised learning.",
        "Ensemble-based methods such as stacked learning are used to reduce the instability ofclas-sifiers, to average out their errors and to combine the strengths ofdiverse learning algorithms.",
        "Ensemble-based methods have attracted a lot of attention in dependency parsing recently (Sagae and Lavie, 2006; Hall et al., 2007; Nivre and McDonald, 2008; Martins et al., 2008; Fishel and Nivre, 2009; Surdeanu and Manning, 2010).",
        "Nivre and McDonald (2008) were first to introduce stacking in the context of dependency parsing.",
        "Semi-supervised learning is typically motivated by data sparseness.",
        "For many classification tasks in natural language processing, labeled data can be in short supply but unla-beled data is more readily available.",
        "Semi-supervised methods exploit unlabeled data in addition to labeled data to improve performance on classification tasks.",
        "If the predictions of a learner l on unlabeled data are used to improve a learner I in semi-supervised learning, the robustness of learning will depend on the stability of l. Combining ensemble-based and semi-supervised methods may thus lead to more robust semi-supervised learning.",
        "Ensemble-based and semi-supervised methods are some of the areas that receive most attention in machine learning today, but relatively little attention has been given to combining these methods (Zhou, 2009).",
        "Semi-supervised learning algorithms can be categorized with respect to the number of views, i.e. the number of feature sets, and the number of learners used to inform each other (Hady and Schwenker, 2008).",
        "Self-training and expectation maximization are perhaps the best known semi-supervised learning algorithms (Abney, 2008).",
        "They are both single-view and single-learner algorithms.",
        "Since there is thus only a single perspective on data, selecting unlabeled data points with predictions is a difficult task.",
        "There is an imminent danger that the learner amplifies its previous mistakes, and while several techniques such as balancing and throttling have been developed to avoid such caveats, using single-view and single-learner algorithms often requires both caution and experience with the modeling task at hand.",
        "Algorithms with multiple views on data are known to be more robust.",
        "This insight led to the development of co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), a two-view method where views inform each other, but it also paved the way for the integration of ensemble-based and semi-supervised methods, i.e. for methods with multiple learners.",

        "Our observed variables are sentences with words labeled with part-of-speech tags.",

        "Each vertex corresponds to a word in the sentence, except 0 which is the root vertex, i.e. for any i < n (i, 0) G A.",
        "Since a dependency tree is a tree it is acyclic.",
        "A tree is projective if every vertex has a continuous projection, i.e. if and only if for every arc (i, j) G A and node k G V, if i < k < j or j < k < i then there is a subset of arcs {(i, il), (ii, i2),..., (ifc-i,ifc )} G A suchthat ik = k.",
        "In this paper we use a maximum spanning tree algorithm, the so-called Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm (CLE) (Edmonds, 1967) to turn the predictions of our semi-supervised classifiers into a dependency tree.",
        "Stacked generalization, or simply stacking, was first proposed by Wolpert (1992).",
        "Stacking is an ensemble-based learning method where multiple weak classifiers are combined in a strong end classifier.",
        "The idea is to train the end classifier directly on the predictions of the input classifiers.",
        "Say each input classifier a with 1 < i < n receives an input x and outputs a prediction a (x).",
        "The end classifier then takes as input (x, ci (x),..., cn(x)) and outputs a final prediction Co((x, ci(x),..., cn(x))).",
        "Training is done by cross-validation.",
        "In sum, stacking is training a classifier on the output of classifiers.",
        "Stacked learning can be generalized to structured prediction tasks such as dependency parsing.",
        "Architectures for stacking dependency parsers typically only use one input parser, but otherwise the intuition is the same: the input parser is used to augment the dependency structures that the end parser is trained and evaluated on.",

        "The input features of the input classifiers in stacked learning x can of course be removed from the input of the end classifier.",
        "It is also possible to stack stacked classifiers.",
        "This leaves us with four strategies for recursive stacking; namely to constantly augment the feature set, with level n classifiers trained on the predictions of the classifiers at all n – 1 lower levels with or without the input features x, or simply to train a level n classifier on the predictions of the level n – 1 classifiers with or without x.",
        "In this work we stack stacked dependency parsers by training classifiers on the output of three stacked dependency parsers and POS tags.",
        "Consequently, we use one of the features from x.",
        "Note that we train classifiers and not parsers on this new level 2.",
        "The reduction is done the following way: First we train a classifier on the relative distance from a word to its head to induce attachments.",
        "For example, we may obtain the following features from the predictions of our level 1 parsers:",
        "In the second row all input parsers, p1-3 in columnsaa 2-4, agree that the verb is the root of the sentence.",
        "Column 1 tells us that this is correct.",

        "We train level 2 classifiers on feature vectors produced this way.",
        "Note that oracle performance of the ensemble is no upper bound on the accuracy of a classifier trained on level 1 predictions this way, since a classifier may learn the right decision from three wrong predictions and a POS tag.",
