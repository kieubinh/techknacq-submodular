        "The hat categories of Honnibal and Curran (2009) may better handle form/function discrepancies such as the Chinese zero copula construction, leading to cleaner, more general analyses.",
        "We have presented a wide-coverage Chinese corpus which exploits the strengths of ccg to analyse a range of challenging Chinese constructions.",
        "We are now ready to develop rich nlp tools, including efficient, wide-coverage ccg parsers, to address the ever-increasing volumes of Chinese text now available."
