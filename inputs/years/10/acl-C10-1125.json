        "In natural language processing, one of the most challenging tasks is the proper treatment of collocations, which term comprises light verb constructions as well.",
        "Every multiword expression is considered to be a collocation if its members often co-occur and its form is fixed to some extent (Siepmann, 2005; Siepmann, 2006; Sag et al., 2001; Oravecz et al., 2004; Varadi, 2006).",
        "Collocations are frequent in language use and they usually exhibit unique behaviour, thus, they often pose a problem to NLP systems.",
        "Light verb constructions deserve special attention in NLP applications for several reasons.",
        "First, their meaning is not totally compositional, that is, it cannot be computed on the basis of the meanings of the parts of the collocation and the way they are related to each other.",
        "Thus, the result of translating the parts of the collocation can hardly be considered as the proper translation of the original expression.",
        "Second, light verb constructions (e.g. make a mistake) often share their syntactic pattern with other constructions such as literal verb + noun combinations (e.g. make a cake) or idioms (e.g. make a meal), thus, their identification cannot be based on solely syntactic patterns.",
        "Third, since the syntactic and the semantic head of the construction are not the same the syntactic head being the verb and the semantic head being the noun -, they require special treatment when parsing.",
        "It can be argued that they form a complex verb similarly to phrasal or prepositional verbs (as reflected in the term complex verb structures).",
        "Thus, it is advisable to indicate their special syntacto-semantic relationship: in dependency grammars, the new role QUASIARGUMENT might be proposed for this purpose."

        "Identifying multiword expressions in general and light verb constructions in particular is not unequivocal since constructions with similar syntactic structure (e.g. verb + noun combinations) can belong to different subclasses on the productivity scale (i.e. productive combinations, light verb constructions and idioms).",

        "However, in agglutinative languages such as Hungarian, nouns can have several grammatical cases, some of which typically occur in a light verb construction when paired with a certain verb.",

        "On the other hand, when it is preceded or followed by a noun in the sublative or illative case (the typical position of the noun in Hungarian light verb constructions being right before or after the verb), it is most likely a light verb construction.",
        "To illustrate this, we offer some examples:",
        "The first one is a productive combination (with the noun being in the accusative form) while the second one is a light verb construction.",

        "On the other hand, the presence of a noun in the illative or sublative case immediately preceding or following the verb strongly suggests that a light verb instance of hoz is under investigation.",
        "Most light verb constructions have a verbal counterpart derived from the same stem as the noun, which entails that it is mostly deverbal nouns that occur in light verb constructions (as in make/take a decision compared to decide or dontést hoz vs. dont in Hungarian).",
        "The identification of such nouns is possible with the help of a morphosyntactic parser that is able to treat derivation as well (e.g. hunmorph for Hungarian (Troon et al., 2005)), and the combination of a possible light verb and a deverbal noun typically results in a light verb construction.",
        "Thus, an algorithm that makes use of mor-phosyntactic and derivational information and previously given lists can be constructed to identify light verb constructions in texts.",
        "It is important that the identification of light verb constructions precedes syntactic parsing, for the noun and the verb in the construction form one complex predicate, which has its effects on parsing: other arguments belong not solely to the verb but to the complex predicate.",

        "In the following, the ways machine translation and information extraction can profit from such a corpus and algorithm are shortly presented.",
        "When translating collocations, translation programs face two main problems.",
        "On the one hand, parts of the collocation do not always occur next to each other in the sentence (split collocations).",
        "In this case, the computer must first recognize that the parts of the collocation form one unit (Oravecz et al., 2004), for which the multiword context of the given word must be considered.",
        "On the other hand, the lack (or lower degree) of compositional-ity blocks the possibility of word-by-word translation (Siepmann, 2005; Siepmann, 2006).",

        "Annotated corpora (especially and most desirably, parallel corpora) and explanatory-combinatorial dictionaries are possible sources of such lists.",
        "Since in foreign language equivalents of light verb constructions, the nominal components are usually literal translations of each other (Vincze, 2009), by collating the corresponding noun entries in these lists the foreign language variant of the given light verb construction can easily be found.",
        "On the other hand, in order to improve the building of such lists, we plan to annotate light verb constructions in a subcorpus of SzegedParalell, a Hungarian-English manually aligned parallel corpus (Tooth et al., 2008).",

        "This can be carried out by a syntactic parser and is a relatively simple task.",
        "However, the identification of the syntactic status of the nominal component is more complex in the case of light verb constructions for it is a quasi-argument of the verb not to be confused with other arguments (Alonso Ramos, 1998).",

        "(1995)).",
        "These dictionaries indicate light verb constructions within the entry of the nominal component.",

        "If a precise syntactic analysis is needed, it is crucial to know which argument belongs to which governor.",
        "Nevertheless, it is still debated if syntactic arguments should be divided between the nominal component and the verb (see Meyers et al.",
        "(2004a) on argument sharing) and if yes, how (Alonso Ramos, 2007).",
        "For the purpose of information extraction, such a detailed analysis is unnecessary and in general terms, the nominal component can be seen as part of the verb, that is, they form a complex verb similarly to phrasal or prepositional verbs and this complex verb is considered to be the governor of arguments.",
        "Thus, the following data can be yielded by the IE algorithm: there is an event of decision-making, Pete is its subject and it is about his future (and not an event of making with the arguments decision, Pete and his future).",
