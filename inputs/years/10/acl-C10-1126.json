        "Given an exceptionally large training corpus, a phrase-based system can learn these reordering on a case by case basis.",
        "But, if our systems are to generalize to phrases not seen in the training data, they must explicitly capture and model these reorderings.",
        "However, permutations are difficult to model and impractical to search.",
        "Presently, approaches that handle reorderings",
        "Nanda Kambhatla",
        "typically model word and phrase movements via a distortion model and rely on the target language model to produce words in the right order.",
        "Early distortion models simply penalized longer jumps more than shorter jumps (Koehn et al., 2003) independent of the source or target phrases in question.",
        "Other models (Tillman, 2004), (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006) generalize this to include lexical dependencies on the source.",
        "Another approach is to incorporate features, based on the target syntax, during modeling and decoding, and this is shown to be effective for various language pairs (Yamada and Knight, 2001), (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).",
        "Hierarchical phrase-based decoding (Chiang, 2005) also allows for long range reordering without explicitly modeling syntax.",
        "While these approaches have been shown to improve machine translation performance (Zollmann et al., 2008) they usually combine chart parsing with the decoding process, and are significantly more computationally intensive than phrase-based systems.",
        "A third approach, one that has proved to be useful for phrase-based SMT systems, is to reorder each source-side sentence using a set of rules applied to a parse tree of the source sentence.",
        "The goal of these rules is to make the word order of the source sentence more similar to the expected target sentence word order.",
        "With this approach, the reordering rules are applied before training and testing with an SMT system.",
        "The efficacy of these methods has been shown on various language pairs including: French to English (Xia and McCord, 2004), German to English (Collins et al., 2005), English to",
        "Chinese, (Wang et al., 2007) and Hindi to English (Ramanathan et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we propose a simple model for reordering conditioned on the source side parse tree.",
        "The model is learned using a parallel corpus of source-target sentence pairs, machine generated word alignments, and source side parses.",
        "We apply the reordering model to both training and test data, for four different language pairs: English – Spanish, English – French, English – Hindi, and English – German.",
        "We show improvements in machine translation performance for all of the language pairs we consider except for English – German.",
        "We use this negative result to propose extensions to our reordering model.",
        "We note that the syntax based reordering we propose can be combined with other approaches to handling reordering and does not have to be followed by an assumption of monotonicity.",
        "In fact, our phrase-based model, trained upon reordered data, retains its reordering models and search, but we expect that these facilities are employed much more sparingly with reordered inputs."

        "In this section we discuss the reordering issues typical of translating between English and Hindi, French, Spanish and German which are the four language pairs we experiment on in this paper.",
        "Typical word ordering patterns common to these two European languages relate to noun phrases including groups of nouns and adjectives.",
        "In contrast to English, French and Spanish adjectives and adjunct nouns follow the main noun, i.e. we typically observe a reversal of word order in noun phrases, e.g., \"A beautiful red car\" translates into French as \"Une voiture rouge beau\",and as \"Un coche rojo bonito\" into Spanish.",
        "Phrase-based MT systems are capable of capturing these patterns provided they occur with sufficient frequency for each example in the training data.",
        "For rare noun phrases, however, the MT may produce erroneous word order that can lead to serious distortions in the meaning.",
        "Particularly difficult are nominal phrases from specialized domains that involve challenging terminology, for example: \"group reference attribute\"and \"validation checking code\".",
        "In both instances, the baseline MT system generated translations with an incorrect word order and, consequently, possibly a different meaning.",
        "We will return to these two examples in Section 5.1 to compare the output of a MT system with and without reordering.",
        "Unlike French and Spanish, German poses a considerably different challenge with respect to word ordering.",
        "The most frequent reordering in German relates to verbs, particularly verb groups consisting of auxiliary and main verbs, as well as verbs in relative clauses.",
        "Moreover, reordering patterns between German and English tend to span large portions of the sentence.",
        "We included German in our investigations to determine whether our automated rule extraction procedure can capture such long distance patterns.",
        "Hindi word order is significantly different than English word order; the typical order followed is Subject Object Verb (although Object Subject Verb order can be used if nouns are followed by appropriate case markers).",
        "This is in contrast to English which has a Subject Verb Object order.",
        "This can result in words that are close in English moving arbitrarily far apart in Hindi depending on the length of the noun phrase representing the object and the length of the verb phrase.",
        "These long range reorderings are generally hard for a phrase based system to capture.",
        "Another way Hindi and",
        "English differ is that prepositions in English become postpositions in Hindi and appear after the noun phrase.",

        "A potential source of improvements might be to use alternative parses (via different parsers or n-best parses) to generate n-best reorderings both in training and at test.",
        "Despite a common heritage, German word order is distinct from English, particularly regarding verb placement.",
        "This difference can be dramatic, if an auxiliary (e.g. modal) verb is used in conjunction with a full verb, or the sentence contains a subordinate clause.",
        "In addition to our experiments with automatically learned rules, a small set of handcrafted reordering rules was created and evaluated.",
        "Our preliminary results indicate that the latter rules tend to outperform the automatically derived ones by 0.5-1.0 BLEU points on average.",

        "RB (along with other adverbs).",
        "Another limitation apparent from the first rule above (the movement of verbs in a verb phrase depends on the previous phrase being a noun phrase) is that the automatic reordering rule for a node's children depends only on the children of that node and not a larger context.",
        "For instance, a full verb following a modal verb is typically parsed as a VP child node of the modal VP node, hence the automatic rule, as currently considered, will not take the modal verb (being a sibling of the full-verb VP node) into account.",
        "We are currently investigating extensions of the automatic rule extraction alorithm to address these shortcomings.",
        "Based on our analysis of the errors and on the hand designed German rules we would like to extend our model with more general feature functions in Equation 1 by allowing features: that are dependent on the constituent words (or headwords), that examine a large context than just a nodes children (see the first German rule above) and that fire for all permutations when the constituent X is moved to the end (or start).",
        "This would allow us to generalize more easily to learn rules of the type \"move X to the end of the phrase\".",
        "Another direction that we feel should be explored, is the use of multiple parses to obtain multiple reorderings and combine these at a later stage."
