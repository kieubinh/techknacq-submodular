        "For a given text collection with known statements on x, both Lpos and Cneg can be found by computing the most discriminant terms with respect to x.",
        "A reasonable first approach is then to filter sentences that contain terms from Lpos and lack terms from Lneg, but problems arise when terms from different vocabularies co-occur or statements on different criteria are attached to one another.",
        "Instead, we propose a statistical learning approach.",
        "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been proven to yield very good performance in both general classification and sentence extraction while being immune to overfitting (Steinwart and Christmann, 2008; Hirao et.",
        "al., 2001).",
        "For our candidates, we compute lexical and distance features based on Lpos, Lneg, and the time and money information.",

        "However, this information can mostly be obtained from a nearby indicator word (e.g. \"plus\" or \"decreased\") and, therefore, we address this problem with appropriate word lists.",
        "Once the trend is known, any two types imply the others.",
        "Though we are predominantly interested in forecasts, statements also often represent a declaration on achieved results.",
        "This distinction is essential and can be based on time-directional indicators (e.g. \"next\") and the tense of leading verbs.",
        "For this, we test both feature and kernel methods on dependency parse trees, thereby determining T and M at the same time.",
        "We only parse the identified sentences, though.",

        "Possible limitations to a geographic scope g can be recognized with word lists.",
        "In market analysis, the approximate td suffices, and for most news articles td is similar to their release date.",
