        "Document summarization methods can be either extraction-based or abstraction-based.",
        "In this section, we focus on extraction-based methods.",
        "Extraction-based methods for single-document summarization usually assign a saliency score to each sentence in a document and then rank and select the sentences.",
        "The score is usually computed based on a combination of statistical and linguistic features, such as term frequency, sentence position, cue words and stigma words (Luhn, 1969; Edmundson, 1969; Hovy and Lin, 1997).",
        "Machine learning techniques have also been used for sentence extraction (Kupiec et al., 1995; Conroy and O'Leary, mutual reinforcement principle has been exploited to iteratively extract key phrases and sentences from a document (Zha, 2002; Wan et al., 2007a).",

        "In recent years, graph-based ranking methods have been investigated for document summarization, such as TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005) and LexPag-eRank (ErKan and Radev, 2004).",
        "Similar to PageRank (Page et al., 1998), these methods first build a graph based on the similarity relationships between the sentences in a document and then the saliency of a sentence is determined by making use of the global information on the graph recursively.",
        "The basic idea underlying the graph-based ranking algorithm is that of \"voting\" or \"recommendation\" between sentences.",
        "Similar methods have been used for generic multi-document summarization.",
        "A typical method is the centroid-based method (Radev et al., 2004).",
        "For each sentence, the method computes a score based on each single feature (e.g. cluster centroids, position and TFIDF) and then linearly combines all the scores into an overall sentence score.",
        "Topic signature is used as a novel feature for selecting important content in NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002).",
        "Various sentence features have been combined by using machine learning techniques (Wong et al., 2008).",
        "A popular way for removing redundancy between summary sentences is the MMR algorithm (Car-bonell and Goldstein, 1998).",
        "Themes (or topics, clusters) in documents have been discovered and used for sentence selection (Harabagiu and La-catusu, 2005).",
        "Hachey (2009) investigates the effect of various source document representations on the accuracy of the sentence extraction phase of a multi-document summarization task.",
        "Graph-based methods have also been used to rank sentences in a document set.",
        "The methods first construct a graph to reflect sentence relationships at different granularities, and then compute sentence scores based on graph-based learning algorithms.",
        "For example, Wan (2008) proposes to use only cross-document relationships for graph building and sentence ranking.",
        "Cluster-level information has been incorporated in the graph model to better evaluate sentences (Wan and Yang, 2008).",
        "For topic-focused multi-document summarization, many methods are extensions of generic summarization methods by incorporating the information of the given topic or query into generic summarizers.",
        "In recent years, a few novel methods have been proposed for topic-focused summarization (Daumé and Marcu, 2006; Wan",

        "Given a document set, in which the whole document set and each single document in the set are required to be summarized, we use local saliency to indicate the importance of a sentence in a particular document, and use global saliency to indicate the importance of a sentence in the whole document set.",
        "In previous work, the following two assumptions are widely made for graph-based summarization models:",
        "Assumption 1: A sentence is locally important in a particular document if it is heavily linked with many locally important sentences in the same document.",
        "Assumption 3: A sentence is locally important in a particular document, if it is heavily linked with many globally important sentences in the document set.",
        "Assumption 2: A sentence is globally important in the document set if it is heavily linked with many globally important sentences in the document set.",
        "The above assumptions are the basis for Pag-eRank-like algorithms for single document summarization and multi-document summarization, respectively.",
        "In addition to the above two assumptions, we make the following two assumptions to consider the mutual influences between the two summarization tasks:",
        "The above assumption is reasonable because the documents in the set are relevant and the globally important information in the document set will be expressed in many single documents.",
        "Therefore, if a sentence is salient in the whole document set, the sentence may be salient in a particular document in the set.",
        "Assumption 4: A sentence is globally important in the document set, if it is heavily linked with many locally important sentences.",
        "The above assumption is reasonable because the documents in the set are relevant and the globally important information in the whole set is the aggregation of the locally important information in each single document.",
        "Therefore, if a sentence is salient in a particular document, the sentence has the potential to be salient in the whole document set.",
        "In brief, the local saliency and global saliency of a sentence can mutually influence and boost each other: high local saliency will lead to high global saliency, and high global saliency will lead to high local saliency.",
        "Based on the above assumptions, our proposed approach first builds affinity graphs (each graph is represented by an affinity matrix) to reflect the different kinds of relationships between sentences, respectively, and then iteratively computes the local saliency scores and the global saliency scores of the sentences based on the graphs.",
        "Finally, the algorithm converges and the local saliency score and global saliency score of each sentence are obtained.",
        "The sentences with high local saliency scores in a particular document are chosen into the summary of the single document, and the sentences with high global saliency scores in the set are chosen into the summary of the document set.",
        "Note that for both summarization tasks, after the saliency scores of sentences have been obtained, the greedy algorithm used in (Wan et al., 2007c) is applied to remove redundancy and finally choose both informative and novel sentences into the summary.",
