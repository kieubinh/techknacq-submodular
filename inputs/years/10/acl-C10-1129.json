        "Previous studies are limited to rule-based methods and learning based on lexical features, lacking in linguistic analysis.",

        "Anyone who has Internet access can visit, edit and delete Wikipedia articles without authentication.",
        "A primary threat to this convenience, however, is vandalism, which has become one of Wikipe-dia's biggest concerns (Geiger, 2010).",
        "To date, automatic countermeasures mainly involve rule-based approaches and these are not very effective.",
        "Therefore, Wikipedia volunteers have to spend a large amount of time identifying vandalized articles manually, rather than spending time contributing content to the articles.",
        "Hence, there is a need for more effective approaches to automatic vandalism detection.",
        "In contrast to spam detection tasks, where a full spam message, which is typically 4K Bytes (Rigoutsos and Huynh, 2004), can be sampled and analyzed (Itakura and Clarke, 2009), Wiki-pedia vandals typically change only a small number of words or sentences in the targeted article.",
        "In our preliminary corpus (Potthast et al., 2007), we find the average size of 201 vandalized texts to be only 1K Byte.",
        "This leaves very few clues for vandalism modeling.",
        "The question we address in this paper is: given such limited information, how can we better understand and model Wikipedia vandalism?",
        "Our proposed approach establishes a novel classification framework, aiming at capturing vandalism through an emphasis on shallow syntactic and semantic modeling.",
        "In contrast to previous work, we recognize the significance of natural language modeling techniques for Wiki-pedia vandalism detection and utilize Web search results to construct our shallow syntactic and semantic models.",
        "We first construct a baseline model that captures task-specific clues and lexical features that have been used in earlier work (Potthast et al., 2008; Smets et al., 2008) augmenting these with shallow syntactic and semantic features.",
        "Our main contributions are:",
        "• Improvement over previous modeling methods with three novel lexical features",
        "• Using Web search results as training data for syntactic and semantic modeling",

        "The reported average precision is 0.75 and average recall is 0.73.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, Potthast et al., (2008) report the best result so far for Wikipedia vandalism detection.",
        "They craft a feature set that consists of interesting task-specific features.",
        "For example, they monitor the number of previously submitted edits from the same author or IP, which is a good feature to model author contribution.",
        "Their other contributions are the use of a logistic regression classifier, as well as the use of lexical features.",
        "They successfully demonstrate the use of lexical features like vulgarism frequency.",

        "In order to better understand the characteristics of vandalism cases in Wikipedia, we manually analyzed 201 vandalism edits in the training set of our preliminary corpus.",
        "In order to concentrate on textual vandalism detection, we did not take into account the cases where vandals hack the image, audio or other multimedia resources contained in the Wikipedia edit.",
        "We found three main types of vandalism, which are shown in Table 1 along with corresponding examples.",
        "These examples contain both the title of the edit and a snippet of the diff-ed content of vandalism, which is the textual difference between the old revision and the new revision, derived through the standard diff algorithm (Heckel, 1978).",
        "• Lexically ill-formed",
        "This is the most common type of vandalism in Wikipedia.",
        "Like other online vandalism acts, many vandalism cases in Wikipedia involve ill-intentioned or ill-formed words such as vulgarisms, invalid letter sequences, punctuation misuse and Web slang.",
        "An interesting observation is that vandals almost never add emoticons in Wikipedia.",
        "For the first example in",
        "Table 1, vulgarism and punctuation misuse are observed.",
        "• Syntactically ill-formed",
        "Most vandalism cases that are lexically ill-intentioned tend to be syntactically ill-formed as well.",
        "It is not easy to capture these cases by solely relying on lexical knowledge or rule-based dictionaries and it is also very expensive to update dictionaries and rules manually.",
        "Therefore, we think that is crucial to incorporate more syntactic cues in the feature set in order to improve performance.",
        "Moreover, there are also some cases where an edit could be lexically well-intentioned, yet syntactically ill-formed.",
        "The first example of syntactic ill-formed in Table 1 is of this kind.",
        "• Lexically and syntactically well formed, but semantically ill-intentioned",
        "This is the trickiest type of vandalism to identify.",
        "Vandals of this kind might have good knowledge of the rule-based vandalism detecting bots.",
        "Usually, this type of vandalism involves off-topic comments, inserted biased opinions, unconfirmed information and lobbying using very subjective comments.",
        "However, a common characteristic of all vandalism in this category is that it is free of both lexical and syntactic errors.",
        "Consider the first example of semantic vandalism in Table 1 with edit title \"Global Warming\": while the first sentence for that edit seems to be fairly normal (the author tries to claim another explanation of the global warming effect), the second sentence makes a sudden transition from the previous topic to mention a basketball star and makes a ridiculous conclusion in the last sentence.",
        "In this work, we realize the importance of incorporating NLP techniques to tackle all the above types of vandalism, and our focus is on the syntactically ill-formed and semantically ill-intentioned types that could not be detected by rule-based systems and straightforward lexical features.",

        "Moreover, in the Wikipedia vandalism detection task, since we do not have a sufficient amount of training data to model the topic of each edit, we propose the idea of using the Web as corpus by retrieving search engine results to learn our topic-specific n-tag syntax and syntactic n-gram semantic models.",
        "The difference between our syntactic and semantic modeling is that n-tag syntax models only model the order of sentence constituents, disregarding the corresponding words.",

        "As we see, for this test segment, it belongs to the vandalism class and has very different syntax from the n-tag model.",
        "Therefore, the normalized log likelihood outcome from the n-tag model is very low.",
        "In order to model semantics, we use an improved version of the n-gram language modeling method.",

        "In the example in Figure 2, the vandalism diff text will probably score low, because although it shares an overlap bigram \"and roll\" with the phrase \"rock and roll\" in training text, once we apply the shallow syntactic n-gram modeling method, the POS tag bigram \"and/CC roll/VB\" in diff'text will be distinguished from the \"and/CC roll/NN' or \"and/CC roll/NNP\" in the training data."

        "For the results of our system, LMT gives us a 0.89 F1 and LogitBoost (LB) gives a 0.95 F1.",
        "A significant F1 improvement of 15% was achieved in comparison to the previous study (Potthast et al., 2008).",
        "Another finding is that we find our shallow syntactic-semantic modeling method improves 2-4% over our task-specific and lexical features.",
        "In the second experiment, a notable difference from the preliminary evaluation is that we have an unbalanced data problem.",
        "So, we use random down-sampling method to resample the majority class into balanced classes in the training stage.",
        "Then, we also use the two classifiers with 10fold cross validation.",
        "The F1 result reported by our BoW + Naïve Bayes baseline is 0.68.",
        "Next, we test our task-specific and lexical features that specified in section 4.1 and 4.2.",
        "The best result is a F1 of 0.82, using logistic boosting.",
        "Finally, with our topic-specific shallow syntactic and semantic modeling features, we have a precision of 0.86, a recall of 0.85 and F1 of 0.85.",
        "Though we are surprised to see the overall F1 for the second experiment are not as high as the first one, we do see that the topic-specific shallow syntactic and semantic modeling methods play an important role in improving the result.",
        "Looking back at the related work we mentioned in section 2, though we use newer data sets, our overall results still seem to surpass major vandalism detection systems."
