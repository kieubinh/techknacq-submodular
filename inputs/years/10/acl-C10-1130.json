        "Answers have emerged as popular means of information exchange on the web.",
        "They not only connect a network of people to freely ask and answer questions, but also allow information seekers to search for relevant historical questions in the cQA archive (Agichtein et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Many research works have been proposed to find similar questions in cQA.",
        "The state-of-the-art retrieval models include the vector space model (Duan et al., 2008), language model (Duan et al., 2008; Jeon et al., 2005), Okapi model (Jeon et al., 2005), translation model (Jeon et al., 2005; Riezler et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008), and syntactic tree matching model(Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Although experimental studies in these works show that the proposed models are capable of improving question retrieval, they did not give clear explanation on which portion of the question that the user query is actually matched against.",
        "A question thread from cQA usually comprises several sub-questions conveying different information needs, and it is highly desirable to identify individual sub-questions and match each of them to the user query.",
        "Getting sub-questions clearly identified not only helps the retrieval system to match user query to the most desirable content but also improves the retrieval efficiency.",
        "However, the detection of sub-question is nontrivial.",
        "Question sentences in cQA are usually mixed with various description sentences, and they usually employ informal languages, where standard features such as question mark or utterance are likely to be absent.",
        "As such, simple heuristics using question mark or 5W1H words (who, what, where, why, how) may become inadequate.",
        "The demand of special techniques in detecting question sentences online arises due to three particular reasons.",
        "First, the question mark could be missing at the end of a question ,or might be used in cases other than questions such as \"Really bad toothache?\".",
        "Second, some questions such as \"I'd like to know the expense of removing wisdom teeth\" are expressed in a declarative form, which neither contains 5W1H words nor is neccessarily ended with \"?\".",
        "Third, some question-like sentences do not carry any actual information need, such as \"Please help me?\".",
        "Figure 1 illustrates an example of a question thread",

        "To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing question retrieval systems are equipped with a comprehensive question detector module to handle various question forms online, and limited effort has been devoted to this direction.",
        "In this paper, we extensively explore characteristics of questions in cQA, and propose a fully automated approach to detecting question sentences.",
        "In particular, we complement lexical patterns with syntactic patterns, and use them as features to train a classification model that is capable of handling informal online languages.",

        "As has been discussed, human generated content on the Web are usually not well formatted, and naive methods such as the use of question mark and 5W1H words are not adequate to correctly detect or capture all online questions.",
        "Methods based on hand-crafted rules also fail to cope with various question forms as randomly appeared on the Web.",
        "To overcome the shortcomings of these traditional methods, we propose to extract a set of salient patterns from online questions and use them as features to detect question sentences.",
        "In this study, we mainly focus on two kinds of patterns - sequential pattern at the lexical level and syntactic shallow pattern at the syntactic level.",
        "Sequential patterns have been well discussed in many literature, including the identification of comparative sentences (Jindal and Liu, 2006), the detection of erroneous sentences (Sun et al., 2007) and question sentences (Cong et al., 2008) etc.",
        "However, works on syntactic patterns have only been partially explored (Zaki and Ag-garwal, 2003; Sun et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Grounded on these previous works, we next explain our mining approach of the sequential and syntactic shallow patterns.",
        "Sequential Pattern is also referred to as Labeled Sequential Pattern (LSP) in the literature.",
        "It is in the form of S=C, where S is a sequence [ti,...,tn}, and C is the class label that the sequence S is classified to.",
        "In the problem of question detection, a sequence is defined to be a series of tokens from questions, and the class labels are {Q, NQ}, which stand for question and non-question respectively.",
        "The purpose of sequential pattern mining is to extract a set of frequent subsequence of words that are indicative of questions.",
        "For example, the word subsequence \"anyone know what ... to\" could be a good indication to characterize the question sentence \"anyone know what Ican do to make me less tired.\".",
        "Note that the mined sequential tokens need not to be contiguous as appeared in the original text.",
        "There is a handful of algorithms available for frequent subsequence extraction.",
        "Pei et al.",
        "(2001) observed that all occurrences of a frequent pattern can be classified into groups (approximated pattern) and proposed a Prefixspan algorithm.",
        "The Prefixspan algorithm quickly finds out all relative frequent subsequences by a pattern growth method, and determines the approximated patterns from those subsequences.",
        "We adopt this algorithm in our work due to its high reported efficiency.",
        "We impose the following additional constraints for better control over the significance of the mined patterns:",
        "1.",
        "Maximum Pattern Length: It limits the maximum number of tokens in a mined sequence.",
        "2.",
        "Maximum Token Distance: The two adjacent tokens tn and tn+\\ in the pattern need to be within a threshold window in the original text.",
        "3.",
        "Minimum Support: The minimum percentage of sentences in Q containing the pattern p.",
        "4.",
        "Minimum Confidence: The probability of a pattern p=Q being true in the whole database.",
        "To overcome the word sparseness problem, we generalize each sentence by applying the Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to all tokens except some indicative keywords such as 5W1H words, modal words, stopwords etc.",
        "For instance, the question sentence \"How can I quickly tell if my wisdom teeth are coming\" is converted to \"How can IRB VBP ifmyNNNNS VBP VBG\", on top of which the pattern mining is conducted.",
        "To further capture online language patterns, we mine a set of frequent tokens that are unique to cQA such as \"anyl\", \"im\" and \"whats\", and keep them from being generalized.",
        "The reason to hold back this set of tokens is twofold.",
        "First, conventional POS taggers are trained from standard English corpus, and they could mis-tag these non-standard words.",
        "Second, the special online tokens are analogue to standard stopwords, and having them properly excluded could help reflect the online users' textual questioning patterns.",
        "It is expected that the converted patterns preserve the most representative features of online questions.",
        "Each discovered pattern makes up a binary feature for the classification model that we will introduce in Section 3.",
        "The sequential patterns represent features at the lexical level, but we found that lexical patterns might not always be adequate to categorize questions.",
        "For example, the pattern {when, do} could presume the non-question \"Levator scapulae is used when you do the traps workout\" to be a question, whereas the question \"know someone with an eating disorder?\"",
        "could be overlooked due to the lack of indicative lexical patterns.",
        "These limitations, however, could be alleviated by syntactic features.",
        "The syntactic pattern (SBAR(WHADVP(WRB))(S(NP)(VP))) extracted",
        "Anyone try weight watchers?",
        "Someone need a diet motivator?",
        "from the former example has the order of NP and VP being switched, which could indicate the sentence to be a non-question, whereas the pattern (VP(VB)(NP(NP)(PP))) may be evidence that the latter example is indeed a question, because this pattern is commonly witnessed in the archived questions.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example that two questions bear very different wordings but share the same questioning pattern (S(NP(NN))(VP(VPB)(NP))) at the syntactic level.",
        "In view of the above, we argue that patterns at the syntactic level could complement lexical patterns in identifying question sentences.",
        "To our knowledge, the mining of salient patterns at the syntactic level was limited to a few tasks.",
        "Zaki and Aggarwal (2003) employed tree patterns to classify XML data, Sun et al.",
        "(2007) extracted all frequent sub-tree structures for erroneous sentences detection, and Wang et al.",
        "(2009) decomposed the parsing tree into fragments and used them to match similar questions.",
        "Our work differs from these previous works in that: (1) we also utilize syntactic patterns for the question detection; and (2) we do not blindly extract all possible sub-tree structures, but focus only on certain portions of the parsing tree for better pattern representation and extraction efficiency.",
        "Given a syntactic tree T, we define syntactic pattern as a part of substructures of T such that the production rule for each non-leaf node in the patterns is intact.",
        "For example, the pattern (S(NP(NN))(VP(VPB)(NP))) in Figure 2 is considered to be a valid syntactic pattern, whereas (S(NP(NN))(VP(VPB))) is not, since the production rule VP^VPB NP is not strictly complied.",
        "We take the following measures to mine salient syntactic patterns: First, we limit the depth of each syntactic pattern to be within a certain range.",
        "Q: How can I quickly tell if my wisdom teeth are coming?",
        "[WRB[ pä^rN^\"fVp i PRP H~vBt|sBar1 fsl [nPu^pI",
        "It is believed that the syntax structure will become too specific if it is extended to a deeper level or too general if the depth is too shallow, neither of which produces good representative patterns.",
        "We therefore set the depth D of each syntactic pattern to be within a reasonable range (2<D<4).",
        "Second, we prune away all leaf nodes as well as the production rules at the POS tag level.",
        "We believe that nodes at the bottom levels do not carry much useful structural information favored by question detector.",
        "For example, the simple grammar rule NP^DTNN does not give any insight to useful question structures.",
        "Third, we relax the definition of syntactic pattern by allowing the removal of some nodes denoting modifiers, preposition phrases, conjunctions etc.",
        "The reason is that these nodes are not essential in representing the syntactic patterns and are better excluded for generalization purpose.",
        "Figure 3 gives an illustration of the process for pattern extraction and generalization.",
        "In this example, several syntactic patterns are generated from the question sentence \"How can I quickly tell ifmy wisdom teeth are coming?",
        "\", and the tree patterns (a) and (b) are generalized into (a') and (b'), in which the redundant branch (ADVP(RB)) that represents the adverb \"quickly\" is detached.",
        "Contents on the Web are prone to noise, and most off-the-shelf parsers are not well-trained to parse online questions.",
        "For example, the parsing tree of the question \"whats the matter with it?\"",
        "will be very different from that of the question \"what is the matter with it?\".",
        "It would certainly be nice to know that \"whats\" is a widely used short form of the phrase \"what is\" on the Web, but we are lack of this kind of thesaurus.",
        "Nevertheless, we argue that the parsing errors would not hurt the question detector performance much as long as the mining database is large enough.",
        "The reason is that if certain irregular forms frequently occur on the Web, there will be statistical evidences that the syntactic patterns derived from it, though not desired, will commonly occur as well.",
        "In other words, we take the wrong patterns and utilize them to detect questions in the irregular forms.",
        "Our approach differs from other systems in that we do not intentionally try to rectify the grammatical errors, but leave the errors as they are and use the statistical based approach to capture those informal patterns.",
        "The pattern extraction process is outlined in Algorithm 1.",
        "The overall mining strategy is analogous to the mining of sequential patterns, where support and confidence measures are taken into account to control the significance of the mined patterns.",
