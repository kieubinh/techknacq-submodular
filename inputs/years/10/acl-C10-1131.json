        "A range of Natural Language Processing tasks involve making judgments about the semantic relatedness of a pair of sentences, such as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) and answer selection for Question Answering (QA).",
        "A key challenge that these tasks face in common is the lack of explicit alignment annotation between a sentence pair.",
        "We capture the alignment by using a novel probabilistic model that models tree-edit operations on dependency parse trees.",
        "Unlike previous tree-edit models which require a separate alignment-finding phase and resort to ad-hoc distance metrics, our method treats alignments as structured latent variables, and offers a principled framework for incorporating complex linguistic features.",
        "We demonstrate the robustness of our model by conducting experiments for RTE and QA, and show that our model performs competitively on both tasks with the same set of general features."

        "Many complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications can be broken down to a subtask of evaluating the semantic relationship of pairs of sentences (e.g., in Question Answering, answer selection involve comparing each answer candidate against the question).",
        "This means that research aiming at analyzing pairs of semantically related natural language sentences is promising because of its reusability: it is not tied to a particular internal representation of meanings, but it nevertheless serves as a first step towards full meaning understanding, which is applicable to a number of applications.",
        "At the same time, this paradigm clearly defines the input and output space, facilitating system comparison and standard evaluation.",
        "Tasks of this paradigm have drawn much of the focus in recent NLP research, including Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), answer selection for Question Answering (QA), Paraphrase Identification (PI), Machine Translation Evaluation (MTE), and many more.",
        "In each of these tasks, inputs to the systems are pairs of sentences that may or may not convey the desired semantic property (e.g., in RTE, whether the hypothesis sentence can be entailed from the premise sentence; in QA, whether the answer candidate sentence correctly answers the question), and the output of the system is a binary classification decision (or a regression score,as in MTE).",
        "Earlier studies in these domains have concluded that simple word overlap measures (e.g., bag of words, n-grams) have a surprising degree of utility (Papineni et al., 2002; Jijkoun and de Ri-jke, 2005b), but are nevertheless not sufficient for these tasks (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005a).",
        "A common problem identified in these earlier systems is the lack of understanding of the semantic relation between words and phrases.",
        "Later systems that include more linguistic features extracted from resources such as WordNet have enjoyed more success (MacCartney et al., 2006).",
        "Studies have also shown that certain prominent syntactic features are often found beneficial (Snow et al., 2006).",
        "More recent studies gained further leverage from systematic exploration of the syntactic feature space through analysis of parse trees (Wang et al., 2007; Das and Smith, 2009).",
        "There are two key challenges imposed by these tasks.",
        "The first challenge has to do with the hidden alignment structures embedded in the sentence pairs.",
        "It is straightforward to see that in order to extract word-matching and/or syntax-matching features, inevitably one has to consider the alignment between words and/or syntactic parts.",
        "These alignments are not given as inputs, and it is a non-trivial task to decide what the correct alignment is.",
        "Alignment-based approach have been proven effective by many RTE, QA and MTE systems (Haghighi et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007;",
        "MacCartney et al., 2008; Das and Smith, 2009, inter alia).",
        "Although alignment is a commonly used approach, it is not the only one.",
        "Other studies have successfully applied theorem proving and logical induction techniques, translating both sentences to knowledge representations and then doing inference on these representations (Moldovan et al., 2003; Raina et al., 2005; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; MacCartney and Manning, 2007, inter alia).",
        "A second challenge arises when a system needs to combine various sources of evidence (i.e., surface text features, semantic features, and syntactic features) to make a global classification decision.",
        "Quite often these features are heavily overlapping and sometimes contradicting, and thus a robust learning scheme that knows when to activate what feature is desired.",
        "Traditional approaches employ a two-stage or multi-stage model where tasks are broken down into alignment finding, feature extraction, and feature learning subtasks (Haghighi et al., 2005; MacCartney et al., 2008).",
        "The alignment finding task is typically done by committing to a one best alignment, and subsequent features are extracted only according to this alignment.",
        "A large body of literature in joint learning has demonstrated that such an approach can suffer from cascaded errors at testing, and does not benefit from the potential for joint learning (Finkel et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we present a novel undirected graphical model to address these challenges.",
        "A promising approach to these challenges is modeling the alignment as an edit operation sequence over parse tree representation, an approach pioneered by (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Kouylekov and Magnini, 2006; Harmeling, 2007; Mehdad, 2009).",
        "We improve upon this earlier work by showing how alignment structures can be inherently learned as structured latent variables in our model.",
        "Tree edits are represented internally as state transitions in a Finite-State Machine (FSM), and our model is parameterized as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001), which allows us to incorporate a diverse set of arbitrarily overlapping features.",
        "In comparison to previous work that exploits various ad-hoc or heuristic ways of incorporating tree-edit operations, our model provides an elegant and much more principled way of describing tree-edit operations in a probabilistic setting."

        "Nodes that are inserted or deleted are aligned to null, and nodes that are substituted are aligned.",

        "For example, the following are all possible edit operations: delete a noun that is SUB of the root, delete a named-entity of type PERSON, substitute roots of the tree.",
        "In our experiments, we designed a set of 45 edit operations (12 delete, 12 insert and 21 substitute).",
        "More details of the edit operations are described in ยง4.",
        "Depending on the specific application domain, more sophisticated and verbose tree edit operations can be designed and easily incorporated into our model.",

        "Next, we design a Finite-State Machine (FSM) in which each edit operation is mapped to a unique state, and an edit sequence is mapped into a transition sequence among states (denoted as e.a = e1.a...em.d).",
        "In brief, an edit sequence is associated with a sequence of edit positions in the trees (e.p = e1.p...em.p), as well as a transition sequence among states (e.a = e1.a... em.a).",

        "We now arrive at a new FSM structure where upon arriving at the starting state, one makes a non-deterministic decision to enter either the positive set or the negative set and stay in that set until reaching the end of the edit sequence, since no transitions are allowed across the positive and negative set.",
        "Each edit operation sequence can now be associated with a sequence of positive states as well as a sequence of negative states.",
        "The intuitive idea is that during training, we want to maximize the weights of the positive examples in the positive state set and minimize their weights in the negative state set, and vice versa.",

        "The other extreme is to encode every zero-order feature as a separate edit operation.",

        "When encoding more information as edit operations (and thus more states in FSM), first-order features become much more expressive; whereas when encoding more information as features, computation becomes cheaper as the number of possible state transition sequences is reduced.",

        "It works across different problem domains with minimal domain knowledge and feature engineering, whereas previous methods are only engineered for a particular task and are hard to generalize to new problems.",
        "While the current Tree-edit CRF model can model a large set of linguistic phenomenon and tree-transformations, it has some clear limitations.",
        "One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of support for modeling phrasal re-ordering, which is a very common and important linguistic phenomena.",
        "It is not straightforward to implement reordering in the current model because it breaks the word-order constraint which admits tractable forward-backward style dynamic programming.",
