        "This suggests that the combined heuristics do have strong capability of distinguishing nocuous from innocuous ambiguity at the weakest region of the baseline models.",
        "Figure 4 also shows that, the CM-1 model benefitted from the extended heuristics and the LogitBoost algorithm with an increased accuracy of around 5.54% on average compared with CM-2.",
        "This suggests that local context information and semantic relationships between coordinating conjuncts provide useful clues for the identification of nocuous ambiguity.",
        "Furthermore, the LogitBoost algorithm is more suitable for dealing with a numeric-attribute feature vector than the previous Logistic Regression algorithm.",
        "We report on two implementations: one with weak thresholds (AM-1) and one without (AM-2).",
        "We compare both approaches using the baselines, BL-1 and BL-2 (in Figure 5).",
        "It shows that AM-1 and AM-2 achieve consistent improvements on baseline accuracy at high thresholds (t>0.75).",
        "Here also, the improvement maximises around the 83% threshold point where the two baselines intersect.",
        "However, the ML-based models perform worse than BL-1 at the lower thresholds (0.5<t<0.7).",
        "One possible explanation is that, at low thresholds, performance is affected by lack of data for training of the Q class label, an important indicator for nocuous ambiguity (see Table 5).",
        "This is also consistent with the ML models performing well at higher thresholds, when enough nocuous instances are available for training.",

        "Although both models perform much better than the baselines on precision (more experimental results are reported in Yang et al.",
        "(2010b)), the actual precisions for both models are relatively low, ranging from 0.3 ~ 0.6 at different thresholds.",
        "When the AM-1 model attempts to discover more nocuous instances using weak thresholds, it also introduces more false positives (innocuous instances incorrectly classed as nocuous).",
        "The side-effect of introducing false positives for AM-1 is to lower accuracy.",
        "However, the AM-1 model outperforms both AM-2 and BL-2 models on F-measure (Figure 6), with an average increase of 5.2 and 3.4 percentage points respectively.",
        "This reveals that relaxing sensitivity to the ambiguity threshold helps catch more instances of nocuous anaphora ambiguity.",

        "We presented judges with sentences containing ambiguities without any surrounding context, even though contextual information (e.g., discourse focus) clearly contributes to interpretation.",

        "Judgements are sensitive to the backgrounds of the participants, and the extent to which stakeholder groups share such a background.",

        "Different interpretations may be compatible, and so not necessarily contribute to misunderstanding.",
        "Finally, we used different machine learning algorithms to tackle different types of ambiguity instances: LogitBoost for coordination ambiguity and Naive Bayes for anaphora ambiguity.",
        "The main reason is that coordination heuristics returned numeric values, whereas the anaphora heuristics were Boolean.",
        "Our method assumes tailoring of the ML algorithm to the choice of heuristic.",
        "These limitations indicate that the methodology has a high degree of flexibility, but also that it has several interdependent components and background assumptions that have to be managed if an application is to be developed."

        "These last two approaches rely on probability analysis of language usage, and not directly on human perception, which we believe to be the key to evaluating ambiguity.",

        "We have presented a general methodology for automatically identifying nocuous ambiguity (i.e. cases of ambiguity where there is a risk that people will hold different interpretations) relative to some tolerance level set for such a risk.",
        "The methodology has been implemented in a ML based architecture, which combines a number of heuristics each highlighting factors which may affect how humans interpret ambiguous constructs.",
        "We have validated the methodology by identifying instances of nocuous ambiguity in coordination and anaphoric constructs.",
        "Human judgments were collected in a dataset used for training the ML algorithm and evaluation.",
        "Results are encouraging, showing an improvement of approximately 21% on accuracy for coordination ambiguity and about 3.4% on F-measure for anaphora ambiguity compared with naive baselines at different ambiguity threshold levels.",
        "We showed, by comparison with results reported in",
        "Willis et al. (2008) that the methodology can be fine tuned, and extended to other ambiguity types, by including different heuristics.",
        "Our method can highlight the risk of different interpretations arising: this is not a task a single human could perform, as readers typically have access only to their own interpretation and are not routinely aware that others hold a different one.",
        "Nonetheless, our approach has limitations, particularly around data collection, and for anaphora ambiguity at low thresholds.",
        "We envisage further work on the implementation of ambiguity tolerance thresholds",
        "Several interesting issues remain to be investigated to improve our system's performance and validate its use in practice.",
        "We need to explore how to include different and complex ambiguity types (e.g., PP attachment and quantifier scoping), and investigate whether these are equally amenable to a heuristics based approach.",
