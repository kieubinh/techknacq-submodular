Pollard and Sag (1994)).",

        "Line SS represents the threshold of statistical significance; the value below which the detected difference between the E and NE sets becomes statistically significant.",
        "Experimental results show some interesting facts: While BAM for a > 0 perform better than EAM computed with k = 1 in the NN set, they do not perform better in the VN set.",
        "EAM with k = 1 has 1 degree of freedom corresponding to 1 parameter, the same as BAM.",
        "The parameter of EAM is tuned on the training set, in contrast to a, the parameter of BAM.",
        "Increasing the number of considered dimensions, k of EAM, estimated models outperform BAM for all values of parameter a.",
        "Moreover, EAM detect a statistically significant difference between the E and the NE sets for k > 10 and k = 20 for the NN set and the VN set set, respectively.",
        "Simple parametrisation of a BAM does not outperform the proposed estimated additive model."
