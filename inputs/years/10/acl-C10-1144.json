        "Deep syntactic analysis by lexicalized grammar parsing, which provides linguistic-rich information for many NLP tasks, has recently received more and more attention from the NLP community.",
        "To use a deep parser in real large-scale applications, speed is an important issue to take into consideration.",
        "Supertagging is one of the speedup technique widely used for lexicalized grammar parsing.",
        "A supertagger is used to limit the number of plausible lexical entries fed to the parser, this can greatly reduce the search space for the parser.",
        "Supertagging was first proposed for Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), and then successfully applied to Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Clark, 2002) and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Ninomiya et al., 2006).",
        "In addition, supertags can also be used for other NLP tasks besides parsing, such as semantic role labeling (Chen and Rambow, 2003) and machine translation (Birch et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2007) to utilize syntactic information in the supertags.",
        "In lexicalized grammar parsing, supertagging is usually treated as a sequence labeling task independently trained from the parser.",
        "Previous research (Clark, 2002) showed that even a point-wise classifier not considering context edge features is effective when used as a supertagger.",
        "To make up for the insufficient accuracy as a singletagger, more than one supertag prediction is reserved and the parser takes the burden of resolving the rest of the supertag ambiguities.",
        "A non-trivial problem raised by the separate training of the supertagger is that the prediction score provided by the supertagger might not be suitable for direct use in the parsing process, since a separately trained supertagger that does not take into account grammar constraints has a training objective which is inconsistent with the parser.",
        "Although the scores provided by the supertagger can be ignored (e.g., in some CCG parsers), this may also discard some useful information for effective beam search and accurate disambiguation.",
        "Based on this observation, we assume that considering global grammar constraints during the supertagger training process would make the supertagger and the parser more tightly integrated.",
        "In this paper, we propose an on-line forest-guided training method for a supertagger to make the training objective of a supertagger more closely related to the parsing task.",
        "We implemented this method on a large-scale HPSG grammar.",
        "We used a CFG grammar to approximate the original HPSG grammar in the supertagging stage and applied best-first search to select grammar-satisfying supertag sequences for the parameter updating.",
        "The experiments showed that the HPSG parser is improved by considering structure constraints in the supertagging training process.",
        "For the standard test set (Penn Treebank Section 23), we accomplished an absolute 0.68% improvement from baseline in F-score for predicate-argument relation recognition and got a competitive result of 89.31% with a faster parsing speed, compared to a state-of-the-art HPSG parser.",

        "HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) is a lexicalist grammar framework.",
        "In HPSG, a large number of lexical entries are used to express word-specific characteristics, while only a small number of rule schemata are used to describe general construction rules.",
        "Typed feature structures named \"signs\" are used to represent both lexical entries and phrasal constituents.",
        "A classic efficient statistical HPSG parsing process is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "Given a word and part-of-speech sequence (w,p) as input, the first step (called \"supertagging\") in HPSG parsing is to assign possible lexical entries.",
        "In practice, for each word, more than one supertag is reserved for the parser.",
        "Then, the parser searches the given lexical entry space to construct a HPSG tree using the rule schemata to combine possible signs.",
        "Constituent-based methods and transition-based methods can be used for tree structure disambiguation.",
        "This parsing framework using supertagging is also used in other lexical-ized grammars, such as LTAG and CCG.",
        "Like other lexicalized grammar, the lexical entries defined in HPSG are referred to as \"supertags\".",
        "For example, the word \"like\" is assigned a lexical entry for transitive verbs in non-3rd person present form, which indicates that the head syntactic category of \"like\" is verb and it has an NP subject and an NP complement.",
        "With such fine-grained grammatical type distinctions, the number of supertags is very large.",
        "Compared to the 45 part-of-speech (POS) tags defined in the PennTreebank, the HPSG grammar we used contains 2,308 supertags.",
        "The large number and the complexity of the supertags makes supertagging harder than the POS tagging task.",
        "Supertagging can be formulated as a sequence labeling task.",
        "Here, we follow the definition of Collins' perceptron (Collins, 2002).",
        "The training objective of supertagging is to learn the mapping from a POS-tagged word sentence w = (wi/pi,wn/pn) to a sequence of supertags s = (si,...,sn).",
        "We use function GEN(w) to indicate all candidates of supertag sequences given input w. Feature function $ maps a sample (w, s) to a point in the feature space B.",
        "6 is the vector of feature weights.",
        "Given an input w, the most plausible supertag sequence is found by the prediction function defined as follows:",
        "seGEN(w)",
        "CFG-filtering (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) is a technique to find a superset of (packed) HPSG parse trees that satisfy the constraints in a grammar.",
        "A CFG that approximates the original HPSG grammar is used for efficiently finding such trees without doing full-fledged HPSG parsing that is computationally demanding because the schema application involves unification operations among large feature structures (signs).",
        "The number of possible signs is infinite in general and hence some features (e.g., the number agreement feature) are ignored in the approximating CFG so that the set of possible signs can be approximated by a finite set of non-terminal symbols in the CFG.",
        "By this construction, some illegal trees may be included in the set of trees licensed by the approximating CFG, but none of the well-formed trees (i.e., those satisfying all constraints in the grammar) are excluded by the approximation.",

        "In lexicalized grammar parsing, a parser aims to find the most plausible syntactic structure for a given sentence based on the supertagging results.",
        "One efficient parsing approach is to use prediction scores provided by the supertagger.",
        "Usually, the supertagger is trained separately from the structure disambiguation in a later stage.",
        "This pipeline parsing strategy poses a potential problem in that the training objective of a supertagger can deviate from the final parser, if the global grammar constraints are not considered.",
        "For example, the supertag predictions for some words can contribute to high supertagging accuracy, but cause the parser to fail.",

        "with largest sequence score 6: if( No Si satisfied grammar constraints) Return: 6sum/NT parser more tightly related, which will contribute towards the performance of the parser.",
        "Based on the motivation above, we propose a forest-guided supertagger training method to make the supertagger more tightly integrated with the parser.",
        "This method is based on the averaged perceptron training algorithm.",
        "The training process is given in Algorithm 1.",
        "The most important difference of the proposed algorithm compared to the traditional supertagger training method is that the current best-scored supertag sequence is searched only within the space of the supertag sequences that are allowed by the grammar.",
        "As for whether the grammar constraints are satisfied, we judge it by whether a possible syntactic tree can be constructed using the given supertag sequence.",
        "We do not require the constructed syntactic tree to be identical to the gold tree in the corpus.",
        "For this reason we call it \"forest-guided\".",
        "In the forest-guided training of the supertagger, an approximating CFG is used to filter out the supertag sequences from which no well-formed tree can be built.",
        "It is implemented as a best-irst CFG parser wherein the score of a constituent is the score of the supertag (sub-)sequence on the fringe of the constituent, which is calculated using the current value of the parameters.",
        "Note that the best-irst parser can ind the best-scored supertag sequence very eficiently given proper scoring for the candidate supertag set for each token; this is actually the case in the course of training except for the initial phase of the training, wherein the parameter values are not well-tuned.",
        "The efficiency is due to the sparseness of the approximating CFG (i.e., the production rule set includes only a tiny fraction of the possible parent-children combinations of symbols) and highest-scored supertags often have a well-formed tree on top of them.",
        "As is clear from the above description, the use of CFG-ilter in the forest-guided training of the supertagger is not essential but is only a subsidiary technique to make the training faster.",
        "The improvement by the forest-guided training should however depend on whether the CFG approximation is reasonably tight or not.",
        "Actually, we managed to obtain a manageable size out of a CFG grammar, which includes 80 thousand nonterminal symbols and 10 million rules, by eliminating only a small number of features (semantics, case and number agreement, and ine distinctions in nouns, adjectives and complementizers).",
        "We thus believe that the approximation is fairly tight.",
        "This training algorithm can also be explained in a search-based learning framework (Hal Daumé III and Daniel Marcu, 2005).",
        "In this framework, the objective of learning is to optimize the 6 for the enqueue function to make the good hypotheses rank high in the search queue.",
        "The rank score r consists of two components: path score g and heuristic score h. In the forest-guided training method, r can be rewritten as follows:",
        "The heuristic part h checks whether the supertag candidate sequence satisies the grammar constraints: if no CFG tree can be constructed, -oo penalty is imposed to the candidate sequence in the forest-guided training method."

        "In this paper, based on the observation that supertaggers are commonly trained separately from lexicalized parsers without global grammar constraints, we proposed a forest-guided supertagger training method to integrate supertagging more tightly with deep parsing.",
        "We applied this method to HPSG parsing and made further significant improvement for both supertagging (0.28%) and the HPSG parsing (0.68%) compared to the baseline.",
        "The improved parser also achieved a competitive result (89.31%) with a faster parsing speed, compared to a state-of-the-art HPSG parser.",
        "For future work, we will try to weight the forest trees for the supertagger training and extend this method to other lexicalized grammars, such as LTAG and CCG."
