        "The named entity (NE) ambiguation has raised serious problems in many areas, including web people search, knowledge base population (KBP), and information extraction, because an entity (such as Abbott Laboratories, a diversified pharmaceuticals health care company) can be referred to by multiple mentions (e.g. \"ABT\" and \"Abbott\"), and a mention (e.g. \"Abbott\") can be shared by different entities (e.g. Abbott Texas: a city in United States; Bud Abbott, an American actor; and Abbott Laboratories, a diversified pharmaceutical health care company).",
        "Both Web People Search (WePS) task (Artiles et al.",
        "2007) and Global Entity Detection & Recognition task (GEDR) in Automatic Content Extraction 2008 (ACE08) disambiguate entity mentions by clustering documents with these mentions.",
        "Each cluster then represents a unique entity.",
        "Recently entity linking has been proposed in this field.",
        "However, it is quite different from the previous tasks.",
        "Given a knowledge base, a document collection, entity linking task as defined by KBP-09(McNamee and Dang, 2009) is to determine for each name string and the document it appears, which knowledge base entity is being referred to, or if the entity is a new entity which is not present in the reference KB.",
        "Compared with GEDR and WePS, entity linking has a given entity list (i.e. the reference KB) to which we disambiguate the entity mentions.",
        "Moreover, in document collection, there are new entities which are not present in KB and can be used for further population.",
        "In fact, new entities with or without the names in KB cover more than half of testing instances.",
        "Entity linking has been explored by several researchers.",
        "Without any training data available, most of the previous work ranks the similarity between ambiguous mention and candidate entities through Vector Space Model (VSM).",
        "Since they always choose the entity with the highest rank as the answer, the ranking approaches hardly detect a situation where there may be a new entity that is not present in KB.",
        "It is also difficult to combine bag of words (BOW) with other features.",
        "For example, to capture the \"category\" information, the method of Cucerzan (2007) involves a complicated optimization issue and the approach has to be simplified for feasible computation, which compromises the accuracy.",
        "Besides unsupervised methods, some supervised approaches (Agirre et al.",
        "2009, Li et al.",
        "2009 and McNamee et al.",
        "2009) also have been proposed recently for entity linking.",

        "We also leverage on the Wikipedia documents to provide additional information which is not available in our generated corpus through a domain adaption approach which provides further performance improvements.",

        "In this section we describe our two-stage approach for entity linking: name variation and entity disambiguation.",
        "The first stage finds variations for every entity in the KB and generates an entity candidate set for a given query.",
        "The second stage is entity disambiguation, which links an entity mention with the real world entity it refers to.",
        "The aim for Name Variation is to build a Knowledge Repository of entities that contains vast amount of world knowledge of entities like name variations, acronyms, confusable names, spelling variations, nick names etc.",
        "We use Wikipedia to build our knowledge repository since Wikipedia is the largest encyclopedia in the world and surpasses other knowledge bases in its coverage of concepts and up-to-date content.",
        "We obtain useful information from Wikipedia by the tool named Java Wikipedia Library (Zesch et al.",
        "2008), which allows to access all information contained in Wikipedia.",
        "Cucerzan (2007) extracts the name variations of an entity by leveraging four knowledge sources in Wikipedia: \"entity pages\", \"disambiguation pages\" \"redirect pages\" and \"anchor text\".",
        "Entity page in Wikipedia is uniquely identified by its title - a sequence of words, with the first word always capitalized.",
        "The title of Entity Page represents an unambiguous name variation for the entity.",
        "A redirect page in Wikipedia is an aid to navigation.",
        "When a page in Wikipedia is redirected, it means that those set of pages are referring to the same entity.",
        "They often indicate synonym terms, but also can be abbreviations, more scientific or more common terms, frequent misspellings or alternative spellings etc.",
        "Disambiguation pages are created only for ambiguous mentions which denote two or more entities in Wikipedia, typically followed by the word \"disambiguation\" and containing a list of references to pages for entities that share the same name.",
        "This is more useful in extracting the abbreviations of entities, other possible names for an entity etc.",
        "Besides, both outlinks and inlinks in Wi-kipedia are associated with anchor texts that represent name variations for the entities.",
        "Using these four sources above, we extracted name variations for every entity in KB to form the Knowledge Repository as Cucerzan's (2007) method.",
        "For example, the variation set for entity E0272065 in KB is {Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Nutrition, Abbott ...}.",
        "Finally, we can generate the entity candidate set for a given query using the Knowledge Repository.",
        "For example, for the query containing \"Abbott\", the entity candidate set retrieved is {E0272065, E0064214 ...}.",
        "From our observation, for some queries the retrieved candidate set is empty.",
        "If the entity for the query is a new entity, not present in KB, empty candidate set is correct.",
        "Otherwise, we fail to identify the mention in the query as a variation, commonly because the mention is a misspelling or infrequently used name.",
        "So we propose to use two more sources \"Did You Mean\" and \"Wikipedia Search Engine\" when Cucerzan (2007) algorithm returns empty candidate set.",
        "Our experiment results show that both proposed knowledge sources are effective for entity linking.",
        "This contributes to a performance improvement on the final entity linking accuracy.",

        "In this Section, we will describe the method for automatic data creation, domain adaptation from Wikipedia data, and our supervised learning approach as well.",
        "The basic idea is to take a document with an unambiguous reference to an entity E1 and replacing it with a phrase which may refer to E1, E2 or others.",
        "Observation: Some full names for the entities in the world are unambiguous.",
        "This phenomenon also appears in the given document collection of entity linking.",
        "The mention \"Abbott Laboratories\" appearing at multiple locations in the document collection refers to the same entity \"a pharmaceuticals health care company\" in KB.",

        "Let us take Abbott Laboratories-{ E0272065} in the Knowledge Repository as an example.",
        "We first use an index and search tool to find the documents with unambiguous mentions.",

        "The chosen text indexing and searching tool is the well-known Apache Lucene information retrieval open-source library.",

        "Person, Organization and Geo-Political Entity) exactly matches with the type of entity in KB.",
        "In this example, after Named Entity Recognition, \"Abbott Laboratories\" in document LDC2009T13 is tagged as an Organization which is consistent with the entity type of E0272065 in KB.",
        "We link the \"Abbott Laboratories\" occurring in LDC2009T13 with entity E0272065.",

        "\"Abbott\" is ambiguous, because it is referring not only to E0272065, but also to E0064214 in Knowledge Repository.",

        "However, those instances exist in the current document collection.",
        "We do not retrieve them since there is no unambiguous mention for E0064214 in the document collection.",

        "Articles in Wikipedia often contain mentions of entities that already have a corresponding article, and at least the first occurrence of the mentions of an entity in a Wikipedia article must be linked to its corresponding Wiki-pedia article, if such an article exists.",

        "Next, we will describe how to incorporate Wikipedia data.",
        "Incorporating Wikipedia Data.",
        "The document collection for entity linking is commonly from other domains, but not Wikipedia.",
        "To benefit from Wikipedia data, we introduce a domain adaption approach (DaumÃ© III, 2007) which is suitable for this work since we have enough \"target\" domain data.",
        "The approach is to augment the feature vectors of the instances.",
        "Denote by X the input space, and by Y the output space, in this case, X is the space of the real vectors (p(x) for the instances in data set and Y= {+1,-1} is the label.",

        "The augmented input space will be defined by X =R3F.",

        "When they are from different domains, we get: K{x, x') =<",
        "This is an intuitively pleasing result.",
        "Loosely speaking, this means that data points from our created data set have twice as much influence as Wikipedia points when making predictions about test data from document collection.",
        "To disambiguate a mention in document collection, the ranking method is to rank the entities in candidate set based on the similarity score.",
        "In our work, we transform the ranking problem into a classification problem: deciding whether a mention refers to an entity on an SVM classifier.",
        "If there are 2 or more than 2 candidate entities that are assigned positive label by the binary classifier, we will use the baseline system (explained in Section 4.2) to rank the candidates and the entity with the highest rank will be chosen.",
        "In the learning framework, the training or testing instance is formed by (query, entity) pair.",
