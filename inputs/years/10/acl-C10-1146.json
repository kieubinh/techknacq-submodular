        "Our previous work showed (Fung et al., 2008) that rhetorical structures are embedded in this type of speech and that exploring this structure helps improve summarization quality.",
        "We further demonstrate that speakers do not follow the strict order of bullet points in the presentation slides, and that a reordering of these points occurs.",
        "We therefore propose a method of parsing presentation transcriptions into a rhetorical syntax tree and then reorder the leaf nodes to transform the speech transcriptions into an extractive summary, akin to a process of presentation slide generation.",
        "Chunking, parsing, and reordering are carried out by 28-class Hidden Markov Support Vector Machine(HMSVM) classifier trained from reference presentations and presentation slides.",
        "Using ROUGE-L F-measure we showed that our rhetorical syntax-driven model gives a 35.8% relative improvement over a binary summarizer with no rhetorical information, a 14.3% improvement over Rhetorical State Hidden Markov Model(RSHMM) (Fung et al., 2008), and a 4.3% improvement over our proposed model with no reordering."

        "In this paper, we propose to improve extractive summarization of presentation speech using parsing and reordering of the salient points in the speech.",
        "Presentation speech includes classroom lectures, conference talks, business seminars, as well as political debates and parliamentary speech where the speaker gives a presentation according to some prepared slides containing bullet points.",
        "Some of the speech are transcribed into text, others might even be accompanied by short abstracts.",
        "Nevertheless, for learning and collaboration purposes, transcribed text is too long to read whereas short abstracts do not contain enough information (Teufel and Moens, 2002).",
        "Especially, in our conference presentation corpus, on average only about 40% bullet points of each transcription appears in the corresponding conference paper abstract.",
        "The accompanying presentation slides, on the other hand, are much better in summarizing the gists.",
        "In recent years, more research has been conducted on exploring the hierarchical structure for better summarization performance (Fung et al., 2003; Murray et al., 2006; Sauper and Regina, 2009; Tatar et al., 2008).",
        "Unlike text documents, the structure of a spoken document is not immediately apparent in terms of its layout.",
        "However, researchers have shown that structural characteristics of a speech are clearly rendered by not just its linguistic features but also its acoustic features (Fung et al., 2008; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Nakatani et al., 1995).",
        "The hierarchical layout structure of Power Point slides enhances the understanding by the audience.",
        "In fact, they even provide a kind of extractive summarization that is superior in terms of informativeness than short abstracts.",
        "Unfortunately, presentation slides are not always made available to the audience or for the archive.",
        "In some cases, presentation slides consist of mostly figures and graphs, even videos, but without sufficient text bullet points to summarize the content.",
        "Meanwhile, there are significant amounts of presentation speech online (e.g. political speech, lectures and seminars) that can be rendered more useful if we can summarize them in a format similar to presentation slides.",
        "Following previous research showing that modeling hierarchical structure indeed helps improve summarization performance, we are interested in going a step further in proposing a rhetorical syntax driven summarization model.",
        "Presentation speech is transcribed automatically by an ASR system, then \"parsed\" into a rhetorical syntax tree.",
        "The leaf nodes of the tree, representing actual utterances with rhetorical unit labels, are then \"reordered\" and organized into a target summary.",
        "In this paper, we also propose using a HMSVM (Al-tun et al., 2003) for the parser and the summarizer.",
        "HMSVM has the advantage of considering the interdependence between neighboring sentences.",
        "Reordering rules are automatically learned and candidate sequences generated, before they are scored by the inal summarizer.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our motivation, and the rhetorical structure characteristics in lecture speech.",
        "Section 3 details how to parse rhetorical structure of the lecture speech.",
        "Section 4 describes the reordering process.",
        "Section 5 then describes how to produce extractive summaries.",
        "We then describe the corpus, how to create reference summaries, the acoustic/prosodic, linguistic and discourse characteristics of lecture speech, baselines, and our in-house automatic speech recognition system are presented in Section 6.",
        "Section 7 presents the experiment results.",
        "Section 8 describes related work.",
        "We then conclude at the end of this paper."

        "Although the overall performance on ASR transcriptions is worse than that of manual transcriptions, the performance is also satisfying.",
        "Furthermore, we also ind that using only acoustic features our model obtains satisfying result, 0.65 of ROUGE-L F-measure, on 6-fold cross validation experiment."

        "In this paper, we have shown a rhetorical syntax-driven summarization method for presentation speech.",
        "In view of the fact that rhetorical structure in speech is inherently hierarchical, our method chunks, parses, and reorders the presentation utterance sentences before selecting some of them as summary sentences.",

        "It gives a 4.3% relative improvement over the same model without reordering.",
        "For future work, we are interested in investigating how to apply our rhetorical syntax-driven method to other genres of speech, such as meetings and parliamentary speech."
