        "Successful coreference resolution benefits many natural language processing tasks.",
        "In the literature, most prior work on coreference resolution recasts the problem as a two-class classification problem.",
        "Machine learning-based classifiers are applied to determine whether a candidate anaphor and a potential antecedent are coreferential (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b).",
        "A large body of prior research on corefer-ence resolution follows the same process: during training, they apply standard supervised machine learning algorithms to minimize the number of misclassified training instances; during testing, they maximize either the local or the global probability of the coreferential relation assignments according to the specific chosen resolution method.",
        "However, minimizing the number of misclassified training instances during training does not guarantee maximizing the F-measure of the chosen evaluation metric for coreference resolution.",
        "First of all, coreference is a rare relation.",
        "There are far fewer positive training instances than negative ones.",
        "Simply minimizing the number ofmis-classified training instances is suboptimal and favors negative training instances.",
        "Secondly, evaluation metrics for coreference resolution are based on global assignments.",
        "Not all errors have the same impact on the metric score.",
        "Furthermore, the extracted training instances are not equally easy to be classified.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach comprising the use of instance weighting and beam search to address the above issues.",
        "Our proposed maximum metric score training (MMST) approach performs maximization of the chosen evaluation metric score on the training corpus during training.",
        "It iteratively assigns higher weights to the hard-to-classify training instances.",
        "The output of training is a standard classifier.",
        "Hence, during testing, MMST is faster than approaches which optimize the assignment of coreferential relations during testing.",
        "Experimental results show that MMST achieves significant improvements over the baselines.",
        "Unlike most of the previous work, we report improved results over the state-of-the-art on all five standard benchmark corpora (two MUC corpora and three ACE corpora), with both the link-based MUC metric and the mention-based B-CUBED metric.",

        "(2001) proposed a training and testing framework for coreference resolution.",
        "During training, a positive training instance is formed by a pair of markables, i.e., the anaphor (a noun phrase) and its closest antecedent (another noun phrase).",
        "Each markable (noun phrase) between the two, together with the anaphor, form a negative training instance.",
        "A classifier is trained on all training instances, using a standard supervised learning algorithm.",
        "During testing, all preceding markables of a candidate anaphor are considered as potential antecedents, and are tested in a back-to-front manner.",
        "The process stops if either an antecedent is found or the beginning of the text is reached.",
        "This framework has been widely used in the community of coreference resolution.",
        "Recent work boosted the performance of coref-erence resolution by exploiting fine-tuned feature sets under the above framework, or adopting alternative resolution methods during testing (Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Yang et al., 2003; Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Versley et al., 2008).",
        "Ng (2005) proposed a ranking model to maximize F-measure during testing.",
        "In the approach, n different coreference outputs for each test text are generated, by varying four components in a coref-erence resolution system, i.e., the learning algorithm, the instance creation method, the feature set, and the clustering algorithm.",
        "An SVM-based ranker then picks the output that is likely to have the highest F-measure.",
        "However, this approach is time-consuming during testing, as F-measure maximization is performed during testing.",
        "This limits its usage on a very large corpus.",
        "In the community of machine learning, researchers have proposed approaches for learning a model to optimize a chosen evaluation metric other than classification accuracy on all training instances.",
        "Joachims (2005) suggested the use of support vector machines to optimize nonlinear evaluation metrics.",
        "However, the approach does not differentiate between the errors in the same category in the contingency table.",
        "Furthermore, it does not take into account inter-instance relation (e.g., transitivity), which the evaluation metric for coreference resolution cares about.",
        "Daumé III (2006) proposed a structured learning framework for coreference resolution to approximately optimize the ACE metric.",
        "Our proposed approach differs in two aspects.",
        "First, we directly optimize the evaluation metric itself, and not by approximation.",
        "Second, unlike the incremental local loss in Daumé III (2006), we evaluate the metric score globally.",
        "In contrast to Ng (2005), Ng and Cardie (2002a) proposed a rule-induction system with rule pruning.",
        "However, their approach is specific to rule induction, and is not applicable to other supervised learning classifiers.",
        "Ng (2004) varied different components of coreference resolution, choosing the combination of components that results in a classifier with the highest F-measure on a held-out development set during training.",
        "In contrast, our proposed approach employs instance weighting and beam search to maximize the F-measure of the evaluation metric during training.",
        "Our approach is general and applicable to any supervised learning classifiers.",
        "Recently, Wick and McCallum (2009) proposed a partition-wise model for coreference resolution to maximize a chosen evaluation metric using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970).",
        "However, they found that training on classification accuracy, in most cases, outperformed training on the corefer-ence evaluation metrics.",
        "Furthermore, similar to Ng (2005), their approach requires the generation of multiple coreference assignments during testing.",
        "Vemulapalli et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a document-level boosting technique for coreference resolution by re-weighting the documents that have the lowest F-measures.",
        "By combining multiple classifiers generated in multiple iterations, they achieved a CEAF score slightly better than the baseline.",
        "Different from them, our approach works at the instance level, and we output a single classifier."
