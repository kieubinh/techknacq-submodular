        "Previous studies have shown that paraphrasing can play important roles in plenty of areas, such as machine translation (MT) (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006), question answering (QA) (Duboue and Chu-Carroll, 2006; Riezler et al., 2007), natural language generation (NLG) (Iordanskaja et al., 1991), and so on.",
        "As a result, the research on paraphrasing and its applications have attracted significant interest.",
        "This paper proposes a method that uses search engine query logs for extracting paraphrases, which is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Specifically, three kinds of paraphrases can be extracted with our method, which include (1) query-title (Q-T): a query and a document title that users clicked on; (2) query-query (Q-Q): two queries, for which users clicked on the same document title; (3) title-title (T-T): two titles that users clicked on for the same query.",
        "We train a classifier for each kind to filter incorrect pairs and refine the paraphrases.",
        "Extracting paraphrases using query logs has many advantages.",
        "First, query logs keep growing, which have no scale limitation.",
        "Second, query logs reflect web users' real needs, hence the extracted paraphrases may be more useful than that from other kinds of corpora.",
        "Third, paraphrases extracted from query logs can be directed applied in search engines for query suggestion and document reranking.",
        "In addition, we find that both queries and titles contain a good many question sentences, which can be useful in developing QA systems.",
        "We conduct experiments using a query log of a commercial Chinese search engine Baidu, from which we extracted about 2.7 million pairs of paraphrase Q-T, 0.4 million pairs of paraphrase Q-Q, and 0.4 million pairs of paraphrase T-T.",

        "In this section, we briefly review previous studies on paraphrase extraction and query log mining in information retrieval (IR).",
        "A variety of data resources have been exploited for paraphrase extraction.",
        "For example, some researchers extract paraphrases from multiple translations of the same foreign novel (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Ibrahim et al., 2003), while some others make use of comparable news articles that report on the same event within a small time interval (Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004).",
        "Besides the monolingual corpora, bilingual parallel corpora have also been used for extracting paraphrases (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Callison-Burch, 2008; Zhao et al., 2008).",
        "Their basic assumption is that phrases that align with the same foreign phrase may have the same meaning.",
        "The above methods have achieved promising results.",
        "However, their performances are usually constrained due to the scale and domain limitation.",
        "As an alternative, researchers have tried to acquire paraphrases from large-scale web corpora (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pa§ca and Dienes, 2005; Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008) or directly based on web mining (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).",
        "These methods are guided by an extended version of distributional hypothesis, namely, if two phrases often occur in similar contexts, their meanings tend to be similar.",
        "The disadvantage of these methods is that the underlying assumption does not always hold.",
        "Phrases with opposite meanings can also occur in similar contexts, such as \"X solves Y\" and \"X worsens Y\" (Lin and Pan-tel, 2001).",
        "In addition, the extracted paraphrases are generally short fragments with two slots (variables) at both ends.",
        "Query logs are widely used in the IR community, especially for mining similar queries.",
        "For example, Wen et al.",
        "(2002) clustered queries based on user click information.",
        "Their basic idea is that if some queries result in similar user clicks, the meanings of these queries should be similar.",
        "Such methods have also been investigated in (Gao et al., 2007) for cross-lingual query suggestion and (Zhao et al., 2007) for synonymous questions identification.",
        "This paper is partly inspired by their studies.",
        "However, we do not simply use click information as clues for mining similar queries.",
        "Instead, we mine paraphrases across queries and clicked document titles.",
        "In addition, query logs can be used for query expansion.",
        "For instance, Cui et al.",
        "(2002) extract probabilistic correlations between query terms and document terms by analyzing query logs, which are then used to select high-quality",
        "H1: If a query q hits a title t, then q and t are likely to be paraphrases.",
        "H2: If queries qi and q2 hit the same title t, qi and q2 are likely to be paraphrases.",
        "H3: If a query q hits titles t1 and t2, then ti and t2 are likely to be paraphrases.",
        "expansion terms for new queries.",
        "Note that the expansion terms are merely related terms of the queries, not necessarily paraphrases.",
        "There are other studies that use query logs for constructing ontologies (Sekine and Suzuki, 2007), learning named entities (Pa§ca, 2007), building user profiles (Richardson, 2008), correcting spelling errors (Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005), and so forth."

        "This motivates us to extract paraphrases from query-title pairs.",

        "We combine the extracted paraphrase Q-T, Q-Q and T-T and get a total of 3,560,257 pairs of unique paraphrases.",
        "Statistics show that only 8380 pairs (0.24%) are from more than one source, which indicates that the intersection among the three sets is very small.",
        "Further statistics show that the average length of the queries and titles in the paraphrases is 6.69 (words).",
        "To have a detailed analysis of the extracted paraphrases, we randomly selected 1000 pairs and manually labeled the precision, types, and domains.",
        "It is found that more than 43% of the paraphrases are paraphrase questions, in which how (36%), what (19%), and yes/no (14%) questions are the most common.",
        "In addition, we find that the precision of paraphrase questions (84.26%) is evidently higher than non-question paraphrases (65.14%).",
        "Those paraphrase questions are useful in question analysis and expansion in QA, which can hardly be extracted from other kinds of corpora.",
        "As expected, the paraphrases we extract cover a variety of domains.",
        "However, around 50% of them are in the 7 most popular domains, including: (1) health and medicine, (2) documentary download, (3) entertainment, (4) software, (5) education and study, (6) computer game, (7) economy and finance.",
        "This analysis reflects what web users are most concerned about.",
        "These domains, especially (4) and (6), are not well covered by the parallel and comparable corpora previously used for paraphrase extraction."

        "In this paper, we put forward a novel method that extracts paraphrases from search engine query logs.",
        "Our contribution is that we, for the first time, propose to extract paraphrases from user queries and the corresponding clicked document titles.",
        "Specifically, three kinds of paraphrases are extracted, which can be (1) a query and a hit title, (2) two queries that hit the same title, and (3) two titles hit by the same query.",
        "The extracted paraphrases are refined based on classification.",
        "Using the proposed method, we extracted over 3.5 million pairs of paraphrases from a query log of Baidu.",
        "Human evaluation results show that the precision of the paraphrases is above 70%.",
        "The results also show that we can generate high-quality paraphrase patterns from the extracted paraphrases.",
        "Our future research will be conducted along the following directions.",
        "Firstly, we will use a much larger query log for paraphrase extraction, so as to enhance the coverage of paraphrases.",
        "Secondly, we plan to have a deeper study of the transitivity of paraphrasing.",
        "Simply speaking, we want to find out whether we can extract (s1,s3) as paraphrases given that (s1;s2) and (s2, s3) are paraphrases."
