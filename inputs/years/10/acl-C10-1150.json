        "Due to reference ambiguity, even if we knew the user was only interested in the company, they would still have to contend with articles referring to the other concepts as well.",
        "In this paper we focus on the problem of resolving references of named-entities and concepts in natural language through their textual surface forms.",
        "Specifically, we present a method of resolving surface forms in general text documents to Wikipedia entries.",
        "The tasks of resolution and disambiguation are nearly identical; we make the distinction that resolution specifically applies when a known set of referent concepts are given a priori.",
        "Our approach differs from others in multiple aspects including the following.",
        "1) We employ a rich set of disambiguation features leveraging mining results from large-scale data sources.",
        "We calculate context-sensitive features by extensively mining the categories, links and contents of the entire Wikipe-dia corpus.",
        "Additionally we make use of context-independent data mined from various data sources including Web user-behavioral data and Wikipedia.",
        "Our features also capture the one-to-one relationship between a surface form and its referent.",
        "2) We use machine learning methods to train resolution models with a large automatically labeled training set.",
        "Both ranking-based and classification-based resolution approaches are explored.",
        "3) Our method disambiguates both entities and word senses.",
        "It scales well to new entities and concepts, and it can be easily applied to other languages.",
        "We propose an extensive set of metrics to evaluate not only overall resolution performance but also out-of-Wikipedia prediction.",
        "Our systems for English language are evaluated using real-world test sets and compared with a number of baselines.",
        "Evaluation results show that our systems consistently and significantly outperform others across all test sets.",

        "We then introduce our learning method in Section 4 and our features in Section 5.",

        "We have described a method of learning to resolve surface forms to Wikipedia entries.",
        "Using this method we can enrich the unstructured documents with structured knowledge from Wikipe-dia, the largest knowledge base in existence.",
        "The enrichment makes it possible to represent a document as a machine-readable network of senses instead of just a bag of words.",
        "This can supply critical semantic information useful for next-generation information retrieval systems and other text mining applications.",
        "Our resolution models use an extensive set of novel features and are leveraged by a machine learned approach that depends only on a purely automated training data generation facility.",
        "Our methodology can be applied to any other language that has Wikipedia and Web data available (after modifying the simple capitalization rules in Section 4.1).",
        "Our resolution models can be easily and quickly retrained with updated data when Wikipedia and the relevant Web data are changed.",
        "For future work, it will be important to investigate other approaches to better predict oow.",
        "Adding global constraints on resolutions of the same term at multiple locations in the same document may also be important.",
        "Of course, developing new features (such as part-of-speech, named entity type, etc) and improving training data quality is always critical, especially for social content sources such as those from Twitter.",
