        "Recent years have seen extensive applications of machine learning methods to natural language processing problems.",
        "Typically, increase in the scale of training data boosts the performance of machine learning methods, which in turn enhances the quality of learning-based NLP systems (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "However, annotating data by human is expensive in time and labor.",
        "For this reason, human-annotated corpora are considered as the most valuable resource for NLP.",
        "In practice, there often exist more than one corpus for the same NLP tasks.",
        "For example, for constituent syntactic parsing (Collins, 1999; Char-niak, 2000; Petrov et al., 2006) in Chinese, in addition to the most popular treebank Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2002), there are also other treebanks such as Tsinghua Chinese Treebank (TCT) (Zhou, 1996).",
        "For the purpose of full use of readily available human annotations for the same tasks, it is significant if such corpora can be used jointly.",
        "At first sight, a direct combination of multiple corpora is a way to this end.",
        "However, corpora created for the same NLP tasks are generally built by different organizations.",
        "Thus such corpora often follow different annotation standards and/or even different linguistic theories.",
        "We take CTB and TCT as a case study.",
        "Although both CTB and TCT are Chomskian-style treebanks, they have annotation divergences in at least two dimensions: a) CTB and TCT have dramatically different tag sets, including parts-of-speech and grammar labels, and the tags cannot be mapped one to one; b) CTB and TCT have distinct hierarchical structures.",
        "For example, the words \" M (Chinese) # Ãªt (traditional) X'fc (culture)\" are grouped as a flat noun phrase according to the CTB standard (right side in Fig. 1), but in TCT, the last two words are instead grouped together beforehand (left side in Fig. 1).",
        "The differences cause such treebanks of different annotations to be generally used independently.",
        "This paper is dedicated to solving the problem of how to use jointly multiple disparate treebanks for constituent syntactic parsing.",
        "Hereafter, treebanks of different annotations are called heterogeneous treebanks, and correspondingly, the problem of syntactic parsing with heterogeneous treebanks is referred to as heterogeneous parsing.",
        "Previous work on heterogeneous parsing is often based on treebank transformation (or treebank conversion) (Wang et al., 1994; Niu et al., 2009).",
        "The basic idea is to transform annotations of one treebank (source treebank) to fit the standard of another treebank (target treebank).",
        "Due to divergences of treebank annotations, such transformation is generally achieved in an indirect way by selecting transformation results from the output of a parser trained on the target treebank.",
        "A common property of all the work mentioned above is that transformation accuracy is heavily dependent on the performance of parsers trained on the target treebank.",
        "Sometimes transformation accuracy is not so satisfactory that techniques like instance pruning are needed in order to refine transformation results (Niu et al., 2009).",
        "We claim there exists another way, interesting but less studied for heterogeneous parsing.",
        "The basic idea is that, although there are annotation divergences between heterogenous treebanks, actually we can also find consensus in annotations of bracket structures.",
        "Thus we would like to train parsers on individual heterogeneous treebanks and guide the parsers to gain output with consensus in bracket structures as much as possible when they are parsing the same sentences.",
        "To realize this idea, we propose a generic collaborative decoding (or co-decoding) framework where decoders trained on heterogeneous treebanks can exchange consensus information between each other during the decoding phase.",
        "Theoretically the framework is able to incorporate a large number of treebanks and various functions that formalize consensus statistics.",
        "Our contributions can be summarized: 1) we propose a co-decoding approach to directly utilizing heterogeneous treebanks; 2) we propose a novel function to measure parsing consensus between multiple decoders.",
        "We also conduct experiments on two Chinese treebanks: CTB and TCT.",

        "This section describes the motivation to use co-decoding for heterogeneous parsing.",
        "We first use the example in Fig. 1 to illustrate what consensus information exists between heterogenous treebanks and why such information might help to improve parsing accuracy This figure contains two partial parse trees corresponding to the words \"t 1 (Chinese) # %L (traditional) X te (culture)\", annotated according to the TCT (left side) and CTB (right side) standards respectively.",
        "Despite the distinctions in tag sets and bracket structures, these parse trees actually have partial agreements in bracket structures.",
        "That is, not all bracket structures in the parse trees are different.",
        "Specifically put, although the internal structures of the parse trees are different, both CTB and TCT agree to take \"t 1 X te\" as a noun phrase.",
        "Motivated by this observation, we would like to guide parsers that are trained on CTB and TCT respectively to verify their output interactively by using consensus information implicitly contained in these treebanks.",
        "Better performance is expected when such information is considered.",
        "A feasible framework to make use of consensus information is n-best combination (Henderson and Brill, 1999; Sagae and Lavie, 2006; Zhang et al., 2009; Fossum and Knight, 2009).",
        "In contrast to previous work on n-best combination where multiple parsers, say, Collins parser (Collins, 1999) and Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006) are trained on the same training data, n-best combination for heterogeneous parsing is instead allowed to use either a single parser or multiple parsers which are trained on heterogeneous treebanks.",
        "Consensus information can be incorporated during the combination of the output (n-best list of full parse trees following distinct annotation standards) of individual parsers.",
        "However, despite the success of n-best combination methods, they suffer from the limited scope of n-best list.",
        "Taking this into account, we prefer to apply the co-decoding approach such that consensus information is expected to affect the entire procedure of searching hypothesis space.",
        "The idea of co-decoding is recently extensively studied in the literature of SMT (Li et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009).",
        "As the name shows, co-decoding requires multiple decoders be combined and proceed collaboratively.",
        "As with n-best combination, there are at least two ways to build multiple decoders: we can either use multiple parsers trained on the same training data (use of diversity of models), or use a single parser on different training data (use of diversity of datasets) .",
        "Both ways can build multiple decoders which are to be integrated into co-decoding.",
        "For the latter case, one method to get diverse training data is to use different portions of the same training set.",

        "To this end, we would like to adopt bestfirst CKY-style parsing algorithms as baseline decoders, since CKY-style decoders have the property that they process word spans in the ascending order of span sizes.",

        "As the table shows, although overall accuracy is increased, we find that on some sentences, co-decoding instead worsens parsing accuracy.",
        "In order to get insights on error sources, we manually analyzed 20 sentences on which co-decoding achieves negative results.",
        "We find a large portion (14 of 20) of sentences are short sentences (of words less than 20).",
        "Actually, due to high accuracy of the CTB-based decoder on short sentences, co-decoding is indifferent when this decoder is processing short sentences.",
        "And we also find that some errors are derived from differences in annotation standards.",
        "Fortunately, the divergence of annotations mainly exists in relatively small spans.",
        "So one solution to the problem is to enable co-decoding on relatively big spans.",
        "These will be done in our future work."
