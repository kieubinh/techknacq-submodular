        "Sentence simplification transforms long and difficult sentences into shorter and more readable ones.",
        "This helps humans read texts more easily and faster.",
        "Reading assistance is thus an important application of sentence simplification, especially for people with reading disabilities (Carroll et al., 1999; Inui et al., 2003), low-literacy readers (Watanabe et al., 2009), or non-native speakers (Siddharthan, 2002).",
        "Not only human readers but also NLP applications can benefit from sentence simplification.",
        "The original motivation for sentence simplification is using it as a preprocessor to facilitate parsing or translation tasks (Chandrasekar et al., 1996).",
        "Complex sentences are considered as stumbling blocks for such systems.",
        "More recently, sentence simplification has also been shown helpful for summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2000),",
        "* This work has been supported by the Emmy Noether Program of the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the grant No.",

        "sentence fusion (Filippova and Strube, 2008b), semantic role labeling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008), question generation (Heilman and Smith, 2009), paraphrase generation (Zhao et al., 2009) and biomedical information extraction (Jonnalagadda and Gonzalez, 2009).",
        "At sentence level, reading difficulty stems either from lexical or syntactic complexity.",
        "Sentence simplification can therefore be classified into two types: lexical simplification and syntactic simplification (Carroll et al., 1999).",
        "These two types of simplification can be further implemented by a set of simplification operations.",
        "Splitting, dropping, reordering, and substitution are widely accepted as important simplification operations.",
        "The splitting operation splits a long sentence into several shorter sentences to decrease the complexity of the long sentence.",
        "The dropping operation further removes unimportant parts of a sentence to make it more concise.",
        "The reordering operation interchanges the order of the split sentences (Sid-dharthan, 2006) or parts in a sentence (Watanabe et al., 2009).",
        "Finally, the substitution operation replaces difficult phrases or words with their simpler synonyms.",
        "In most cases, different simplification operations happen simultaneously.",
        "It is therefore necessary to consider the simplification process as a combination of different operations and treat them as a whole.",
        "However, most of the existing models only consider one of these operations.",
        "Siddharthan (2006) and Petersen and Ostendorf (2007) focus on sentence splitting, while sentence compression systems (Filippova and Strube, 2008a) mainly use the dropping operation.",
        "As far as lexical simplification is concerned, word substitution is usually done by selecting simpler synonyms from Wordnet based on word frequency (Carroll et al., 1999).",
        "In this paper, we propose a sentence simplification model by tree transformation which is based on techniques from statistical machine translation (SMT) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Yamada and Knight, 2002; Graehl et al., 2008).",
        "Our model integrally covers splitting, dropping, reordering and phrase/word substitution.",
        "The parameters of our model can be efficiently learned from complex-simple parallel datasets.",
        "The transformation from a complex sentence to a simple sentence is conducted by applying a sequence of simplification operations.",
        "An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to iteratively train our model.",
        "We also propose a method based on monolingual word mapping which speeds up the training process significantly.",
        "Finally, a decoder is designed to generate the simplified sentences using a greedy strategy and integrates language models.",
        "In order to train our model, we further compile a large-scale complex-simple parallel dataset (PWKP) from Simple English Wikipedia and English Wikipedia, as such datasets are rare.",
        "We organize the remainder of the paper as follows: Section 2 describes the PWKP dataset.",
        "Section 3 presents our TSM model.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to training and decoding, respectively.",
