        "In this paper, we propose a minimum error weighting strategy for SRL combination and investigate the benefit that Chinese SRL can get from combination.",
        "We assign different weights to different system outputs and add a weighted merging stage to conventional SRL combination system architecture.",
        "And we also propose a method to train these weights on development set.",
        "We evaluate the MEW strategy on Chinese Propbank data set with greedy and ILP combination methods.",
        "Our experiments have shown that the MEW strategy is very effective for Chinese SRL combination, and the benefit of combination can be improved over 25% with this strategy.",
        "And also, the MEW strategy is very flexible.",
        "With different definitions of error function, this strategy can favor precision, or recall, or F1 score.",
        "The experiments have also shown that Chinese SRL can benefit a lot from combination, especially when systems based on different syntactic views are combined.",
        "The SRL result with the highest Fi score in this paper is generated by ILP combination together with MEW strategy.",
        "In fact, the MEW strategy is easy to incorporate with other combination methods, just like incorporating with the greedy and ILP combination methods in this paper.",
