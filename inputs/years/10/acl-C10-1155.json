        "Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the analysis of various aspects of sentiment in natural language (Pang & Lee, 2008).",
        "The subtask of hedge resolution deals with the analysis of uncertainty as expressed in natural language, and the linguistic means (so-called hedges) by which speculation or uncertainty are expressed.",
        "Information of this kind is of importance for various mining tasks which aim at extracting factual data.",
        "Example (1), taken from the BioScope corpus (Vincze, Szarvas, Farkas, Mora, & Csirik, 2008), shows a sentence where uncertainty is signaled by the modal verb may.",
        "(1) {The unknown amino acid (may) be used by these species}.",
        "The topic of the Shared Task at the 2010 Conference for Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) is hedge detection in biomedical literature – in a sense 'zooming in' on one particular aspect of the broader BioNLP Shared Task in 2009 (Kim, Ohta, Pyysalo, Kano, & Tsujii, 2009).",
        "It involves two subtasks: Task 1 is described as learning to detect sentences containing uncertainty; the objective of Task 2 is learning to resolve the in-sentence scope of hedge cues (Farkas, Vincze, Mora, Csirik, & Szarvas, 2010).",
        "The organizers further suggest: This task falls within the scope of semantic analysis of sentences exploiting syntactic patterns [...].",
        "The utility of syntactic information within various approaches to sentiment analysis in natural language has been an issue of some debate (Wilson, Wiebe, & Hwa, 2006; Ng, Dasgupta, & Arifin, 2006), and the potential contribution of syntax clearly varies with the specifics of the task.",
        "Previous work in the hedging realm has largely been concerned with cue detection, i.e. identifying uncertainty cues such as may in (1), which are predominantly individual tokens (Medlock & Briscoe, 2007; Kilicoglu & Bergler, 2008).",
        "There has been little previous work aimed at actually resolving the scope of such hedge cues, which presumably constitutes a somewhat different and likely more difficult problem.",
        "Morante and Daele-mans (2009) present a machine-learning approach to this task, using token-level, lexical information only.",
        "To this end, CoNLL 2010 enters largely uncharted territory, and it remains to be seen (a) whether syntactic analysis indeed is a necessary component in approaching this task and, more generally, (b) to what degree the specific task setup can inform us about the strong and weak points in current approaches and technology.",
        "In this article, we investigate the contribution of syntax to hedge resolution, by reflecting on our experience in the CoNLL 2010 task.",
        "Our CoNLL system submission ranked fourth (of 24) on Task 1 and third (of 15) on Task 2, for an overall best average result (there appears to be very limited overlap among top performers for the two subtasks).",

        "We present a hybrid, two-level approach for hedge resolution, where a statistical classifier detects cue words, and a small set of manually crafted rules operating over syntactic structures resolve scope.",
        "We show how syntactic information – produced by a data-driven dependency parser complemented with information from a 'deep', hand-crafted grammar – contributes to the resolution of in-sentence scope of hedge cues, discussing various types of syntactic constructions and associated scope detection rules in considerable detail.",

        "Task 1 is a binary sentence classification task: identifying utterances as being certain or uncertain.",
        "Following common practice, this subtask is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, and Fi for the 'positive' class, i.e. uncertain.",
        "In our work, we approach Task 1 as a byproduct of the full hedge resolution problem, labeling a sentence as uncertain if it contains at least one token classified as a hedge cue.",
        "In addition to the sentence-level evaluation for Task 1, we also present precision, recall, and Fi for the cue-level.",
        "Task 2 comprises two subtasks: cue detection and scope resolution.",
        "The official CoNLL evaluation does not tease apart these two aspects of the problem, however: Only an exact match of both the cue and scope bracketing (in terms of substring positions) will be counted as a success, again quantified in terms of precision, recall, and F1.",
        "Discussing our results below, we report cue detection and scope resolution performance separately, and further put scope results into perspective against an upper bound based on the goldstandard cue annotation.",
        "Besides the primary biomedical domain data, some annotated Wikipedia data was provided for Task 1, and participating systems are classified as in-domain (using exclusively the domain-specific data), cross-domain (combining both types of training data), or open (utilizing additional uncertainty-related resources).",
        "In our work, we focus on the interplay of syntax and the more challenging Task 2; we ignored the Wikipedia track in Task 1.",
        "Despite our using general NLP tools (see below), our system falls into the most restrictive, in-domain category.",
        "Training and Evaluation Data The training data for the CoNLL 2010 Shared Task is taken from the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) and consists of 14,541 'sentences' (or other root-level utterances) from biomedical abstracts and articles (see Table 1).",
        "The BioScope corpus provides annotation for hedge cues as well as their scope.",
        "According to the annotation guidelines (Vincze et al., 2008), the annotation adheres to a principle of minimalism when it comes to hedge cues, i.e. the minimal unit expressing hedging is annotated.",
        "The inverse is true of scope annotations, which adhere to a principle of maximal scope – meaning that scope should be set to the largest syntactic unit possible.",

        "For improved accuracy and portability across domains and genres, we make our parser incorporate the predictions of a large-scale, general-purpose lfg parser – following the work of0vrelid, Kuhn, and Spreyer (2009).",
        "A technique dubbed parser stacking enables the data-driven parser to learn, not only from gold standard treebank annotations, but from the output of another parser (Nivre & McDonald, 2008).",
        "This technique has been shown to provide significant improvements in accuracy for both English and German (0vrelid et al., 2009), and a similar setup employing an hpsg grammar has been shown to increase domain independence in data-driven dependency parsing (Zhang & Wang, 2009).",
        "The stacked parser combines two quite different approaches – data-driven dependency parsing and 'deep' parsing with a handcrafted grammar – and thus provides us with a broad range of different types of linguistic information for the hedge resolution task.",
        "MaltParser is based on a deterministic parsing strategy in combination with treebank-induced classifiers for predicting parse transitions.",
        "It supports a rich feature representation of the parse history in order to guide parsing and may easily be extended to take additional features into account.",
        "The procedure to enable the data-driven parser to learn from the grammar-driven parser is quite simple.",
        "We parse a treebank with the xle platform (Crouch et al., 2008) and the English grammar developed within the ParGram project (Butt, then convert the lfg output to dependency structures, so that we have two parallel versions of the treebank – one gold standard and one with lfg annotation.",
        "We extend the gold standard treebank with additional information from the corresponding lfg analysis and train MaltParser on the enhanced data set.",
        "Table 2 shows the enhanced dependency representation of example (1) above, taken from the training data.",
        "For each token, the parsed data contains information on the word form, lemma, and part of speech (pos), as well as on the head and dependency relation in columns 6 and 7.",
        "The added xle information resides in the feats column, and in the xle-specific head and dependency columns 8 and 9.",
        "Parser outputs, which in turn form the basis for our scope resolution rules discussed in Section 5, also take this same form.",
        "The parser employed in this work is trained on the Wall Street Journal sections 2 - 24 of the Penn Treebank (ptb), converted to dependency format (Johansson & Nugues, 2007) and extended with xle features, as described above.",
        "Parsing uses the arc-eager mode of MaltParser and an svm with a polynomial kernel.",
        "When tested using 10-fold cross validation on the enhanced ptb, the parser achieves a labeled accuracy score of 89.8.",
        "PoS Tagging and Domain Variation Our parser is trained on financial news, and although stacking with a general-purpose lfg parser is expected to aid domain portability, substantial differences in domain and genre are bound to negatively affect syntactic analysis (Gildea, 2001).",
        "MaltParser presupposes that inputs have been PoS tagged, leaving room for variation in preprocessing.",
        "On the one hand, we aim to make parser inputs maximally similar to its training data (i.e. the conventions established in the PTB); on the other hand we wish to benefit from specialized resources for the biomedical domain.",

        "Hence, we adapted an in-house tokenizer (using cascaded finite-state rules) to the CoNLL task, run two PoS taggers in parallel, and eclectically combine annotations across the various preprocessing components – predominantly giving precedence to genia lemmatization and PoS hypotheses.",
        "To assess the impact of improved, domain-adapted inputs on our hedge resolution system, we contrast two configurations: first, running the parser in the exact same manner as 0vrelid, Kuhn, and Spreyer (2010), we use TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and its standard model for English (trained on the PTB) for preprocessing; second, we give as inputs to the parser our refined tokenization and merged PoS tags, as described above.",

        "Our evaluators reviewed and discussed these 185 cases, classifying 156 (84%) as genuine system errors, 22 (12 %) as likely annotation errors, and a remaining seven cases as involving controversial or seemingly arbitrary decisions.",
        "The two most frequent classes of system errors pertain (a) to the recognition of phrase and clause boundaries and (b) to not dealing successfully with relatively superficial properties of the text.",
        "Examples (14) and (15) illustrate the first class of errors, where in addition to the goldstandard annotation we use vertical bars ('|') to indicate scope predictions of our system.",
        "(15) This |{(might) affect the results} if there is a systematic bias on the composition of a protein interaction set| .",
        "In our syntax-driven approach to scope resolution, system errors will almost always correspond to a failure in determining constituent boundaries, in a very general sense.",
        "However, specifically example (15) is indicative of a key challenge in this task, where adverbials of condition, reason, or contrast frequently attach within the dependency domain of a hedge cue, yet are rarely included in the scope annotation.",
        "Example (16) demonstrates our second frequent class of system errors.",
        "One in six items in the BSP training data contains a sentence-final parenthesized element or trailing number, as for example (2), (9), or (10) above; most of these are bibliographic or other in-text references, which are never included in scope annotation.",
        "Hence, our system includes a rule to 'back out' from trailing parentheticals; in examples like (16), however, syntax does not make explicit the contrast between an in-text reference vs. another type of parenthetical.",
        "(16) More specifically, {|the bristle and leg phenotypes are ( likely) to result from reduced signaling by Dl| (and not by Ser)}.",
        "Moving on to apparent annotation errors, the rules for inclusion (or not) of the subject in the scope of verbal hedge cues and decisions on boundaries (or internal structure) of nominals predictions made by our scope resolution rules is likely to bias our sample, such that our estimated proportion of 12 % annotation errors cannot be used to project an overall error rate.",

        "Our combination of stacked dependency parsing and hand-crafted scope resolution rules proved adequate for the CoNLL 2010 competition, confirming the central role of syntax in this task.",
        "With a comparatively small set of rules (implemented in a few hundred lines of code), constructed through roughly two full weeks of effort (studying BioScope annotations and developing rules), our CoNLL system achieved an end-to-end F1 of 55.33 on Task 2.",
        "The two submissions with better results (at 57.32 and 55.65 F1) represent groups who have pioneered the hedge analysis task in previous years (Morante et al., 2010; Rei & Briscoe, 2010).",
        "Scores for other 'indomain' participants range from 52.24 to 2.15 F1.",
        "Doubtless there is room for straightforward extension: for example retraining our parser on the GENIA Treebank, further improving the cue classifier, and refining scope resolution rules in the light of the error analysis above.",
        "At the same time, we remain mildly ambivalent about the long-term impact of some of the specifics of the 2010 CoNLL task.",
        "Shared tasks (i.e. system bake-offs) have become increasingly popular in past years, and in some sub-fields (e.g. IE, smt, or dependency parsing) high-visibility competitions can shape community research agendas.",
        "Hence, even at this early stage, it seems appropriate to reflect on the possible conclusions to be drawn from the 2010 hedge resolution task.",
        "First, we believe the harsh 'exact substring match' evaluation metric underestimates the degree to which current technology can solve this problem; furthermore, idiosyncratic, string-level properties (e.g. the exact treatment of punctuation or parentheticals) may partly obscure the interpretation of methods used and corresponding system performance.",
        "These effects are compounded by some concerns about the quality of available annotation.",
        "Even though we tried fine-tuning our cross validation testing to the nature of the evaluation data (comprising only articles), our system performs substantially worse on the newly annotated CoNLL test data, in both stages.",
        "In our view, the annotation of hedge cues and scopes ideally would be overtly related to at least some level of syntactic annotation – as would in principle be possible for the segment of BioScope drawing on the abstracts of the genia Treebank."
