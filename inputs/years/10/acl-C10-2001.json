        "Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging is probably the most common and best researched NLP task, the first step in many higher level processing solutions such as parsing, but also information retrieval, speech recognition and machine translation.",
        "There are also well established evaluation measures, the foremost of which is accuracy, i.e., the percent of words for which the tagger assigns the correct – in the sense of some gold standard – interpretation.",
        "Accuracy works well for the original PoS tagging task, where each word is assumed to have exactly one correct tag, and where the information carried by a tag is limited roughly to the PoS of the word and only very little morphosyntactic information, as in typical tagsets for English.",
        "However, there are two cases where accuracy becomes less than adequate: the situation where the gold standard and / or the tagging results contain multiple tags marked as correct for a single word, and the use of a rich morphosyntactic (or morphological) tagset.",
        "The first possibility is discussed in detail in (Karwariska and Przepiorkowski, 2009), but the need for an evaluation measure for taggers which do not necessarily fully disambiguate PoS was already noted in (van Halteren, 1999), where the use of standard information retrieval measures precision and recall (as well as their harmonic mean, the F-measure) is proposed.",
        "Other natural generalisations of the accuracy measure, able to deal with non-unique tags either in the gold standardor in the tagging results, are proposed in (Kar-wanska and Przepiorkowski, 2009).",
        "Standard accuracy is less than adequate also in case of rich morphosyntactic tagsets, where the full tag carries information not only about PoS, but also about case, number, gender, etc.",
        "Such tagsets are common for Slavic languages, but also for Hungarian, Arabic and other languages.",
        "For example, according to one commonly used Polish tagset (Przepiorkowski and Wolinski, 2003), the form uda has the following interpretations: fin:sg:ter:perf (a finite singular 3rd person perfective form of the verb UDAC 'pretend'), subst:pl:nom:n and",
        "subst:pl:acc:n (nominative or accusative plural form of the neuter noun udo 'thigh').",
        "Now, assuming that the right interpretation in a given context is subst:pl:acc:n, accuracy will equally harshly penalise the other nominal interpretation (subst:pl:nom:n), which shares with the correct interpretation not only PoS, but also the values of gender and number, and the completely irrelevant verbal interpretation.",
        "A more accurate tagger evaluation measure should distinguish these two non-optimal assignments and treat subst:pl:nom:n as partially correct.",
        "Similarly, the Polish tagset mentioned above distinguishes between nouns and gerunds, with some forms actually ambiguous between these two interpretations.",
        "For example, zadanie may be interpreted as a nominative or accusative form of the noun zadanie 'task', or a nominative or accusative form of the gerund derived from the verb zadaC 'assign'.",
        "Since gerunds and nouns have very similar distributions, any error in the assignment of part of speech, noun vs. gerund, will most probably not matter for a parser of Polish – it will still be able to construct the right tree, provided the case is correctly disambiguated.",
        "However, the \"all-or-nothing\" nature of the accuracy measure regards the tag differing from the correct one only in part of speech or in case as harshly, as it would regard an utterly wrong interpretation, say, as an adverb.",
        "In what follows we propose various evaluation measures which differentiate between better and worse incorrect interpretations, cf. § 2.",
        "The implementation of two such measures is described in § 3.",
        "Finally, § 4 concludes the paper."

      "heading": "2. Proposed Measures",
      "text": [
        "The first step towards a better accuracy measure might consist in calculating two accuracy measures: one for full tags, and the other only for fragments of tags representing parts of speech.",
        "Two taggers wrongly assigning either fin:sg:ter:perf (T1) or subst:pl:nom:n (T2) instead of the correct subst:pl:acc:nwould fare equally well with respect to the tag-level accuracy, but T2 would be – rightly – evaluated as better with respect to the PoS-level accuracy.",
        "The second example given in § 1 shows, however, that the problem is more general and that a tagger which gets the PoS wrong (say, gerund instead of noun) but all the relevant categories (case, number, gender) right may actually be more useful in practice than the one that gets the PoS right at the cost of confusing cases (say, accusative instead of nominative).",
        "A generalisation of the idea of looking separately at parts of speech is to split tags into their components (or positions) and measure the correctness of the tag by calculating the F-measure.",
        "For example, if the (perfective, affirmative) gerundial interpretation ger:sg:nom:n:perf:aff is assigned instead of the correct nominal interpretation subst:sg:nom:n, the tags agree on 3 positions (sg, nom, n), so the precision is |, the recall – 4, which gives the F-measure of 0.6.",
        "Obviously, the assignment of the correct interpretation results in F-measure equal 1.0, and the completely wrong interpretation gives F-measure 0.0.",
        "Taking these values instead of the \"all-or-nothing\" 0 or 1, accuracy is reinterpreted as the average F-measure over all tag assignments.",
        "Note that while this measure, let us call it positional accuracy (PA), is more fine-grained than the standard accuracy, it wrongly treats all components of tags as of equal importance and difficulty.",
        "For example, there are many case syncretisms in Polish, but practically no ambiguities concerning the category of negation (see the value aff above), so case is inherently much more difficult than negation, and also much more important for syntactic parsing, and as such it should carry more weight when evaluating tagging results.",
        "In the current section we make a simplifying assumption that weights of positions are absolute, rather than conditional, i.e., that the weight of, say, case does not depend on part of speech, word or context.",
        "Once the weights are attained, weighted precision and recall may be used as in the following example.",
        "Assume that PoS, case, number and gender have the same weight, say 2.0, which is 4 times larger than that of any other category.",
        "Then, in case ger:sg:nom:n:perf:aff is assigned instead of the correct subst:sg:nom:n, precision and recall are given by:",
        "This results in a higher F-measure than in case of non-weighted positional accuracy.",
        "The following subsections propose various ways in which the importance of particular grammatical categories and of the part of speech may be estimated.",
        "The average number of morphosyntactic interpretations per word is sometimes given as a rough measure of the difficulty of tagging.",
        "For example, tagging English texts with the Penn Treebank tagset is easier than tagging Czech or Polish, as the average number of possible tags per word is 2.32 in English (Hajic, 2004, p. 171), while it is 3.65 (Hajic and Hladkâ, 1997, p. 113) and 3.32 (Przepiorkowski, 2008, p. 44) for common tagsets for Czech and Polish, respectively.",
        "By analogy, one measure of the difficulty of assigning the right value of a given category or part of speech is the average number of different values of the category per word.",
        "All measures mentioned so far are intrinsic (in vitro) evaluation measures, independent – but hopefully correlated with – the usefulness of the results in particular applications.",
        "On the other hand, extrinsic (in vivo) evaluation estimates the usefulness of tagging in larger systems, e.g., in parsers.",
        "Full-scale extrinsic evaluation is rarely used, as it is much more costly and often requires user evaluation of the end system.",
        "In this and the next subsections we propose evaluation measures which combine the advantages of both approaches.",
        "They are variants of the weighted positional accuracy (WPA) measure, where weights correspond to the usefulness of a given category (or PoS) for a particular task.",
        "Probably the most common task taking advantage of morphosyntactic tagging is syntactic parsing.",
        "Here, weights should indicate to what extent the parser relies on PoS and particular categories to arrive at the correct parse.",
        "Such weights may be estimated from an automatically parsed corpus in the following way:",
        "for each category (including PoS) c do",
        "count(c) = 0 {Initialise counts.}",
        "for each sentence s do for each rule r used in s do for each terminal symbol (word) t in the RHS of r do for each category c referred to by r in t",
        "increase count(c) end for end for end for end for {Use count(c)'s as weights.}",
        "In prose: whenever a syntactic rule is used, increase counts of all morphosyntactic categories (incl.",
        "PoS) mentioned in the terminal symbols occurring in this rule.",
        "These counts may be normalised or used directly as weights.",
        "We assume here that either the parser produces a single parse for any sentence (assumption realistic only in case of shallow parsers), or that the best or at least most probable parse may be selected automatically, as in case of probabilistic grammars, or that parses are disambiguated manually.",
        "In case only a non-probabilistic deep parser is available, and parses are not disambiguated manually, the Expectation-Maximisation method may be used to select a probable parse (Debowski, 2009) or all parses might be taken into account.",
        "Note that, once a parser is available, such weights may be calculated automatically and used repeatedly for tagger evaluation, so the cost of using this measure is not significantly higher than the cost of intrinsic measures, while at the same time the correlation of the evaluation results with the extrinsic application is much higher.",
        "The final variant (many more are imaginable) of WPA that we would like to describe here concerns another application of tagging, namely, for the annotation of corpora.",
        "Various corpus search engines, including the IMS Open Corpus Workbench (http://cwb.",
        "sourceforge.net/) andPoliqarp (http:// poliqarp.sourceforge.net/) allow the user to search for particular parts of speech and grammatical categories.",
        "Obviously, the tagger should maximise the quality of the disambiguation of those categories which occur frequently in corpus queries, i.e., the weights should correspond to the frequencies of particular categories (and PoS) in user queries.",
        "Note that the only resource needed to calculate weights are the logs of a corpus search engine.",
        "An experiment involving an implementation of this measure is described in detail in § 3.",
        "The importance and difficulty of a category may depend on the part of speech.",
        "For example, after case syncretisms, gender ambiguity is one of the main problems for the current taggers of Polish.",
        "But this problem concerns mainly pronouns and adjectives, where the systematic gender syncretism is high.",
        "On the other hand, nouns do not inflect for gender, so only some nominal forms are ambiguous with respect to gender.",
        "Moreover, gerunds, which also bear gender, are uniformly neuter, so here part of speech alone uniquely determines the value of this category.",
        "A straightforward extension of WPA capitalising on these observations is what we call conditional weighted positional accuracy (CWPA), where weights of morphosyntactic categories are conditioned on PoS.",
        "Note that not all variants of WPA may be easily generalised to CWPA; although such an extension is obvious for the average ambiguity (§ 2.3.1), it is less clear for the other two variants.",
        "For parsing-related WPA, we assume that, even if a given rule does not mention the PoS of a terminal symbol, that PoS may be read off the parse tree, so the conditional weights may still be calculated.",
        "On the other hand, logs of a corpus search engine are typically not sufficient to calculate such conditional weights; e.g., a query for a sequence of 5 genitive words occurring in logs would have to be rerun on the corpus again in order to find out parts of speech of the returned 5-word sequences.",
        "For a large number of queries on a large corpus, this is a potentially costly operation.",
        "It is also not immediately clear how to generalise precision and recall from WPA to CWPA.",
        "Returning to the example above, where ti = ger:sg:nom:n:perf:aff is assigned instead of the correct t2 = subst:sg:nom:n,we note that the weights of number, case and gender may now (and should, at least in case of gender!)",
        "be different for the two parts of speech involved.",
        "Hence, precision needs to be calculated with respect to the weights for the automatically assigned part of speech, and recall – taking into account weights for the gold standard part of speech:",
        "where t* is the PoS of tag t, w(p) is the weight of the part of speech p, w(c\\p) is the conditional weight of the category c for PoS p, C (t) is the set of morphosyntactic categories of tag t, C (t1 ,t2) is the set of morphosyntactic categories common to tags t1 and t2, tc is the value of category c in tag t, and is the Kronecker delta (equal to 1 if i = j, and to 0 otherwise).",
        "Hence, for the example above, these formulas may be simplified to:",
        "where n, c, g, a and neg stand for number, case, gender, aspect and negation.",
        "values of some of its categories, as in the following simple rule, specifying prepositional phrases as a preposition governing a specific case and a non-empty sequence of words bearing that case: PPcase=c Pcase=c X+se=C."

        "From now on, let name them scoring functions.",
        "One could use them directly for evaluation, given that both the tagger and the golden standard always assign a single interpretation to each segment.",
        "This is not the case for the corpus we use, hence we propose generalisation of standard information retrieval metrics (precision, recall and F-measure) as well as strong and weak correctness (Kar-wanska and Przepiorkowski, 2009) to account for scoring functions.",
        "Denote by Ti and Gi the sets of tags assigned by the tagger and the golden standard, accordingly, to the i-th segment of the tagged text.",
