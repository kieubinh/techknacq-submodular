        "Since the earliest days of IR, researchers noted the potential pitfalls of keyword retrieval, such as synonymy, polysemy, hyponymy or anaphora.",
        "Although in principle these linguistic phenomena should be taken into account in order to obtain high retrieval relevance, the lack of algorithmic models prohibited any systematic study of the effect of this phenomena in retrieval.",
        "Instead, researchers resorted to distributional semantic models to try to improve retrieval relevance, and overcome the brittleness of keyword matches.",
        "Most research concentrated on Query",
        "Expansion (QE) methods, which typically analyze term co-occurrence statistics in the corpus and in the highest scored documents for the original query in order to select terms for expanding the query terms (Manning et al., 2009).",
        "Document expansion (DE) is a natural alternative to QE, but surprisingly it was not investigated until very recently.",
        "Several researchers have used distributional methods from similar documents in the collection in order to expand the documents with related terms that do not actually occur in the document (Liu and Croft, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2004; Tao et al., 2006; Mei et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2009).",
        "The work presented here is complementary, in that we also explore DE, but use WordNet instead of distributional methods.",
        "Lexical semantic resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) might provide a principled and explicit remedy for the brittleness of keyword matches.",
        "WordNet has been used with success in psycholinguistic datasets of word similarity and relatedness, where it often surpasses distributional methods based on keyword matches (Agirre et al., 2009b).",
        "WordNet has been applied to IR before.",
        "Some authors extended the query with related terms (Voorhees, 1994; Liu et al., 2005), while others have explicitly represented and indexed word senses after performing word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Gonzalo et al., 1998; Stokoe et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004).",
        "More recently, a CLEF task was organized (Agirre et al., 2008; Agirre et al., 2009a) where queries and documents were semantically disambiguated, and participants reported mixed results.",
        "This paper proposes to use WordNet for document expansion, proposing a new method: given a full document, a random walk algorithm over the WordNet graph ranks concepts closely related to the words in the document.",
        "This is in contrast to previous WordNet-based work which focused on WSD to replace or supplement words with their senses.",
        "Our method discovers important concepts, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the document.",
        "For instance, given a document mentioning virus, software and DSL, our method suggests related concepts and associated words such us digital subscriber line, phone company and computer.",
        "Those expansion words are indexed separately, and when combined with the regular index, we show that they improve the results in three datasets over a state-of-the-art IR engine (Boldi and Vigna, 2005).",
        "The three datasets used in this study are ResPubliQA (Pefias et al., 2009), Yahoo!",
        "Answers (Surdeanu et al., 2008) and CLEF-Robust (Agirre et al., 2009a).",
        "Considering that many IR systems are not robust in the sense that they need careful fine-tuning and optimization of their parameters, we decided to study the robustness of our method, exploring some alternative settings, including default parameters, parameters optimized in development data, and parameters optimized in other datasets.",
        "The study reveals that the additional semantic expansion terms provide robustness in most cases.",
        "We also hypothesized that semantic document expansion could be most profitable when documents are shorter, and our algorithm would be most effective for collections of short documents.",
        "We artificially trimmed documents in the Robust dataset.",
        "The results, together with the analysis of document lengths of the three datasets, show that document expansion is specially effective for very short documents, but other factors could also play a role.",

        "Our key insight is to expand the document with related words according to the background information in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which provides generic information about general vocabulary terms.",
        "WordNet groups nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs into sets of synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.",
        "Synsets are interlinked with conceptual-semantic and lexical relations, including hypernymy, meronymy, causality, etc.",
        "In contrast with previous work, we select those concepts that are most closely related to the document as a whole.",
        "For that, we use a technique based on random walks over the graph representation of WordNet concepts and relations.",
        "We represent WordNet as a graph as follows: graph nodes represent WordNet concepts (synsets) and dictionary words; relations among synsets are represented by undirected edges; and dictionary words are linked to the synsets associated to them by directed edges.",
        "We used version 3.0, with all relations provided, including the gloss relations.",

        "Basically, personalized PageRank is computed by modifying the random jump distribution vector in the traditional PageRank equation.",

        "Then, the calculation of the PageRank vector Pr over G is equivalent to resolving Equation (1).",
        "In the equation, v is a N x 1 vector and c is the so called damping factor, a scalar value between 0 and 1.",
        "The first term of the sum on the equation models the voting scheme described in the beginning of the section.",
        "The second term represents, loosely speaking, the probability of a surfer randomly jumping to any node, e.g. without following any paths on the graph.",
        "The damping factor, usually set in the [0.85..0.95] range, models the way in which these two terms are combined at each step.",
        "The second term on Eq.",
        "(1) can also be seen as a smoothing factor that makes any graph fulfill the property of being aperiodic and irreducible, and thus guarantees that PageRank calculation converges to a unique stationary distribution.",
        "In the traditional PageRank formulation the vector v is a stochastic normalized vector whose element values are all N, thus assigning equal probabilities to all nodes in the graph in case of random jumps.",
        "In the case of personalized PageRank as used here, v is initialized with uniform probabilities for the terms in the document, and 0 for the rest of terms.",
        "PageRank is actually calculated by applying an iterative algorithm which computes Eq.",
        "(1) successively until a fixed number of iterations are executed.",

        "Most QE methods use statistical (or distributional) techniques to select terms for expansion.",
        "They do this by analyzing term cooccurrence statistics in the corpus and in the highest scored documents of the original query (Manning et al., 2009).",
        "These methods seemed to improve slightly retrieval relevance on average, but at the cost of greatly decreasing the relevance of difficult queries.",
        "But more recent studies seem to overcome some of these problems (Collins-Thompson, 2009).",
        "An alternative to QE is to perform the expansion in the document.",
        "Document Expansion (DE) was first proposed in the speech retrieval community (Singhal and Pereira, 1999), where the task is to retrieve speech transcriptions which are quite noisy.",
        "Singhal and Pereira propose to enhance the representation of a noisy document by adding to the document vector a linearly weighted mixture of related documents.",
        "In order to determine related documents, the original document is used as a query into the collection, and the ten most relevant documents are selected.",
        "Two related papers (Liu and Croft, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2004) followed a similar approach on the TREC ad-hoc document retrieval task.",
        "They use document clustering to determine similar documents, and document expansion is carried out with respect to these.",
        "Both papers report significant improvements over non-expanded baselines.",
        "Instead of clustering, more recent work (Tao et al., 2006; Mei et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2009) use language models and graph representations of the similarity between documents in the collection to smooth language models with some success.",
        "The work presented here is complementary, in that we also explore DE, but use WordNet instead of distributional methods.",
        "They use a tighter integration of their expansion model (compared to our simple two-index model), which coupled with our expansion method could help improve results further.",
        "We plan to explore this in the future.",
        "An alternative to statistical expansion methods is to use lexical semantic knowledge bases such as WordNet.",
        "Most of the work has focused on query expansion and the use of synonyms from WordNet after performing word sense disambiguation (WSD) with some success (Voorhees, 1994; Liu et al., 2005).",
        "The short context available in the query when performing WSD is an important problems of these techniques.",
        "In contrast, we use full document context, and related words beyond synonyms.",
        "Another strand of WordNet based work has explicitly represented and indexed word senses after performing WSD (Gonzalo et al., 1998; Stokoe et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004).",
        "The word senses conform a different space for document representation, but contrary to us, these works incorporate concepts for all words in the documents, and are not able to incorporate concepts that are not explicitly mentioned in the document.",
        "More recently, a CLEF task was organized (Agirre et al., 2009a) where terms were semantically disambiguated to see the improvement that this would have on retrieval; the conclusions were mixed, with some participants slightly improving results with information from WordNet.",
        "To the best of our knowledge our paper is the first on the topic of document expansion using lexical-semantic resources.",
        "We would like to also compare our performance to those of other systems as tested on the same datasets.",

        "This paper presents a novel Document Expansion method based on a WordNet-based system to find related concepts and words.",
        "The documents in three datasets were thus expanded with related words, which were fed into a separate index.",
        "When combined with the regular index we report improvements over MG4J using wBM for those three datasets across several parameter settings, including default values, optimized parameters and parameters optimized in other datasets.",
        "In most of the cases the improvements are statistically significant, indicating that the information in the document expansion is useful.",
        "Similar to other expansion methods, parameter optimization has a stronger effect than our expansion strategy.",
        "The problem with parameter optimization is that in most real cases there is no tuning dataset available.",
        "Our analysis shows that our expansion method is more effective for suboptimal parameter settings, which is the case for most real-live IR applications.",
        "A comparison across the three datasets and using artificially trimmed documents indicates that our method is particularly effective for short documents.",
        "As document expansion is done at indexing time, it avoids any overhead at query time.",
        "It also has the advantage of leveraging full document context, in contrast to query expansion methods, which use the scarce information present in the much shorter queries.",
        "Compared to WSD-based methods, our method has the advantage of not having to disambiguate all words in the document.",
        "Besides, our algorithm picks the most relevant concepts, and thus is able to expand to concepts which are not explicitly mentioned in the document.",
        "The successful use of background information such as the one in WordNet could help close the gap between semantic web technologies and IR, and opens the possibility to include other resources like Wikipedia or domain ontologies like those in the Unified Medical Language System.",
        "Our method to integrate expanded terms using an additional index is simple and straightforward, and there is still ample room for improvement.",
        "A tighter integration of the document expansion technique in the retrieval model should yield better results, and the smoothed language models of natural choice.",
        "We would also like to compare with other existing query and document expansion techniques and study whether our technique is complementary to query expansion approaches."
