        "Web search algorithms provide methods for ranking web scale collection of documents given a short query.",
        "The success of these algorithms often relies on the rich set of document properties or features and the complex relationships between them.",
        "Increasingly, machine learning techniques are being used to learn these relationships for an effective ranking function (Liu, 2009).",
        "These techniques use a set of labeled training data labeled with multiple relevance grades to automatically estimate parameters of a model which directly optimizes a performance metric.",
        "Although training data often is derived from editorial labels of document relevance, it can also be inferred from a careful analysis of users' interactions with a working system (Joachims, 2002).",
        "For example, in web search, given a query, document preference information can be derived from user clicks.",
        "This data can then be used with an algorithm which learns from pairwise preference data (Joachims, 2002; Zheng et al., 2007).",
        "However, automatically extracted pairwise preference data is subject to noise due to the specific sampling methods used (Joachims et al., 2005; Radlinski and Joachim, 2006; Radlinski and Joachim, 2007).",
        "One of the fundamental problems for a web search engine with global reach is the development of ranking models for different regional markets.",
        "While the approach of training a single model for all markets is attractive, it fails to fully exploit of specific properties of the markets.",
        "On the other hand, the approach of training market-specific models requires the huge overhead of acquiring a large training set for each market.",
        "As a result, techniques have been developed to create a model for a small market, say a Southeast Asian country, by combining a strong model in another market, say the United States, with a small amount of manually labeled training data in the small market (Chen et al., 2008b).",
        "However, the existing Trada method takes only multigrade labeled training data for adaptation, making it impossible to take advantage of the easily harvested pairwise preference data.",
        "In fact, to our knowledge, there is no adaptation algorithm that is specifically developed for pairwise data.",
        "In this paper, we address the development market-specific ranking models by leveraging pairwise preference data.",
        "The pairwise preference data contains most market-specific training examples, while a model from a large market may capture the common characteristics of a ranking function.",
        "By combining them algorithmically, our approach has two unique advantages.",
        "(1) The biases and noises of the pairwise preference data can be depressed by using the base model from the large market.",
        "(2) The base model can be tailored to the characteristics of the new market by incorporating the market specific pairwise training data.",
        "As the pairwise data has the particular form, the challenge is how to effectively use pairwise data in adaptation.",
        "This appeals to the following objective of many web search engines: design algorithms which minimize manually labeled data requirements while maintaining strong performance."

        "In recent years, the ranking problem is frequently formulated as a supervised machine learning problem, which combines different kinds of features to train a ranking function.",
        "The ranking problem can be formulated as learning a function with pairwise preference data, which is to minimize the number of contradicting pairs in training data.",
        "For example, RankSVM (Joachims, 2002) uses support vector machines to learn a ranking function from preference data; RankNet (Burges et al., 2005a) applies neural network and gradient descent to obtain a ranking function; RankBoost (Freund et al., 1998) applies the idea of boosting to construct an efficient ranking function from a set of weak ranking functions; GBRank (Zheng et al., 2007; Xia et al., 2008) using gradient descent in function spaces, which is able to learn relative ranking information in the context of web search.",
        "In addition, Several studies have been focused on learning ranking functions in semi-supervised learning framework (Amini et al., 2008; Duh and Kirchhoff, 2008), where unlabeled data are exploited to enhance ranking function.",
        "Another approach to learning a ranking function addresses the problem of optimizing the list-wise performance measures of information retrieval, such as mean average precision or Discount Cumulative Gain (Cao et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008c).",
        "The idea of these methods is to obtain a ranking function that is optimal with respect to some information retrieval performance measure.",
        "Model adaptation has previously been applied in the area of natural language processing and speech recognition.",
        "This approach has been successfully applied to parsing (Hwa, 1999), tagging (Blitzer et al., 2006), and language modeling for speech recognition (Bacchiani and Roark, 2003).",
        "Until very recently, several works have been presented on the topic of model adaptation for ranking (Gao et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008b; Chen et al., 2009), however, none of them target the model adaptation with the pairwise learning framework.",
        "Finally, multitask learning for ranking has also been proposed as a means of addressing problems similar to those we have encountered in model adaptation (Chen et al., 2008a; Bai et al., 2009; Geng et al., 2009)."

        "Given this representation, we can learn a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) which models the relationship between document features, (q, d), and the relevance score, y, as a decision tree (Friedman, 2001).",
        "Figure 1 shows a portion of such a tree.",
        "Given a new query document pair, the GBDT can be used to predict the relevance grade of the document.",
        "A ranking is then inferred from these predictions.",
        "We refer to this method as GBDTreg.",
        "In the training phase, GBDTreg iteratively constructs regression trees.",
        "The initial regression tree minimizes the L2 loss with respect to the targets, y,",
        "As with other boosting algorithms, the subsequent trees minimize the L2 loss with respect to the residuals of the predicted values and the targets.",
        "The final prediction, then, is the sum of the predictions of the trees estimated at each step, where f *(x) is the prediction of the ith tree.",
        "As alternative to the absolute grades in D, we can also imagine assembling a data set of relative judgments.",
        "In this case, assume we have a training data set Vy = where {(q,d), (q,d/),p)i encodes the preference, of a document, d, to a second document, d/, given query, q.",
        "Again, each query-document pair is represented by a set of features.",
        "Each preference judgment, p G {>-, -<}, indicates whether document d is preferred to document d/(d y d/) or not (d -< d/).",
        "Preference data is attractive for several reasons.",
        "First, editors can often more easily determine preference between documents than the absolute grade of single documents.",
        "Second, relevance grades can often vary between editors.",
        "Some editors may tend to overestimate relevance compared to another editor.",
        "As a result, judgments need to be rescaled for editor biases.",
        "Although preference data is not immune to intereditor inconsistency, absolute judgments introduce two potential sources of noise: determining a relevance ordering and determining a relevance grade.",
        "Third, even if grades can be accurately labeled, mapping those grades to real values is often done in a heuristic or ad hoc manner.",
        "Fourth, GBDTreg potentially wastes modeling effort on predicting the grade of a document as opposed to focusing on optimizing the rank order of documents, the real goal a search engine.",
        "Finally, preference data can often be mined from a production system using assumptions about user clicks.",
        "In order to support preference-based training data, (Zheng et al., 2007) proposed GBRank based on GBDTreg.",
        "The GBRank training algorithm begins by constructing an initial tree which predicts a constant score, c, for all instances.",
        "A pair is contradicting if the {(q,d), (q,d/), y) and prediction f (q,d) < f (q,d/).",
        "At each boosting stage, the algorithm constructs a set of contradicting pairs, Dontra.",
        "The GBRank algorithm then adjusts the response variables, f(q, d) and f (q,d/), so that f (q,d) > f (q,d/).",
        "Assume that (q,d) y (q,d/) and f (q,d) < f (q,d/).",
        "To correct the order, we modify the target values, where t > 0 is a margin parameter that we need to assign.",
        "In our experiments, we set r to 1.",
        "Note that if preferences are inferred from absolute grades, D, minimizing the L2 to 0 also minimizes the contradictions.",
        "Recall that we are also interested in using the information learned from one market, which we will call the source market, on a second market, which we will call the target market.",
        "To this end, the Trada algorithm adapts a GBDTreg model from the source market for the target market by using a small amount of target market absolute relevance judgments (Chen et al., 2008b).",
        "Let the Ds be the data in the source domain and Dt be the data in target domain.",
        "Assume we have trained a model using GBDTreg.",

        "Because we are discussing the root node, when we select a threshold b, Dt will be partitioned into two sets, D>b and D<b representing those instances whose feature xi has a value greater and lower than b.",

        "We would like to select a value for b which minimizes the L2 loss between y and f in Equation 5; equivalently, b can be selected to minimize the variance of y in each partition.",
        "In our implementation, we compute the L2 loss for all possible values of the feature vX and select the value which minimizes the loss.",

        "We have proposed a model for adapting retrieval models using preference data instead of absolute relevance grades.",

        "However, in real world systems, we often have access to sources of preference data beyond those resulting from editorial judgments.",
        "We demonstrated that Pairwise-Trada can exploit such data and boost performance significantly.",
        "In fact, if we omit editorial data altogether we see performance improvements over the baseline model.",
        "This suggests that, in principle, we can train a single, strong source model and improve it using target click data alone.",
        "Despite the fact that the modification we made is quite simple, we showed that modification is effective in practice.",
