        "They have distinctive features when compared to the traditional ones, such as newspaper articles.",
        "Blog language contains formal and informal expressions, and other elements, as repeated punctuation or emoticons (used to stress upon different text elements).",
        "With the growth in the content of the blogosphere, the quantity of subjective data of the Web is increasing exponentially (Cui et al., 2006).",
        "As it is being updated in real-time, this data becomes a source of timely information on many topics, exploitable by different applications.",
        "In order to properly manage the content of this subjective information, its processing must be automated.",
        "The NLP task, which deals with the classification of opinionated content is called Sentiment Analysis (SA).",

        "Research in opinion-related tasks gained importance in the past years.",
        "However, there are still many aspects that require analysis and improvement, especially for approaches that combine SA with other NLP tasks such as QA or automatic summarization.",
        "The TAC 2008 Opinion Pilot task and the subsequent research performed on the competition data have demonstrated that answering opinionated questions and summarizing subjective information are significantly different from the equivalent tasks in the same context, but dealing with factual data.",
        "This finding was confirmed by the recent work by (Kabadjov et al., 2009).",
        "The first motivation of our work is the need to detect and explore the challenges raised by opinion QA (OQA), as compared to factual QA.",
        "To this aim, we analyze the improvements that can be brought at the different steps of the OQA process: question treatment (identification of expected polarity - EPT, expected source - ES and expected target -ET-), opinion retrieval (at the level of one and three-sentences long snippets, using topic-related words or using paraphrases), opinion analysis (using topic detection and anaphora resolution).",
        "This preliminary research is motivated by the conclusions drawn by previous studies (Balahur et al., 2009).",
        "Our purpose is to verify if the inclusion of new elements and methods - source and target detection (using semantic role labeling (SRL)), topic detection (using Latent Semantic Analysis), paraphrasing and joint topic-sentiment analysis (classification of the opinion expressed only in sentences related to the topic), followed by anaphora resolution (using a system whose performance is not optimal), affects the results of the system and how.",
        "Our contribution to this respect is the identification of the challenges related to OQA compared to traditional QA.",
        "A further contribution consists in adding the appropriate methods, tools and resources to resolve the identified challenges.",
        "With the purpose of testing the effect of each tool, resource and technique, we carry out a separate and a global evaluation.",
        "An additional motivation of our work is the fact that although previous approaches showed that opinion questions have longer answers than factual ones, the research done in OQA so far has only considered a sentence-level approach.",
        "Another contribution this paper brings is the retrieval at 1 and 3-sentence level and the retrieval based on similarity to query paraphrases enriched with topic-related words).",
        "We believe retrieving longer text could cause additional problems such as redundancy, coreference and temporal expressions or the need to apply contextual information.",
        "Paraphrasing, on the other hand, had account for language variability in a more robust manner; however, the paraphrase collections that are available at the moment are known to be noisy.",
        "The following sections are structured as follows: Section 3 presents the related work in the field and the competitions organized for systems tackling the OQA task.",
        "In Section 4 we describe the corpora used for the experiments we carried out and the set of questions asked over each of them.",
        "Section 5 presents the experimental settings and the different system configurations we assessed.",
        "Section 6 shows the results of the evaluations, discusses the improvements and drops in performance using different configurations.",

        "In the fourth evaluation setting, we replaced the set of snippets retrieved using JIRS with the ones obtained by generating alternative queries using paraphrases, enriched with the topic words determined using LSA.",
        "We subsequently filtered these results based on their polarity (so that it corresponds to the EPT) and on the condition that the source and target of the opinion (identified through SRL using Semrol) correspond to the ES and ET.",
        "From the results obtained (Table 3 and Table 4), we can draw the following conclusions.",
        "Firstly, the hypothesis that OQA requires the retrieval of longer snippets was confirmed by the improved results, both in the case of EmotiBlog, as well as the TAC 2008 corpus.",
        "Secondly, opinion questions require the use of joint topic-sentiment analysis.",
        "As we can see from the results, the use of topic-related words when computing of the affect influences the results in a positive manner and joint topic-sentiment analysis is especially useful for the cases of questions asked on a monothematic corpus.",
        "Thirdly, another conclusion that we can draw is that target and source detection are highly relevant steps at the time of answer filtering, not only helping the more accurate retrieval of answers, but also at placing at the top of the retrieval the relevant results (as more relevant information is contained within these 7000 characters).",
        "The use of paraphrases at the retrieval stage was shown to produce a significant drop in results, which we explain by the noise introduced and the fact that more non-relevant answer candidates were introduced among the results.",
        "Nonetheless, as we can see from the overall relatively low improvement in the results, much remains to be done in order to appropriately tackle OQA.",
        "As seen in the results, there are still questions for which no answer is found (e.g. 18).",
        "This is due to the fact that the treatment of such questions requires the use of inference techniques that are presently unavailable (i.e. define terms such as \"improvement\", possibly as \"X better than Y\" , in which case opinion extraction from comparative sentences should be introduced in the model).",
        "The results obtained when using all the components for the 3-sentence long snippets significantly improve the results obtained by the best system participating in the TAC 2008 Opinion Pilot competition (determined using a paired t-test for statistical significance, with confidence level 5%).",
        "Finally, from the analysis of the errors, we could see that even though some tools are in theory useful and should produce higher improvements - such as SR - their performance in reality does not produce drastically higher results.",
        "The idea to use paraphrases for query expansion also proved to decrease the system performance.",
        "From preliminary results obtained using JavaRap for coreference resolution, we also noticed that the performance of the OQA lowered, although theoretically it should have improved."

        "In this paper, we presented and evaluated different methods and techniques with the objective of improving the task of QA in the context of opinion data.",
        "From the evaluations performed using different NLP resources and tools, we concluded that joint topic-sentiment analysis, as well as the target and source identification, are crucial for the correct performance of this task.",
        "We have also demonstrated that by retrieving longer answers, the results have improved.",
        "We tested, within a simple setting, the impact of using paraphrases in the context of opinion questions and saw that their use lowered the system results.",
        "Although such paraphrase collections include a lot of noise and have been shown to decrease system performance even in the case of factual questions, we believe that other types of paraphrasing methods should be investigated in the context of OQA.",
        "We thus showed that opinion QA requires the development of appropriate strategies at the different stages of the task (recognition of subjective questions, detection of subjective content of the questions, source and target identification, retrieval and classification of the candidate answer data).",
        "Due to the high level of complexity of subjective language, our future work will be focused on testing higher-performing tools for coreference resolution, other (opinion) paraphrases collections and paraphrasing methods and the employment of external knowledge sources that refine the semantics of queries.",
        "We also plan to include other SA methods and extend the semantic roles considered for ET and ES, with the purpose of checking if they improve or not the performance of the QA system.",
