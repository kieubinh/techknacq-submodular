        "Twitter is one of the most popular social network websites and has been growing at a very fast pace.",
        "The number of Twitter users reached an estimated 75 million by the end of 2009, up from approximately 5 million in the previous year.",
        "Through the twitter platform, users share either information or opinions about personalities, politicians, products, companies, events (Prentice and Huffman, 2008) etc.",
        "This has been attracting the attention of different communities interested in analyzing its content.",
        "Sentiment detection of tweets is one of the basic analysis utility functions needed by various applications over twitter data.",
        "Many systems and approaches have been implemented to automatically detect sentiment on texts (e.g., news articles, Web reviews and Web blogs) (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Glance et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "Most of these Junlan Feng approaches use the raw word representation (n-grams) as features to build a model for sentiment detection and perform this task over large pieces of texts.",
        "However, the main limitation of using these techniques for the Twitter context is messages posted on Twitter, so-called tweets, are very short.",
        "The maximum size of a tweet is 140 characters.",
        "In this paper, we propose a 2-step sentiment analysis classification method for Twitter, which first classifies messages as subjective and objective, and further distinguishes the subjective tweets as positive or negative.",
        "To reduce the labeling effort in creating these classifiers, instead of using manually annotated data to compose the training data, as regular supervised learning approaches, we leverage sources of noisy labels as our training data.",
        "These noisy labels were provided by a few sentiment detection websites over twitter data.",
        "To better utilize these sources, we verify the potential value of using and combining them, providing an analysis of the provided labels, examine different strategies of combining these sources in order to obtain the best outcome; and, propose a more robust feature set that captures a more abstract representation of tweets, composed by meta-information associated to words and specific characteristics of how tweets are written.",
        "By using it, we aim to handle better: the problem of lack of information on tweets, helping on the generalization process of the classification algorithms; and the noisy and biased labels provided by those websites.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we provide some context about messages on Twitter and about the websites used as label sources.",
        "We introduce the features used in the sentiment detection and also provide a deep analysis of the labels generated by those sources in Section 3.",
        "We examine different strategies of combining these sources and present an extensive experimental evaluation in Section 4.",
        "Finally, we discuss previous works related to ours in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6, where we outline directions and future work."

        "Tweets.",
        "The Twitter messages are called tweets.",
        "There are some particular features that can be used to compose a tweet (Figure 1 illustrates an example): \"RT\" is an acronym for retweet, which means the tweet was forwarded from a previous post; \"@twUser\" represents that this message is a reply to the user \"twUser\"; \"#obama\" is a tag provided by the user for this message, so-called hash-tag; and \"http://bit.ly/9K4n9p\" is a link to some external source.",
        "Tweets are limited to 140 characters.",
        "Due to this lack of information in terms of words present in a tweet, we explore some of the tweet features listed above to boost the sentiment detection, as we will show in detail in Section 3.",
        "Data Sources.",
        "We collected data from 3 different websites that provide almost real-time sentiment detection for tweets: Twendz, Twitter Sentiment and TweetFeel.",
        "To collect data, we issued a query containing a common stopword \"of\", as we are interested in collecting generic data, and retrieved tweets from these sites for three weeks, archiving the returned tweets along with their sentiment labels.",
        "Table 1 shows more details about these sources.",
        "Two of the websites provide 3-class detection: positive, negative and neutral and one of them just 2-class detection.",
        "One thing to note is our crawling process obtained a very different number of tweets from each website.",
        "This might be a result of differences among their sampling processes of Twitter stream or some kind of filtering process to output.",
        "For instance, a site may only present the tweets it has more confidence about their sentiment.",

        "The prior polarity is switched from positive to negative or vice-versa when a negative expression (as, e.g., \"don't\", \"never\") precedes the word.",
        "We obtained the prior subjectivity and polarity information from subjectivity lexicon of about 8,000 words used in (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "Although this is a very comprehensive list, slang and specific Web vocabulary are not present on it, e.g., words as \"yummy\" or \"ftw\".",

        "and (2) does combining them bring improvement in accuracy?",

        "â€¢ Labeler quality: if the labelers have low quality, combine them might not bring much improvement (Sheng et al., 2008).",
        "In our case, each source is treated as a labeler;",
        "â€¢ Number of labels provided by the labelers: if the labels are informative, i.e., the probability of them being correct is higher than 0.5, the more the number of labels, the higher is the performance of a classifier built from",
        "â€¢ Labeler bias: the labeled data provided by the labelers might be only a subset of the real data distribution.",
        "For instance, labelers might be interested in only providing labels that they are more confident about;",
        "â€¢ Different labeler bias: if labelers make similar mistakes, the combination of them might not bring much improvement.",
        "We provide an empirical analysis of these datasets to address these points.",
        "First, we measure the polarity detection quality of a source by calculating the probability p of a label from this source being correct.",
        "We use the data manually labeled for assessing the classifiers' performance (testing data, see Section 4) to obtain the correct labels of Data sources Quality Entropy",
        "Table 2: Quality of the labels and entropy of the tweets provided by each data source for the polarity detection.",
        "a data sample.",
        "Table 2 shows their values.",
        "We can conclude from these numbers that the 3 sources provide a reasonable quality data.",
        "This means that combining them might bring some improvement to the polarity detection instead of, for instance, using one of them in isolation.",
        "An aspect that is overlooked by quality is the bias of the data.",
        "For instance, by examining the data from TwitterFeel, we found out that only 4 positive words (\"awe-some\",\"rock\",\"love\" and \"beat\") cover 95% of their positive examples and only 6 negative words cover 96% of their negative set.",
        "Clearly, the data provided by this source is biased towards these words.",
        "This is probably the reason why this website outputs such fewer number of tweets compared to the other websites (see Table 1) as well as why its data has the smallest entropy among the sources (see Table 2).",
        "The quality of the data and its individual bias have certainly impact in the combination oflabels.",
        "However, there is other important aspect that one needs to consider: different bias between the labelers.",
        "For instance, if labelers a and b make similar decisions, we expect that combining their labels would not bring much improvement.",
        "Therefore, the diversity of labelers is a key element in combining them (Polikar, 2006).",
        "One way to measure this is by calculating the agreement between the labels produced by the labelers.",
        "We use the kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) to measure the degree of agreement between two sources.",
        "Table 3 presents the coefficients for each par of data source.",
        "All the coefficients are between 0.4 and 0.6, which represents a moderate agreement between the labelers (Landis and Koch, 1977).",
        "This means that in fact the sources provide different bias regarding polarity detection.",
        "Data sources Kappa",
        "Twendz/TwitterSentiment 0.58 TwitterSentiment/TweetFeel 0.58 Twendz/TweetFeel 0.44",
        "From this analysis we can conclude that combining the labels provided by the 3 sources can improve the performance of the polarity detection instead of using one of them in isolation because they provide diverse labels (moderate kappa agreement) of reasonable quality, although there is some issues related to bias of the labels provided by them.",
        "In our experimental evaluation in Section 4, we present results obtained by different strategies of combining these sources that confirm these findings.",
        "The features used in the polarity detection are the same ones used in the subjectivity detection.",
        "However, as one would expect the set of the most discriminative features is different between the two tasks.",
        "For subjectivity detection, the top-5 features in terms of information gain, based on the training data, are: negative polarity, positive polarity, verbs, good emoticons and upper case.",
        "For this task, the meta-information of the words (negative polarity, positive polarity and verbs) is more important than specific features from Twitter (good emoticons and upper case), whereas for the subjectivity detection, tweet syntax features have a higher relevance.",
        "This analysis show that prior polarity is very important for this task.",
        "However, one limitation of using it from a generic list is its values might not hold for some specific scenario.",
        "For instance, the polarity of the word \"spot\" is positive according to this list.",
        "However, looking at our training data almost half of the occurrences of this word appears in the positive set and the other half in the negative set.",
        "Thus, it is not correct to assume that prior polarity of \"spot\" is 1 for this particular data.",
        "This example illustrates our strategy to weight the prior polarities: for each word w with prior polarity defined by the list, we calculate the prior polarity of w, pol (w), based on the distribution of w in the positive and negative sets.",
        "Thus, polpos(w) = count(w, pos)/count(w) and polneg(w) = 1 â€“ polpos(w).",
        "We assume the polarity of a word is associated with the polarity of the sentence, which seems to be reasonable since we are dealing with very short messages.",
        "Although simple, this strategy is able to improve the polarity detection, as we show in Section 4."

        "Experimental results reported in this section are obtained using SVM.",
        "Table 4 shows the error rates obtained by the different subjectivity detection approaches.",
        "Twit-terSA achieved lower error rate than both Uni-grams and ReviewSA.",
        "As a result, these numbers confirm that features inferred from meta-information of words and specific syntax features from tweets are better indicators of the subjectivity than unigrams.",
        "Another advantage of our approach is since it uses only 20 features, the training and test times are much faster than using thousands of features like Unigrams.",
        "One of the reasons why TwitterSA obtained such a good performance was the process of data cleansing (see Section 3).",
        "The label quality provided by the sources for this task was very poor: 0.66 for Twendz and 0.68 for TwitterSentiment.",
        "By cleaning the data, the error decreased from 19.9, TwitterSA(no-cleaning), to 18.1, TwitterSA(cleaning).",
        "Regarding ReviewSA, its lower performance is expected since tweets are composed by single sentences and ReviewSA relies on the proximity between sentences to perform subjectivity detection.",
        "We also investigated the influence of the size of training data on classification performance.",
        "Figure 2 plots the error rates obtained by TwitterSA and Unigrams versus the number of training examples.",
        "The curve corresponding to TwitterSA showed that it achieved good performances even with a small training data set, and kept almost constant as more examples were added to the training data, whereas for Unigrams the error rate decreased.",
        "For instance, with only 2,000 tweets as training data, TwitterSA obtained 20% of error rate whereas Unigrams 34.5%.",

        "This implies that, in our scenario, the best way of combining the merits of the individual classifiers is by using a confidence score approach.",
        "Unigrams also achieved comparable performances.",
        "However, when reducing the size of the training data, the performance gap between Twit-terSA and Unigrams is much wider.",
        "Figure 3 shows the error rate of both approaches in function of the training size.",
        "Similar to subjectivity detection, the training size does not have much influence in the error rate for TwitterSA.",
        "However for Unigrams, it decreased significantly as the training size increased.",
        "For instance, for a training size with 2,000 tweets, the error rate for Unigrams was 46% versus 23.8% for our approach.",
        "As for subjectivity detection, this occurs because our features are in fact able to capture a more general representation of the tweets.",
        "Another advantage of TwitterSA over Uni-grams is that it produces more robust models.",
        "To illustrate this, we present the error rates of Uni-grams and TwitterSA where the training data is composed by data from each source in isolation.",
        "For the TweetFeel website, where data is very biased (see Section 3), Unigrams obtained an error rate of 44.5% whereas over a sample of the same size of the combined training data (Figure 3), it obtained an error rate of around 30%.",
        "Our approach also performed worse over this data than the general one, but still had a reasonable error rate, 25.1%.",
        "Regarding the Twendz website, which is the noisiest one (Section 3), Unigrams also obtained a poor performance comparing it against its performance over a sample of the general data with a same size (see Table 5 and Figure 3).",
        "Our approach, on the other hand, was not much influenced by the noise (22.9% on noisy data and around 20% on the sample of same size of the general data).",

        "There is a rich literature in the area of sentiment detection (see e.g., (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Go et al., 2009; Glance et al., 2005).",
        "Most of these approaches try to perform this task on large texts, as e.g., newspaper articles and movie reviews.",
        "Another common characteristic of some of them is the use of n-grams as features to create their models.",
        "For instance, Pang and Lee (Pang and Lee, 2004) explores the fact that sentences close in a text might share the same subjectivity to create a better subjectivity detector and, similar to (Pang et al., 2002), uses unigrams as features for the polarity detection.",
        "However, these approaches do not obtain a good performance on detecting sentiment on tweets, as we showed in Section 4, mainly because tweets are very short messages.",
        "In addition to that, since they use a raw word representation, they are more sensible to bias and noise, and need a much higher number of examples in the training data than our approach to obtain a reasonable performance.",
        "The Web sources used in this paper and some other websites provide sentiment detection for tweets.",
        "A great limitation to evaluate them is they do not make available how their classification was built.",
        "One exception is TwitterSentiment (Go et al., 2009), for instance, which considers tweets with good emoticons as positive examples and tweets with bad emoticons as negative examples for the training data, and builds a classifier using unigrams and bigrams as features.",
        "We showed in Section 4 that our approach works better than theirs for this problem, obtaining lower error rates."

        "We have presented an effective and robust sentiment detection approach for Twitter messages, which uses biased and noisy labels as input to build its models.",
        "This performance is due to the fact that: (1) our approach creates a more abstract representation of these messages, instead of using a raw word representation of them as some previous approaches; and (2) although noisy and biased, the data sources provide labels of reasonable quality and, since they have different bias, combining them also brought some benefits.",
        "The main limitation of our approach is the cases of sentences that contain antagonistic sentiments.",
        "As future work, we want to perform a more fine grained analysis of sentences in order to identify its main focus and then based the sentiment classification on it."
