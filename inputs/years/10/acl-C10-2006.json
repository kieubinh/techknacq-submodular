        "First launched in 2005, the Recognising Textual Inference Challenge (RTE) aims to assess in how far computer systems can emulate a human being in determining whether a short text fragment H referred to as the hypothesis, follows from or is contradicted by a text fragment T. In the RTE benchmarks, the hypothesis is a short constructed sentence whilst the text fragments are short passages of naturally occurring texts.",
        "As a result, the RTE challenge permits evaluating the capacity of NLP systems to handle local textual inference on real data, an enabling technology for any applications involving document interpretation.",
        "In this paper, we focus on entailments based on meaning entailing, syntactic transformations such as:",
        "(1) The man gives the woman the flowers that smell nice == The flowers which are given to the woman smell nice",
        "We start (Section 2) by motivating the approach.",
        "We argue that the proposed evaluation methodology (i) interestingly complements the RTE challenge in that it permits a modular, analytic evaluation of the ability of NLP systems to handle syntax-based, sentential inference and (ii) permits focused error mining and analysis .",
        "In Section 3, we go on to describe the benchmark construction process.",
        "Each item of the constructed benchmark associates two sentences with a truth value (true or false) indicating whether or not the second sentence can be understood to follow from the first.",
        "The construction of these benchmark items relies on the use of a grammar based surface realiser and we show how this permits automatically associating with each inference item, an entailment value (true or false) and a detailed syntactic annotation reflecting the syntactic constructs present in the two sentences constituting each benchmark item.",
        "In section 4, we use the benchmark to evaluate and compare three systems designed to recognise meaning preserving syntactic variations namely, a semantic role labeller, Johan Bos' Nutcracker RTE system (where the syntax/semantic interface is handled by a semantic construction module working on the output of combinatory categorial grammar parser) and the Afazio system, a hybrid system combining statistical parsing, symbolic semantic role labelling and sentential entailment detection using first order logic.",
        "We give the evaluation figures for each system.",
        "Additionally, we show how the detailed syntactic annotations automatically associated with each benchmark item by the surface realiser can be used to identify the most likely source of errors that is, the syntactic constructs that most frequently co-occur with en entailment recognition error."

      "text": [
        "Arguably focusing on meaning entailing syntactic transformations is very weak.",
        "Indeed, one of the key conclusions at the second RTE Challenge Workshop was that entailment modeling requires vast knowledge resources that correspond to different types of entailment reasoning e.g., ontological and lexical relationships, paraphrases and entailment rules, meaning entailing syntactic transformations and last but not least, world knowledge.",
        "Further, Manning (2006) has strongly argued against circumscribing the RTE data to certain forms of inference such as for instance, inferences based solely on linguistic knowledge.",
        "Finally, it is also often insisted that naturally occurring data should be favored over constructed data.",
        "While we agree that challenges such as the RTE challenge are useful in testing systems abilities to cope with real data, we believe there is also room for more focused evaluation setups.",
        "Focusing on syntax based entailments.",
        "As mentioned above, syntax based entailment is only one of the many inference types involved in determining textual entailment.",
        "Nevertheless, a manual analysis of the RTE1 data by (Vanderwende et al., 2005) indicates that 37% of the examples could be handled by considering syntax alone.",
        "Similarly, (Garoufi, 2007) shows that 37.5% of the RTE2 data does not involve deep reasoning and more specifically, that 33.8% of the RTE2 datain-volves syntactic or lexical knowledge only.",
        "Hence although the holistic, blackbox type of evaluation practiced in the RTE challenge is undeniably useful in assessing the ability of existing systems to handle local textual inference, a more analytic, modular kind of evaluation targeting syntax-based entailment reasoning is arguably also of interest.",
        "Another interesting feature of the SSI (syntax-based sentential entailment) task we propose is that it provides an alternative way of evaluating semantic role labelling (SRL) systems.",
        "Typically, the evaluation of SRL systems relies on a hand annotated corpus such as PropBank or the FrameNet corpus.",
        "The systems precision and recall are then computed w.r.t.",
        "this reference corpus.",
        "As has been repeatedly argued (Moll and Hutchinson, 2003; Galliers and Jones, 1993), intrinsic evaluations may be of very limited value.",
        "For semantically oriented tools such as SRL systems, it is important to also assess their results w.r.t.",
        "the task which they are meant support namely reasoning : Do the semantic representations built by SRL help in making the correct inferences ?",
        "Can they be used, for instance, to determine whether a given sentence answers a given question ?",
        "or whether the content of one sentence follow from that another ?",
        "As explained in (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), entailment recognition is a first, major step towards answering these questions.",
        "Accordingly, instead of comparing the representations produced by SRL systems against a gold standard, the evaluation scheme presented here, permits evaluating them w.r.t.",
        "their ability to capture syntax based sentential inference.",
        "It is worth adding that, although the present paper focuses on entailments strictly based on syntax, the proposed methodology should straightforwardly extend to further types of entailment such as in particular, entailments involving lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy, etc.)",
        "or entailments involving more complex semantic phenomena such as the interplay between different classes of complement taking verbs, polarity and author commitment discussed in (Nairn et al., 2006).",
        "This is because as we shall see in section 3, our approach is based on an extensive, hand written grammar of English integrating syntax and semantics.",
        "By modifying the grammar, the lexicon and/or the semantics, data of varying linguistic type and complexity can be produced and used for evaluation.",
        "Hand constructed vs. naturally occurring data.",
        "Although in the 90s, hand tailored testsuites such as (Lehmann et al., 1996; Cooper et al., 1995) were deemed useful for evaluating NLP systems, it is today generally assumed that, for evaluation purposes, naturally occurring data is best.",
        "We argue that constructed data can interestingly complement naturally occurring data.",
        "To start with, we agree with (Crouch et al., 2006; Cohen et al., 2008) that science generally benefits from combining laboratory and field studies and more specifically, that computational linguistics can benefit from evaluating systems on a combination of naturally occurring and constructed data.",
        "Moreover, constructed data need not be hand constructed.",
        "Interestingly, automating the production of this data can help provide better data annotation as well as better and better balanced data coverage than both hand constructed data and naturally occurring data.",
        "Indeed, as we shall show in section 4, the benchmark creation process presented here supports a detailed and fully automated annotation of the syntactic properties associated with each benchmark item.",
        "As shown in section 5, this in turn allows for detailed error mining making it possible to identify the most likely causes of system errors.",
        "Additionally, the proposed methodology permits controlling over such benchmark parameters as the size of the data set, the balance between true and false entailments, the correlation between word overlap and entailment value and/or the specific syntactic phenomena involved.",
        "This is in contrast with the RTE data collection process where \"the distribution of examples is arbitrary to a large extent, being determined by manual selection\" (Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "As has been repeatedly pointed out (Burchardt et al., 2007; Garoufi, 2007), the RTE datasets are poorly balanced w.r.t., both the frequency and the coverage of the various phenomena interacting with textual inference."

        "By using logical, rather than textual (i.e., human based) entailment, it is possible that some cases of syntax mediated textual entailments are not taken into account.",
        "However, intuitively, it seems reasonable to assume that for most of the entailments mediated by syntax alone, logical and textual entailments coincide.",

        "For this preprocessing, the suspicion of a tag pair t is defined as the ratio of t occurrences in unrecognised entailments and the total number of t occurrences in the corpus.",
        "To compensate for data sparseness, an additional expansion factor is used which depends on the frequency of an n-gram and approaches one for higher frequency.",
        "In this way, long n-grams that have low frequency are not favoured.",
        "The longer the n-gram is, the more frequent or the more suspicious it needs to be in order to be selected by the preprocessing step.",
        "We apply this extension to the SSI setting.",
        "We first extend the set of available tag pairs with tag set pairs such that the suspicion rate of these pairs is higher that the suspicion rate of each of the smaller tagset pairs that can be constructed from these sets.",
        "We then apply (Sagot and de La Clergerie, 2OO6)'s fix point algorithm to compute the suspicion rate of the resulting tag pairs and tag sets pairs.",

        "For false negatives, the first suspect indicates incorrect analyses for cases where an intransitive with canonical subject in H is matched by an intransitive with covert relative subject (e.g., Bill sees the woman give the flower to the man / the man gives the flower to the woman.).",

        "where an embedded verb with relative overt subject in T (sings) is matched in H by an embedded gerund.",
