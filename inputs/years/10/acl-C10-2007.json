        "Question Answering (QA) systems aim at providing precise answers to user questions.",
        "Most QA systems integrate a document retrieval component, which is in charge of retrieving the most relevant documents or passages for a given user question.",
        "Since document retrieval is performed in early stages of QA, it is of the uttermost importance that all relevant documents be retrieved, to limit the loss of relevant answers for further processing.",
        "However, document retrieval systems have to solve the lexical gap problem, whicharises from alternative ways of conveying the same piece of information in questions and answers.",
        "One of the solutions proposed to deal with this issue is query expansion (QE), which consists in extending user queries with related terms.",
        "This paper describes a new method for using lexical-semantic resources in query expansion with a focus on QA applications.",
        "While some research has been devoted to using explicit semantic relationships for QE, such as synonymy or hypernymy, with rather disappointing results (Voorhees, 1994), we focus on the usefulness of textual and unstructured dictionary definitions for question expansion.",
        "Definitions extracted from seven English lexical resources are first grouped to obtain definition clusters, which capture redundancies and sense mappings across resources.",
        "Expansion terms are extracted from these definition clusters using pseudo relevance feedback: we first retrieve the definition clusters which are most related to the user query, and then extract the most relevant terms from these definition clusters to expand the query.",
        "The contributions of this work are as follows: (i) we build definition clusters across seven different lexical resources for English, (ii) we thoroughly compare different question expansion methods using local and global feedback, and (iii) we address both the lexical gap and question ambiguity problems by integrating expansion and disambiguation in one and the same step.",
        "In the next section, we describe related work.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our method for acquiring definition clusters from seven English lexical resources.",
        "In Section 4, we detail query expansion methods.",
        "We present experimental results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."

        "Query expansion attempts to solve the vocabulary mismatch problem by adding new semantically related terms to the query.",
        "The goal is to increase recall by retrieving more relevant documents.",
        "Two types of query expansion methods are usually distinguished (Manning et al., 2008): global techniques, which do not take the results obtained for the original query into account, and local techniques, which expand the query based on an analysis of the documents returned.",
        "Local methods are also known as relevance feedback.",
        "A first type of global QE methods relies on external hand-crafted lexical-semantic resources such as WordNet.",
        "While expansion based on external resources is deemed more efficient than expansion relying on relevance feedback, it also has to tackle problems of semantic ambiguity, which explains why local analysis has been shown to be generally more effective than global analysis (Xu and Croft, 1996).",
        "However, recent work by Fang (2008) has demonstrated that global expansion based on WordNet and co-occurrence based resources can lead to performance improvement in an axiomatic model of information retrieval.",
        "Corpus-derived co-occurrence relationships are also exploited for query expansion.",
        "Qiu and Frei (1993) build a corpus-based similarity thesaurus using the method described in Schütze (1998) and expand a query with terms which are similar to the query concept based on the similarity thesaurus.",
        "Song and Bruza (2003) construct vector representations for terms from the target document collection using the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model (Lund and Burgess, 1996).",
        "The representations for all the terms in the query are then combined by a restricted form of vector addition.",
        "Finally, expansion terms are derived from this combined vector by information flow.",
        "Quasi-parallel monolingual corpora have been recently employed for query expansion, using statistical machine translation techniques.",
        "Expansion terms are acquired by training a translation model on question-answer pairs (Riezler et al., 2007) or query-snippets pairs (Riezler et al., 2008) and by extracting paraphrases from bilingual phrase tables (Riezler et al., 2007).",
        "The main difficulty of QE methods lies in selecting the most relevant expansion terms, especially when the query contains ambiguous words.",
        "Moreover, even if the original query is not ambiguous, it might become so after expansion.",
        "Recent attempts at integrating word sense disambiguation (WSD) in IR within the CLEF Robust WSD track have led to mixed results which show that in most cases WSD does not improve performance of monolingual and cross-lingual IR systems (Agirre et al., 2009).",
        "For query expansion based on translation models, ambiguity problems are solved by a language model trained on queries (Riezler et al., 2008), in order to select the most likely expansion terms in the context of a given query.",
        "In this article, we propose to integrate disambiguation and expansion in one and the same step by retrieving expansion terms from definition clusters acquired by combining several English lexical resources."

        "In contrast to explicit structural and semantic relations between word senses such as synonymy or hy-pernymy, definitions are readily available, even for less-resourced languages.",
        "Moreover, they can be used for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from word sense disambiguation (Lesk, 1986), to producing multiple-choice questions for educational applications (Kulkarni et al., 2007) or synonym discovery (Wang and Hirst, 2009).",
        "However, all resources differ in coverage and word sense granularity, which may lead to several shortcomings when using a single resource.",
        "For instance, the sense inventory in WordNet has been shown to be too fine-grained for efficient word sense disambiguation (Navigli, 2006; Snow et al., 2007).",
        "Moreover, gloss and definition-based measures of semantic relatedness which rely on the overlap between the definition of a target word and its distributional context (Lesk, 1986) or the definition of another concept (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) yield low results when the definitions provided are short and do not overlap sufficiently.",
