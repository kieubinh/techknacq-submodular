        "We propose in this paper a generic approach addressing both formal representation and concrete annotation of multimodal data, that relies on typed-feature structure (TFS), used as a description language on graphs.",
        "This approach is generic in the sense that it answers to different needs: it provides at the same time a formalism directly usable for corpus annotation and a description language making it possible to specify constraints that constitute the core of a multimodal grammar.",
        "In the first section, we motivate the use of TFS and present how to concretely implement them for multimodal annotation.",
        "We address in the second section one of the most problematic question for multimodal studies: how to represent and implement the relations between the different domains and modalities (a simple answer in terms of time alignment being not powerful enough).",

        "Linguistic annotation in general, and multimodal-ity in particular, requires high level annotation schemes making it possible to represent in an homogeneous way information coming from the different domains and modalities involved in human communication.",
        "The approach presented in this paper generalizes previous methods (in particular annotation graphs) thanks to two proposals: first in providing a way to index objects without strict order relation between nodes and second in specifying a precise and homogeneous representation of the objects and their relations.",
        "This approach has been developed into a formal scheme, typed feature structures, in which all the different domains can be represented, and making it possible to implement directly hypergraphs.",
        "TFS and hypergraphs are particularly well adapted for the specification of interaction constraints, describing interaction relations between modalities.",
        "Such constraints constitute the core of the definition of future multimodal grammars.",
        "From a practical point of view, the proposal described in this paper is currently under experimentation within the OTIM project (see (Blache, 2010)).",
        "An XML scheme has been automatically generated starting from TFS formal scheme.",
        "The existing multimodal annotations, created with ad hoc annotation schemes, are to their turn automatically translated following this format.",
        "We obtain then, for the first time, a large annotated multimodal corpus, using an XML schema based on a formal specification."
