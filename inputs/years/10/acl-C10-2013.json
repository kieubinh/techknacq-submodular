        "In this paper, we compare three statistical parsers that produce typed dependencies for French.",
        "A syntactic analysis in terms of typed grammatical relations, whether encoded as functional annotations in syntagmatic trees or in labeled dependency trees, appears to be useful for many NLP tasks including question answering, information extraction, and lexical acquisition tasks like collocation extraction.",
        "This usefulness holds particularly for French, a language for which bare syntagmatic trees are often syntactically underspeciied because of a rather free order of post-verbal complements/adjuncts and the possibility of subject inversion.",
        "Thus, the annotation scheme of the French Treebank (Abeillé and Barrier, 2004) makes use of flat syntagmatic trees without VP nodes, with no structural distinction between complements, adjuncts or post-verbal subjects, but with additional functional annotations on dependents of verbs.",
        "Parsing is commonly enhanced by using more abstract lexical information, in the form of morphological features (Tsarfaty, 2006), lemmas (Seddah et al., 2010), or various forms of clusters (see (Candito and Seddah, 2010) for references).",
        "In this paper, we explore the integration of morphological features, lemmas, and linear context clusters.",
        "Typed dependencies can be derived using many different parsing architectures.",
        "As far as statistical approaches are concerned, the dominant paradigm for English has been to use constituency-based parsers, the output of which can be converted to typed dependencies using well-proven conversion procedures, as in the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "In recent years, it has also become popular to use statistical dependency parsers, which are trained directly on labeled dependency trees and output such trees directly, such as MSTParser (McDonald, 2006) and MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006).",
        "Dependency parsing has been applied to a fairly broad range of languages, especially in the CoNLL shared tasks in 2006 and 2007 (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "We present a comparison of three statistical parsing architectures that output typed dependencies for French: one constituency-based architecture featuring the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006), and two dependency-based systems using radically different parsing methods, MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2006) and MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006).",
        "These three systems are compared both in terms of parsing accuracy and parsing times, in realistic settings that only use predicted information.",
        "By using freely available software packages that implement language-independent approaches and applying them to a language different from English, we also hope to shed some light on the capacity of different methods to cope with the challenges posed by different languages.",
        "Comparative evaluation of constituency-based and dependency-based parsers with respect to labeled accuracy is rare, despite the fact that parser evaluation on typed dependencies has been advocated for a long time (Lin, 1995; Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "Early work on statistical dependency parsing often compared constituency-based and dependency-based methods with respect to their unlabeled accuracy (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003), but comparison of different approaches with respect to labeled accuracy is more recent.",
        "Cer et al.",
        "(2010) present a thorough analysis of the best trade-off between speed and accuracy in deriving Stanford typed dependencies for English (de Marneffe et al., 2006), comparing a number of constituency-based and dependency-based parsers on data from the Wall Street Journal.",
        "They conclude that the highest accuracy is obtained using constituency-based parsers, although some of the dependency-based parsers are more eficient.",
        "For German, the 2008 ACL workshop on parsing German (Kübler, 2008) featured a shared task with two different tracks, one for constituency-based parsing and one for dependency-based parsing.",
        "Both tracks had their own evaluation metrics, but the accuracy with which parsers identiied subjects, direct objects and indirect objects was compared across the two tracks, and the results in this case showed an advantage for dependency-based parsing.",
        "In this paper, we contribute results for a third language, French, by benchmarking both constituency-based and dependency-based methods for deriving typed dependencies.",
        "In addition, we investigate the usefulness of morphological features, lemmas and word clusters for each of the different parsing architectures.",

        "The remaining un-labeled dependencies are labeled using heuristics (for dependents of non-verbal heads).",

        "The choice to include two different dependency parsers but only one constituency-based parser is motivated by the study of Seddah et al.",
        "(2009), where a number of constituency-based statistical parsers were evaluated on French, including Dan Bikel's implementation of the Collins parser (Bikel, 2002) and the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000).",
        "The evaluation showed that the Berkeley parser had signiicantly better performance for French than the other parsers, whether measured using a parseval-style labeled bracketing F-score or a CoNLL-style unlabeled attachment score.",
        "Contrary to most of the other parsers in that study, the Berkeley parser has the advantage of a strict separation of parsing model and linguistic constraints: linguistic information is encoded in the treebank only, except for a language-dependent sufix list used for handling unknown words.",
        "In this study, we compare the Berkeley parser to MSTParser and MaltParser, which have the same separation of parsing model and linguistic representation, but which are trained directly on labeled dependency trees.",
        "The two dependency parsers use radically different parsing approaches but have achieved very similar performance for a wide range of languages (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).",
        "We describe below the three architectures in more detail.",
        "The Berkeley parser is a freely available implementation of the statistical training and parsing algorithms described in (Petrov et al., 2006) and (Petrov and Klein, 2007).",
        "It exploits the fact that PCFG learning can be improved by splitting symbols according to structural and/or lexical properties (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "Following Mat-suzaki et al.",
        "(2005), the Berkeley learning algorithm uses EM to estimate probabilities on symbols that are automatically augmented with latent annotations, a process that can be viewed as symbol splitting.",
        "Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) proposed to score the splits in order to retain only the most beneicial ones, and keep the grammar size manageable: the splits that induce the smallest losses in the likelihood of the treebank are merged back.",
        "The algorithm starts with a very general treebank-induced binarized PCFG, with order h horizontal markovisation.",
        "created, where at each level a symbol appears without track of its original siblings.",
        "Then the Berkeley algorithm performs split/merge/smooth cycles that iteratively reine the binarized grammar: it adds two latent annotations on each symbol, learns probabilities for the reined grammar, merges back 50% of the splits, and smoothes the inal probabilities to prevent overitting.",
        "All our experiments are run using BerkeleyParser 1.0, modified for handling",
        "French unknown words by Crabbé and Candito (2008), with otherwise default settings (order 0 horizontal markovisation, order 1 vertical marko-visation, 5 split/merge cycles).",
        "The Berkeley parser could in principle be trained on functionally annotated phrase-structure trees (as shown in the left half of igure 1), but Crabbé and Candito (2008) have shown that this leads to very low performance, because the splitting of symbols according to grammatical functions renders the data too sparse.",
        "Therefore, the Berkeley parser was trained on Ftb-uc without functional annotation.",
        "Labeled dependency trees were then derived from the phrase-structure trees output by the parser in two steps: (1) function labels are assigned to phrase structure nodes that have functional annotation in the Ftb scheme; and (2) dependency trees are produced using the same procedure used to produce the pseudo-gold dependency treebank from the Ftb (cf.",
        "Section 2).",
        "The functional labeling relies on the Maximum Entropy labeler described in Candito et al.",
        "(2010), which encodes the problem of functional labeling as a multiclass classiication problem.",
        "Specifically, each class is of the eight grammatical functions used in Ftb, and each head-dependent pair is treated as an independent event.",
        "The feature set used in the labeler attempt to capture bilexi-cal dependencies between the head and the dependent (using stemmed word forms, parts of speech, etc.)",
        "as well as more global sentence properties like mood, voice and inversion.",
        "MSTParser is a freely available implementation of the parsing models described in McDonald (2006).",
        "These models are often described as graph-based because they reduce the problem of parsing a sentence to the problem of inding a directed maximum spanning tree in a dense graph representation of the sentence.",
        "Graph-based parsers typically use global training algorithms, where the goal is to learn to score correct trees higher than incorrect trees.",
        "At parsing time a global search is run to ind the highest scoring dependency tree.",
        "However, unrestricted global inference for graph-based dependency parsing is NP-hard, and graph-based parsers like MST-",
        "Parser therefore limit the scope of their features to a small number of adjacent arcs (usually two) and/or resort to approximate inference (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).",
        "For our experiments, we use MSTParser 0.4.3b with 1-best projective decoding, using the algorithm of Eisner (1996), and second order features.",
        "The labeling of dependencies is performed as a separate sequence classification step, following McDonald et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "To provide part-of-speech tags to MSTParser, we use the MElt tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009), a Maximum Entropy Markov Model tagger enriched with information from a large-scale dictionary.",
        "The tagger was trained on the training set to provide POS tags for the dev and test sets, and we used 10-way jackknifing to generate tags for the training set.",
        "MaltParser is a freely available implementation of the parsing models described in (Nivre, 2006) and (Nivre, 2008).",
        "These models are often characterized as transition-based, because they reduce the problem of parsing a sentence to the problem of inding an optimal path through an abstract transition system, or state machine.",
        "This is sometimes equated with shift-reduce parsing, but in fact includes a much broader range of transition systems (Nivre, 2008).",
        "Transition-based parsers learn models that predict the next state given the current state of the system, including features over the history of parsing decisions and the input sentence.",
        "At parsing time, the parser starts in an initial state and greedily moves to subsequent states - based on the predictions of the model - until a terminal state is reached.",
        "The greedy, deterministic parsing strategy results in highly eficient parsing, with run-times often linear in sentence length, and also facilitates the use of arbitrary non-local features, since the partially built dependency tree is ixed in any given state.",
        "However, greedy inference can also lead to error propagation if early predictions place the parser in incorrect states.",
        "For the experiments in this paper, we use MaltParser 1.3.1 with the arc-eager algorithm (Nivre, 2008) and use linear classifiers from the LIBLINEAR package (Fan et al., 2008) to predict the next state transitions.",

        "Motivations for these features are rooted in the fact that French has a rather rich inflectional morphology.",

        "This is especially true given that the 29 tags used by the MElt tagger are rather coarse-grained.",

        "Candito and Crabbé (2009) used the L'Est Républicain corpus, a 125 million word journalistic corpus.",
        "To reduce lexical data sparseness caused by inlection, they ran a lexicon-based stemming process on the corpus that removes inlection marks without adding or removing lexical ambiguity.",
        "The Brown algorithm was then used to compute 1000 clusters of stemmed forms, limited to forms that appeared at least 20 times.",

        "Although Berkeley has the best unlabeled attachment overall, it also has the worst labeled attachment, and we found that this is largely due to the functional role labeler having trouble assigning the correct label when the dependent is a preposition or a clitic.",
        "For errors in attachment as a function of word distance, we find that precision and recall on dependencies of length > 2 tend to degrade faster for MaltParser than for MSTParser and Berkeley, with Berkeley being the most robust for dependencies of length > 6.",
        "In addition, Berkeley is best at finding the correct root of sentences, while MaltParser often predicts more than one root for a given sentence.",
        "The behavior of MSTParser and MaltParser in this respect is consistent with the results of McDonald and Nivre (2007).",

        "We have evaluated three statistical parsing architectures for deriving typed dependencies for French.",
        "The best result obtained is a labeled attachment score of 88.2%, which is roughly on a par with the best performance reported by Cer et al.",
        "(2010) for parsing English to Stanford dependencies.",
        "Note two important differences between their results and ours: First, the Stanford dependencies are in a way deeper than the surface dependencies tested in our work.",
        "Secondly, we find that for French there is no consistent trend favoring either constituency-based or dependency-based methods, since they achieve comparable results both for labeled and unlabeled dependencies.",
        "Indeed, the differences between parsing architectures are generally small.",
        "The best performance is achieved using MSTParser, enhanced with predicted part-of-speech tags, lemmas, morphological features, and unsupervised clusters of word forms.",
        "MaltParser achieves slightly lower labeled accuracy, but is probably the best option if speed is crucial.",
        "The Berkeley parser has high accuracy for unlabeled dependencies, but the current labeling method does not achieve a comparably high labeled accuracy.",
        "Examining the use of lexical features, we find that predicted lemmas are useful in all three architectures, while morphological features have a marginal effect on the two dependency parsers (they are not used by the Berkeley parser).",
        "Unsupervised word clusters, finally, give a significant improvement for the Berkeley parser, but have a rather small effect for the dependency parsers.",
        "Other results for statistical dependency parsing of French include the pilot study of Candito et al.",
        "(2010), and the work ofSchluter and van Genabith (2009), which resulted in an LFG statistical French parser.",
        "However, the latter's results are obtained on a modified subset of the Ftb, and are expressed in terms of F-score on LFG f-structure features, which are not comparable to our attachment scores.",
        "There also exist a number of grammar-based parsers, evaluated on gold test sets annotated with chunks and dependencies (Paroubek et al., 2005; de la Clergerie et al., 2008).",
        "Their annotation scheme is different from that of the Ftb, but we plan to evaluate the statistical parsers on the same data in order to compare the performance of grammar-based and statistical approaches."
