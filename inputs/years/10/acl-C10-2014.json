        "Many state-of-the-art parsers work with lexical-ized parsing models that utilize the information and statistics of word tokens (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1999, 2003; Charniak, 2000).",
        "The performance of lexicalized models is susceptible to vocabulary variation as lexical statistics is often corpus-specific (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Gildea, 2001).",
        "As parsers are typically evaluated using the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), which is based on financial news, the problems of lexicalized parsing could easily be overlooked.",
        "Unlexicalized models, on the other hand, are less sensitive to lexical variation and are more portable across domains.",
        "Though the performance of unlexicalized models was believed not to exceed that of lexicalized models (Klein &",
        "Manning, 2003), Petrov & Klein (2007) show that unlexicalized parsers can match lexicalized parsers in performance using the grammar rule splitting technique.",
        "Given the practical advantages and the latest development, unlexicalized parsing deserves further scrutiny.",
        "A profitable direction of research on unlexi-calized parsing is to investigate novel parsing features.",
        "This paper examines a set of what we call tree topological (TT) features, including phrase span, phrase height, tree skewness, etc.",
        "This study is motivated by the fact that conventional parsers rarely consider the shape of subtrees dominated by these nodes and rely primarily on matching tags.",
        "As a result, an NP with a complicated structure is treated the same as an NP that dominates only one word.",
        "However, our study shows that TT features are useful predictors of phrase boundaries, a critical ambiguity resolution issue.",
        "TT features have two more advantages.",
        "First, TT features capture linguistic properties, such as branching and grammatical \"heaviness\", across different syntactic structures.",
        "Second, they are easily computable without the need for extra language resources.",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews the features commonly used in parsing.",
        "Section 3 provides the details of TT features in the unlexicalized parser.",

        "Classifiers can typically capitalize on a large set of features in decision making.",
        "Magerman (1995), Ratnaparkh (1999) and Charniak (2000) used classifiers to model dependencies between word pairs.",
        "They popularized the use word tokens as attributes in lexicalized parsing.",
        "Collins (1999, 2003) also integrated information like head word and distance from head into the statistical model to enhance probabilistic chart parsing.",
        "Since then, word tokens, head words and their statistical derivatives have become standard features in many parsers.",
        "Word token information is also fundamental to dependency parsing (Kübler et al., 2009) because dependency grammar is rooted in the idea that the head and the dependent word are related by different dependency relations.",
        "Semantic-based: Some efforts have also been made to consider semantic features, such as sense tags, in parsing.",
        "Words are first tagged with semantic classes, often using WordNet-based resources.",
        "The lexical semantic class can be instructive to the selection of the correct parse from a set of candidate structures.",
        "It has been reported that the lexical semantics of words is effective in resolving structural ambiguity, especially PP-attachment (Black et al., 1992; Stetina & Nagao, 1997; Agirre et al., 2008).",
        "Nevertheless, the use of semantic features has still been relatively rare.",
        "They incur overheads in acquiring semantic language resources, such as sense-tagged corpora and WordNet databases.",
        "Semantic-based parsing also requires accurate sense-tagging.",
        "Since substantial gain from tag features is unlikely in the near future and deriving semantic features is often a tremendous task, there is a pressing need to seek for new features, particularly in unlexicalized parsing.",
        "In this section, a review of the linguistic motivation behind the TT features is provided.",
        "Grammatical Weight: Apart from syntactic categories, linguists have long observed that the number of words (often referred to as \"weight\" or \"heaviness\") in a phrase can affect syntactic processing of sentences (Quirk et al., 1985; Wa-sow, 1997; Rosenbach, 2005).",
        "It corresponds roughly to the span feature described in Section 3.2.",
        "The effect of grammatical weight often manifests in word order variation.",

        "Tree Topology: CFG-based parsing approach hides the structural properties of the dominated subtree from the associated syntactic tag.",
        "Structural topology, or tree shape, however, can be useful in guiding the parser to group tags into phrases.",
        "Structures significantly deviating from left/right branching, e.g. center embedding, are much more difficult to process and rare in production (Gibson, 1998).",
        "Another example is the resolution of scope ambiguity in coordinate structures (CSs).",
        "CSs are common but notoriously difficult to parse due to scope ambiguity when the conjuncts are complex (Collins, 1999; Kübler et al., 2009).",
        "One good cue to the problem is that humans prefer CSs with parallel internal syntactic structures (Frazier et al., 2000).",
        "In a corpus-based study, Dubey et al.",
        "(2008) show that structural repetition across conjuncts is significantly more frequent.",

        "As in other similar approaches (Abney 1991; Ramshaw & Marcus, 1995; Sang, 2001; Sagae & Lavie, 2005), the first and the foremost problem that has to be resolved is to identify the boundary points of phrases, without any explicit grammar rules.",
        "Here we adopt the ensemble learning technique to unveil boundary points, or chunking points hereafter.",
        "Two heterogeneous and mutually independent attribute feature sets are introduced in Section 3.2 and 3.3.",
        "Our parser has two modules, namely, a chunker and a phrase recognizer.",

        "In the chunker, we explore a new approach that aims at identifying chunk boundaries.",
        "Assume that the input of the chunker is a tag sequence <x0 ... xn ... xm> where 0 < n < m. Let yn be the point of focus between two consecutive tags xn and xn+1.",
        "The chunker classifies all focus points as either a chunking point or a merging point at the relevant level.",

        "In addition, we adopt the ensemble technique to combine two sets of heterogeneous features.",
        "The method yields a much more accurate predictive power (Dietterich, 2000).",

        "Node Coordinates (NCs): NCs include the level of focus (LF) and the relative position (RP) of the target subtree.",
        "The level of focus is defined as the total number of levels under the target node, with the terminal level inclusive while the RP indicates the linear position of the target node in that level.",
        "As in Figure 1, the LF for subtree A and B are the same; however, the RP for subtree A is smaller than that for subtree B.",
        "Span Ratio (SR): The SR is defined as the total number of terminal nodes spanned under the target node and is divided by the length of the sentence.",
        "In Figure 1, the span ratio for the target node VP at subtree B is 5/12.",
        "This ratio illustrates not only how many terminal nodes are covered by the target node, but also how far the target node is from the root S.",

        "Skewness Measure (SM): The SM estimates the degree to which the subtree leans towards either left or right.",
        "In this research, the SM of a subtree is evaluated by the distribution of the length of the paths connecting the target node and each terminal node it dominates.",
        "The length of a path from a target node V to a terminal node T is the number of edges between V and T. For a tree with n terminal nodes, there are n paths.",
        "A pivot is defined as the [n/2]th terminal node when n is odd and between [n/2]th and [(n+1)/2]th terminal nodes if n is even, where [ ] is a ceiling function.",
        "The SM is defined as where xi is the length of the i-th path pointing to the i-th terminal node, x and a are the average and standard deviation of the length of all paths at that level of focus (LF).",
        "pi is the distance measured from the i-th terminal node to the pivot.",
        "The distance is positive if the terminal node is to the left of the pivot, zero if it is right at the pivot, and negative if the terminal node is to the right of the pivot.",
        "Obviously, if the lengths of all paths are the same in the tree, the numerator of Eqn (1) will be crossed out and the SM returns to zero.",
        "The pivot also provides an axis of vertical flipping where the SM still holds.",
        "The farther the terminal node from the pivot, the longer the distance.",
        "The distances p provide the moment factors to quantify the skewness of trees.",
        "For illustration, let us consider subtree B with the target node VP at level of focus (LF) = 4 in Figure 1.",
        "Since there are five terminal nodes, the pivot is at the third node VB.",
        "The lengths of the paths xi from left to right in the subtree are 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 and the moment factors pi for the paths are 2, 1, 0, -1, -2.",
        "Assuming that x and a for all the trees in the Treebank at level 4 are, say, 2.9 and 1.2 respectively, then SM = -3.55.",
        "It implies that subtree B under the target node VP has a strong right branching tendency, even though it has a very uniform branching factor which is usually defined as the number of children at each node.",
        "In our parser, to determine whether the two target nodes at level 4, i.e., NP and VP, should be merged to form a S at level 5 or not, an attribute vector with TT features for both NP and VP are devised as a training case.",
        "The corresponding target attribute is a binary value, i.e., chunking vs. merging.",
        "In addition, a set of if-merged attributes are introduced.",
        "For example, the attribute SM-if-merged indicates the changes of the SM if both target nodes are merged.",

        "In this research, to capture the colligation without word tokens, a sliding window of 6 POS tags at the neighborhood of the focus point yn is defined as our first set of context attributes.",

        "Empirically speaking, ensembles methods deliver highly accurate classifiers by combining less accurate ones.",
        "They tend to yield better results than a single classifier in those situations when different classifiers have different error characteristics and their errors can compensate each other.",
        "Two questions need to be addressed when building and using an ensemble that integrates the predictions of several classifiers.",
        "First, what data are used to train the classifiers so that the errors made by one classifier could be remedied by the other?",
        "Second, how are the individual classifiers fused or integrated to produce a final ensemble prediction?",
        "As shown in the last two sections, we address the first question by introducing two heterogeneous and mutually independent attribute feature sets, namely the tree topological (TT) features and information-theoretic (IT) features.",
        "Instead of training all the features to form a single giant classifier, we produce two distinct, sometimes diversified, training sets of data to form two separate moderate classifiers, in the hope that they will produce a highly accurate prediction.",
        "The second question is addressed by employing the boosting algorithm.",
        "Boosting is an effective method that produces a very accurate prediction rule by combining rough and moderately inaccurate rules of thumb (Schapire & Singer, 2000).",
        "It generates the classifiers in an iterative way.",
        "At the early beginning, an initial base classifier using a set of training data with equal weight is first constructed.",
        "When the prediction of the base classifier differs from the expected outcome, the weight of the poorly predicted data is increased to an extent based on their misclassification rate on the preceding classifiers.",
        "As a result, the learning of the subsequent classifier will focus on learning the training data that are misclassified, or poorly predicted.",
        "This process continues until a specified number of iterations is reached or a predefined termination condition is met.",
        "The ensemble prediction is also a weighted voting process, where the weight of a classifier is based on its errors over the training data used to generate it.",
