        "With the English 50 tag set with 500k words, we experiment with mapping the English 50 tag set result to the 17 tag set, we see that in Figure 4, 16 (of 50) states mapped to the N tag, accounting for 37% of the words in the dataset.",

        "Note: the percentage of iterations is used here because each algorithms converge at a different number of iterations, thus the progress is scaled accordingly.",
        "The greedy 1-to-1 accuracy actually fluctuates through the run.",
        "VB has an interesting dip at around 80% of its iteration before climbing to its max (not showing in the graph).",
        "All the Gibbs sampling variations follow a relatively steady hill climb before converging (only GS(c,w) is shown in Figure 5).",
        "EM is particularly interesting; Looking at the initial 15% of the algorithm's run, we can see that EM climbs to a \"local\" max very quickly before dropping and then slowly improving in its accuracy.",
        "The greedy 1-to-1 accuracy in the initial top is actually higher than the final convergence value in most runs.",
        "This initial peak in value following by a drop and then a slow hill climb in EM for Chinese POS tagging is consistent with the finding in (Johnson, 2007) for English POS tagging.",
        "We have only scratched the surface of the research in unsupervised techniques in Chinese NLP.",
        "We have established a baseline of EM, VB and GS against the CTB 5.0.",
        "The experiment shows that for both Chinese and English, GS(c,w) produces the best result.",
        "We have also found that Chinese performs rather poorly in the 1-to-1 accuracy when comparing against English in the same data size.",
        "We find that in many-to-1 mapping, we have a disproportionate large number of states mapping to individual POS tags comparing to the gold distribution and also in comparison to English against its gold distribution.",

        "We can also perform these analyses on VB and GS and observe the changes of output tags by starting from the Gold Standard distribution in EM and VB, and gold standard tags in GS.",
