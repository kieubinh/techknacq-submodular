        "A paraphrase generator is a program which, given a source sentence, produces a new sentence with almost the same meaning.",
        "The modification place is not imposed but the paraphrase has to differ from the original sentence.",
        "Paraphrase generation is useful in applications where it is needed to choose between different forms to keep the most fit.",
        "For instance, automatic summary can be seen as a particular paraphrasing task (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) by selecting the shortest paraphrase.",
        "They can help human writers by proposing alternatives and having them choose the most appropriate (Max and Zock, 2008).",
        "Paraphrases can also be used to improve natural language processing (nlp) systems.",
        "In this direction, (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) tried to improve machine translations by enlarging the coverage of patterns that can be translated.",
        "In the same way, most nlp systems like information retrieval (Sekine, 2005) or questionanswering (Duclaye et al., 2003), based on pattern recognition, can be improved by a paraphrase generator.",
        "Most of these applications need a n-best set of solutions in order to rerank them according to a task-specific criterion.",
        "In order to produce the paraphrases, a promising approach is to see the paraphrase generation problem as a statistical translation problem.",
        "In that approach, the target language becomes the same as the source language (Quirk et al., 2004; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Max and Zock, 2008).",
        "The first difficulty of this approach is the need of a paraphrase table.",
        "A paraphrase table is a monolingual version of a translation table in the statistical machine translation (smt) field.",
        "In this field, the difficulty is basically overcome by using huge aligned bilingual corpora like the Eu-roparl (Koehn, 2005) corpus.",
        "In the paraphrase generation field, one needs a huge aligned monolingual corpus to build a paraphrase table.",
        "The low availability of such monolingual corpora nurtures researches in order to find heuristics to produce them (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004).",
        "On the other hand, an interesting method proposed by (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) tries to make a paraphrase table using a translation table learned on bilingual corpora.",
        "The method uses a well-known heuristic (Lepage and Denoual, 2005) which says that if two sentences have the same translation, then they should be paraphrases of each others.",
        "Another aspect, less studied, is the generation process of paraphrases, i.e. the decoding process in smt.",
        "This process is subject to combinatorial explosions.",
        "Heuristics are then frequently used to drive the exploration process in the a priori intractable high dimensional spaces.",
        "On the one hand, these heuristics are used to build a paraphrase step by step according to the paraphrase table.",
        "On the other hand, they try to evaluate the relevance of a step according to the global paraphrase generation model.",
        "The SMT model score is related to the path followed to generate a paraphrase.",
        "Because of the step-by-step computation, different ways can produce the same paraphrase, but with different scores.",
        "Amongst these scores, the best one is the true score of a paraphrase according to the SMT model.",
        "Most paraphrase generators use some standard SMT decoding algorithms (Quirk et al., 2004) or some off-the-shelf decoding tools like MOSES.",
        "The goal of these decoders is to find the best path in the lattice produced by the paraphrase table.",
        "This is basically achieved by using dynamic programming - especially the Viterbi algorithm - and beam searching (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The best paraphrase proposed by these programs is known not to be the optimal paraphrase.",
        "One can even question if the score returned is the true score.",
        "We first show in Section 2 that in the particular domain of statistical paraphrase generation, one can compute true a posteriori scores of generated paraphrases.",
        "We then explore some applications of the true score algorithm in the paraphrase generation field.",
        "In Section 3, we show that scores returned by smt decoders are not always true scores and they plague the ranking of output n-best solutions.",
        "In Section 4, we show that the true score can give a major boost for holistic paraphrases generators which do not rely on decoding approaches."

        "In (Chevelu et al., 2009), both systems were rated similar by a subjective evaluation.",
        "One could question the relevance of small score differences and why the best paraphrase should be selected instead of the hundred next ones.",
        "Given the current state of the art, the next step to improve paraphrase generation does not lie in score optimisation but in refining the model and its components: the language model and the paraphrase table.",
        "Human based evaluations reveal that the current most important issue of paraphrase generation lies in the syntax (Chevelu et al., 2009).",
        "It seems difficult to assess the syntax of a potential paraphrase while not considering it as a whole, which is impossible with a local scoring function inherent to the smt decoding paradigm.",
        "Holistic paraphrase generators have now reached a level of performance comparable to smt decoders, without suffering from their limitations.",
        "They are paving the way for experiments with more complex semantic and linguistic models to improve paraphrase generation."
