        "In this paper, we present an efficient machine learning based method for automated lexical acquisition (LA) which improves the performance of large-scale computational grammars on reallife tasks.",
        "Our approach has three main advantages which distinguish it from other methods applied to the same task.",
        "First, it enables the acquisition of the whole paradigm of a given unknown word while other approaches are only concerned with the particular word form encountered in the data subject to LA.",
        "Second, we analyse different contexts which the unknown word occurs in.",
        "Third, the analysis of these contexts is provided by a fullblown syntactic parser and the grammar we aim to improve which gives the grammar the opportunity to participate directly in the LA process.",
        "Our method achieves an F-measure of 84.6% on unknown words in experiments with the wide-coverage Alpino grammar (van Noord, 2006) of Dutch.",
        "The integration of this method in the parser leads to a 4.2% error reduction in terms of labelled dependencies.",
        "To predict a lexical entry for a given unknown word, we take into account two factors-its morphology and the syntactic constraints imposed by its context.",
        "As for the former, the acquisition of the whole paradigm provides us with a valuable source of morphological information.",
        "If we were to deal with only one form of the unknown word, this information would not be accessible.",
        "Further, looking at different contexts of the unknown word gives us the possibility to work with linguistically diverse data and to incorporate more syntactic information into the LA process.",
        "Cases where this is particularly important include morphologically ambiguous words and verbs which subcategorize for various types of syntactic arguments.",
        "We also consider contexts of the other members of the paradigm of the unknown word in order to increase the amount of linguistic data our method has access to.",
        "Finally, the usage of a full-blown syntactic parser and the grammar we want to acquire lexical entries for has two advantages.",
        "First, LA can benefit from the high-quality analyses such a parser produces and the elaborate syntactic information they provide.",
        "Second, this information comes directly from the grammar, thus allowing the LA process to make predictions based on what the grammar considers to be best suited for it.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the basic steps in our LA algorithm.",
        "Section 3 presents initial experiments conducted with Alpino and shows that the main problems our LA method encounters are the acquisition of morphologically ambiguous words, the learning of the proper subcate-gorization frames for verbs and the acquisition of particular types of adjectives.",
        "In Section 4 we make extensive use of the paradigms of the unknown words to develop specific solutions for these problems.",
        "Section 5 describes experiments with our LA method applied to a set of real unknown words.",
        "Section 6 provides a comparison between our approach and work previously done on LA.",
        "This section also discusses the application of our method to other systems and languages."

        "The Alpino wide-coverage dependency parser is based on a large stochastic attribute value grammar.",
        "The grammar takes a 'constructional' approach, with rich lexical representations stored in the lexicon and a large number of detailed, construction specific rules (about 800).",
        "Currently, the lexicon contains about 100K lexical entries and a list of about 200K named entities.",
        "Each word is assigned one or more lexical types.",
        "For example, the verb amuseert (to amuse) is assigned two lexical types verb(hebben,sg3,intransitive) and verb(hebben,sg3,transitive)- because it can be used either transitively or intransitively.",
        "The other type features indicate that it is a present third person singular verb and it forms perfect tense with the auxiliary verb hebben.",
        "The goal of our LA method is to assign the correct lexical type(s) to a given unknown word.",
        "The method takes into account only open-class lexical types: nouns, adjectives and verbs, under the assumption that the grammar is already able to handle all closed-class cases.",
        "We call the types considered by our method universal types.",
        "The adjectives can be used as adverbs in Dutch and thus, we do not consider the latter to be an open class.",
        "We employ a ME-based classifier which, for some unknown word, takes various morphological and syntactic features as input and outputs lexical types.",
        "The probability of a lexical type t, given an unknown word and its context c is:",
        "where fi(t,c) may encode arbitrary characteristics ofthe context and < 6i, 62,... > can be evaluated by maximising the pseudo-likelihood on a training corpus (Malouf, 2002).",
        "Table 1 shows the features for the noun in-spraakprocedures (consultation procedures).",
        "Row (i) contains 4 separate features derived from the prefix of the word and 4 other suffix features are given in row (ii).",
        "The two features in rows (iii) and (iv) indicate whether the word starts with a particle and if it contains a hyphen, respectively.",
        "Another source ofmorphological features is the paradigm of the unknown word which provides information that is otherwise inaccessible.",
        "For example, in Dutch, neuter nouns always take the het definite article while all other noun forms are used with the de article.",
        "Since the article is distinguishable only in the singular noun form, the correct article of a word, assigned a plural noun type, can be determined if we know its singular form.",
        "We adopt the method presented in Cholakov and van Noord (2009) where a finite state morphology is applied to generate the paradigm(s) of a given word.",
        "The morphology does not have access to any additional linguistic information and thus, it generates all possible paradigms allowed by the word structure.",
        "Then, the number of search hits Yahoo returns for each form in a given paradigm is combined with some simple heuristics to determine the correct paradigm(s).",
        "However, we make some modifications to this method because it deals only with regular morphological phenomena.",
        "Though all typical irregularities are included in the Alpino lexicon, there are cases of irregular verbs composed with particles which are not listed there.",
        "One such example is the irregular verb meevliegen (to fly with someone) for which no paradigm would be generated.",
        "To avoid this, we use a list of common particles to strip off any particle from a given unknown word.",
        "Once we have removed a particle, we check if what is left from the word is listed in the lexicon as a verb (e.g. vliegen in the case of meevliegen).",
        "If so, we extract all members of its paradigm from",
        "Features iii) particle_yes #in this case in iv) hyphen_no v) noun(de,pl) vi) noun(de,count,pl), tmp_noun(de,count,sg) vii) noun(de), noun(count), noun(pl), tmp_noun(de) tmp_noun(count), tmp_noun(sg)",
        "the lexicon and use them to build the paradigm of the unknown word.",
        "All forms are validated by using the same web-based heuristics as in the original model of Cholakov and van Noord (2009).",
        "A single paradigm is generated for in-spraakprocedures indicating that this word is a plural de noun.",
        "This information is explicitly used as a feature in the classifier which is shown in row (v) of Table 1.",
        "Next, we obtain syntactic features for in-spraakprocedures by extracting a number of sentences which it occurs in from large corpora or Internet.",
        "These sentences are parsed with a different 'mode' of Alpino where this word is assigned all universal types, i.e. it is treated as being maximally ambiguous.",
        "For each sentence only the best parse is preserved.",
        "Then, the lexical type that has been assigned to inspraakprocedures in this parse is stored.",
        "During parsing, Alpino's POS tagger (Prins and van Noord, 2001) keeps filtering implausible type combinations.",
        "For example, ifa determiner occurs before the unknown word, all verb types are typically not taken into consideration.",
        "This heavily reduces the computational overload and makes parsing with universal types computationally feasible.",
        "When all sentences have been parsed, a list can be drawn up with the types that have been used and their frequency:",
        "The lexical types assigned to inspraakprocedures in at least 80% of the parses are used as features in the classifier.",
        "These are the two features in row (vi) of Table 1.",
        "Further, as illustrated in row (vii), each attribute of the considered types is also taken as a separate feature.",
        "By doing this, we let the grammar decide which lexical type is best suited for a given unknown word.",
        "This is a new and effective way to include the syntactic constraints of the context in the LA process.",
        "However, for the parsing method to work properly, the disambiguation model of the parser needs to be adapted.",
        "The model heavily relies on the lexicon and it has learnt preferences how to parse certain phrases.",
        "For example, it has learnt a preference to parse prepositional phrases as verb complements, if the verb includes such a subcatego-rization frame.",
        "This is problematic when parsing with universal types.",
        "If the unknown word is a verb and it occurs together with a PP, it would always get analysed as a verb which subcategorizes for a PP.",
        "To avoid this, the disambiguation model is retrained on a specific set of sentences meant to make it more robust to input containing many unknown words.",
        "We have selected words with low frequency in large corpora and removed them temporarily from the Alpino lexicon.",
        "Less frequent words are typically not listed in the lexicon and the selected words are meant to simulate their behaviour.",
        "Then, all sentences from the Alpino treebank which contain these words are extracted and used to retrain the disambiguation model."

        "Baldwin (2005) uses a set of binary classifiers to learn lexical entries for a large-scale grammar of English (ERG; (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000)).",
        "The main disadvantage of the method is that it uses information obtained from secondary language resources POS taggers, chunkers, etc.",
        "Therefore, the grammar takes no part in the LA process and the method acquires lexical entries based on incomplete linguistic information provided by the various resources.",
        "The highest F-measure (about 65%) is achieved by using features from a chunker but it is still 20% lower than the results we report here.",
        "Further, no evaluation is done on how the method affects the performance of the ERG when the grammar is used for parsing.",
        "Zhang and Kordoni (2006) and Cholakov et al.",
        "(2008), on the other hand, include features from the grammar in a maximum entropy (ME) classifier to predict new lexical entries for the ERG and a large German grammar (GG; (Crys-mann, 2003)), respectively.",
        "The development data for this method consist of linguistically annotated sentences from treebanks and the grammar features used in the classifier are derived from this annotation.",
        "However, when the method is applied to open-text unannotated data, the grammar features are replaced with POS tags.",
        "Therefore, the grammar is no longer directly involved in the LA process which affects the quality of the predictions.",
        "Evaluation on sentences containing real unknown words shows improvement of the coverage for the GG when LA is employed but the accuracy decreases by 2%.",
        "Such evaluation has not been done for the ERG.",
        "The results on the development data are not comparable with ours because evaluation is done only in terms of precision while we are also able to measure recall.",
        "Statistical LA has previously been applied to Alpino as well (van de Cruys, 2006).",
        "However, his method employs less morphosyntactic features in comparison to our approach and does not make use of word paradigms.",
        "Further, though experiments on development data are performed on a smaller scale, the results in terms ofF-measure are 10% lower than those reported in our case study.",
        "Experiments with real unknown words have not been performed.",
        "Other, non-statistical LA methods also exist.",
        "Cussens and Pulman (2000) describe a symbolic approach which employs inductive logic programming and Barg and Walther (1998) and Fouvry (2003) follow a unification-based approach.",
        "However, the generated lexical entries might be both too general or too specific and it is doubtful if these methods can be used on a large scale.",
        "They have not been applied to broad-coverage grammars and no evaluation is provided.",
        "We stress the fact that the experiments with Alpino represent only a case study.",
        "The proposed LA method can be applied to other computational grammars and languages providing that the following conditions are fulfilled.",
        "First, words have to be mapped onto some finite set of labels of which a subset of open-class (universal) labels has to be selected.",
        "This subset represents the labels which the ME-based classifier can predict for unknown words.",
        "Second, a (large) corpus has to be available, so that various sentences in which a given unknown word occurs can be extracted.",
        "This is crucial for obtaining different contexts in which this word is found.",
        "Next, we need a parser to analyse the extracted sentences which allows for the syntactic constraints imposed by these contexts to be included in the prediction process.",
        "Finally, as for the paradigm generation, the idea of combining a finite state morphology and web heuristics is general enough to be implemented for different languages.",
        "It is also important to note that the classifier allows for arbitrary combinations of features and therefore, a researcher is free to include any (language-specific) features he or she considers useful for performing LA.",
        "We have already started investigating the applicability of our LA method to large-scale grammars of German and French and the initial experiments and results we have obtained are promising."
