        "In a natural language, words interact among themselves in different ways - some words co-occur with certain words at a very high probability than other words.",
        "These co-occurrences are nontrivial, as in their patterns cannot be inferred from the frequency distribution of the individual words.",
        "Understanding the structure and the emergence of these patterns can present us with important clues and insights about how we evolved this extremely complex phenomenon, that is language.",
        "In this paper, we present an in-depth study of the word co-occurrence patterns of a language in the framework of complex networks.",
        "The choice of this framework is strongly motivated by its success in explaining various properties of word co-occurrences previously (Ferrer-i-Cancho and Sole, 2001; Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2007; Kapustin and Jamsen, 2007).",
        "Local properties, such as the degree distribution and clustering coefficient of the word co-occurrence networks, have been thoroughly studied for a few languages (Ferrer-i-Cancho and Sole, 2001; Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2007; Kapustin and Jamsen, 2007) and many interesting conclusions have been drawn.",
        "For instance, it has been found that these networks are small-world in nature and are characterized by a two regime power-law degree distribution.",
        "Efforts have also been made to explain the emergence of such a two regime degree distribution through network growth models (Dorogovstev and Mendes, 2001).",
        "Although it is tempting to believe that a lot is known about word co-occurrences, in order to obtain a deeper insight into how these cooccurrence patterns emerged there are many other interesting properties that need to be investigated.",
        "One such property is the spectrum of the word cooccurrence network which can provide important information about its global organization.",
        "In fact, the application of this powerful mathematical machinery to infer global patterns in linguistic networks is rarely found in the literature (few exceptions are (Belkin and Goldsmith, 2002; Mukher-jee et al., 2009)).",
        "However, note that spectral analysis has been quite successfully applied in the analysis of biological and social networks (Banerjee and Jost, 2007; Farkas et al., 2001).",
        "The aim of the present work is to investigate the spectral properties of a word co-occurrence network in order to understand its global structure.",
        "In particular, we study the properties of seven different languages namely Bangla (Indo-European family), English (Indo-European family), Estonian (Finno-Ugric family), French (Indo-European family), German (Indo-European family), Hindi (Indo-European family) and Tamil (Dravidian family).",
        "Quite importantly, as we shall see, the most popular growth model proposed by Dorogovtsev and Mendes (DM) (Dorogovstev and Mendes, 2001) for explaining the degree distribution of such a network is not adequate to reproduce the spectrum of the network.",
        "This observation holds for all the seven different languages under investigation.",
        "We shall further attempt to identify the precise (linguistic) reasons behind this difference in the spectrum of the empirical network and the one reproduced by the model.",
        "Finally, as an additional objective, we shall present a hitherto unreported deeper analysis of this popular model and show how its most important parameter is correlated to the size of the corpus from which the empirical network is constructed.",
        "The rest of the paper is laid out as follows.",
        "In section 2, we shall present a brief review of the previous works on word co-occurrence networks.",
        "This is followed by a short primer to spectral analysis.",
        "In section 4, we outline the construction methodology of the word co-occurrence networks and present the experiments comparing the spectrum of these real networks with those generated by the DM model.",
        "Section 5 shows how the most important parameter of the DM model varies with the size of the corpus from which the co-occurrence networks are constructed.",
        "Finally, we conclude in section 6 by summarizing our contributions and pointing out some of the implications of the current work."

        "In this section, we present a short review of the earlier works on word co-occurrence networks, where the nodes are the words and an edge between two words indicate that the words have co-occurred in a language in certain context(s).",
        "The most basic and well studied form of word cooccurrence networks are the word collocation networks, where two words are linked by an edge if they are neighbors (i.e., they collocate) in a sentence (Ferrer-i-Cancho and Sole, 2001).",
        "In (Ferrer-i-Cancho and Sole, 2001), the authors study the properties of two types of collocation networks for English, namely the unrestricted and the restricted ones.",
        "While in the unrestricted network, all the collocation edges are preserved, in the restricted one only those edges are preserved for which the probability of occurrence of the edge is higher than the case when the two words collocate independently.",
        "They found that both the networks exhibit small-world properties; while the average path length between any two nodes in these networks is small (between 2 and 3), the clustering coefficients are high (0.69 for the unrestricted and 0.44 for the restricted networks).",
        "Nevertheless, the most striking observation about these networks is that the degree distributions follow a two regime power-law.",
        "The degree distribution of the 5000 most connected words (i.e., the kernel lexicon) follow a power-law with an exponent – 3.07, which is very close to that predicted by the Barabasi-Albert growth model (Barabasi and Albert, 1999).",
        "These findings led the authors to argue that the word usage of the human languages is preferential in nature, where the frequency of a word defines the comprehensibility and production capability.",
        "Thus, higher the usage frequency of a word, higher is the probability that the speakers will be able to produce it easily and the listeners will comprehend it fast.",
        "This idea is closely related to the recency effect in linguistics (Akmajian, 1995).",
        "Properties of word collocation networks have also been studied for languages other than English (Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2007; Kapustin and",
        "Jamsen, 2007).",
        "The basic topological characteristics of all these networks (e.g., scale-free, small world, assortative) are similar across languages and thus, point to the fact that like Zipf's law, these are also linguistic universals whose emergence and existence call for a non-trivial psycholinguistic account.",
        "In order to explain the two regime power-law in word collocation networks, Dorogovtsev and Mendes (Dorogovstev and Mendes, 2001) proposed a preferential attachment based growth model (henceforth referred to as the DM model).",
        "In this model, at every time step t, a new word (i.e., a node) enters the language (i.e., the network) and connects itself preferentially to one of the pre-existing nodes.",
        "Simultaneously, ct (where c is a positive constant and a parameter of the model) new edges are grown between pairs of old nodes that are chosen preferentially.",
        "Through mathematical analysis and simulations, the authors successfully establish that this model gives rise to a two regime power-law with exponents very close to those observed in (Ferrer-i-Cancho and Sole, 2001).",
        "In fact, for English, the values kcross (i.e., the point where the two power law regimes intersect) and kcut (i.e., the point where the degree distribution cuts the x-axis) obtained from the model are in perfect agreement with those observed for the empirical network.",
        "Although the DM model is capable of explaining the local topological properties of the word collocation network, as we shall see in the forthcoming sections, it is unable to reproduce the global properties (e.g., the spectrum) of the network."

        "In this section, we shall briefly outline the basic concepts involved in spectral analysis and discuss some of its applications (see (Chung, 1994) for details).",

        "Any real symmetric matrix A has n (possibly non-distinct) eigenvalues Ao < Ai < ... < Ara_i, and corresponding n eigenvectors that are mutually orthogonal.",
        "The spectrum of a network is the set of the distinct eigenvalues of the graph and their corresponding multiplicities.",
        "It is a distribution usually represented in the form of a plot with the eigenvalues in x-axis and their multiplicities in the y-axis.",
        "The spectrum of real and random networks display several interesting properties.",
        "Banerjee and Jost (Banerjee and Jost, 2007) report the spectrum of several biological networks and show that these are significantly different from the spectrum of artificially generated networks.",
        "It is worthwhile to mention here that spectral analysis is also closely related to Principal Component Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling.",
        "If the first few (say d) eigenvalues of a matrix are much higher than the rest of the eigenvalues, then one can conclude that the rows of the matrix can be approximately represented as linear combinations of d orthogonal vectors.",

        "Interestingly, this property is observed across all the languages under investigation.",
        "We believe that the difference in the spectra is due to the fact that the ordering of the words in a sentence are strongly governed by the grammar or the syntax of the language.",
        "Words belong to a smaller set of lexico-syntactic categories, which are more commonly known as the parts-of-speech (POS).",
        "The co-occurrence patterns of the words are influenced, primarily, by its POS category.",
        "For instance, nouns are typically preceded by articles or adjectives, whereas verbs might be preceded by auxiliary verbs, adverbs or nouns, but never articles or adjectives.",
        "Therefore, the words \"car\" and \"camera\" are more likely to be structurally similar in the word co-occurrence network, than \"car\" and \"jumped\".",
        "In general, the local neighborhoods of the words belonging to a particular POS is expected to be very similar, which means that several rows in the adjacency matrix will be very similar to each other.",
        "Thus, the matrix is expected to have low rank.",
        "In fact, this property is not only applicable to syntax, but also semantics.",
        "For instance, even though adjectives are typically followed by nouns, semantic constraints make certain adjective-noun co-occurrences (e.g., \"green leaves\") much more likely than some others (e.g., \"green dreams\" or \"happy leaves\").",
        "These notions are at the core of latent semantics and vector space models of semantics (see, for instance, Turney and Pantel (Tur-ney and Pantel, 2010) for a recent study).",
        "The DM model, on the other hand, is based on the recency effect that says that the words which are produced most recently are easier to remember and therefore, easier to produce in the future.",
        "Preferential attachment models the recency effect in word production, which perhaps is sufficient to replicate the degree distribution of the networks.",
        "However, the model fails to explain the global properties, precisely because it does not take into account the constraints that govern the distribution of the words.",
        "It is quite well known that the spectrum of a network can be usually obtained by iteratively powering the adjacency matrix of the network (aka power iteration method).",
        "Note that if the adjacency matrices of the empirical and the synthesized networks are powered even once (i.e., they are squared), their degree distributions match no longer (see Figure 3).",
        "This result further corroborates that although the degree distribution of a word co-occurrence network is quite appropriately reproduced by the DM model, more global structural properties remain unexplained.",
        "We believe that word association in human languages is not arbitrary and therefore, a model which accounts for the clustering of words around their POS categories might possibly turn out to present a more accurate explanation of the spectral properties of the co-occurrence networks.",

        "At every time step, only one new node is added to the network and therefore the total number of nodes at the end of time T is exactly equal to T. Thus the average degree of the network is and this completes the proof.",
        "In fact, it is also possible to make a precise empirical estimate of the value of the parameter c. One can express the average degree of the cooccurrence networks as the ratio of twice the bigram frequency (i.e., twice the number of edges in the network) to the unigram frequency (i.e., the number of nodes or unique words in the network).",

        "In contrast, the peripheral lexicon making the other part of the two regime grows very fast as new words enter the language.",
