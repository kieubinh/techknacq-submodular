        "In our work on posing questions to a biology knowledge base, we address this brittleness in two ways: First, we exploit the DIRT paraphrase database to introduce alternative phrasings of a question; Second, we defer word sense and semantic role commitment until question answering.",

        "Our goal is to allow users to pose exam-style questions to a biology knowledge base (KB), containing formal representations of biological structures and processes expressed in first-order logic.",
        "As the questions typically require automated reasoning to answer them, a semantic interpretation of each question is needed.",
        "In our earlier work (Clark et al., 2007), questions were interpreted using a conventional pipeline (parse, coreference, sense and role disambiguation).",
        "However, despite moderate performance, the original (\"base\") system suffered from well-known problems of brittleness, arising from both premature commitments in the pipeline and the system's limited knowledge of the multiple ways that questions can be expressed.",
        "In this paper, we describe how deferred commitment and a large paraphrase database can be used to reduce these problems, drawing on prior work and applying it in the context of a large KB being available.",
        "In particular, by interleaving interpretation and answering, we are able to control the combinatorics of alternatives that would otherwise arise.",
        "An evaluation suggests that this improves the ability of the system to correctly interpret, and hence answer, questions."

        "Our system aims to interpret and answer high-school level, exam-style biology questions, expressed in sentence form.",
        "Our source of answers is a formal knowledge-base and reasoning engine (rather than a text corpus), placing specific requirements on the interpretation process - in particular, a full semantic interpretation of the question is required.",
        "Questions are typically one or two sentences long, for example:",
        "(1) Does a prokaryotic cell contain ribosomes?",
        "(2) A eukaryotic cell has a nucleus.",
        "Does that nucleus contain RRNA?",
        "(3) Is adenine found in RNA molecules?",
        "(4) Does a prokaryotic cell have a region consisting of cytosol?",
        "(5) Do ribosomes synthesize proteins in the cytoplasm?",

        "(3) Is adenine found in RNA molecules?",
        "(5) Do ribosomes synthesize proteins in the cytoplasm?",
        "Interpreting and answering this style of question has a long history in NLP, both for answers found via database retrieval and formal reasoning, and for answers extracted from a large text corpus.",
        "For answers found using reasoning, the focus of this paper, early NL systems typically used a pipelined architecture for question interpretation (e.g., Bobrow, 1964; Woods 1977), with later systems also using semantic constraints to guide disambiguation decisions (e.g., Novak, 1977).",
        "More recently, as well as there being significant improvements in the performance of typical pipeline modules, e.g., word sense disambiguation (Navigli, 2009), there has been substantial work on various forms of deferred commitment, underspecification, and paraphrasing to expand the space of interpretations considered, and thus improve interpretation.",
        "Underspecified representations (e.g., van Deemter and Peters, 1996; Pinkal, 1999) allow ambiguity (in particular scope ambiguity) to be preserved in a single structure and commitments deferred until later, allowing multiple interpretations to be carried through the system.",
        "Similarly, a system can defer commitment by simply carrying multiple, alternative interpretations forward as individual structures, or packed together into a single structure (e.g., Alshawi and van Eijck, 1989, Bobrow et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2010a,b).",
        "Finally, canonicalized representations are often used to represent (and hence carry through the system) multiple, equivalent surface forms as a single structure, e.g., normalizing active and passive forms, or alternative forms of noun modification (Rinaldi et al., 2003).",
        "All these techniques help avoid premature commitment in interpretation.",
        "As well as avoiding early rejection of interpretations in these ways, there has been substantial, recent work on expanding the space of possible interpretations considered through the use of paraphases (e.g., Sekine and Inui, 2007).",
        "Paraphrasing is based on the observation that there are many ways of saying (roughly) the same thing, and that syntatic manipulation alone is not sufficient to enumerate them all.",
        "Paraphrases aim to enumerate these additional alternatives, and may be generated synthetically (e.g., Rinaldi et al., 2003), drawn from similar texts (e.g., from similar questions for QA,",
        "Harabagiu et al., 2000), or mined from a corpus using machine learning techniques (e.g., Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "They have proved to be particularly useful in the context of textual entailment (e.g., Bentivogli et al., 2009), and in corpus-based question answering (e.g., Harabagiu et al., 2003).",
        "Our work builds on this prior work, applying and extending these ideas to the context where a formal knowledge base and reasoning engine is available.",
        "In particular, we interleave the process of expanding the space of interpretations considered (using paraphrases and deferred commitment) with the process of question answering (which narrows down that space by selecting interpretations supported by the KB), thus controlling the otherwise combinatorial explosion of alternatives.",
        "This makes it feasible to use the DIRT paraphrase database (12 million paraphrases) for generating a full semantic interpretation of the original question, extending its previous use in the semi-formal context of textual entailment (Bentivogli et al., 2009).",
        "Our use of reasoning to guide disambiguation follows Hobbs et als (1993) method of \"interpretation as abduction\", where the system searches a space of possible interpretations for one(s) that are provable from the KB, preferring those interpretations."

        "the system (mis-)interprets this as referring to some actual \"finding\" event, not recognizing that this is an alternative way of phrasing a question about physical structure.",
        "Similarly, the notion of \"consisting of\" in question (4) is an unexpected phrasing that the system does not understand.",
        "Questions (5) and (6) are also answered incorrectly by the base system due to errors in semantic role labeling during interpretation.",
        "In (5):",

        "Clearly, one can tweak the original interpreter to overcome these particular problems.",

        "The brittleness of the base system can be partially attributed to its eager commitments, ahead of specifics that might be discovered during question-answering itself.",
        "To address this, we have modified the system in two ways.",
        "First, we have added use of paraphrases to explore additional interpretations of the question during question-answering.",
        "Second, we defer sense and semantic role disambiguation until question answering.",
        "As a result, part of interpretation occurs during answering itself: multiple interpretations are tried and a commitment is made to the one(s) that produce a non-null answer.",
        "The justification for this commitment is a benevolent user assumption, namely that the interpretation that \"makes sense\" with respect to the KB (i.e., produces a non-null answer) is the one that the user intended.",
        "This use of question-answering to drive disambiguation follows Hobbs et als.",
        "(1993) work on Interpretation as Abduction.",
        "In that framework, a system searches for an interpretation that is provable from the KB plus a minimal cost set of assumptions, the interpretation corresponding to a particular way to disambiguate the text.",
        "In our work we do a similar thing, although restrict the assumptions to disambiguation decisions and exclude assuming new knowledge, as we are dealing with questions rather than assertions (if no interpretations are provable, then we treat the answer as \"no\" rather than treating the unproven query as something that should be asserted as true).",
        "Several paraphrase databases are now available to the NLP community, typically built by automatically finding phrases that occur in distribu-tionally similar contexts (e.g., Dras et al., 2005).",
        "To date, paraphrase databases have primarily been exploited for recognizing textual entailment (e.g., Bentivogli et al., 2009, Clark et al., 2009), and for corpus-based question answering (e.g., Harabagiu et al., 2003).",
        "Here we use them for generating a full semantic interpretation in the context of querying a formal knowledge resource.",
        "We use the DIRT paraphrase database (Lin and Pantel, 2001), containing approximately 12 million automatically learned rules of the form:",
        "IF X relation Y THEN X relation' Y where relation is a path in the dependency tree between constitutents X and Y, or equivalently (as we use later) a chain of literals:",

        "The database itself is noisy, containing both good and nonsensical paraphrases.",
        "Interestingly, their use in question-answering tends to filter out most bad paraphrases, as it is rare that a nonsensical paraphrases will by chance produce an answer (i.e., the question + KB together help \"triangulate\" on good paraphrases).",
        "Nevertheless, bad paraphrases can sometimes produce incorrect answers.",
        "To handle this in a practical setting, we are adding an interactive interface (outside the scope of this paper) that shows the user any paraphrases used, and allows him/her to verify/block them as desired.",
        "A second, common cause of failure of the base system was incorrect assignment of senses and",
        "(a) setup: create an instance X0 of the object being universally quantified over (identified during initial language interpretation)",
        "(b) query: for each literal in the LF with at least one bound variable, iteratively query the KB to see if some interpretation of those literals are provable i.e., already known.",
        "In this example, illustrated in Figure 1, for step (a) the system first creates an instance X0 of a mitotic spindle, i.e., asserts the instantiated first literal isa(X0,Mitotic-Spindle), and then queries the inference engine with the remaining LF literals.",

        "While domain-specific terms are generally reliably disambiguated, disambiguation of general terms (e.g., whether \"split\" denotes the concept of Separate or Divide) and semantic roles (e.g., whether \"into\" denotes destina-tion(x,y) or result(x,y)) is less reliable, with only limited improvement attainable through manual engineering or machine learning.",
        "The problem is compounded by a degree of subjectivity in the way knowledge is encoded in the KB, for example whether the KB engineer chose to conceptualize a biological object as the \"agent\" or \"instrument\" or \"site\" of an activity is to a degree a matter of viewpoint.",

        "Although such questions are relatively rare in biology, they are common in other sciences (e.g., physics).",
        "Handling such questions would require extension of this approach, eg by matching a generalized form of the assertion X against the KB to identify how to disambiguate it.",
        "Similarly, if we wished to use the system to read new knowledge, as opposed to identify old knowledge, further extensions would be needed, as new knowledge by definition cannot be proved from the KB.",
        "Finally, this work suggests that paraphrase databases such as DIRT offer potential for language understanding in the context of posing formal questions to a reasoning system or database, by bridging gaps that would otherwise have to be hand-engineered, extending their previous use in semi-formal settings such as textual entailment (Bentivogli et al., 2009).",
        "Despite noise, the question plus KB help \"triangulate\" on good paraphrases, and with a suitable user interface to expose their use, this work suggests that there is substantial potential for deploying them in a practical, end-user environment."
