        "Word ordering is one of the major issues in statistical machine translation (SMT), due to the many word order peculiarities of each language.",
        "It is widely accepted that there is a need for structural information to account for such differences.",
        "Structural information, such as Part-of-speech (POS) tags, chunks or constituency/dependency parse trees, offers a greater potential to learn generalizations about relationships between languages than models based on word surface forms, because such \"surfacist\" models fail to infer generalizations from the training data.",
        "The word ordering problem is typically decomposed in a number of related problems which can be further explained by a variety of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Accordingly, we can sort out the reordering problems into three categories based on the kind of linguistic units involved and/or the typical distortion distance they imply.",
        "Roughly speaking, we face short-range reorderings when single words are reordered within a relatively small window distance.",
        "It consist of the easiest case as typically, the use of phrases (in the sense of translation units of the phrase-based approach to SMT) is believed to adequately perform such reorderings.",
        "Mid-range reorderings involve reorderings between two or more phrases (translation units) which are closely positioned, typically within a window of about 6 words.",
        "Many alternatives have been proposed to tackle midrange reorderings through the introduction of linguistic information in MT systems.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the authors of (Xia and Mc-Cord, 2004) were the first to address this problem in the statistical MT paradigm.",
        "They automatically build a set of linguistically grounded rewrite rules, aimed at reordering the source sentence so as to match the word order of the target side.",
        "Similarly, (Collins, et al. 2005) and (Popovic and Ney, 2006) reorder the source sentence using a small set of hand-crafted rules for German-English translation.",
        "(Crego and Marino, 2007) show that the ordering problem can be more accurately solved by building a source-sentence word lattice containing the most promising reordering hypotheses, allowing the decoder to decide for the best word order hypothesis.",
        "Word lattices are built by means of rewrite rules operating on POS tags; such rules are automatically extracted from the training bi-text.",
        "(Zhang, et al. 2007) introduce shallow parse (chunk) information to reorder the source sentence, aiming at extending the scope of their rewrite rules, encoding reordering hypotheses in the form of a confusion network that is then passed to the decoder.",
        "These studies tackle midrange reorderings by predicting more or less accurate reordering hypotheses.",
        "However, none of them introduce a reordering model to be used in decoding time.",
        "Nowadays, most of SMT systems implement the well known lexicalized reordering model (Tillman, 2004).",
        "Basically, for each translation unit it estimates the probability of being translated monotone, swapped or placed discontiguous with respect to its previous translation unit.",
        "Integrated within the Moses (Koehn, et al. 2007) decoder, the model achieves state-of-the-art results for many translation tasks.",
        "One of the main reasons that explains the success of the model is that it considers information of the source-and target-side surface forms, while the above mentionned approaches attempt to hypothesize reorderings relying only on the information contained on the source-side words.",
        "Finally, long-range reorderings imply reorder-ings in the structure of the sentence.",
        "Such re-orderings are necessary to model the translation for pairs like Arabic-English, as English typically follows the SVO order, while Arabic sentences have different structures.",
        "Even if several attempts exist which follow the above idea of making the ordering of the source sentence similar to the target sentence before decoding (Niehues and Kolss, 2009), long-range reorderings are typically better addressed by syntax-based and hierarchical (Chiang, 2007) models.",
        "In (Zollmann et al., 2008), an interesting comparison between phrase-based, hierarchical and syntax-augmented models is carried out, concluding that hierarchical and syntax-based models slightly outperform phrase-based models under large data conditions and for sufficiently non-monotonic language pairs.",
        "Encouraged by the work reported in (Hoang and Koehn, 2009), we tackle the midrange reordering problem in SMT by introducing a n-gram language model of bilingual units built from POS information.",
        "The rationale behind such a model is double: on the one hand we aim at introducing morpho-syntactic information into the reordering model, as we believe it plays an important role for predicting systematic word ordering differences between language pairs; at the same time that it drastically reduces the sparseness problem of standard translation units built from surface forms.",
        "On the other hand, n-gram language modeling is a robust approach, that enables to account for arbitrary large sequences of units.",
        "Hence, the proposed model takes care of the translation adequacy ofthe structural information present in translation hypotheses, here introduced in the form ofPOS tags.",
        "We also show how the new model compares to a widely used lexical-ized reordering model, which we have also implemented in our particular bilingual n-gram approach to SMT, as well as to the widely known Moses SMT decoder, a state-of-the-art decoder performing lexicalized reordering.",
        "The remaining of this paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we briefly describe the bilingual n-gram SMT system.",
        "Section 3 details the bilingual n-gram reordering model, the main contribution of this paper, and introduces additional well known reordering models.",
        "In Section 4, we analyze the reordering needs of the language pairs considered in this work and we carry out evaluation experiments.",
        "Finally, we conclude and outline further work in Section 5."

        "The back-off procedure used by standard language models allows to dynamically adapt the scope of the context used.",
        "Therefore, in the case of our reordering model, back-off allows to consider always as much bilingual context (n-grams) as possible.",
        "The new model was straightforward implemented in our bilingual n-gram system by extending the log-linear combination implemented by our decoder.",
        "No additional decoding complexity was introduced in the baseline decoding implementation.",
        "Finally, we showed that midrange reorder-ings are present in French-English and German-English translations and that our reordering model effectively tackles such reorderings.",
        "However, we saw that long-range reorderings, also present in these tasks, are yet to be addressed.",
        "We plan to further investigate the use of different structural information, such as supertags, and tags conveying different levels of morphology information (gender, number, tense, mood, etc.)",
        "for different language pairs."
