        "Information Retrieval (IR) involves finding documents that are relevant to a given query in a large corpus.",
        "The task is usually formulated as a ranking problem.",
        "When a user submits a query, the IR system retrieves all documents that contain at least one query term, calculates a ranking score for each of the documents using a ranking model, and sorts the documents according to the ranking scores.",
        "The scores represent the relevance, importance, and/or diversity of the retrieved documents.",
        "Thus, the quality of a search engine can be determined by the accuracy of the ranking results.",
        "Recently, a machine learning technology called learning to rank has been applied extensively to the task.",
        "Several state-of-the-art machine learning-based ranking algorithms have been proposed, e.g., RankSVM and RankNet.",
        "These algorithms differ substantially in terms of the ranking models and optimization techniques employed, but most of them can be regarded as \"local ranking\" approaches in the sense that each model is defined on a single document without considering the possible relations to other documents to be ranked.",
        "In many applications, this is only a loose approximation as there is always relational information among documents.",
        "For example, in some cases, users may prefer that two similar documents have similar relevance scores; even though one of the documents is not as relevant to the given query as the other; this problem is similar to Pseudo Relevance Feedback (Kwok, 1984).",
        "In other cases, web pages from the same site form a sitemap hierarchy in which a parent document should be ranked higher than its child documents (referred to as Topic Distillation at TREC (Chowdhury, 2007)).",
        "To utilize all available information, more advanced ranking algorithms define a ranking model as a function of all the documents to be ranked, i.e., a global ranking model (Qin et al., 2008a; Qin et al., 2008b).",
        "Unlike conventional ranking and learning to rank models, such as BM25 and RankSVM, whose ranking functions are defined on a query and document pair, global ranking models utilize both content information and relation information.",
        "Qin et al.",
        "(2008) proposed the first supervised learning framework for the global ranking problem.",
        "They formulated the problem as an optimization problem that involves finding an objective function to minimize the trade-off between local consistence and global consistence and implemented it on SVM.",
        "Subsequently, they defined the global ranking problem formally in (Qin et al., 2008) and solved it by employing continuous conditional random fields (CRF).",
        "In this paper, we propose a new framework for the global ranking problem.",
        "The major difference between our work and that of Qin et al.",
        "(2008a; 2008b) is that we do not compile a feature vector of relational information directly to construct a new machine-learned ranking model for global ranking.",
        "Instead, we use the ranking results generated by the original ranking model and then employ an algorithm with the relational information to transform the global ranking problem into a data fusion problem; that is also known as a rank aggregate problem.",
        "The proposed framework is flexible and can be cascaded with conventional ranking models or learning to rank models.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present a formal definition of global ranking.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the proposed framework and consider three fusion algorithms that can be used with our framework.",
        "We also explain how the algorithms can be adapted to solve the global ranking problem.",
        "In Section 4, we introduce a biomedical text mining task called the interactor normalization task (INT) (Krallinger et al., 2009) and show why it should be formulated as a global ranking problem.",
