        "Following this, meaning relatedness scores are computed by using various similarity measures on the vector representations.",
        "One of the major issues that all distributional methods have to face is sense ambiguity.",
        "Since vector representations reflect mixtures of uses additional methods have to be employed in order to capture specific meanings of a word in context.",

        "Human participants in this task provided words such as transmit and spread as good substitutes for shed in this context, however a vector space representation of shed will not capture this infrequent sense.",
        "For these reasons, recent work on distributional methods for similarity such as (Mitchell and La-pata, 2008) (Erk and Pado, 2008) (Thater et al., 2009) focuses on using the context in which a target word occurs to derive context-sensitive similarity computations.",

        "Our approach differs from this as we assume ambiguity of words at the, initial, acquisition step, by encoding senses of words as a hidden variable in the text we process.",

        "A total set of patterns is extracted from a large corpus and each of them can be paraphrased by returning its most similar patterns, according to the similarity score.",
        "Although relatively accurate, it has been noted (Lin and Pantel, 2001b) that the paraphrases extracted this way reflect, as expected, various meanings, and that a context-sensitive representation would be appropriate.",
        "Context-sensitive extensions of DIRT (Pantel et al., 2007) and (Basili et al., 2007) focus on making DIRT rules context-sensitive by attaching appropriate semantic classes to the X and Y slots of an inference rule.",
        "For this purpose, the initial step in their methods is to acquire an inference rule database, using the DIRT algorithm.",
        "Following this, given an inference rule, they identify semantic classes for the X and Y fillers which make the application of the rule appropriate.",
        "For this (Pan-tel et al., 2007) build a set of semantic classes using WordNet in one case and CBC clustering algorithm in the other; for each rule, they use the overlap of the fillers found in the input corpus as an indicator of the correct semantic classes.",
        "The same idea is used in (Basili et al., 2007) where, this time, the X and Y fillers are clustered for each rule individually; these nouns are clustered using an LSA-vector representation extracted from a large corpus.",
        "(Connor and Roth, 2007) take a slightly different approach as they attempt to classify the context of a rule as appropriate or not, again using the overlap of fillers as an indicator.",
        "They all show improvement over DIRT by evaluating on occurrences of rules in context which are annotated as correct/incorrect by human participants.",
        "On a common data set (Pantel et al., 2007) and (Basili et al., 2007) achieve significant improvements over DIRT at 95% confidence level when employing the clustering methods.",
