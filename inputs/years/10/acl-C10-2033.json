        "In statistical machine translation, for the diversity of natural languages, the word order of source and target language may differ and searching through all possible translations is NP-hard (Knight, 1999).",
        "So some measures have to be taken to reduce search space: either using a search algorithm with pruning technique or restricting possible reorderings.",
        "Currently, beam search is widely used (Tillmann and Ney, 2003; Koehn, 2004) to reduce search space.",
        "However, the pruning technique adopted by this algorithm is not risk-free.",
        "As a result, the best partial translation may be ruled out during pruning.",
        "The more aggressive the pruning is, the more likely the best translation escapes.",
        "There should be a tradeoff between the speed and the accuracy.",
        "If some heuristic knowledge is employed to guide the search, the search algorithm can discard some implausible hypotheses in advance and focus on more possible ones.",
        "Inversion Transduction Grammars (ITGs) permit a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility and are particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages (Wu, 1996; Wu, 1997).",
        "They can well balance the needed flexibility against complexity constraints.",
        "Recently, ITG has been successfully applied to statistical machine translation (Zens and Ney, 2003; Zens et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2006).",
        "However, ITG generally employs the expensive CYK parsing algorithm which runs in cube time.",
        "In addition, the CYK algorithm can not calculate language model exactly in the process of decoding, as it can not catch the full history context of the left words in a hypothesis.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a shift-reduce decoding algorithm with ITG constraints which runs in a left-to-right manner.",
        "This algorithm parses source words in the order of their corresponding translations on the target side.",
        "In the meantime, it gives all candidate ITG-legal reorderings.",
        "The shift-reduce algorithm is different from the CYK algorithm, in particular:",
        "• It produces translation in a left-to-right manner.",
