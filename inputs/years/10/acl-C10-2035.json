        "Systematic reviews are the result of a tedious process which involves human reviewers to manually screen references of papers to determine their relevance to the review.",
        "This process often entails reading thousands or even tens of thousands of abstracts from prospective articles.",
        "As the body of available articles continues to grow, this process is becoming increasingly difficult.",
        "Common systematic review practices stipulate that two reviewers are used at the screening phases of a systematic review to review each abstract of the documents retrieved after a simple query-based search.",
        "After a final decision is made for each abstract (the two reviewers decide if the abstract is relevant or not to the topic of review), in the next phase further analysis (more strict screening steps) on the entire article is done.",
        "A systematic review has to be complete, articles that are published on a certain topic and are clinically relevant need to be part of the review.",
        "This requires near-perfect recall since the accidental exclusion of a potentially relevant abstract can have a significantly negative impact on the validity of the overall systematic review (Cohen et al., 2006).",
        "Our goal in this paper is to propose an automatic system that can help human judges in the process of triaging articles by looking only at abstracts and not the entire documents.",
        "This decision step is known as the initial screening phase in the protocol of building systematic reviews, only the abstracts are used as source of information.",
        "One reviewer will still read the entire collection of abstracts while the other will benefit from the help of the system; this reviewer will have to label only the articles that will be used to train the classifier (ideally a small proportion for workload reduction), the rest of the articles will be labeled by the classifier.",
        "In the systematic review preparation, if at least one reviewer agrees to include an abstract, the abstract will have the labeled included and it will pass to the next screening phase; otherwise, it will be discarded.",
        "Therefore, the benefit of doubt plays an important role in the decision process.",
        "When we replace one reviewer with the automatic classifier, because we keep one human judge in the process, the confidence and reliability of the review is still higher while the overall workload is reduced.",
        "The reduction is from the time required for two passes through the collection (for the two humans) to only one pass and the smaller part labeled by the reviewer which is assisted by the classifier.",
        "Figure 1 presents on overview of our proposed workflow.",
        "The task that needs to be solved in order to help the systematic review process is a text classification task intended to classify an abstract as relevant or not relevant to the topic of review.",
        "The hypothesis that guides our research is that it is possible to save time for the human reviewers and obtain good performance levels, similar to the ones obtained by humans.",
        "In this current study we show that we can achieve this by building a classification model that is based on the natural human workflow used for building systematic reviews.",
        "We show, on a real data set, that a human-machine system obtains the best results when an ensemble of classifiers is used as the classification model."

        "Their work is mostly focused on the elimination of non relevant documents.",

        "The idea is that a classifier returns, with high recall, a set of abstracts, and only those abstracts need to be read to weed out the nonrelevant ones.",
        "The savings are measured with respect to the number of abstracts that would have to be read if a random baseline classifier was used.",

        "The machine learning techniques that could be used in the process of automating the creation of systematic reviews need to take into account some issues that can arise when dealing with such tasks.",
        "Imbalanced data sets are usually what we deal with when building reviews, the proportion of relevant articles that end up being present in the review is significantly lower compared with the original data set.",
        "The benefit of doubt will affect the quality of the data used to train the classifier, since a certain amount of noise is introduced: abstracts that are in fact nonrelevant can be labeled as being relevant in the first screening process.",
        "The relatively high number of abstracts involved in the process will make the classification algorithms deal with a high number of features and the representation technique should try to capture aspects pertaining of the medical domain.",
        "In our current research, we use three representation techniques: bag-of-words (BOW), concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and a combination of both.",
        "The bag-of-words representation is commonly used for text classification and we have chosen to use binary feature values.",
        "Binary feature values were shown to outperform weighted values for text classification tasks in the medical domain as shown by Cohen et al.",
        "(2006) and binary values tend to be more stable in results than frequency values for a task similar to ours, as shown by Ma (2007).",
        "We considered feature words delimitated by space and simple punctuation marks that appeared at least three times in the training data, were not part of a stop words list, and had a length greater than three characters.",
        "30,000 word features were extracted.",
        "No stemming was used.",
        "UMLS concepts which are part of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) knowledge repository are identified and extracted form the collection of abstracts using the MetaMapsystem.",
        "This conceptual representation helped us overcome some of the shortcomings of BOW representation, and allowed us to use multi-word features, medical knowledge, and higher-level meanings of words in context.",
        "As Cohen (2008) shows, multi-word and medical concept representations are suitable to use.",
        "As a classification algorithm we have chosen to use the complement naive Bayes (CNB) (Frank and Bouckaert, 2006) classifier from the Wekatool.",
        "The reason for this choice is that the CNB classifier implements state-of-the-art modifications of the standard multinomial naÃ¯ve Bayes (MNB) classifier for a classification task with highly skewed class distribution (Drummond and Holte, 2003).",
        "As the systematic reviews data usually contain a large majority of not relevant abstracts, resulting in a skewness reaching even below 1%, it is important to use appropriate classifiers.",
        "Other classifiers, such as decision tress, support vector machine, instance-based learning, and boosting, were used but the results obtained with CNB were always better.",
        "The first method that we propose in order to solve the text classification task that is intended to help a systematic review process is a straightforward machine learning approach.",
        "We trained a classifier, CNB, on a collection of abstracts and then evaluated the classifier's performance on a separate test data set.",

        "The two possible classes are Included (relevant) or Excluded (non relevant).",
        "We decided to work with a training set smaller than the test set because ideally good results need to be obtained without using too much training data.",

        "We selected the top k1 CHI features that are exclusively included (appeared only in the training abstracts that are classified as Included) and the top k2 CHI features that are exclusively excluded (appeared only in the training abstracts that are classified as Excluded) and used them as a representation for our data set.",
        "We varied the k1 parameter from 10 to 150 and k2 from 5 to 150 We used a minimum of 20 features and a maximum of 300.",
        "InfoGain evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the information gain with respect to the class.",
        "We run experiments when we varied the number of selected features from 50 to 500.",

        "Bi-Normal Separation (BNS) is a feature selection technique that measures the separation between the threshold occurrences of a feature in one of the two classes.",
        "The latter measure is described in detail in Forman (2002).",
        "We used a ratio of features that varies from 10 to 150 for the most representative features for the Included class and from 5 to 150 for the Excluded class.",
        "For some experiments the number of features for the Included class is higher than the number of features for the Excluded class.",
        "We have chosen to do so because we wanted to rebalance the imbalance of classes in the training data set.",
        "After selecting the number of Included and Excluded features, we used the combination to represent our entire collection of abstracts.",
        "We used the implementation from the Weka package for the Chi and InfoGain and the BNS implementation done by Ma (2007).",
        "The second method that we propose for solving the task takes into account the specifics of the systematic review process.",

        "The clear distinction between the methods comes when we combined the classifiers with the human judge in the workflow of building reviews.",
        "The per-question technique is more robust and it offers the possibility to choose the desired type of performance.",
        "If the reviewers are willing to read almost the entire collection of documents, knowing that the recall is high, then a 3 or 4-vote scheme can be the set-up (though the 3 or 4-vote method is not likely to achieve 100% recall because it is very rare that an abstract contain answers to three or four of the questions associated with the systematic review).",

        "We base our discussion for the human-machine results for the experiment that obtained the best results, the 2-vote scheme with a BOW+UMLS representation technique.",
        "When combining the human and classifier decisions, the precision level decreased a bit compared to the one that the machine obtained.",
        "We believe that this is the case because some of the abstracts that the classifier excluded were included by the first human reviewer and, with this decision process in place, the level of precision dropped.",
        "Our goal of improving the recall level from the first level of screening is achieved, since when both the classifier and the human judge are integrated in the workflow, the recall level jumps from 79.7% to 92.7%.",
        "We believe that the low level of precision that is obtained for the human reviewer, for the human-classifier workflow, and for the classifier, is due to the fact that we are running experiments for the first screening phase when we use only the abstracts as source of information and not the entire articles.",
        "We believe that further investigations are required to fully replace a human reviewer with an automatic classifier but the results obtained with the per-question method encourage us to believe that this is a suitable solution for reaching our final goal."
