        "When matches are found, the corresponding translations in the target language are obtained through sub-sentential alignment.",
        "In our EBMT system, the final translation is obtained by combining the partial target translations using a statistical target Language Model.",
        "EBMT systems, like other data-driven approaches, require large amounts of data to function well (Brown, 2000).",
        "Having more training data is beneficial resulting in log-linear improvement in translation quality for corpus-based methods (EBMT, SMT).",
        "Koehn (2002) shows translation scores for a number of language pairs with different training sizes translated using the Pharaoh SMT toolkit (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "However, obtaining sizable parallel corpora for many languages is time-consuming and expensive.",
        "For rare languages, finding bilingual speakers becomes especially difficult.",
        "One of the main reasons for low quality translations is the presence of large number of OOV and rare words (low frequency words in the training corpus).",
        "Variation in domain and errors in spelling increase the number of OOV words.",
        "Many of the present translation systems either ignore these unknown words or leave them untranslated in the final target translation.",
        "When data is limited, the number of OOV words increases, leading to the poor performance of the translation models and the language models due to the absence of longer sequences of source word matches and less reliable language model estimates.",
        "Approaches in the past have suggested using stems or synonyms for OOV words as replacements (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).",
        "Similarity measures have been used to find words that are closely related (Marton et al., 2009).",
        "For morphologically rich languages, the OOV word is morphologically analyzed and the stem is used as its replacement (Popovic and Ney, 2004).",
        "This paper presents a simpler method inspired by the Context-based MT approach (Carbonell et al., 2006) to improve translation quality.",
        "The method requires a large source language monolingual corpus and does not require any other language dependent resources to obtain replacements.",
        "Approaches suggested in the past only concentrated on finding replacements for the OOV words and not the rare words.",
        "This paper proposes a unified method to find possible replacements for OOV words as well as rare words based on the context in which these words appear.",
        "In the case of rare words, the translated sentence is traced back to find the origin of the translations and the target translations of the replacements are replaced with the translations of the rare words.",
        "In the case of OOV words, the target translations are replaced by the OOV word itself.",
        "The main idea for adopting this approach is the belief that the EBMT system will be able to find longer phrasal matches and that the language model will be able to give better probability estimates while decoding if it is not forced to fragment text at OOV and rare-word boundaries.",
        "This method is highly beneficial for low-resource languages that do not have morphological analysers or Part-of-Speech (POS) taggers and in cases where the similarity measures proposed in the past do not find closely related words for certain OOV words.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

        "(2006) to generate word and phrasal synonyms in their Context-based MT system.",

        "The idea is based on the distributional hypothesis which states that words with similar meanings tend to appear in similar contexts (Harris, 1954).",

        "(2006) to obtain replacements for OOV words, where monolingual distributional profiles for OOV words were constructed.",

        "Our method does not make use of any morphological analysers, POS taggers or manually created dictionaries as they may not be available for many rare or low-resource languages.",
        "The translation of the replacements in the final decoded target sentence is replaced by the translation of the original word (or the source word itself in the OOV case), hence, we do not specifically look for synonyms.",
        "The only condition for a word to be a candidate replacement is that its left and right context need to match with that of the OOV/rare-word.",
        "Hence, the clustered words could have different semantic relations.",
        "For example, (c1uster1):\"laugh, giggle, chuckle, cry, weep\" where \"laugh, giggle, chuckle\" are synonyms and \"cry, weep\" are antonyms of \"laugh\".",

        "Second, the framework used allows scoring replacements based on multiple features to permit optimization.",
        "Third, instead of directly modifying the training corpus by replacing the candidate replacements by the OOV words, a new representation scheme is used for the test sentences to efficiently handle a beam of possible replacements."

        "Words in the test sentence that appear less than K times in the training corpus are considered as rare words (in this paper K = 3).",
        "The method presented in the following sections holds for both OOV as well as rare words.",

        "As the goal is to obtain longer target phrasal translations for the test sentence before decoding, only words that fit the left and right context of the OOV/rare-word in the test sentence are extracted.",
        "Unlike Marton et al.",
        "(2009) where a context list for each OOV is generated from the contexts of their replacements, this paper uses only the left and right context of the OOV/rare-word.",
        "The default window size for the context is five words (two words to the left and two words to the right of the OOV/rare-word).",
        "If the windowed words contain only function words, the window is incremented until at least one content word is present in the resulting context.",
        "This enables one to find sensible replacements that fit the context well.",
        "The contexts for T are:",
        "Left-context (L): hitting three Right-context (R): with one arrow",
        "The above contexts are further processed to generalize the numbers by a NUMBER tag to produce more candidate replacements.",
        "The resulting contexts are now:",
        "Left-context (L): hitting NUMBER Right-context (R): with NUMBER arrow",
        "As a single L – R context is used, a far smaller number of replacements are extracted.",
        "The monolingual corpus (ML) of the source language is used to find words and phrases (Xk) that fit LXkR i.e., with L as its left context and/or R as its right context.",
        "The maximum length for Xk is set to 3 currently.",
        "The replacements are further filtered to obtain only those replacements that contain at least one content word.",

        "A local context of two to three words to the left of an OOV/rare-word (wordi) and two to three words to the right of wordi contain sufficient clues for the word, wordi.",
        "Hence, local contextual features are used to score each of the replacement candidates (Xi k) of wordi.",
