        "World Wide Web and search engines have become an indispensable part of everyone's everyday life.",
        "While web search has come a long way over the past 10 years, it still has a long way to go to respond to the ever-increasing size of the web and needs of web surfers.",
        "Today, web search is under intensive and active research, drawing unparalleled attention from both industry and academia.",
        "Need of disambiguation.",
        "One of the major challenges in web search lies in unsatisfactory relevance of results caused by ambiguity.",
        "Query terms are inherently ambiguous due to polysemy, and most queries are short containing 1 to 3 terms only (Jansen et al., 2000).",
        "Thus queries are in general prone to ambiguity of user intent or information needs, resulting in retrieval ofenormous irrelevant pages.",
        "As the web increases in size at an increasing rate, ambiguity becomes ubiquitous and users are in increasing need of effective means of disambiguation.",
        "The ambiguity issue and its consequences are demonstrated in Example 1.",
        "Example 1 There are 17 entries in Wikipedia for different renown individuals under the same name of \"Jim Gray\", including a computer scientist, a sportscaster, a zoologist, a politician, a film director, a cricketer, and so on.",
        "Suppose we intend to find information about Jim Gray, the Turing award winner, we can issue a query of \"Jim Gray\" in Yahoo!For this extremely famous name in computer science, only 3 are relevant in the top 10 results.",
        "They are his Wikipedia entry, homepage at Microsoft Research, and DBLP entry.",
        "Straightforward approach.",
        "One intuitive way of disambiguation would be to apply available domain knowledge and refine the query by adding some confining contextual terms.",
        "This would generally improve precision.",
        "However, there are several inevitable problems in this approach.",
        "First, the improvement on precision is at the sacrifice of recall.",
        "For example, many Jim Gray pages may not contain the added contextual terms and are thus excluded from the search results.",
        "Second, the query is altered, leading to unfavorable ranking of results.",
        "Term proximity matters significantly in ranking (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "Some good pages w.r.t.",
        "the original query may be ranked low in the new search results because of worsened term proximity and relevance w.r.t.",
        "the new query.",
        "Thus, with this straightforward approach only limited success can be expected at best, as demonstrated in Example 2.",
        "Example 2 Suppose we know that Jim Gray is a computer scientist, we can issue a query of \"Jim Gray computer\".",
        "All the top 10 results are about Jim Gray and relevant.",
        "However, many of them are trivial pages, failing to include 2 of the 3 most important ones.",
        "His DBLP entry appears as the 27th result, and his homepage at Microsoft Research appears as the 51st result.",
        "This limited success is achieved by using a carefully selected contextual term.",
        "\"Computer\" is a very general term appearing on most of the Jim Gray pages.",
        "Also, there are no other competitively known computer people with the same name.",
        "Most other contextual terms would perform much worse.",
        "Thus a third problem of this straightforward query refinement approach is that only few contextual terms, which may not be available to users, would possibly achieve the limited success.",
        "Often, much of our domain knowledge would cause more damage than repair and is practically unusable, as demonstrated in Example 3.",
        "Example 3 Suppose we know that Jim Gray has David DeWitt as a close friend and colleague, we can issue a query of\"Jim Gray David DeWitt\".",
        "Again, all the top 10 results are about Jim Gray and relevant.",
        "However, the theme of the query is almost completely altered.",
        "Evidently, the 1st result \"Database Pioneer Joins Microsoft to Start New Database Research Lab\", among many others, talks about David De Witt.",
        "It is relevant to Jim Gray only because the lab is named \"Jim Gray Systems Lab\" in honor ofhim.",
        "The Bobo approach.",
        "Can we freely apply our domain knowledge to effectively disambiguate search intent and improve relevance of results without altering the original query?",
        "For this purpose, we propose and implement Bobo.",
        "For conceptual clarity, the Bobo interface features two boxes.",
        "Besides a regular query box, an additional box is used to take contextual terms from users that capture helpful domain knowledge.",
        "Contextual terms are used for disambiguation purposes.",
        "They do not alter the original query defined by query terms.",
        "Particularly, unlike in the straightforward approach, positive contextual terms are not required to be included in search results and negative contextual terms are not required to be excluded from search results.",
        "Contextual terms help estimate relevance of search results, routing them towards a user intended domain, filtering out those not-in-domain, or irrelevant, results.",
        "Bobo works in two rounds.",
        "In round I, a query is issued using by default the combination of query terms and contextual terms, or just the contextual terms if the query returns too few results.",
        "Then from the results, some top-ranked high-quality pages are (automatically) selected as seeds.",
        "In round II, a query is issued using the query terms.",
        "Then the results are compared with the seeds and their similarities are computed.",
        "The similarity values reflect the degree of relevance of search results to the user intent, based on which the results are re-ranked.",
        "Example 4 reports the Bobo experiment using the same contextual terms as in Example 3.",
        "Example 4 As in Example 3, suppose we know Jim Gray has David DeWitt as a colleague.",
        "Then with Bobo, we can enter \"Jim Gray\" in the query box and \"David DeWitt\" in the auxiliary box.",
        "As a result with default preferences, all the top 10 results are relevant including all the top 3 important Jim Gray pages.",
        "From the top 10, only 1 page, the DBLP entry, contains \"DavidDe-Witt\" as they coauthored papers.",
        "The theme of the query is not altered whereas in Example 3, all the top 10 results contain \"David DeWitt\".",
        "In Example 4, the selected seeds are relevant to Jim Gray.",
        "Observe that seeds can be useful if they are relevant to the user-intended domain, not only the user-intended query.",
        "Bobo works effectively with such seeds and thus can utilize a much expanded range of domain knowledge.",
        "Helpful contextual terms do not even need to co-occur with query terms on any page.",
        "They only need to occur, possibly separately, on some pages of the same domain, as demonstrated in Example 5.",
        "Example 5 Using the criteria of being in the same community as Jim Gray but co-occuring on no web pages, we randomly chose a student name, Flavia Moser.",
        "In Bobo, we entered \"Jim Gray\" in the query box, \"Flavia Moser\" in the auxiliary box, and used only the contextual terms for the round I query.",
        "As a result, 11 of the top 12 results were relevant including all the top 3 important Jim Gray pages.",
        "Of course, none of the returned pages contains \"Flavia Moser\"."

        "The filtering problem (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Schapire et al., 1998) views disambiguation as a binary text classification task assigning documents into one of the two categories, relevant and irrelevant.",
        "The routing problem (Schütze et al., 1995; Singhal et al., 1997) differs from text classification in that search results need to be ranked instead of just classified (Gkanogiannis and Kalamboukis, 2008).",
        "term search history to build user profiles.",
        "These profiles are used on a regular basis to guide many queries.",
        "Such approaches entail little extra user involvement in search, but need to manage profiles, face the privacy issue, and swallow the inflexibility in context switch.",
        "Explicit and pseudo relevance feedback (RF) techniques (Ruthven and Lalmas, 2003; Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Manning et al., 2008) are more related to Bobo in the sense that they do not build long-term profiles.",
        "Instead, they construct a one-time search context that are used only once to guide a single query each time.",
        "Such approaches enjoy the flexibility to switch spontaneously from one domain to another in response to different information needs.",
        "RF is regarded as the most popular query reformation strategy (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).",
        "It iterates in multiple rounds, typically two, to modify a query step by step.",
        "Explicit RF asks explicit feedback from users, whereas pseudo (or blind) RF assumes relevance of top-ranked results.",
        "The problem of explicit RF is that it requires too much user involvement.",
        "Users are often reluctant to provide explicit feedback, or do not wish to prolong the search interaction.",
        "Web search engines of today do not provide this facility.",
        "Ex-cite.com initially included but dropped it due to the lack of use (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "Pseudo RF, first suggested by Croft and Harper (1979) and since widely investigated, automates the manual part of RF, so that users get improved search performance without extended interactions.",
        "Psuedo RF has been found to improve performance in the TREC ad hoc task and Cornell SMART system at TREC 4 (Buckley et al., 1995).",
        "Unfortunately, pseudo RF suffers from a major flaw, the so-called query drift problem.",
        "Query drift occurs when the feedback documents contain few or no relevant ones.",
        "In this case, search results will be routed farther away from the search intent, resulting in even worse performance.",
        "Different approaches (Mitra et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2008)have been proposed to alleviate query drift but with little success.",
        "Some queries will be improved, others will be harmed (Ruthven and Lalmas, 2003).",
        "Similarly to RF, Bobo works in two rounds.",
        "Similarly to pseudo RF, it makes use of top-ranked round I results.",
        "However, Bobo and RF differ fundamentally in various aspects.",
        "Firstly, Bobo is not a query reformation technique as RF.",
        "In RF, the automatically generated additional terms become part of the reformed query to be issued in round II, while in Bobo, the user-input contextual terms are not used in round II.",
        "The terms generated by RF may work well as contextual terms for Bobo but not the other way around.",
        "In general, effective contextual terms form a much larger set.",
        "In query reformation, it is often hard to understand why a particular document was retrieved after applying the technique (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "In Bobo, the original query is kept intact and only the ranking of search results is changed.",
        "Secondly, in RF, only query terms are used in round I queries.",
        "In Bobo, by default the combination of query terms and contextual terms, both entered by users, is used, leading to much more relevant seeds that are comparable to explicit RF.",
        "In this sense, Bobo provides a novel and effective remedy for query drift.",
        "Beyond that, Bobo can use contextual terms only to obtain seeds that are relevant to the user-intended domain and not necessarily the user-intended query, leading to effective utilization of a largely expanded range of domain knowledge.",
        "Thirdly, RF can have practical problems.",
        "The typically long queries (usually more than 20 terms) generated by RF techniques are inefficient for IR systems, resulting in high computing cost and long response time (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "In Bobo, however, both query terms (1 to 3) and contextual terms (1 to 2) are short.",
        "A round I query combining the two would typically contain 2 to 5 terms only."
