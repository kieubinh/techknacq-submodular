        "Shallow parsing which involves Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Chunking is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "It is natural to view each of these subtasks as a sequence labeling task of assigning POS/chunk labels to a given word sequence.",
        "For languages like English where annotated corpora are available in abundance these tasks can be performed with very high accuracy using data-driven machine learning techniques.",
        "Languages of the world show different levels of readiness with respect to such annotated resources and hence not all languages may provide a conducive platform for machine learning techniques.",
        "In this scenario, morphologically rich languages from the Indian subcontinent present a very interesting case.",
        "While these languages do not enjoy the resource abundance of English, their linguistic richness can be used to offset this resource deficit.",
        "Specifically, in such languages, the suffixes carry a lot of information about the category of a word which can be harnessed for shallow parsing.",
        "This is especially true in the case of verbs where suffixes like <T~ {ne}, \"ïïfT\" {naare} clearly indicate the category of the word.",
        "Further, the structure of verb groups in such languages is relatively rigid and can be used to reduce the ambiguity between main verbs and auxiliary verbs.",
        "In the current work, we aim to reduce the data requirement of machine learning techniques by appropriate feature engineering based on the characteristics of the language.",
        "Specifically, we target Marathi-a morphologically rich language-and show that a powerful morphological analyzer backed by a high coverage lexicon and a simple but accurate Verb Group Identifier (VGI) can go a long way in improving the accuracy of a state of the art sequence classifier.",
        "Further, we show that harnessing such features is the only way by which one can hope to build a high-accuracy classifier for such languages, and that simply throwing in a large amount of annotated corpora does not serve the purpose.",
        "Hence it makes more sense to invest time and money in developing good morphological analyzers for such languages than investing in annotation.",

        "Speech Tagging and 97% for Chunking using a modestly sized corpus (20K words) vindicate our claim that for morphologically rich languages linguistic knowledge plays a very important role in shallow parsing of these languages."

        "Many POS taggers have been built for English employing machine learning techniques ranging from Decision Trees (Black et al., 1992) to Graphical Models (Brants, 2000; Brill, 1995; Ratna-parkhi, 1996; Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Even hybrid taggers such as CLAWS (Garside and Smith, 1997) which combine stochastic and rule based approaches have been developed.",
        "However, most of these techniques do not focus on harnessing the morphology; instead they rely on the abundance of data which is not a very suitable proposition for some of the resource deprived languages of the Indian sub-continent.",
        "Morphological processing based taggers using a combination of hand-crafted rules and annotated corpora have been tried for Turkish (Oflazer and Kuruoz, 1994), Arabic (Tlili-Guiassa, 2006), Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999) and Modern Greek (Giorgos et al., 1999).",
        "The work on Hindi POS tagging (Singh et al., 2006) comes closest to our approach which showed that using a detailed linguistic analysis of morphosyntactic phenomena, followed by leveraging suffix information and accurate verb group identification can help to build a high-accuracy (93-94%) part of speech tagger for Hindi.",

      "heading": "3. Motivating Examples",
      "text": [
        "To explain the importance of suffix information for shallow parsing we present two motivating examples.",
        "First, consider the following Marathi sentence, haa rasta don gavaannaa jodaNaaraa VM aahe.",
        "this road two villages connecting is this is the road connectingJVM two villages.",
        "The word {jodaNaaraa} (connecting) in the above sentence is a verb and can be categorized as such by simply looking at the suffix uiiti {Naaraa} as this suffix does not appear with any other POS category.",
        "When suffix information is used as a feature a statistical POS tagger is able to identify the correct POS tag of { jodaNaaraa} even when it does not appear in the training data.",
        "Hence, using suffix information ensures that a classifier is able to learn meaningful patterns even in the absence of large training data.",
        "Next, we consider two examples for chunking.",
        "• VGNN (Gerund Verb Chunk)",
        "maaNasaane uDaNyaachaaS-VGNN prayatna kelaa.",
        "man fly try do man tried flying S-VGNN.",
        "• VGINF (Infinitival Verb Chunk)",
        "tyaane chaalaayalaaS-VGNF suruvaata kelii.",
        "he walk start did he started to walkS-VGINF.",
        "Here, we are dealing with the case of two specific verb chunks, viz., VGNN (gerund verb chunk) and VGINF (infinitival verb chunk).",
        "A chunk having a gerund always gets annotated as VGNN and a chunk having an infinitival verb always gets annotated as VGINF.",
        "Thus, the correct identification of these verb chunks boils down to the correct identification of gerunds and infinitival verb forms in the sentence which in turn depend on the careful analysis of suffix information.",
        "For example, in Marathi, the attachment of the verbal suffix \"rq--m~\" {Nyaachaa} to a verb root always results in a gerund.",
        "Similarly, the attachment of the verbal suffix \"qw\" {yalaa} to a verb root always results in an infinitival verb form.",
        "The use of such suffix information as features can thus lead to better generalization for handling unseen words and thereby reduce the need for additional training data.",
        "For instance, in the first sentence, even when the word \"usuqi^i\" {uDaNyaachaa} does not appear in the training data, a classifier which uses suffix information is able to label it correctly based on its experience of previous words having suffix \"rq-m~\" {Nyaachaa} whereas a classifier which does not use suffix information fails to classify it correctly."

        "Effect of VGI: Figures 3 and 4 show that the VGI module does not lead to any improvement in the overall accuracy.",
        "A detailed analysis showed that this is mainly because there was not much VM-VAUX ambiguity left after applying CRF model containing rich morphological features.",
        "To further illustrate our point we present the confusion matrix (see Table 3 ) for verb tags for a POS tagger using Rich-MF.",
        "Table 3 shows that there were only 347 VM tags which got wrongly tagged as VAUX and 257 VAUX tags which got wrongly tagged as VM.",
        "Thus the rich morphological features were able to take care of most VM-VAUX ambiguities in the data.",
        "However we feel that if the data contains several VM-VAUX ambiguities such as the one illustrated in the example in Section 5.3 then the VGI module would come in play and help to boost the performance by resolving such ambiguities."
