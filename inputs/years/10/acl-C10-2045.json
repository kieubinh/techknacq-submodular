        "We presented a probabilistic topic modeling approach that reveals some of the structure of human model summaries.",
        "The topic model is trained on the term-sentence matrix of a set of human summaries, and discovers semantic topics in a completely unsupervised fashion.",
        "Many of the topics identified by our model for a given set of summaries show a similar distribution over words as the manually annotated Summary Content Units of the summaries' Pyramid.",
        "We utilized the word distributions of SCUs and topics to match topics to similar SCUs, and showed that the topics identified by the model often occur in the same sentences as the contributors of the corresponding SCU.",
        "Precision and recall of these topic-sentence assignments are very high when compared to the SCU-sentence associations, indicating that many of the automatically acquired topics are good approximations of SCUs.",
        "Our results suggest that a topic model can be used to learn a candidate set of SCUs to facilitate the process of Pyramid creation.",
        "We note that the topic model that we applied is one of the simplest latent variable models.",
        "A more complex model could integrate syntax to relax the bag-of-words assumption (Wallach, 2006), or combine the statistical model with more linguistically-grounded methods to handle linguistic features such as enumerations or negation."
