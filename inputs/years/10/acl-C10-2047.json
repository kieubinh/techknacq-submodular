        "Much attention has recently been devoted to using enormous amount of web text covering an exceedingly wide range of domains as a huge knowledge resource with computers.",
        "To use web texts as knowledge resources, we need to extract information from texts that are merely sequences of words and convert them into a structured form.",
        "Although extracting information from texts as a structured form is difficult, relation extraction is a way that makes it possible to use web texts as knowledge resources.",
        "The aim of relation extraction is to extract semantically related named entity pairs, X and Y, and their relation, R, from a text as a structured form [X, Y, R].",
        "For example, the triple [Yukio Hatoyama, Japan, prime minister] would be extracted from the text \"Yukio Hatoyama is the prime minister of Japan\".",
        "This extracted triple provides important information used in information retrieval (Zhu et al., 2009) and building an ontology (Wong et al., 2010).",
        "It is possible to say that all named entity pairs that co-occur within a text are semantically related in some way.",
        "However, we define that named entity pairs are semantically related if they satisfy either of the following rules:",
        "• One entity is an attribute value of the other.",
        "• Both entities are arguments of a predicate.",
        "Following the above definition, explicit and implicit relations should be extracted.",
        "An explicit relation means that there is an expression that shows the relation between a named entity pair in a given text, while an implicit relation means that there is no such expression.",
        "For example, the triple [Yukio Hatoyama, Kunio Hatoyama, brother] extracted from the text \"Yukio Hatoyama, the Democratic Party, is Kunio Hatoyama's brother\" is an explicit relation.",
        "In contrast, the triple [Yukio Hatoyama, the Democratic Party, member] extracted from the same text is an implicit relation because there is no expression showing the relation (e.g. member) between \"Yukio Hatoyama\" and \"the Democratic Party\" in the text.",
        "Extracting triples [X, Y, R] from a text involves two tasks.",
        "One is detecting semantically related pairs from named entity pairs that co-occur in a text and the other is determining the relation between a detected pair.",
        "For the former task, various supervised learning methods (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zelenko et al., 2003; Hirano et al., 2007) and bootstrapping methods (Brin, 1998; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) have been explored to date.",
        "In contrast, for the latter task, only a few methods have been proposed so far (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Zhu et al., 2009).",
        "We therefore addressed the problem of how to determine relations between a given pair.",
        "We used a three-step approach to address this problem.",
        "The first step is to recognize an expression that shows explicit relations between a given named entity pair in a text.",
        "If no such expression is recognized, the second step is to estimate the relationship that exists between a given named entity pair that has an implicit relation.",
        "The last step is to identify synonyms of the relations that are recognized or estimated in the above steps.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the first step.",
        "The task is selecting a phrase from the text that contains a relation expression linking a given entity pair and outputting the expression as one showing the relationship between the pair.",
        "In our preliminary experiment, it was found that using only structural features of a text, such as syntactic or contextual features, is not good enough for a number of examples.",
        "For instance, the two Japanese sentences shown in Figure 1 have the same syntactic structure but (a) contains a relation expression and (b) does not.",
        "We therefore assume there are clues for recognizing relation expressions other than conventional syntactic and contextual information.",
        "In this paper, we propose a supervised learning method that includes two novel features of relational words as well as conventional syntactic and contextual features.",
        "The novel features of our method are:",
        "Inherent Feature: Some words are able to express the relations between named entities and some are not.",
        "Thus, it would be useful to know the words that inherently express these relations.",
        "Context-dependent Feature: There are a number of typical relationships that change as time passes, such as \"dating\" == \"engagement\" == \"marriage\" between persons.",
        "Furthermore, present relations are influenced by the past relations of a given named entity pair.",
        "Thus, it would be useful to know the past relations between a given pair and how the relations change as time passes.",
        "In the rest of this paper, Section 2 references related work, Section 3 outlines our method's main features and related topics, Section 4 describes our experiments and experimental results, and Section 5 briefly summarizes key points and future work to be done."

        "First, from among given entities and the candidate, we choose the one appearing last in the text as the root of the tree.",

        "If there are nodes ofthe same case marker already in the tree, the noun phrase is appended as a child of the leaf node of them.",
        "In other cases, the noun phrase is appended as a child of the root node.",
        "For example, we get the SRL tree shown in Figure 4 with the given entity pair, X = \"Miyaji2i\" and Y = \"Ishii22\", and the candidate, \"taiketsu12\", with the text (S-1, S-2).",
