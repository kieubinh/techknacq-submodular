        "Compared to relevance feedback-based re-ranking method widely adopted in the literature, this paper proposes a new method to well use three features in known negative feedbacks to identify and depress unknown negative feedbacks.",
        "The features include: 1) the minor (lower-weighted) terms in negative feedbacks; 2) hierarchical distance (HD) among feedbacks in a hierarchical clustering tree; 3) obstinateness strength of negative feedbacks.",
        "We evaluate the method on the TDT4 corpus, which is made up of news topics and their relevant stories.",
        "And experimental results show that our new scheme substantially outperforms its counterparts."

      "text": [
        "When we start out an information retrieval journey on a search engine, the first step is to enter a query in the search box.",
        "The query seems to be the most direct reflection of our information needs.",
        "However, it is short and often out of standardized syntax and terminology, resulting in a large number of negative feedbacks.",
        "Some researches focus on exploring long-term query logs to acquire query intent.",
        "This may be helpful for obtaining information relevant to specific interests but not to daily real-time query intents.",
        "Especially it is extremely difficult to determine whether the interests and which of them should be involved into certain queries.",
        "Therefore, given a query, it is important to \"locally\" ascertain its intent by using the real-time feedbacks.",
        "Intuitively it is feasible to expand the query using the most relevant feedbacks (Chum et al., 2007).",
        "Unfortunately search engines just offer \"farraginous\" feedbacks (viz. pseudo-feedback) which may involve a great number of negative feedbacks.",
        "And these negative feedbacks never honestly lag behind relevant ones in the retrieval results, sometimes far ahead because of their great literal similarity to query.",
        "These noisy feedbacks often mislead the process of learning query intent.",
        "For so long, there had no effective approaches to confirm the relevance of feedbacks until the usage of the web click-through data (Joachims et al., 2003).",
        "Although the data are sometimes incredible due to different backgrounds and habits of searchers, they are still the most effective way to specify relevant feedbacks.",
        "This arouses recent researches about learning to rank based on supervised or semi-supervised machine learning methods, where the click-through data, as the direct reflection of query intent, offer reliable training data to learning the ranking functions.",
        "Although the learning methods achieve substantial improvements in ranking, it can be found that lots of \"obstinate\" negative feedbacks still permeate retrieval results.",
        "Thus an interesting question is why the relevant feedbacks are able to describe what we really need, but weakly repel what we do not need.",
        "This may attribute to the inherent characteristics of pseudo-feedback, i.e. their high literal similarity to queries.",
        "Thus no matter whether query expansion or learning to rank, they may fall in the predicament that \"favoring\" relevant feedbacks may result in \"favoring\" negative ones, and that \"hurting\" negative feedbacks may result in \"hurting\" relevant ones.",
        "However, there are indeed some subtle differences between relevant and negative feedbacks, e.g. the minor terms (viz. low-weighted terms in texts).",
        "Although these terms are often ignored in relevance measurement because their little effect on mining relevant feedbacks that have the same topic or kernel, they are useful in distinguishing relevant feedbacks from negative ones.",
        "As a result, these minor terms provides an opportunity to differentiate the true query intent from its counterpart intents (called \"opposite intents\" thereafter in this paper).",
        "And the \"opposite intents\" are adopted to depress negative feedbacks without \"hurting\" the ranks of relevant feedbacks.",
        "In addition, hierarchical clustering tree is helpful to establish the natural similarity correlation among information.",
        "So this paper adopts the hierarchical distance among feedbacks in the tree to enhance the \"opposite intents\" based division of relevant and negative feedbacks.",
        "Finally, an obstinateness factor is also computed to deal with some obstinate negative feedbacks in the top list of retrieval result list.",
        "In fact, Teevan (Teevan et al., 2008) observed that most searchers tend to browse only a few feedbacks in the first one or two result pages.",
        "So our method focuses on improving the precision of highly ranked retrieval results.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews the related work.",
        "Section 3 describes our new irrelevance feedback-based re-ranking scheme and the HD measure.",
        "Section 4 introduces the experimental settings while Section 5 reports experimental results.",
        "Finally, Section 6 draws the conclusion and indicates future work."

      "text": [
        "Our work is motivated by information search behaviors, such as eye-tracking and click through (Joachims, 2003).",
        "Thereinto, the click-through behavior is most widely used for acquiring query intent.",
        "Up to present, several interesting features, such as click frequency and hit time on click graph (Craswell et al., 2007), have been extracted from click-through data to improve search results.",
        "However, although effective on query learning, they fail to avoid the thorny problem that even when the typed query and the click-through data are the same, their intents may not be the same for different searchers.",
        "A considerable number of studies have explored pseudo-feedback to learn query intent, thus refining page ranking.",
        "However, most of them focus on the relevant feedbacks.",
        "It is until recently that negative ones begin to receive some attention.",
        "Zhang (Zhang et al., 2009) utilize the irrelevance distribution to estimate the true relevance model.",
        "Their work gives the evidence that negative feedbacks are useful in the ranking process.",
        "However, their work focuses on generating a better description of query intent to attract relevant information, but ignoring that negative feedbacks have the independent effect on repelling their own kind.",
        "That is, if we have a king, we will not refuse a queen.",
        "In contrast, Wang (Wang et al., 2008) benefit from the independent effect from the negative feedbacks.",
        "Their method represents the opposite of query intent by using negative feedbacks and adopts that to discount the relevance of each pseudo-feedback to a query.",
        "However, their work just gives a hybrid representation of opposite intent which may overlap much with the relevance model.",
        "Although another work (Wang et al., 2007) of them filters query terms from the opposite intent, such filtering makes little effect because of the sparsity of the query terms in pseudo-feedback.",
        "Other related work includes query expansion, term extraction and text clustering.",
        "In fact, query expansion techniques are often the chief beneficiary of click-through data (Chum et al., 2007).",
        "However, the query expansion techniques via clicked feedbacks fail to effectively repel negative ones.",
        "This impels us to focus on un-clicked feedbacks.",
        "Cao (Cao et al., 2008) report the effectiveness of selecting good expansion terms for pseudo-feedback.",
        "Their work gives us a hint about the shortcomings of the one-sided usage of high-weighted terms.",
        "Lee (Lee et al., 2008) adopt a cluster-based re-sampling method to emphasize the core topic of a query.",
        "Their repeatedly feeding process reveals the hierarchical relevance of pseudo-feedback."

      "heading": "3.. RE-RANKING SCHEME",
      "text": [
        "The re-ranking scheme, as shown in Figure 1, consists of three components: acquiring negative feedbacks, measuring irrelevance feedbacks and re-ranking pseudo-feedback.",
        "Given a query and its search engine results, we start off the re-ranking process after a trigger point.",
        "The point may occur at the time when searchers click on \"next page\" or any hyperlink.",
        "All feedbacks before the point are assumed to have been seen by searchers.",
        "Thus the un-clicked feedbacks before the point will be treated as the known negative feedbacks because they attract no attention of searchers.",
        "This may be questioned because searchers often skip some hyperlinks that have the same contents as before, even if the links are relevant to their interests.",
        "However, such skip normally reflects the true searching intent because novel relevant feedbacks always have more attractions after all.",
        "p^ciijti-r(i)",
        "hhIIbI tH hi tup",
        "0_scure-l_sct>rv (i) largest ant al hottoni",
        "Another crucial step after the trigger point is to generate the opposite intent by using the known negative feedbacks.",
        "But now we temporarily leave the issue to Section 3.2 and assume that we have obtained a good representation of the opposite intent, and meanwhile that of query intent has been composed of the highly weighted terms in the known relevant feedbacks and query terms.",
        "Thus, given an unseen pseudo-feedback, we can calculate its overall ranking score predisposed to the opposite intent as follows:",
        "where the Oscore is the relevance score to the opposite intent, I score is that to the query intent and a is a weighting factor.",
        "On the basis, we re-rank the unseen feedbacks in ascending order.",
        "That is, the feedback with the largest score appears at the bottom of the ranked list.",
        "It is worthwhile to emphasize that although the overall ranking score, i.e. Rscore, looks similar to Wang (Wang et al., 2008) who adopts the inversely discounted value (i.e. the relevance score is calculated as I _ score -a-O _ score ) to re-rank feedbacks in descending order, they are actually quite different because our overall ranking score as shown in Equation (1) is designed to depress negative feedbacks, thereby achieving the similar effect to filtering.",
        "It is necessary for the representation of opposite intent to obey two basic rules: 1) the opposite intent should be much different from the query intent; and 2) it should reflect the independent effect of negative feedbacks.",
        "Given a query, it seems easy to represent its opposite intent by using a vector of high-weighted terms of negative feedbacks.",
        "However, the vector is actually a \"close relative\" of query intent because the terms often have much overlap with that of relevant feedbacks.",
        "And the overlapping terms are exactly the source of the highly ranked negative feedbacks.",
        "Thus we should throw off the overlapping terms and focus on the rest instead.",
        "In this paper, we propose two simple facilities in representing opposite intent.",
        "One is a vector of the weighted terms (except query terms) occurring in the known negative feedbacks, named as O(-q) , while another further filters out the high-weighted terms occurring in the known relevant feedbacks, named as O(-q - r).",
        "Although O(-q) filters out query terms, the terms are so sparse that they contribute little to opposite intent learning.",
        "Thus, we will not explore O(-q) further in this paper (Our preliminary experiments confirm our reasoning).",
        "In contrast, O(-q- r) not only differs from the representation of query intent due to its exclusion of query terms but also emphasize the low-weighted terms occurring in negative feedbacks due to exclusion of high-weighted terms occurring in the known relevant feedbacks.",
        "Another key issue in our re-ranking scheme is how to measure the relevance of all the feedbacks to the opposite intent, i.e. O score, thereby the ranking score R score.",
        "For simplicity, we only consider Boolean measures in employing opposite intent to calculate the ranking score Rscore.",
        "Assume that given a query, there are n known relevant feedbacks and N known negative ones.",
        "First, we adopt query expansion to acquire the representation of query intent.",
        "This is done by pouring all terms of the n relevant feedbacks and query terms into a bag of words, where all the occurring weights of each term are accumulated, and extracting n top-weighted terms to represent the query intent as I(+q + r).",
        "Then, we use the N negative feedbacks to represent the n-dimensional opposite intents O(-q - r).",
        "For any unseen pseudo-feedback u, we also represent it using an n-dimensional vector V(u) which contains its n top-weighted terms.",
        "In all the representation processes, the TFIDF weighting is adopted.",
        "Thus, for an unseen pseudo-feedback u, the relevance scores to the query intent and the opposite intent can be measured as:",
        "where B{*,*} indicates Boolean calculation:",
        "In particular, we simply set the factor a, as mentioned in Equation (1), to 1 so as to balance the effect of query intent and its opposite intent on the overall ranking score.",
        "The intuition is that if an unseen pseudo-feedback has more overlapping terms with O(-q - r) than I(+q + r), it will has higher probability of being depressed as an negative feedback.",
        "Two alternatives to the above Boolean measure are to employ the widely-adopted VSM cosine measure and Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence (Thollard et al., 2000).",
        "However, such term-weighting alternatives will seriously eliminate the effect of low-weighted terms, which is core of our negative feedback-based re-ranking scheme.",
        "The proposed method in Section 3.3 ignores two key issues.",
        "First, given a query, although search engine has thrown away most opposite intents, it is unavoidable that the pseudo-feedback still involves more than one opposite intent.",
        "However, the representation O(-q - r) has the difficulty in highlighting all the opposite intents because the feature fusion of the representation smoothes the independent characteristics of each opposite intent.",
        "Second, given several opposite intents, they have different levels of effects on the negative score O_ And the effects cannot be measured by the unilateral score.",
        "To solve the issues, we propose a hierarchical distance based negative measure, abbr.",
        "HD, which measures the distances among feedbacks in a hierarchical clustering tree, and involves them into hierarchical division of relevance score.",
        "Given two random leaves u and v in the tree, their HD score is calculated as:",
        "where re/(*,*) indicates textual similarity, w(*,*) indicates the weighted distance in the tree, which is calculated as:",
        "where m is the total number of the edges between two leaves, wi (*,*) indicates the weight of the i-th edge.",
        "In this paper, we adopt CLUTO to generate the hierarchical binary tree, and simply let each wi(*,*) equal 1.",
        "Thus the w(*,*) becomes to be the number of edges m, for example, the w(j, k) equals 5 in Figure 2.",
        "On the basis, given an unseen feedback u, we can acquire its modified re-ranking score R ' score by following steps.",
        "First, we regard each known negative feedback as an opposite intent, following the two generative rules (mentioned in section 3.2) to generate its n-dimensional representation O(-q - r).",
        "Additionally we represent both the known relevant feedbacks and the unseen feedback u as n-dimensional term vectors.",
        "Second, we cluster these feedbacks to generate a hierarchical binary tree and calculate the HD score for each pair of (u,*), where * denotes a leaf in the tree except u.",
        "Thus the modified ranking score is calculated as:",
        "where vi indicates the i-th known negative feedback in the leaves, N is the total number of",
        "v, vj indicates the j-th known relevant feedback, n is the total number of v .",
        "Besides, we still adopt Boolean value to measure the textual similarity rei(*,*) in both clustering process and ranking score calculation, thus the HD score in the formula (6) can be calculated as follows:",
        "Additionally we involve an interesting feature, i.e. the obstinate degree, into our re-ranking scheme.",
        "The degree is represented by the rank of negative feedbacks in the original retrieval results.",
        "That is, the more \"topping the list\" an negative feedback is, the more obstinate it is.",
        "Therefore we propose a hypothesis that if a feedback is close to the obstinate feedback, it should be obstinate too.",
        "Thus given an unseen feedback u, its relevance to an opposite intent in HD can be modified as:",
        "where rnk indicates the rank of the opposite intent in original retrieval results (Note: in HD, every known negative feedback is an opposite intent), â€“ is a smoothing factor.",
        "Because ascending order is used in our re-ranking process, by the weighting coefficient, i.e. (1 + ÃŸ / rnk), the feedback close to the obstinate opposite intents will be further depressed.",
        "But the coefficient is not commonly used.",
        "In HD, we firstly ascertain the feedback closest to u, and if the feedback is known to be negative, set to vmax, we will use the Equation (8) to punish the pair of (u, vmax ) alone, otherwise without any punishment."

        "So we just regard the improvements benefiting from high click-through rate as an ideal status, and still adopt the practical numerical value of N and N, i.e. n = N =5, to run following test.",
        "A surprising result is that Exp-sys always achieves the worst MAP value, even worse than the basic search engine even if high value of N is in use, such as the performance when N equal 9 in Table 4.",
        "It seems to be difficult to question the reasonability of the system because it always selects the most key terms to represent query intent by query expansion.",
        "But an obvious difference between Exp-sys and other re-ranking systems could explain the result.",
        "That is the query terms consistently involved in query representation by Exp-sys.",
        "In fact, Wng-sys1 never overly favor the query terms because they are not always the main body of an independent feedback, and our systems even remove the query terms from the opposite intent directly.",
        "Conversely Exp-sys continuously enhances the weights of query terms which result in over-fitting and bias.",
        "The visible evidence for this is shown in Figure 4, where Exp-sys achieves better Precision and NDCG than the basic search engine at the top of result list but worse at the subsequent parts.",
        "The results illustrate that too much emphasis placed on query terms in query expansion is only of benefit to elevating the originally high-ranked relevant feedback but powerless to pull the straggler out of the bottom of result list.",
        "Obviously Wang (Wang et al., 2008) has noticed the negative effects of query terms on re-ranking.",
        "Therefore his work (reproduced by Wng-sys1, 2, 3 in this paper) avoids arbitrarily enhancing the terms in query representation, even removes them as Wng-sys3.",
        "This indeed contributes to the improvement of the re-ranking system, such as the better performances of Wng-sysl, 2, 3 shown in Table 3, although Wng-sys3 has no further improvement than Wng-sys2 because of the sparsity of query terms.",
        "On the basis, the work regards the terms in negative feedbacks as noises and reduces their effects on relevance measure as much as possible.",
        "This should be a reasonable scheme, but interestingly it does not work well in our experiments.",
        "For example, although Wng-sys2 and Wng-sys3 eliminate the relevance score calculated by using the terms in negative feedbacks, they perform worse than Wng-sysl which never make any discount.",
