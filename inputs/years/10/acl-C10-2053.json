        "With the rapid development of the Internet, the online document archive is increasing quickly with a growing speed.",
        "Such a large volume and the rapid growth pose great challenges for document searching, indexing, and cataloging.",
        "To facilitate these processes, many concepts have been proposed, such as Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al., 2001), Ontologies (Gruber, 1993), Open Directory Projects like Dmoz, folksonomies (Hotho et al., 2006), and social tagging systems like Flickr and CiteULike.",
        "Annotating documents or web-pages using Ontologies and Open Directories are often limited to a manually controlled vocabulary (developed by service providers) and a small number of expert annotators, which we call service-centric annotation.",
        "By contrast, social tagging systems in which registered users can freely use arbitrary words to tag images, documents or web-pages, belong to user-centric annotation.",
        "Although many advantages have been reported in user-centric annotation, low-quality and undesired annotations are always observed due to uncontrolled user behaviors (Xu et al., 2006; Sigurbjörnsson and Zwol, 2008).",
        "Moreover, the vocabulary involved in user-centric annotation is arbitrary, unlimited, and rapid-growing in nature, causing more difficulties in tag-based searching and browsing (Bao et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007).",
        "Service-centric annotation is of importance for managing online documents, particularly in serving high-quality repositories of scientific literature.",
        "For example, in biomedicine, Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) annotation has been for a decade an influential research topic of unifying reliable biological knowledge from the vast amount of biomedical literature.",
        "Document annotation can also greatly help service providers such as ACM/IEEE portals to provide better user experience of search.",
        "Much work has been devoted to digital document annotation, such as ontology-based (Corcho, 2006) and semantic-oriented (Eriksson, 2007).",
        "This paper focuses on service-centric annotation.",
        "Our task is to assign an input document a list of entries.",
        "The entries are predefined by a controlled vocabulary.",
        "Due to the data availability, we study the documents and vocabulary in the biomedical domain.",
        "We first analyze human annotation behaviors in two millions previously annotated documents.",
        "When compared to user-centric annotation, we found that the two annotation processes have major differences and that they also share some common grounds.",
        "Next, we propose to annotate new articles with a learning method based on the assumption that documents similar in content share similar annotations.",
        "To this end, we utilize a logistic regression algorithm with a set of novel features.",
        "We evaluate our approach with extensive experiments and compare it to the state of the art.",

        "Second, we develop an automatic method for annotating scientific publications with significant improvements over other systems.",

      "text": [
        "Analyzing annotation behaviors can greatly facilitate assessing annotation quality, reliability, and consistency.",
        "There has been some work on analyzing social tagging behaviors in user-centric annotation systems (Sigurbjörnsson and Zwol, 2008; Suchanek et al., 2008).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such analysis on service-centric annotation.",
        "In social tagging systems, no specific skills are required for participating; thus users can tag the resources with arbitrary words (the words may even be totally irrelevant to the content, such as \"todo\").",
        "By contrast, in service-centric annotation, the annotators must be trained, and they must comply with a set of strict guidelines to assure the consistent annotation quality.",
        "Therefore, it is valuable to study the differences between the two annotation processes.",
        "To investigate annotation behaviors, we downloaded 2 million documents from PubMed, one of the largest search portals for biomedical articles.",
        "These articles were published from Jan. 1, 2000 to Dec. 31, 2008.",
        "All these documents have been manually annotated by National Library Medicine (NLM) human curators.",
        "The controlled vocabulary used in this system is the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH®), a thesaurus describing various biomedical topics such as diseases, chemicals and drugs, and organisms.",
        "There are 25,588 entries in the vocabulary in 2010, and there are updates annually.",
        "By comparison, the vocabulary used in user-centric annotation is remarkably larger (usually more than 1 million tags) and more dynamic (may be updated every day).",
        "First, we examine the distribution of the number of annotated entries in the document collection.",
        "For each number of annotated entries, we counted the number of documents with respect to different numbers of annotations.",
        "The number of annotations per document among these 2 million documents varies from 1 (with 176,383 documents) to 97 (with one document only).",
        "The average number of annotations per document is 10.10, and the standard deviation is 5.95.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "The original distribution and simulated normal distribution.",
        "Each data point denotes the number of documents (y-axis) that has the corresponding number of entries (x-axis).",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, when there are more than 4 annotations, the distribution fits a normal distribution.",
        "Comparing with user-centric annotation, there are three notable observations: a), the maximal number of annotations per document (97) is much smaller (in social tagging systems the number amounts to over 10) due to much less annotators involved in service-centric annotation than users in user-centric annotation; b), the number of annotations assigned to documents conforms to a normal distribution, which has not yet been reported in user-centric annotation; c), similar to user-centric annotation, the number of documents that have only one annotation accounts for a large proportion.",
        "Second, we investigate whether the Zipf law (Zipf, 1949) holds in service-centric annotation.",
        "To this end, we ranked all the entries according to the frequency of being annotated to documents.",
        "We plotted the curve in logarithm scale, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "The curve can be simulated by a linear function in logarithm scale if ignoring the tail which corresponds to very infrequently used entries.",
        "To further justify this finding, we ranked all the documents according to the number of assigned annotations and plotted the curve in logarithm scale, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "Similar phenomenon is observed.",
        "In conclusion, the Zipf law also holds in service-centric annotation, just as reported in user-centric annotation (Sigurbjörnsson and Zwol, 2008).",
        "Figure 2.",
        "The distribution of annotated entry frequency.",
        "X-axis is the rank of entries (ranking by the annotation frequency), and y-axis is the frequency of an entry being used in annotation.",

        "The distribution of the number of annotated entries.",
        "X-axis is the rank of a document (in log10 scale), and y-axis is the number of annotations assigned to documents (in log2 scale).",
        "Furthermore, as mentioned in Section 2, the vocabulary corresponds to a hierarchy tree once a set of binary relations were defined.",
        "Thus we can easily obtain the minimal, maximal, and average depth of an entry.",
        "The larger depth an entry has, the more specific meaning it has.",

        "AnnoDepth where Dep(VE) is the minimal, maximal, or average depth of an entry, f(VE) is the usage frequency of VE in annotation, and |V| is the number of entries in the vocabulary.",
        "The two formulas are actually the mathematical expectations of the hierarchy's depth under two distributions respectively: a uniform distribution (1/|V|) and the annotation distribution (formula (3)).",
        "As shown in Table 1, the two expectations are close.",

        "From Figure 4, we can see that there is imbalance with respect to the annotations in different categories.",
        "Category \"diseases\" has 473.5 annotations per entry (totally 4408 entries in this category).",
        "Category \"chemicals and drugs\" has 423.0 annotations per entry (with 8815 entries in total).",
        "Due to the fact that diseases and chemicals and drugs are hot scientific topics, these categories are largely under-annotated.",
        "The most frequently annotated category is: \"named groups\" (7144.4 annotations per entry), with 199 entries in total.",
        "The issue of imbalanced categorization may be due to that the topics of the document collection are of imbalance; and that the vocabulary was updated annually, so that the latest entries were used less frequently.",
        "As shown in (Si-gurbjörnsson and Zwol, 2008), this imbalance issue was also observed in user-centric annotation, such as in Flickr Tagging."

        "As for the task tackled in this paper, i.e., annotating biomedical publications, three genres of approaches have been proposed: (1) k-Nearest Neighbor model: selecting annotations from neighboring documents, ranking and filtering those annotations (Vasuki and Cohen, 2009; Tri-eschnigg et al., 2009).",

        "Service-centric and user-centric annotations have in common that the Zipf law holds and categorization imbalance exists.",
        "Based on these observations, we introduced a logistic regression approach to annotate publications, with novel features.",
        "Significant improvements over other systems were obtained on a benchmark dataset.",
        "Although our features are tailored for this task in biomedicine, this approach may be generalized for similar tasks in other domains."
