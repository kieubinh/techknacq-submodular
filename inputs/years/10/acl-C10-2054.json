        "When creating comparable corpora, the key process is to align the source document with relevant target documents.",

        "Figure 1 shows the general architecture of our comparable corpora construction system.",
        "It consists of two components: component I and component II.",
        "Component I is mainly composed by a web crawler, which is used to harvest source and target documents from selected web sites.",
        "We can get the final source and target document sets through content extraction and noise filtering.",
        "The core of the system is component II, which aligns a source document with target documents having comparable contents.",
        "It implements on the two document sets generated by component I.",
        "Component II is composed of three modules: keyword extraction, keyword translation, and retrieval & filtering.",
        "The methods for three modules are detailed respectively.",
        "Keyword Extraction",
        "A keyword is described as a meaningful and significant expression containing one or more words.",
        "Appropriate keywords briefly describe the theme of comparable corpora construction of a document.",
        "In this paper, keywords are viewed as basic units of search indexes in order to retrieve closely related documents.",
        "Generally, phrases can capture the main idea of a document more effectively, inasmuch as they have more information than single words (an independent linguistic unit after word segmentation for Chinese).",
        "Existing approaches for keyword extraction could be distinguished into two main categories: supervised or unsupervised methods.",
        "Supervised machine learning algorithms were widely used in keyword extraction such as Naïve Bayes (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999), SVM (Zhang et al., 2006), CRF (Zhang et al., 2008), etc.",
        "These approaches had excellent stability.",
        "However, it was difficult for us to construct a big-enough golden annotated corpus to train a good classifier, especially for news web pages.",
        "Unsupervised methods hinged on evaluating various features to select keywords, such as word frequency (Luhn, 1957), word co-occurrence (Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004), and TF*IDF (Li et al., 2007).",
        "The inherent problem in these methods was that most of their work came in the judgment whether a candidate was a keyword or not, but they had not paid sufficient attention to the identification of phrase candidates.",
        "Wan and Xiao (2008) proposed a method for keyphrase extraction from single document.",
        "However, it simply combined the adjacent candidate words to a multi-word phrase.",
        "Based on the above observation, our approach for keyword extraction focuses more on the construction of phrasal candidates.",
        "It is mainly based on MWE (Multi-Word Expression) extraction together with relevant word ranking method.",
        "MWE is a special lexical unit including compound terms, idioms and collocations, etc.",
        "The process of keyword extraction in this paper mainly depends on the following stages.",
        "Stage 1: The generation of phrasal candidates (1) The extraction of MWEs from the preprocessed document",
        "Document preprocessing is a procedure of morphological analysis including segmentation and part of speech tagging for Chinese.",
        "The method based on the marginal probabilities detailed in (Luo and Huang, 2009) is adopted in this part.",
        "We extract MWEs using LocalMaxs selection algorithm together with a relevance measure calculation method (FSCP) proposed by Silva et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "Suffix arrays and related structures in (Aires et al., 2008) are used to compute the FSCP value so as to raise efficiency.",
        "And the initial collection of MWEs named G for the document is generated after filtered by stopword list.",
        "(2) The acquisition of new MWEs through the modification for segmentation",
        "As a matter of fact, the results of segmentation for the document usually have some errors especially for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words which are segmented to single Chinese characters in most cases.",
        "Inaccurate segmentation leads to some faults for keyword extraction.",
        "As stated in (Liu et al., 2007), OOV words can be identified by the method of MWEs extraction mentioned above.",
        "Therefore, we modify the segmentation like this: any MWE in G is merged to one word if it only consists of single Chinese characters and its frequency > freq.",
        "The changes before and after merging are shown in Table 1.",
        "Because the method of MWE extraction is based on statistical techniques, so low frequency of MWE will result in poor performance.",
        "But large value for freq means that very few MEWs can satisfy the frequency restriction.",
        "In our experiments, we set freq=2.",
        "The extraction process is called again to identify MWEs from the document with modified segmentation.",
        "Consequently, new collection of MWEs is acquired.",
        "Additionally, some simple rules are defined according to language features to filter MWEs.",
        "In this paper, our method is tailored to extract keywords from news web pages which contain some special symmetric marks like \" l~, J \".",
        "The words in a specially marked area are usually important to the document.",
        "So we extract words within each paired marks and view them as a MWE on the condition that it contains two or more than two words.",
        "All of the MWEs are viewed as phrasal candidates and filtered by stopword list.",
        "Stage 2: The generation of single words candidates",
        "Our method also generates single word candidates with the account that both phrase and single word can be served as a keyword.",
        "The process of single word selection is independent of MWE extraction.",
        "The candidate words are restricted to nouns, verbs, strings (like WTO) and merged words as discussed in the previous stage.",
        "But the word will be removed if it only appears once in the document or is contained in the stopword list.",
        "Stage 3: Keyword selection based on candidates ranking",
        "As for MWE candidates, we calculate the weight for them using Formula 1 which refers to the formula used to sort NP phrases in (Brace-well et al., 2008).",
        "But the weight of len is reduced.",
        "Weight(MWE) ■■",
        "len + fMWE +",
        "Where len is the length of MWE (in number of words); fMWE is the frequency of the MWE within in the document; tf(wi) is the frequency of word wi.",
        "The following rules are used to rank MWEs:",
        "Segmentation before merging",
        "Segmentation after merging before merging",
        "Pos after merging (a) more frequent MWEs are ranked higher; (b) MWEs with larger weight are ranked higher.",
        "In order to avoid redundancy, we remove the redundant MWEs with lower rank.",
        "Single word candidates are ranked as follows: (a) the single word w with larger TF*IDF value is ranked higher; (b) the pos score for w in descending order is: named entity, merged words, nouns, strings, verbs.",
        "In the end, top-a MWEs and top-b single words are chosen to form the keyword set of the document.",
        "Stage 4: Parameters evaluation and experimental results",
        "The max number of keywords extracted from each document is limited to ten (a+b=10) and we run our approach on the dataset which include one hundred Chinese documents from the corpus of NTCIR-5 since they are also news articles.",
        "For evaluation of the results, the keywords extracted by our method are compared with the manually extracted keywords (at most ten keywords are assigned to each document).",
        "The F-measure is used as evaluation metric.",
        "It is defined like this: F=(P+R)/2; P=nummatch/numsystem, R=nummatch/nummanual.",
        "Where nummatch is the count of keywords extracted by our method matching with manually extracted keywords; numsystem is the count of keywords extracted by our method; nummanual is the count of keywords assigned by human.",
        "Figure 2 shows the performance curves for our extraction method.",
        "In this figure, a ranges from 0 to 10 while b is 10 to 0.",
        "It performs best when a = 4 and b = 6.",
        "So the two values are adopted in this paper.",
        "We test our approach on another dataset which also contains one hundred documents.",
        "In the experiments, the max number of keywords is set to ten.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of keyword extraction under three different conditions respectively.",
        "(A) Only extracts single words as keywords while just MWEs with (B).",
        "(C) The method presented in this paper which makes a proper combination of MWEs and single words.",
        "As for keyword translation, there are three main approaches: translation based on dictionary, parallel corpora and machine translation.",
        "Dictionary based approach is adopted in our system by taking the acquisition of translation resource into account.",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and OOV problem are the main difficulties in CLIR (Cross Language Information Retrieval) task.",
        "A typical bilingual dictionary will provide a set of alternative translations for a given keyword, so how to choose the optimal translation is called Word Sense Disambiguation.",
        "Actually some keywords can not be found and translated due to the coverage limitation of a bilingual dictionary, which is called OOV problem.",
        "In this paper, the keyword is given up if its size of translations gained from the bilingual dictionary is larger than two for the convenience of WSD.",
        "Additionally, both of the translations are treated as synonyms and equal weight is assigned to them when retrieval.",
        "To address the OOV problem, researchers proposed methods using snippets returned by a search engine.",
        "For example, Wang et al.",
        "(2004) introduced a statistics-based approach called SCPCD to mine translations from the returned snippets.",
        "Different from (Wang et al., 2004), Zhou et al.",
        "(2007) used a pattern-based approach to analyze the mixed-languages snippets.",
        "Leveraging on previous work, we analyze the co-occurrence mode of the OOV term and the corresponding translation in the returned snippets.",
        "Table 3 shows the typical co-occurrence modes collected during experiments, where the English words in bold are the corresponding translations of the underlined Chinese OOV terms.",
        "From Table 3, we can see the translations in number 1, 2 and 3 are included in the symmetric symbols, like bracket, quotation marks.",
        "However, the translations in number 4, 5, and 6 are embedded in the partial sentence while there are noise English words.",
        "In order to get the correct translation, the partial sentence needs to be segmented.",
        "By above analysis, we integrate the SCPCD method and the pattern-based method so as to extract more correct translations.",
        "The SCPCD method can be used to determine the boundaries for OOVs like number 4, 5, and 6; while pattern-based method makes use of the symmetric symbols like number 1, 2 and 3.",

        "Seen from Table 6 and 7, DSKF is better than DSF by considering the two standards.",
        "Compared with DSF, more high relevant pairs are left filtered by DSKF when they have the same total number of pairs.",
        "In other words, the DSKF method is more powerful to make high relevant pairs in higher rank so as to reduce alignment pairs which are rarely relevant.",

        "Then the core content of each document is extracted through discriminating noise contents.",
        "Next, we delve into the approaches of problems such as keyword extraction and OOV translation followed by the process of retrieval to develop mapping correlations between source and target documents.",
        "Finally, three features as publication date, similarity score and KSD value are used to filter the aligned document pairs.",
        "Experimental results show that our approach is effective to mine Chinese-English document pairs with comparable contents.",
        "In the future, we will optimize the approach for every module in the construction of comparable corpora for the sake of improving the performance of the whole system.",
        "What's more, it will be worth consideration to mine mappings between terms which can be served as a feature for the process of developing mappings between document pairs in turn.",
