        "Token merging applies to polylexical units, syntactic or para-textual structures.",
        "We distinguish two main types of resources that can be projected on raw texts in order to enrich them.",

        "The projection of this type of resources in textual corpora is quite simple.",
        "After identifying a token, the program only needs to check if the token is included in the resource and add the information units associated with it.",
        "The second type of resources contains a set of rules and a set of canonical forms (usually the lemma but not necessarily).",
        "These sets are used jointly, to produce all the inflected forms or to analyse the tokens.",
        "Analysis consists in determining, for a given inflected form, which rule was used, on which canonical form, in order to generate it.",

        "These lists are most often the result of inflection engines that use canonical forms and inflection rules to generate the inflected forms.",

        "Regarding the lexicon, the model allows for clusters.",
        "We distinguish three levels:",
        "• the inflection level: determine how to produce a derived form from a base form ; the atomic processing unit here is the character (i.e. local transformation).",

        "A verbatim description of a language does not allow for the analysis of unknown words even if their inflection is regular.",

        "The concept of inflection varies depending on the language.",
        "We must build a system capable of dealing with all types of affixation (prefixation, suffixation or infixation).",
        "The treatment of Arabic is from this point ofview a good indicator since it uses all three types of affixation.",
        "5.",
        "An inflection rule, applied to a canonical form, is never completely autonomous ; it is part of a group.",
        "For instance, we group together all the inflections of a verb type, for all tenses.",
