        "Sentiment analysis of English employs various statistical and linguistic methods referencing such linguistic resources as The Berkeley Parser and SentiWordNet.",
        "In the case of Korean, however, most previous works have been confined to statistical methods which focus either on the frequency of words or relevance of co-occurring words only.",
        "This is because it is hard to find proper resources due to the nature of Korean, exhibiting such features as rich functional morphemes, a relatively free word-order and frequent deletion of primary elements of sentences like the subject and object.",
        "The major drawbacks of statistical-based approaches are the facts that the 'real' meaning of the expressions which we feel when we read them cannot be reflected in the analysis, and that complex statistical measuring methods are computationally taxing.",
        "In this paper, in order to overcome previous shortcomings, while making use of Korean case studies we propose a new approach for morphologically rich languages that makes effective use of linguistic information such as the semantic classes of words, semantic scope of negation terms like not, no, and the functional meaning of modal affixes.",
        "Especially, this approach makes chunk structures by using dependency relation of morpheme sequences to limit the semantic scope of influence of opinionated terms.",
        "This chunking method is simpler and more efficient than total syntactic parsing.",
        "In addition, we utilize subjectivity clues and contextual shifters whose effectiveness is established in previous references.",
        "The contents of this paper are as follows: firstly, we review previous works related to our approaches.",
        "We follow up by introducing the framework and main processes of our approach are introduced.",
        "Finally, we describe our experiments and show how a linguistic approach is feasible in sentiment analysis of Korean as a morphologically rich language."

        "Therefore we suggest a new morphological chunking method that binds semantically related concatenations of morphemes.",

        "Our approach focuses on the role of contextual shifters as well.",

        "Sentiment Analysis: The results of sentiment analysis on the three groups of news data are summarized in Figure 3.",
        "The white points in Figure 3 are the values being larger than the baseline, the results using TFIDF.",
        "First of all, all of our proposed classification methods get higher results than TFIDF, except in the case of F-measure of subjective News data.",
        "This shows that using language-specific features which inflect the target language's linguistic characteristics well, without complex mathematical measuring techniques, we could get better results than statistical methods in sentiment classification.",
        "Secondly, similar to the result of movie review corpora, mostly subjective data shows greatly improved results in experimental methods overall.",
        "This means that our subjectivity extraction works successfully.",
        "Finally, in contrast to the results of experiment 1, we get higher values of sentiment classification by using chunking and contextual shifters.",
        "This implies that the restriction on semantic scope of opinionated terms and the methods reducing features and properly modifying values of polarity terms by using contextual shifters also have merits in sentiment analysis of data such as news which has complex sentence structure like news.",
        "Furthermore, this tendency is noticeable particularly in the subjective data of all three groups.",
        "This confirms the effectiveness of utilizing linguistic methods in subjectivity extraction and sentiment analysis for news data which tries to maintain objectivity."
