        "We can see that our method was able to cover a relatively wide range of contrastive relations on the topics on which our method successfully extracted contrastive keyword pairs.",
        "To detect such unidentified contrastive relations, it is necessary to robustly extract contrastive keyword pairs.",
        "In the future, we will employ a bootstrapping approach to identify patterns of direct contrastive statements and contrastive keyword pairs.",
