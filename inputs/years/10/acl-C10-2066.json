        "Speech understanding in spoken dialogue systems is the process of extracting a semantic representation from a user's speech.",
        "That is, it consists of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language understanding (LU).",
        "Because vocabularies and language expressions depend on individual systems, it needs to be constructed for each system, and accordingly, training data are required for each.",
        "To collect more real training data, which will lead to higher performance, it is more desirable to use a prototype system than that based on the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) method where real ASR errors cannot be observed, and to use a more accurate speech understanding module.",
        "That is, in the bootstrapping phase, spoken dialogue systems need to operate before sufficient real data have been collected.",
        "We have been addressing the issue ofrapid prototyping on the basis of the \"Multiple Language model for ASR and Multiple language Understanding (MLMU)\" framework (Katsumaru et al., 2009).",
        "In MLMU, the most reliable speech understanding result is selected from candidates produced by various combinations of multiple ASR and LU modules using hand-crafted grammar and statistical models.",
        "A grammar-based method is still effective at an early stage of system development because it does not require training data; Schapire et al.",
        "(2005) also incorporated human-crafted prior knowledge into their boosting algorithm.",
        "By combining multiple understanding modules, complementary results can be obtained by different kinds of ASR and LU modules.",
        "We propose a novel method to allocate available training data to statistical modules when the amount of training data increases.",
        "The training data need to be allocated adaptively because there are several modules to be trained, and they would cause overfitting without data allocation.",
        "There are speech understanding modules that have language models (LMs) for ASR and LU models (LUMs), and a selection module that selects the most reliable speech understanding result from multiple candidates in the MLMU framework.",
        "When the amount of available training data is small, and an LUM and the selection module are trained on the same data set, they are trained under a closed-set condition, and thus the training data for the selection module include too many correct understanding results.",
        "In such cases, the data need to be divided into subdata sets to avoid overfitting.",
        "On the other hand, when the amount of available training data is large, so that overfit-ting does not occur, all available data should be used to train each statistical module to prepare as much training data as possible.",
        "We therefore develop a method for switching data allocation policies.",
        "More specifically, two points are automatically determined at which statistical modules with more parameters start to be trained.",
        "As a result, better overall performance is achieved at every point while the amount of training data increases, compared with all combinations of a single ASR module and a single LU module."

        "It is important to consider the amount of available training data when designing a speech understanding module.",
        "Many statistical LU methods have been studied, e.g., (Wang and Acero, 2006; Jeong and Lee, 2006; Raymond and Riccardi, 2007; Hahn et al., 2008; Dinarelli et al., 2009).",
        "They generally outperform grammar-based LU methods when a sufficient amount of training data is available; but sufficient training data are not necessarily available during rapid prototyping.",
        "Several LU methods were constructed using a small amount of training data (Fukubayashi et al., 2008; Dinarelli et al., 2009).",
        "Fukubayashi et al.",
        "(2008) constructed an LU method based on the weighted finite state transducer (WFST), in which filler transitions accepting arbitrary inputs and transition weights were added to a hand-crafted FST.",
        "This method is placed between a grammar-based method and a statistical method because a statistically selected weighting scheme is applied to a hand-crafted grammar model.",
        "Therefore, the amount of training data can be smaller compared with general statistical LU methods, but this method does not outperform them when plenty of training data are available.",
        "Dinarelli et al.",
        "(2009) used a generative model for which overfitting is less prone to occur than discriminative models when the amount of training data is small, but they did not use a grammar-based model, which is expected to achieve reasonable performance even when the amount of training data is very small.",
        "Raymond et al.",
        "(2007) compared the performances of statistical LU methods for various amounts of training data.",
        "They used a statistical finite-state transducer (SFST) as a generative model and a support vector machine (SVM) and conditional random fields (CRF) as discriminative models.",
        "The generative model was more effective when the amount of data was small, and the discriminative models were more effective when it was large.",
        "This shows that the performance of an LU method depends on the amount of training data available, and therefore, LU methods need to be switched automatically.",
        "Wang et al.",
        "(2002) developed a two-stage speech understanding method by applying statistical methods first and then grammatical rules.",
        "They also examined the performance of the statistical methods at their first stage for various amounts of training data and confirmed that the performance is not very high when a small amount of data is used.",
        "Schapire et al.",
        "(2005) showed that accuracy of call classification in spoken dialogue systems improved by incorporating hand-crafted prior knowledge into their boosting algorithm.",
        "Their idea is the same as ours in that they improve the system's performance by using hand-crafted human knowledge while only a small amount of training data is available.",
        "We furthermore solve the data allocation problem because there are multiple statistical models to be trained in speech understanding, while their call classification has only one statistical model."

        "In the first phase, the first priority is given to the selection module.",
        "This is because the logistic regression functions used in the selection module converge with relatively less training data than those in the statistical ASR and LU modules for speech understanding; there are eight parameters for each logistic regression function as shown in Equation 1, far fewer than for other statistical models such as N-gram and CRF.",
        "The output from a speech understanding module that employs grammar-based LM and LUM would be the most reliable in many cases because its performance is better than that of other statistical modules when a very small amount of training data is available.",
        "As a result, equivalent or better performance would be achieved than methods using a single ASR module and a single LU module.",
        "In the second phase, the training data are also allocated to the speech understanding modules after the selection module converges.",
        "This aims to improve the performance of the speech understanding modules by allocating as much training data to them as possible.",
        "The amount of training data is fixed in this phase to the amount allocated to the selection module determined in the first phase.",

        "All available data are used to train all modules without dividing the data in this phase.",
        "Automatic switching from one phase to the next requires the determination of two points in the number of training utterances: when the selection module first converges (kmiysei) and when the speech understanding modules all become stable (knodiv).",
        "These points are determined by focusing on the changes in the coefficients of the logistic regression functions when the number of utterances used as training data increases.",
        "We observe the sum of the changes in the coefficients of the functions and then identify the points at which the changes converge.",
        "The points are determined individually by the following algorithm.",

        "Here, \"LM+LUM\" denotes a combination of LM for ASR and LUM.",
        "If the function converges at k utterances, we set konlysel to k and fix the k utterances as training data used by the selection module.",
        "The remaining (kmax - k) utterances are allocated to the speech understanding modules, that is, the LMs and LUMs.",
        "Note that if k becomes equal to kmax before Ai converges, all training data are allocated to the selection module; that is, no data are allocated to the LMs and LUMs.",
        "In this case, no output is obtained from statistical speech understanding modules, and only outputs from the grammar-based modules are used.",

        "Our method switched the allocation phase at 111 and 207 utterances, as described in Section 5.3.",
        "Our method performed equivalently or better than all baseline methods even when only a small amount of training data was available.",

        "6 Conclusion",
        "We developed a method to automatically allocate training data to statistical modules so as to avoid performance degradation caused by overfit-ting.",
        "Experimental evaluation showed that speech understanding accuracies achieved by our method were equivalent or better than the baseline methods based on all combinations of a single ASR module and a single LU module at every point while training data increase.",
        "This includes a case when a very small amount oftraining data is available.",
        "We also showed empirically that the training data should be allocated while an amount of training data is not sufficient.",
        "Our method allocated available training data on the basis of our allocation policy described in Section 4.1, and outperformed the two baselines where the training data were equivalently allocated and not allocated.",
        "When plenty of training data were available, there was no difference between our method and the speech understanding method that requires the most training data, i.e., N-gram+CRF, as shown in Figure 6.",
        "It is possible that our method combining multiple speech understanding modules would outperform it as Schapire et al.",
        "(2005) reported.",
        "In their data, there were some examples that only a hand-crafted rules can parse.",
        "Including such a task as more complicated language understanding grammar is required, verification of our method in other tasks is one of the future works.",
