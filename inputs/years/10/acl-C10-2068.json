        "Implicit relevance feedback serves as a great source of information about user behaviour and search context.",
        "A lot of research went through in the recent past in making use of this great pool of information.",
        "Relevance feedback is proven to significantly improve retrieval performance (Har-man, 1992; Salton and Buckley, 1990).",
        "It has also been successfully used to improve searching ranking, query expansion, personalization, user profiling etcetera (Steve Fox et al.,, 2005; Rocchio, 1999;Xuehua et al., 2005).",
        "Clickthrough data is the most prevalent form of implicit feedback used by researchers for personalization purposes.",
        "Click log data provides valuable information about the interests, preferences and semantic search intent of the user (Daniel and Levinson, 2004; Kelly and Belkin, 2001).",
        "Unlike explicit feedback, clicks logs do not require any special effort from the user (Rocchio, 1999).",
        "It is collected in the background while the user interacts with the search engine to quench his information need.",
        "Hence, it is easy and feasible to collect large amounts of clickthrough data.",
        "However, using clickthrough data has its own share of problems.",
        "Firstly, it is not available for public or even research communities at large for reasons like being a potential threat to privacy of web users.",
        "Secondly, it only contains the URLs of the results that the user clicked and does not contain the documents that the user has chosen.",
        "Given the dynamic nature of the web, content of many of the urls is prone to change and in some cases it might not exist.",
        "In other cases, even if the old expected results remain good resources, search engines might not retrieve them in response to queries.",
        "It will return near-duplicate pages that have equivalent content but different URLs.",
        "Thus feedback data may rapidly become stale with new pages replacing old ones as more approporiate resources.",
        "And also, given the rapidly changing ranking algorithms of web search engines, feedback data collected from the users becomes outdated.",
        "Hence researchers who rely on feedback data either for testing their algorithms or other personalization related problems are faced with the problems of non-availability of user feedback data.",
        "In this paper, we strive to address the above problems by generating simulated relevance feedback using prognostic search techniques.",
        "Prognostic search is a process of simulating user's search process and emulating their actions, through preferences captured in their profile.",
        "Such generated feedback can be used for research in personalization techniques and analyzing personalization algorithms and search ranking func-tions(Harman, 1988).",
        "The main advantage with this system is that we can create data on the fly and hence not fear of it becoming stale.",
        "Since it does not involve user's actions, it is feasible to generate large amounts of data in this way."

        "Simulated feedback is a new type of feedback similar to implicit and explicit relevance feedback.",
        "Simulated feedback is created by observing and analyzing real world search log data.",
        "We propose a two phase process to create simulated relevance feedback as follows: In phase 1, we process real world click-through data of a search engine and build user profiles using the data.",
        "In phase 2, we simulate a user's search process and emulate their actions based on their profile.",
        "We call this process as \"Prognostic Search\".",
        "After closely examining and analyzing the semantics of the query log, we have chosen the following parameters to characterize a user: an anonymous user-id, perceived relevance threshold, patience, previous queries issued and search history of the user.",
        "A user-id is used to distinguish and uniquely identify each and every user.",
        "Perceived relevance is the relevance estimate of the result according to the user on examining the title, snippet and the url of the result.",
        "And Perceived relevance threshold is the threshold limit of perceived relevance of a result for the user to click it.",
        "Patience of the user is the trait which determines the number of clicks and the depth to which the user examines the results.",
        "We explain the process of computing a user's patience parameter in detail in section 3.2.3.",
        "We stored the previous queries and clicks of the user to capture the preferences of the user.",
        "To make use of the search history, we used the previous queries issued and previous results clicked by the user.",
        "We store the titles and snippets of those results to capture the interests of the user.",
        "Here, our aim is to generate implicit relevance feedback which is very close to the real world data.",
        "To generate synthetic relevance feedback, we instantiate these parameters with appropriate values using real world data.",
        "Prognostic search is simulation of a user's search process and emulating their actions based on their interests and preferences captured in their user profile.",
        "Simulating search process involves four steps viz., i)Query formulation, ii)Searching, iii)Browsing results and iv)Generating Clicks.",
        "Each of these processes are explained below.",
        "Query formulation involves cognitive process of the user and requires background knowledge about the user like their interests, preferences and their knowledge base.",
        "It is highly impossible to capture the cognitive thought process of a user and emulate their method of generating a query.",
        "To solve this problem, we randomly select a search session from a user's history and send all the queries in it sequentially to the search engine.",
        "This helps us to preserve the inter query relations that naturally exist between the subsequent queries in a session.",
        "This step involves retrieving documents relevant to the query generated in the previous step.",
        "We used yahoo search engine which is very much similar to the search engine from which the training data is collected.",
        "In this step, we simulate the manner in which a user browses the results in the real world.",
        "Based on the observations in (Granka et al., 2004; Filip and Joachims, 2005), we assume that the user in the real world follows the browsing model explained in Algorithm 1.",
        "In real world, a user may follow more complex browsing models, but presently we have considered this browsing model to simplify things.",
        "Accordingly, to simulate the browsing process of the user explained in algorithm 1, we followed Algorithm 1 User browsing model in real world Step1: Start browsing with the topmost result.",
        "Step2: Examine title, snippet and URL of the result.",
        "Step3: Click if the result looks promising.",
        "Step4: If(user has patience) go to step 5, else go to step 6.",
        "Step5: Select next result and go to step 2.",
        "Step6: Start examining the clicked results.",
        "Step7: If(information need satisfied) end the process, else go to step 8.",
        "Step8: Reformulate the query and go to step 1.",
        "the Algorithm 2.",
        "Algorithm 2 Simulated User browsing model Step 1: Determine the number of results to be browsed based on patience parameter.",
        "Step 2: Browse the results in increasing order of their ranks and examine them.",
        "Step 3: Compute the perceived relevance score of the results.",
        "Step 4: In the same order, generate clicks based on the perceived relevance scores of the results.",
        "Step 5: If(session has more queries) go to step 6, else end the process.",
        "Step 6: Select next query in the session and go to step 1.",
        "Thus based on the patience parameter, we determine the number of results that the user browses.",
        "In our analysis of query log parameters, we learned that the patience value of a user can be characterized by the following parameters: number of clicks per session, maximum rank of the result clicked in a session, time spent in a session, the number of queries issued per second and the average semantic relevance of the top ten results of that session to the user.",
        "We found out that the patience of the user is directly proportional to the maximum rank of the result he has clicked in a session.",
        "We also found out that the number of clicks a user generates is inversely proportional to the number of queries he issues per second and directly proportional to the amount of time he spends per session.",
        "Thus, a user with more patience tends to examine more search results and thus generate more clicks based on their relevance.",
        "We explain these dependencies in detail in the experiments section.",
        "So in order to learn the Patience parameter of the user, we devised the following formula:",
        "Here MR denotes the average of maximum rank of the results clicked by the user in a session, T denotes the average time spent in a session, C is the average number of clicks in a session and Q denotes the average number of queries issued per session and Sqi is the average semantic distance of the top ten results of the query 'qi.",
        "Here, \"a\" is an equalization constant.",
        "This is the most important step in our simulation process.",
        "Typically, a user observes the visual information viz., title, snippet and the URL of a result(Joachims et al., 2005).",
        "Then based on their interests, they choose the results relevant to them.",
        "Similarly, we closely examine the results selected in the previous step and then score them according to their relevance to the user.",
        "We consider the title, snippet and the page-rank of the result and determine its relevance to the user known as perceived relevance score.",
        "We first compute the semantic distance between the title and snippet of the present result from the titles and snippets of previously clicked results of the user.",
        "The results already clicked by the user serve as a knowledge base of the interests and preferences of the user.",
        "Thus, the semantic distance between the present result and the previous result gives us an account of the relevance that the present result carries to the user.",
        "We used latent semantic analysis (LSA) to compute the semantic distance between the results.",
        "LSA does not take the dictionary meaning of the words as input; it rather extracts the contextual meaning of the word with respect to all other words in semantic space(Landauer et al., 2007).",
        "This property of LSA is very much useful in the present context.",
        "A particular word may have a lot of meanings but we are concerned about only those meanings of the word which the user interprets, which are captured in the sentences present in the user's click history.",
        "Hence, we used LSA to compute the semantic distance between the results.",
        "We also consider the page-rank of the result, which has proven to be an important factor in making the decision of a click.",
        "In our study, we found that for about 89% of the queries with clicks, the top ranked document has been clicked and for 56% of the queries second ranked document has been clicked.",
        "In Figure 3, we show the click ratio for each of the top ten ranked documents.",
        "Thereby, we derive that the rank of the result is also a very important factor in deciding whether a result has to be clicked or not.",
        "We also consider the distance of the present result from the previous click of the user.",
        "In (Joachims et al., 2005), it is shown that the user is more biased to click the result that immediately follows the result he previously clicked.",
        "In our simulation process, if this distance for any result exceeds 10, then we terminate the browsing process and reformulate the query.",
        "We believe that when this distance exceeds 10, it signifies that the quality of the results is low and hence can be ignored.",
        "We used the bayesian probabilistic techniques to calculate the probability of the user clicking a result based on the above discussed factors.",
        "Hence Click being a Bernoulli variable, we have",
        "Where aR)q)U is the probability that user 'u' clicks the result 'R' for a query 'q'.",
        "We model the probability of a click, P (c/R, q, u) as a joint probability of P(c,r,Rel,D) where 'r' denotes the rank of the result, 'Rel' denotes the semantic relevance score of the result to the user - precisely to his previous clicks - and 'D' denotes the distance of the previous click of the user.",
        "We use this probability of the result as the Perceived relevance score of the result.",
        "Thus, we have:",
        "Here, 'r' denotes the rank of the result, 'Rel' denotes the perceived relevance of the result to the user and 'D' denotes the distance of the result from the user's previous clicked result.",
        "Prior probablities of each of these factors are calculated from the data stored in the user profile.",
        "We used Laplace smoothing techniques to deal with zero probability entries.",
        "P(ci+1) is the probability that the user may click a result after clicking 'i' results.",
        "We also believe that the behaviour of the user changes with each click he generates in a session.",
        "Hence we used the factor P(ci+1) in determining the probability of the click.",
        "Then, we compare this score with the Perceived relevance threshold of the user and generate the clicks accordingly.",
        "Computing Perceived Relevance Threshold: Using the above formula, we generated clicks for different values of Perceived Relevance Threshold for a user.",
        "Figure 2 show the precision and recall values of generating clicks for different values of Perceived Relevance Threshold of a user.",
        "Thus, we plot the accuracy of our system for different values of Patience Relevance Threshold and accordingly set the threshold selecting the best values for precision and recall of the system."

        "In equation 1, we show that the patience value is inversely proportinal to the number of queries the user issues in a session.",
        "To prove this fact, we made a statistical analysis on the real world querlogs.",
        "From the graphs shown in figure 4, it can be clearly seen that the Patience of the user is inversely proportional to the user's number of Queries/sec.",

        "It is evident that both the graphs are weakly decreasing functions.",
