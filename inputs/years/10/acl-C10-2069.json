        "This paper presents the novel task of best topic word selection, that is the selection of the topic word that is the best label for a given topic, as a means of enhancing the interpretation and visualisation of topic models.",
        "We propose a number of features intended to capture the best topic word, and show that, in combination as inputs to a reranking model, we are able to consistently achieve results above the baseline of simply selecting the highest-ranked topic word.",
        "This is the case both when training in-domain over other labelled topics for that topic model, and cross-domain, using only labellings from independent topic models learned over document collections from different domains and genres."

        "In the short time since its inception, topic modelling (Blei et al., 2003) has become a mainstream technique for tasks as diverse as multi-document summarisation (Haghighi and Vander-wende, 2009), word sense discrimination (Brody and Lapata, 2009), sentiment analysis (Titov and McDonald, 2008) and information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006).",
        "For many of these tasks, the multinomial topics learned by the topic model can be interpreted natively as probabilities, or mapped onto a predefined discrete class set.",
        "However, for tasks where the learned topics are provided to humans as a first-order output, e.g. for use in document collection analysis/navigation, it can be difficult for the end-user to interpret the rich statistical information encoded in the topics.",
        "This research is concerned with making topics more readily human interpretable, by selecting a single term with which to label the topic.",
        "Although topics are formally a multinomial distribution over terms, with every term having finite probability in every topic, topics are usually displayed by printing the top-10 terms (i.e. the 10 most probable terms) in the topic.",
        "These top-10 terms typically account for about 30% of the topic mass for reasonable setting of number of topics, and usually provide sufficient information to determine the subject area and interpretation of a topic, and distinguish one topic from another.",
        "Our research task can be illustrated via the top-10 terms in the following topic, learned from a book collection.",
        "Terms wi are presented in descending order of P(wi|tj) for the topic tj:",
        "trout fish fly fishing water angler stream rod flies salmon",
        "Clearly the topic relates to fishing, and indeed, the fourth term fishing is an excellent label for the topic.",
        "The task is thus termed best word or most representative word selection, as we are selecting the label from the closed set of the top-N topic words in that topic.",
        "Naturally, not all topics are equally coherent, however, and the lower the topic coherence, the more difficult the label selection task becomes.",
        "For example:",
        "oct sept nov aug dec july sun lite adv globe",
        "appears to conflate months with newspaper names, and no one of these topic words is able to capture the topic accurately.",
        "As such, our methodology presupposes an automatic means of rating topics for coherence.",
        "Fortunately, recent research by Newman et al.",
        "(2010) has shown that this is achievable at levels approaching human performance, meaning that this is not an unreasonable assumption.",
        "Labelling topics has applications across a diverse range of tasks.",
        "Our original interest in the problem stems from work in document collection visualisation/navigation, and the realisation that presenting users with topics natively (e.g. as represented by the top-N terms) is ineffective, and would be significantly enhanced if we could automatically predict succinct labels for each topic.",
        "Another application area where labelling has been shown to enhance the utility of topic models is selectional preference learning via topic modelling (Ritter et al., to appear).",
        "Here, topic labelling via taxonomic classes (e.g. WordNet synsets) can lead to better topic generalisation, in addition to better human readability.",
        "This paper is based around the assumption that an appropriate label for a topic can be found among the high-ranking (high probability) terms in that topic.",
        "We assess the suitability of each term by way of comparison with other high-ranking terms in that same topic, using simple pointwise mutual information and conditional probabilities.",
        "We first experiment with a simple ranking method based on the component scores, and then move on to using those scores, along with features from WordNet and from the original topic model, in a ranking support vector regression (SVR) framework.",
        "Our experiments demonstrate that we are able to perform the task significantly better than the baseline of selecting the topic word of highest marginal probability, including when training the ranking model on labelled topics from other document collections."

        "Topic are conventionally interpreted via the top-N words in each topic (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), or alternatively by post-hoc manual labelling of each topic based on domain knowledge and subjective interpretation of each topic (Wang and McCallum, 2006; Mei et al., 2006).",
        "Mei et al.",
        "(2007) proposed various approaches for automatically suggesting phrasal labels for topics, based on first extracting phrases from the document collection, and subsequently ranking the phrases based on KL divergence with a given topic.",
        "Magatti et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a method for labelling topics induced by hierarchical topic modelling, based on ontological alignment with the Google Directory (gDir) hierarchy, and optionally expanding topics based on a thesaurus or WordNet.",
        "Preliminary experiments suggest the method has promise, but the method crucially relies on both a hierarchical topic model and a pre-existing ontology, so has limited applicability.",
        "Over the general task of labelling a learned semantic class, Pantel and Ravichandran (2004) proposed the use of lexico-semantic patterns involving each member of that class to learn a (usually hypernym) label.",
        "The proposed method was shown to perform well over the semantically homogeneous, fine-grained clusters learned by CBC (Pantel and Lin, 2002), but for the coarse-grained, heterogeneous topics learned by topic modelling, it is questionable whether it would work as well.",
        "The first works to report on human scoring of topics were Chang et al.",
        "(2009) and Newman et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "The first study used a novel but synthetic intruder detection task where humans evaluate both topics (that had an intruder word), and assignment of topics to documents (that had an intruder topic).",
        "The second study had humans directly score topics learned by a topic model.",
        "This latter work introduced the pointwise mutual information (PMI) score to model human scoring.",

        "Our task is to predict which words annotators tend to select as most representative or best words when presented with a list of ten words.",
        "Since annotators are not generally unanimous in their choice of best word, we formulate this as a ranking task, and treat the top-1, 2 and 3 system-ranked items as the best words, and compare that to the top-1, 2 and 3 words chosen most frequently by annotators.",
        "In this section, we describe the features that may be useful for this ranking task.",
        "We start with features motivated by word association.",
        "An obvious idea is that the most representative word should be readily evoked by other words in the topic.",
        "For example, given a list of words {space, earth, moon, nasa, mission), which is a Space Exploration topic, space could arguably be the most representative word.",
        "This is because it is natural to think about the word space after seeing the words earth, moon and nasa individually.",
        "A good candidate for best word could be the word that has high average conditional probability given each of the other words.",
        "To calculate conditional probability, we use word counts from the entire collection of English Wikipedia articles.",
        "Conditional probability is defined as:",
        "where i = j and P(wi,wj-) is the probability of observing both Wi and Wj in the same sliding window, and P(wi) is the overall probability of word wi in the corpus.",
        "In the above example, evoked by means that space would fill the slot of wi.",
        "The average conditional probability for word wi is given for j = 1... 10,j = i (this range of indices applies to all following average quantities).",
        "In other cases, we have the flip situation, where the most representative word may evoke (rather than be evoked by) other words in the list of ten words.",
        "Imagine a NASCAR Racing topic, which has a list of words {race, car, nascar, driver, racing).",
        "Given the word nascar, words from the list such as race, car, racing and driver might come to mind because nascar is heavily associated with these words.",
        "Therefore, a good candidate, wi, might also correlate with high P(wj |wi).",
        "As before, the average conditional probability (here denoted with CP2) for word wi is given by:",
        "avg-CP2(wi) = P (wj |wi).",
        "Another approach to measuring word association is by calculating pointwise mutual information (PMI) between word pairs.",
        "Unlike conditional probability, PMI is symmetric and thus the order of words in a pair does not matter.",
        "We calculate PMI using word counts from English",
        "Wikipedia as follows:",
        "The average PMI for word wi is given by:",
        "avg-PMI(wi) = ^ PMI(wi,wj ).",
        "The topic model produces an ordered list of words for each topic, and the ordering is given by the marginal probability of each word given that topic, P(wi|tj ).",
        "The ranking of words based on these probabilities indicates the importance of a word in a topic, and it is also a feature that we use for predicting the most representative word.",
        "We also observe that sometimes the most representative words are generalized concepts of other words.",
        "As such, hypernym relations could be another feature that may be relevant to predicting the best word.",
        "To this end, we use WordNet to find hypernym relations between pairs of words in a topic and obtain a set of boolean-valued relationships for each topic word.",
        "Our last feature is the distributional similarity scores of Pantel et al.",
        "(2009), as trained over Wikipedia.",
        "This takes the form of representing the distributional similarity between each pairing of terms sim(wi|wj- );if wi is not in the top-200 most similar terms for a given wj, we assume it to have a similarity of 0.",
        "While the above features can be used alone to get a ranking on the ten topic words, we can also use various combinations of features in a reranking model such as support vector regression (SVMmrafc: Joachims (2006)).",
        "Applying the features described above â€“ conditional probabilities, PMI, WordNet hypernym relations, the topic model word rank, and Pantel's distributional similarity score â€“ as features for SVMmrafc, a ranking of words is produced and candidates for the most representative word are selected by choosing the top-ranked words.",

        "From the experiments in Section 5, perhaps the first thing to observe is: (a) the high performance of the baseline, and (b) the relatively low (Best-1) upper bound accuracy for the task.",
        "The first is perhaps unsurprising, given that it represents the topic model's own interpretation of the word(s) whichare mostrepresentative ofthat topic.",
        "In this sense, we have set our sights high in attempting to better the baseline.",
        "The upper bound accuracy is a reflection of both the inter-annotator agreement, and the best that we can meaningfully expect to do for the task.",
        "That is, any result higher than this would paradoxically suggest that we are able to do better at a task than humans, where we are evaluating ourselves relative to the labellings of those humans.",
        "The upper bound for NEWS was slightly less than 0.5, indicating that humans agree on the best topic word only 50% of the time.",

        "health drug patient medical doctor hospital care cancer treatment disease",
        "This is clearly a coherent topic, but at least two topic words suggest themselves as labels: health and medical.",
        "By way of having between 10 and 20 annotators (uniquely) label a given topic, and interpreting the multiple labellings probabilistically, we are sidestepping the inter-annotator agreement issue, but ultimately, for the Best-1 evaluation, we are forced to select one term only, and consider any alternative to be wrong.",
        "Because annotators selected only one best topic word, we unfortunately have no way of performing Best-2 or Best-3 upper bound evaluation and deal with topics such as this, but would expect the numbers to rise appreciably.",
        "Looking at the original feature rankings in Tables 2 and 3, no clear picture emerges as to which of the three methods (PMI, CP1 and CP2) was most successful, but there were certainly clear differences in the relative numbers for each, pointing to possible complementarity in the scoring.",
        "This expectation was born out in the results for the reranking model in Tables 4 and 5, where the combined feature set surpassed the baseline in all cases, and feature ablation tended to lead to a drop in results, with the single most effective feature set being CP1 (P(wi\\*)), followed by CP2 (P(*\\wi)) and topic model rank.",
        "The lexical semantic features of WordNet hypernymy and PDS (Pantel's distributional similarity) were the worst performers, often having no or negative impact on the results.",
        "Comparing the best results for the SVR-based reranking model and the upper bound Best-1 score, we approach the upper bound performance for NEWS, but are still quite a way off with BOOKS when training in-domain.",
        "This is encouraging, but a slightly artificial result in terms of the broader applicability of this research, as what it means in practical terms is that if we can access multi-annotator best word labelling for the majority of topics in a given topic model, we can use those annotations to predict the best word for the remainder of the topics with reasonably success.",
        "When we look to the cross-domain results, however, we see that we almost perfectly replicate the best-achieved Best-1, Best-2 and Best-3 indomain results for BOOKS by training on NEWS (making no use of the annotations for BOOKS).",
        "Applying the annotations for BOOKS to NEWS is less successful in terms of Best-1 accuracy, but we actually achieve higher Best-2, and largely mirror the Best-3 results as compared to the best of the in-domain results in Table 6.",
        "This leads to the much more compelling conclusion that we can take annotations from an independent topic model (based on a completely unrelated document collection), and apply them to successfully model the best topic word for a new topic model, without requiring any additional annotation.",
        "As we now have two sets of topics multiply-annotated for best words, this result suggests that we can perform the best topic word selection task with high success over novel topic models.",
        "We carried out manual analysis of topics where the model did particularly poorly, to get a sense for how and where our model is being led astray.",
        "One such example is the topic:",
        "race car nascar driver racing cup winston team gordon season",
        "where the following topic words were selected by our annotators: nascar (8 people), race (2 people), and racing (2 people).",
        "First, we observe the split between race and racing, where more judicious lemmatisation/stemming would make both the annotation easier and the evaluation cleaner.",
        "The SVR model tends to select more common, general terms, so in this case chose race as the best word, and ranked nascar third.",
        "This is one instance were nascar evokes all of the other words effectively, but not conversely (racing is associated with many events/sports beyond nascar, e.g.).",
        "Another topic where our model had difficulty was:",
        "window nave aisle transept chapel tower arch pointed arches roof",
        "where our best model selected nave, while the human annotators selected chapel (6 people), arch (2 people), nave, roof, tower and transept (1 person each).",
        "Clearly, our annotators struggled to come up with a best word here, despite the topic again being coherent.",
        "This is an obvious candidate for labelling with a hypernym/holonym of the topic words (e.g. church or church architecture), and points to the limitations of best word labelling â€“ there are certainly many topics where best word labelling works, as our upper bound analysis demonstrated, but there are equally many topics where the most natural label is not found in the top-ranked topic words.",
        "While this points to slight naivety in the current task set up â€“ we are forcing annotators to label words with topic words, where we know that this is suboptimal for a significant number of topics â€“ we contend that our numbers suggest that: (a) consistent best topic word labelling is possible at least 50% of the time; and (b) we have developed a method which is highly adept at labelling these topics.",
        "As a way forward, we intend to relax the constraint on the topic label needing to be based on a topic word, and explore the possibility of predicting which topics are best labelled with topic words, and which require independent labels.",
        "For topics which can be labelled with topic words, we can use the methodology developed here, and for topics where this is predicted to be sub-optimal, we intend to build on the work of Mei et al.",
        "(2007), Pantel and Ravichandran (2004) and others in selecting phrasal/hypernym labels for topics.",
        "We are also interested in applying the methodology proposed herein to the closely-related task of intruder word, or worst topic word, detection, as proposed by Chang et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Finally, looking to the question of the impact of the presentation order of the topic words on best word selection, it would appear that our baseline is possibly an overestimate (based on Table 8).",
        "Having said that, the flipside of the bias is that it leads to more consistency in the annotations, and tends to help in tie-breaking of examples such as race and racing from above, for example.",
        "In support of this claim, the upper bound Best-1 accuracy of the randomised annotations, relative to the original gold-standard is 0.44, slightly below the original upper bound for NEWS.",
        "More work is needed to determine the real impact of this bias on the overall task setup and evaluation."
