        "Word alignment is defined as mapping corresponding words in parallel text.",
        "A word aligned parallel corpora are very valuable resources in NLP.",
        "They can be used in various applications such as word sense disambiguation, automatic construction of bilingual lexicon, and statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "In particular, the initial quality of statistical word alignment dominates the quality of SMT (Och and Ney 2000; Ganchev et al., 2008); almost all current SMT systems basically refer to the information inferred from word alignment result.",
        "One of the widely used approaches to statistical word alignment is based on the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "IBM models are constructed based on words' co-occurrence and positional information.",
        "If sufficient training data are given, IBM models can be successfully applied to any language pairs.",
        "However, for minority language pairs such as English-Korean and Swedish-Japanese, it is very difficult to obtain large amounts of parallel corpora.",
        "Without sufficient amount of parallel corpus, it is very difficult to learn the correct correspondences between words that infrequently occur in the training data.",
        "Part-of-speeches (POS), which represent morphological classes of words, can give valuable information about individual words and their neighbors.",
        "Identifying whether a word is a noun or a verb can let us predict which words are likely to be mapped in word alignment and which words are likely to occur in its vicinity in target sentence generation.",
        "Many studies incorporate POS information in SMT.",
        "Some researchers perform POS tagging on their bilingual training data (Lee et al., 2006; Sanchis and Sanchez, 2008).",
        "Some of them replace individual words as new words, such as in \"word/POS\" form, producing new, extended vocabulary.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that POS information can help to resolve lexical ambiguity and thus improve translation quality.",
        "On the other hand, Koehn et al.",
        "(2007) propose a factored translation model that can incorporate any linguistic factors including POS information in phrase-based SMT.",
        "The model provides a generalized representation of a translation model, because it can map multiple source and target factors.",
        "Although all of these approaches are shown to improve SMT performance by utilizing POS information, we observe that the influence is virtually marginal in two ways:",
        "1) The POS information tagged to each word may help to disambiguate in selecting word correspondences, but the increased vocabulary can also make the training data more sparse.",
        "2) The factored translation model may help to effectively handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) by incorporating many linguistic factors, but it still crucially relies on the initial quality of word alignment that will dominate the translation probabilities.",
        "This paper focuses on devising a better method for incorporating POS information in word alignment.",
        "It attempts to answer the following questions:",
        "1) Can the information regarding POS alignment tendency affect the post-processing of word alignment?",
        "2) Can the result of word alignment affected by such information help improving the",

        "We believe that this phenomenon occurs not only on English-Korean pairs but also on most of other language pairs.",
        "Thus, in this study we hypothesize that all source language (SL) POSs have some relationship with target language (TL) POSs.",
        "Figure 1 exemplifies some results of using the IBM Models in English-Korean word alignment.",
        "As can be seen in the figure, the English word \"visiting\" is incorrectly and excessively aligned to four Korean morphemes \"maejang\", inaccurate word alignment \"chat\", \"yeoseong\", and \"gogaek\".",
        "One reason for this is the sparseness of the training data; the only correct Korean morpheme \"chat\" does not sufficiently co-occur with \"visiting\" in the training data.",
        "However, it is generally believed that an English verb is more likely aligned to a Korean verb rather than a Korean noun.",
        "Likewise, we suppose that among many POSs, there are strong relationships between similar POSs and relatively weak relationships between different POSs.",
        "We hypothesize that the discovery of such relationships in advance can lead to better word alignment results.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new method to obtain the relationship from word alignment results.",

        "In a small data set, the improvement of our method is much higher than that in a large set.",

        "serve that the word alignment model tends to link word pairs more correctly if they are more frequently co-occurred.",
        "Both \"Lemma/POS\" and our method consistently show higher average recall throughout all frequencies, and the proposed method shows the best performance.",
        "It is also notable that the both \"Lemma/POS\" and our method achieve much more improvement for low co-occurrence frequencies (e.g., 11-40).",
        "This implies that the proposed method incorporates POS information more effectively than the previous method, since the proposed method achieves much higher average recall.",
        "Next, we examine the effect of the improvement of the word alignment on the translation quality.",

        "To investigate how the improved word alignment affect the quality of machine translation, we calculate the BLEU score for translation results with different word alignment settings as shown in Table 3.",
        "First of all, we can easily conclude that the quality of the translation is strongly dominated by the size of the training data.",
        "We can also find that the quality of the translation is correlated to the performance of the word alignment.",
        "For a small test set, the proposed method achieved the best performance in terms of BLEU (21.8%).",
        "For a larger test set, however, the proposed method could not improve the performance of the translation with better word alignment.",

        "When the training data is small, the number of extracted phrases is also apparently small.",
        "However, abundant phrases are extracted from a large amount of training data.",
        "In this case, we hypothesize that the most plausible phrases are already obtained, and the effect of more accurate word alignment seems insignificant.",
