        "Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a major method in current semantic analysis which is important to NLP applications.",
        "The SRL task is to identify semantic roles (or arguments) of each predicate and then label them with their functional tags, such as 'Arg0' and 'ArgM' in PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), or 'Agent' and 'Patient' in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "The significance of syntactic analysis in SRL has been proven by (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2005), and syntactic parsing has been applied by almost all current studies.",
        "In terms of syntactic representations, the SRL approaches are mainly divided into three categories: constituent-based, chunk-based and dependency-based.",
        "Constituent-based SRL has been studied intensively with satisfactory results.",
        "Chunk-based SRL has been found to be less effective than the constituent-based by (Punyakanok et al., 2005).",
        "In recent years, the dependency-based SRL has been greatly promoted by the CoNLL shared tasks on semantic parsing (Hajic et al., 2009).",
        "However, there is not much research on combined use of different syntactic views (Pradhan et al., 2005), on the feature level of SRL.",
        "This paper introduces a novel method for Chinese SRL utilizing both constituent-based and dependency-based features.",
        "The method takes constituent as the basic unit of argument and adopts the labeling of PropBank.",
        "It follows the prevalent feature-based SRL methods to first turn predicate-argument pairs into flat structures by well-defined linguistic features, and then uses machine learning methods to predict the semantic labels.",
        "The method also involves two classification phases: semantic role identification (SRI) and semantic role classification (SRC).",
        "In addition, a heuristic-based pruning preprocessing (Xue and Palmer, 2004) is used to filter out a lot of apparently inappropriate constituents at the beginning.",
        "And it has been widely reported that, in feature-based SRL, the performance can be improved by adding several combined features each of which is composed by two single features (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Toutanova et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2009).",
        "Thus, in this work, we exploit combined use of both constituent-based and dependency-based features in addition to using features of singular types of syntactic view.",
        "We propose a statistical method to select effective combined features using both constituent-based and dependency-based features to make full use of two syntactic views."

        "In our method, the feature set used for SRL consists of two parts: the basic feature set and the combined feature set built upon the basic feature set.",
        "The basic feature set can be further divided into constituent-based features and dependency-based features.",
        "Constituent features focus on hierarchical relations between multi-word constituents whereas dependency features focus on dependencies between individual words, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Take the predicate 'JiHT (increased) as an example, in Figure 1(a), the NP constituent (China's position) is labeled as 'Arg0'.",
        "The argument and the predicate are connected by the path of node types: 'NP-IP-VP-VP'.",
        "But in",
        "Figure 1(b), the individual word 'ilMÈ' (position) is labeled as 'Arg0'.",
        "And the connection between the argument and the predicate is only one edge with the relation 'nsubj', which is more explicit than the path in the constituent structure.",
        "So the two syntactic views can complement each other on different linguistic units.",
        "As a prevalent syntactic feature set for SRL, constituent-based features have been extensively studied by many researchers.",
        "In this work, we simply take 26 constituent-based features tested by existing studies, and add 8 new features define by us.",
        "Firstly, the 26 constituent-based features used by others are:",
        "• The seven \"standard\" features: predicate (c1), path (c2), phrase type (c3), position (c4), voice (c5), head word (c6) and predicate subcategorization (c7) features proposed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "• Syntactic frame (c8) feature from (Xue and",
        "Palmer, 2004).",
        "• Head word POS (c9), partial path (c10), first/last word in constituent (c11/c12), first/last POS in constituent (c13/c14), left/right sibling constituent (c15/c16), left/right sibling head (c17/c18), left/right sibling POS (c19/c20), constituent tree distance (c21) and temporal cue words (c22) features from (Pradhan et al., 2004).",
        "• Predicate POS (c23), argument's parent constituent (c24), argument's parent constituent head (c25) and argument's parent constituent POS (c26) inspired by (Pradhan et al., 2004).",
        "Secondly, the 8 new features that we define are (we take the 'Arg0' node in Figure 1(a) as the example to illustrate them):",
        "• Locational cue words (c27): a binary feature indicating whether the constituent contains location cue words, similar to the temporal cue words (c22).",
        "This feature is defined to distinguish the arguments with the 'ArgM-LOC' type from others.",
        "• POS pattern of argument's children (c28): the left-to-right chain of the POS tags of the argument's children, e.g. 'NR-DEG-NN'.",
        "• Phrase type pattern of argument's children (c29): the left-to-right chain of the phrase type labels of the argument's children, similar with the POS pattern of argument's children (c28), e.g. 'DNP-NP'.",
        "• Type of LCA and left child (c30): The phrase type of the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) combined with its left child, e.g. 'IP-NP'.",
        "• Type of LCA and right child (c31): The phrase type of the LCA combined with its right child, e.g. 'IP-VP'.",
        "Three features: bag of words of path (c32), bag of words of POS pattern (c33) and bag of words of type pattern (c34), for generalizing three sparse features: path (c2), POS pattern of argument's children (c28) and phrase type pattern of argument's children (c29) by the bag-of-words representation.",
        "The dependency parse can effectively represent the head-dependent relationship between words, yet, it lacks constituent information.",
        "If we want to label constituents using dependency-based features, we should firstly map each constituent to one or more appropriate words in the dependency tree.",
        "In this paper, we use the head word of a constituent to represent the constituent in the dependency parses.",
        "The selection method of dependency-based features is similar to the method of constituent-based features.",
        "The 35 selected dependency-based features include:",
        "• Predicate/Argument relation type (d1/d2), relation path (d3), POS pattern of predicate's children (d4) and relation pattern of predicate's children (d5) features from (Ha-",
        "cioglu, 2004).",
        "• Child relation set (d6), child POS set (d7), predicate/argument parent word (d8/d9), predicate/argument parent POS (d10/d11),",
        "left/right word (d12/d13), left/right POS (d14/d15), left/right relation (d16/d17), left/right sibling word (d18/d19), left/right sibling POS (d20/d21) and left/right sibling relation (d22/d23) features as described in (Johansson and Nugues, 2008).",
        "• Dep-exists (d24) and dep-type (d25) features",
        "from (Boxwell et al., 2009).",
        "• POS path (d26), POS path length (d27), REL path length (d28) from (Che et al., 2008).",
        "• High/low support verb (d29/d30), high/low support noun (d31/d32) features from (Zhao et al., 2009).",
        "• LCA's word/POS/relation (d33/d34/d35) inspired by (Toutanova et al., 2005).",
        "To maintain the consistency between two",
        "syntactic views, the dependency parses are generated by a constituent-to-dependency converter (Marneffe et al., 2006), which is suitable for semantic analysis as it retrieves the semantic head rather than the general syntactic head, using a set of modified Bikel's head rules."

        "The combined features, each of which consists of two different basic features, have proven to be positive for SRL.",
        "Several combined features have been widely used in SRL, such as 'predi-cate+head word' and 'position+voice'.",
        "But to our knowledge, there is no prior report about the selection method of combined features for SRL.",
        "The common entropy-based criteria are invalid here because the combined features always take lots of distinct values.",
        "And the greedy method is too complicated to be practical due to the large number of combinations.",
        "In this paper, we define two statistical criteria to efficiently estimate the classification performance of each combined feature on the corpus.",
        "Inspired by Fisher Linear Discriminant separation of two classes is defined as the ratio of the variance between the classes to the variance within the classes, namely larger ratio can lead to better separation between two classes, and the discriminant plane can be achieved by maximizing the separation.",
        "Therefore, in this paper, we adopt the ratio of interclass distance to intraclass distance to measure to what extent a combined feature can partition the data.",
        "Initially, the feature set contains only the N basic features.",
        "We construct one combined feature fab at each iteration by combining two basic features fa and fb , where a,b e [1, N] and a ^ b .",
        "We push fab into the feature set and take it as the N +1 th feature.",
        "Then, all the training instances are represented by feature vectors using the new feature set, and we then quantize the feature vectors of positive and negative data orderly to keep their intrinsic statistical difference.",
        "If the training dataset is denoted as D :{Dpos, Dneg }, then the separation criterion, namely the ratio of interclass to intraclass distance for feature fi can be given as InterDisf (Dpos, Dneg ) IntraDistf(Dpos, Dneg )",
        "where the interclass and the intraclass distance between Dpos and Dneg for feature fi are specified by (2) and (3), respectively.",
        "Meanf (D) in (2) and S7 (D) in (3) represents the sample mean and the corresponding sample standard deviation of feature fi in dataset D as given in (4) and (5).",
        "Meanf (D)",
        "Essentially, the interclass distance reflects the distance between the center of positive dataset and the center of negative dataset, and the intraclass distance indicates the intensity of all instances relative to the corresponding center.",
        "Therefore, larger ratio will lead to a better partition for a feature, as has been pointed out by FLDA.",
        "In order to compare the ratio between different combined features, we further standardize the value of g(fi ) by computing its z-score Z (fi ) which indicates how many standard deviations between a sample and its mean, as given in (6).",
        "where g(fi ) represents the sample mean as given in (7), and SG represents the sample standard deviation of the sequence g(fi ) where i ranges from 1 to N+l as given in (8).",
        "After figuring out the Z(fa ) and Z(fb ) for the basic feature fa and fb , and Z(fab) for the combined feature fab by (6), we define the other criterion, namely the improvement I(fab) of the combined feature, as the smaller difference between the z-score of the combined feature and its two corresponding basic features as given in (9).",
        "Finally, the combined feature with a negative I(fab) value is eliminated.",
        "Then, we will rank the combined features in terms of their z-score, and use the top N of them for later classification.",
        "The selection method based on the two criteria can effectively filter out combined features whose means have no significant difference between positive and negative data, and hence retain the potentially useful combined features for the separation.",
        "Meanwhile, it has a relatively fast speed when dealing with a large number of features in comparison to the greedy method due to its simplicity."

        "We present the result comparison between using gold-standard parsing and automatic parsing, and also offer an analysis of the contribution of the combined features.",
        "To evaluate the proposed method and compare it with others, we use the most commonly used corpus in Chinese SRL, Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB) version 1.0, as the dataset.",

        "We divide the corpus into three parts: the first 99 documents (chtb_001.fid to chtb_099.fid) serve as the test data, the last 32 documents (chtb_900.fid to chtb_931.fid) serve as the development data and the left 629 documents (chtb_100.fid to chtb_899.fid) serve as the training data.",
        "We use the SVM-Light Toolkit version 6.02 (Joachims, 1999) for the implementation of SVM, and use the Stanford Parser version 1.6 (Levy and Manning, 2003) as the constituent parser and the constituent-to-dependency converter.",

        "In particular, the 'predicate+head word' feature takes first place in all semantic categories except LOC, in which the combination of the new feature 'locational cue words' (c27) and the 'voice (c5)' feature performs the best.",
        "The results also show that the most frequently occurred basic features in the combined set are 'predicate' (c1), 'head word' (c6), 'type of LCA and left child' (c30), 'dep-type' (d25) and 'POS path' (d26).",
        "These basic features should be more discriminative when combined with others.",

        "It is obvious that the obtained combined features for SRI and SRC are different, and the obtained combined features for each type are also different as our selection method is based on positive and negative data which are completely different for each argument type.",

        "Therefore, we vary the value of N to 5, 10 and 20 in the experiments to evaluate the performance of combined features.",
        "Corresponding to the three different values of N, we finally obtained 28, 60 and 114 combined features for the SRL, respectively.",
        "To illustrate each component of the method, we constructed 6 SRL systems using 6 different feature sets: 'Constituent Only' (CO) - uses the constituent-based features, as presented in Section 3.1; 'Dependency Only' (DO) - uses the dependency-based features, as presented in Section 3.2; 'CD' - uses both the constituent-based features and the dependency-based features, but no combined features; 'CD+Top5' obtained by adding the top-5 combined features to the 'CD' system; and similarly for the 'CD+Top10' and the 'CD+Top20' systems.",
        "And 'CO' serves as the baseline in our experiments.",
        "First, we evaluate the performance of SRI using the held-out test set with gold-standard constituent parse trees.",
        "The corresponding dependency parse trees are automatically generated by the constituent-to-dependency converter included in the Stanford Parser.",
        "The testing results of the six systems on the SRI phase are shown in Table 2.",
        "It can be seen from Table 2 that 'CD' and 'CD+Top20' give only slightly improvement over 'CO' by less than 1% point.",
        "In other words, feature combinations do not seem to be very effective for SRI.",
        "Then we label all recognized constituents in the SRI phase with one of the six semantic role types.",
        "Table 3 displays the F-score of each semantic type and the overall SRC on the test set with gold-standard parses.",
        "Table 3 shows that the proposed method performs much better in SRC.",
        "It improves the constituent-based method by more than 2% in SRC.",
        "The effectiveness of combined features can also be clearly seen because the overall F-scores of the three systems using combined features all exceed 93%, significant greater than the systems using singular features.",
        "The improvement is noticeable for all semantic role types except the 'TMP' type.",
        "It means that the dependency parses cannot provide additional information to the labeling of this type.",
        "The results of Table 2 and Table 3 together show that our method using combined features can effectively improve the performance of SRL on the SRC phases, when using gold parses.",
