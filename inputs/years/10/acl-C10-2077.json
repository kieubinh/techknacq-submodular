        "In recent years, semantic research has roused great interest in NLP field.",
        "With the progress of many semantic lexicons, this research gradually becomes promising and exciting.",
        "As one of the tasks of SemEval Evaluation, Frame Semantic Structure Extraction based on the FrameNet grows to be highlighted for special attention.",
        "Given a sentence, the task of Frame Semantic Structure Extraction consists of the following three parts: recognizing the word expressions (target words) that evoke semantic frames; discriminating the word sense (frame) of each evoking expression; for each target word, labeling its syntactic dependents with regard to which roles in that frame they fill (Baker et al., 2006).",
        "Among of these three components, frame identification is the fundamental and key problem.",
        "However, current research of this task in Chinese is only focused on semantic role labeling based on the given target words and their corresponding frames (Xue, 2008).",
        "We insist that whether target words can be assigned correct frames in context is a crucial problem demanding prompt solution in this task.",
        "Chinese FrameNet (CFN) (You and Liu, 2005), developed by Shanxi University, is an ongoing effort of building a semantic lexicon for Chinese based on the theory of Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982), referencing the Fra-meNet(Baker et al., 1998) and supported by corpus evidence.",
        "The CFN project currently contains more than 2100 lexical units, more than 300 semantic frames, and has exemplified more than 21600 annotated sentences.",
        "The ultimate goal of this project is to generate information about the articulation of the semantic and syntactic requirements of Chinese lexical items and presents this information in a variety of web-based reports and represents the lexical semantics of all the sentences in a Chinese text.",
        "According to statistics, there are 332 lexical units belonging to more than one frame in the current CFN databases.",
        "For example, lexical unit \" \"can evoke the following three frames: \"^tik (Expressing_publicly) \", \"fê^iÈ (Statement) \" and \" f^^!?",
        "(representative) \".",
        "In order to extract the semantic structure of a sentence containing ambiguous target words, the first step is to assign the correct frame to the target words in a given context.",
        "This task is similar with the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task to a certain extent (Katrin Erk, 2005).",
        "WSD is to resolve the inherent polysemia of words by determining the appropriate sense for each ambiguous word in a given text, while frame identification is assigning a correct frame for the ambiguous target word in the current sentence context.",
        "Nevertheless, essential difference exists between them.",
        "WSD prefers to disambiguation on static sense, whereas based on the frame semantics, frame identification lays particular emphasis on consistency between sentence scene and the dynamic scene described by the candidate frames.",
        "Since the existence of links between frame semantics and syntactic features, we adopt a tree-structured conditional random field (T-CRF) model to solve Chinese frame identification based on Dependency Parsing.",

        "The current FrameNet DIMAP dictionary contains 7575 entries, with many entries having multiple senses.",
        "For each sense, the FrameNet part of speech, the definition, the frame name, the ID number, and the definition source (identified as FN or COD) are captured from the FrameNet files.",
        "When a lexical unit is recognized in processing the text, the first step is to retrieve the entry for that item in the dictionary and use the frame element realization patterns to disambiguate among the senses.",

        "They evaluated on three texts and the best result is 66.10% precision (Litkowski, 2007).",
        "Adrian Bejan and Hathaway (2007) selected from the FN lexicon 556 target words that evoke at least two semantic frames and have at least five sentences annotated for each frame.",
        "And then they assembled a multi-class classifier using two types of models: SVM and Maximum Entropy for each ambiguous target word.",
        "They extracted features used in word sense disambiguation (Florain et al., 2002), lexical features ofthe target word, and NAMED ENTITY FLAGS associated with the root vertex in a syntactic parse tree.",
        "For the rest of the ambiguous target words that have less than five sentences annotated, they randomly chose a frame as being the correct frame in a given context.",
        "For FI sub-task, they obtained 76.71% accuracy compared to a baseline of 60.72% accuracy that always predicts the most annotated frame for each of the 556 target words.",
        "Johansson and Nugues (2007) firstly used some filtering rules to detect target words, and for the target words left after the filtering, they trained a disambiguating SVM classifier on all ambiguous words listed in FrameNet.",
        "The classifier used the following features: target lemma, target word, sub categorization frame, the set of dependencies of the target, the set of words of the child vertexes, and the parent word of the target.",
        "Its accuracy was 84% on the ambiguous words, compared to a first-sense baseline score of 74%.",
        "The above researches focused on English based on FrameNet.",
        "To our knowledge, there exists no work for Chinese by far.",
        "Most methods mentioned above treat the frame identification as an independent classification problem for each ambiguous target word in a sentence.",
        "However, because of neglecting the relations between the candidate frames, the resulting frame assignment may be semantically inconsistent over the sentence."

        "After a preliminary screening, about 1000 sentences compose the original and coarse corpus.",

        "This suggests the dependencies on the tree structure can capture more important characteristics than those on the linear chains do.",
        "Secondly, when we added the edge feature between current word and its parent, the performance declined unexpectedly.",
        "This can be explained in linguistics: in a dependency parsed sentence, the clique of a governor and its dependents forms \"a small world\" which can express partial meaning of the sentence, while the parent of current vertex (except the root vertex which has no parent) can not influence much on it because its parent has its own clique, and current word is just a tiny fragment of the clique of its parent, on the contrary, the parent vertex feature will bring negative effect on the current word.",
        "For example, the target word \"W in figure 2 can illustrate this case clearly.",
        "Thirdly, when we added the children vertexes, the performance increased, that is because current word and its dependents together can form a semantic clique of the sentence.",
        "Lastly, when we added the dependency relation type on the features of parent-child edge and child-parent edge, the performance improved slightly because the relation type of edge is coarser than the edge between parent and child.",
        "There are only 24 kinds of dependency types but exist hundreds of edge combination possibilities between parent and child.",
        "Thus, this feature relived the data sparseness problem to a certain extent.",

        "For example, in the sentence \"âtë#MïBÈ^, feÄ\"o \" , the correct frame of \"^^\"should be \" \" instead of \" \", because it described the attitude of \" Êl^n\" not declared a fact or a phenomena.",
        "However, this kind of deep semantics of sentence couldn't be capured by T-CRF model based on the dependency syntax.",
        "The other is that the labeling frames of some target words are tag \"null\".",
        "The reason is that some lexical units can't evoke a frame sometimes, so in the training data, these words are annotated \"null\".",

        "In the CFN frame database, every frame defines a lexical units set, in which each of lexical unit can evoke this frame.",
        "When one of these lexical units serves as the target word in a sentence, we can use the compatibilities of other lexical units in this set with the sentence to reflect the consistency between this frame and current sentence.",
        "The compatibility of lexical unit with the sentence is computed by the Co-occurrence frequency of lexical unit and the notional words in the sentence in a large corpus.",

        "In the corpus consisted of 940 training sentences and l28 test sentences, the frequency of each frame was counted for ranking.",

        "In this paper, we investigated the problem of Frame Identification in Chinese which is the first work on Chinese FrameNet.",
        "A tree-structured conditional random field (T-CRF) model was applied to this task based on the dependency syntactic structure.",
        "This model provides a way to incorporating the longdistance dependencies between target words and the syntactic related words with it.",
        "In our experiments, the syntactic dependency features were shown to work effectively for Frame Identification, with 7l.73%, 76.82%, and 8l.46% precision for compatibility of lexical unit, CRF and T-CRF, respectively.",
        "Although a relatively good performance was achieved on the test data, the small-scale and simplicity of sentence structure in corpus cannot be ignored compared with the FrameNet corpus.",
        "However, the experimental results that we gained is still promising, suggesting that our model is comparatively appropriate to the Frame Identification task and still has a great potential for improvement.",
        "The next work will focus on the three aspects: firstly, build a larger corpus containing various sentence structures in Chinese; the other is that more semantic features will be tried to add in the T-CRF model, such as the frame elements and the semantic relations between frames, finally, we will try to identify frames of target words using other machine learning methods which has been proved high performance in this task."
