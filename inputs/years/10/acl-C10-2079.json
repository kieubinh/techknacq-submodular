        "The potential benefit of integrating contextual information for recommendation has received much research attention recently, especially with the ever-increasing interest in mobile-based recommendation services.",
        "However, context based recommendation research is limited due to the lack of standard evaluation data with contextual information and reliable technology for extracting such information.",
        "As a result, there are no widely accepted conclusions on how, when and whether context helps.",
        "Additionally, a system often suffers from the so called cold start problem due to the lack of data for training the initial context based recommendation model.",
        "This paper proposes a novel solution to address these problems with automated information extraction techniques.",
        "We also compare several approaches for utilizing context based on a new data set collected using the proposed solution.",
        "The experimental results demonstrate that 1) IE-based techniques can help create a large scale context data with decent quality from online reviews, at least for restaurant recommendations; 2) context helps recommender systems rank items, however, does not help predict user ratings; 3) simply using context to filter items hurts recommendation performance, while a new probabilistic latent relational model we proposed helps."

        "In the information retrieval community, one major research focus is developing proactive retrieval agent that acts in anticipation of information needs of a user and recommends information to the user without requiring him/her to issue an explicit query.",
        "The most popular examples ofsuch kind of proactive retrieval agent are recommender systems.",
        "Over the last several years, research in standard recommender systems has been improved significantly, largely due to the availability of large scale evaluation data sets such as Netflix.",
        "The current research focus goes beyond the standard user-item rating matrix.",
        "As researchers start to realize that the quality of recommendations depends on time, place and a range of other relevant users' context, how to integrate contextual information for recommendation is becoming an ever increasingly important topic in the research agenda (Adomavicius and Ricci, 2009).",
        "One major challenge in context-aware recommendation research is the lack of large scale annotated data set.",
        "Ideally, a good research data set should contain contextual information besides users' explicit ratings on items.",
        "However, such kinds of data sets are not readily available for researchers.",
        "Previous research work in context based recommendation usually experiments on a small data set collected through user studies.",
        "Although undoubtedly useful, this approach is limited because 1) user studies are usually very expensive and their scales are small; 2) it is very hard for the research community to repeat such study; and 3) a personalized contextual system may not succeed until a user has interacted with it for a long period of time to enable context based recommendation models well trained.",
        "On the other hand, a large amount of review documents from web sites such as tri-padvisor.com, yelp.com, cnet.com, amazon.com, are available with certain contextual information, such as time and companion, implicitly in the reviews (see Table 1 for examples).",
        "This offers us an opportunity to apply information extraction techniques for obtaining contextual information from the review texts.",
        "Together with users' explicit ratings on items, this might lead to a large research data set for context based recommendation and consequently address the cold start issue in the recommender systems.",
        "This paper describes the methods that extract the contextual information from online reviews and their impact on the recommendation quality at different accuracy levels of the extraction methods.",
        "Another challenge is how to integrate contextual information into existing recommendation algorithms.",
        "Existing approaches can be classified into three major categories: pre-filtering, post-filtering and the modeling based approaches (Oku et al., 2007; Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2008).",
        "Pre-filtering approaches utilize contextual information to select data for that context, and then predict ratings using a traditional recommendation method on the selected data (Adomavicius et al., 2005).",
        "Post-filtering approaches first predict ratings on the whole data using traditional methods, then use the contextual information to adjust results.",
        "Both methods separate contextual information from the rating estimation process and leads to unsatisfying findings.",
        "For example, Adomavi-cious et al. (2005) found neither standard collaborative filtering nor contextual reduction-based methods dominate each other in all the cases.",
        "In the modeling based approaches, contextual information is used directly in the rating prediction process.",
        "For example, Oku et al. (2007) propose a context-aware SVM-based predictive model to classify restaurants into \"positive\" and \"negative\" classes, and contextual information is included as additional input features for the SVM classifier.",
        "However, treating recommendation as classification is not a common approach, and does not take advantage of the state of art collaborative filtering techniques.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic model to integrate contextual information into the state of art factorization based collaborative filtering approach, and compare it with several baselines."

        "Without loss of generality, we looked into widely available restaurant review data.",
        "More specifically, we investigated four types of contextual information for a dining event, as they might affect users' dining decisions, and they have not been studied carefully before.",
        "The four types of contextual information are: Companion (whether a dining event involves multiple people), Occasion (for what occasions the event is), Time (what time during the day) and Location (in which city the event happens).",

        "Companion: Extracting a companion's information accurately from review data is more difficult.",
        "We utilized two methods to address the challenge:",
        "Companion-Baseline: This is a string matching based approach.",
        "First, we automatically generated a lexicon of different kinds of companion words/phrases by using prepositional patterns, such as \"with my (our) NN (NNS)\".",

        "Companion-Classifier: In order to achieve better precision, we sampled and annotated 1000 sentences with companion terms from the corpus and built three classifiers: 1) a MaxEnt classifier with bag-of-words features, 2) a rule-based classifier, 3) a hybrid classifier.",
        "For the rule-based classifier, we looked into the structural aspects of the window where companion terms occurred, specifically, the adjacent verbs and prepositions associated with those terms.",
        "We collected high frequency structures including verbs, verbproposition combinations, and verb-genitive combinations from the whole corpus, and then constructed a list of rules to decide whether a companion context exists based on these structures.",

        "To train the classifier, we also included features such as POS tags of the verb and of the candidate companion term, the occurrence of a meal term (e.g. \"lunch\", \"dinner\"), the occurrence of pronouns (e.g. \"we\" or \"us\") and the genitive of the companion term.",

        "Reviews widely available online contain a large amount of contextual information.",
        "This paper proposes to leverage information extraction techniques to help recommender systems to train better context-aware recommendation models by mining reviews.",
        "We also introduce a probabilistic latent relation model for integrating the current context and the user's long term preferences.",
        "This model takes the advantages of traditional collaborative filtering approaches (CF).",
        "It also captures the interaction between contextual information and item characteristics.",
        "The experimental results demonstrate that context is an important factor that affects user choices.",
        "If properly used, contextual information helps ranking based recommendation systems, probably because context influences users' purchasing decisions.",
        "Besides, more accurate contextual information leads to better recommendation models.",
        "However, contextual information does not help the user rating prediction task significantly, probably because context doesn't matter much given the user has already chosen a restaurant.",
        "As the first step towards using the information extraction techniques to help contextual recommendation, the techniques used in this paper are far from optimal.",
        "In the future, we will research more effective text mining techniques for contextual extraction(Mazur and Dale, 2008; McCallum et al., 2000; Lafferty et al., 2001) at the same time increasing the amount of annotated review data for better classifier performance through actively learning (Laws and SchÃ¼tze, 2008).",
        "We also plan to work towards a better understanding of contextual information in recommender systems, and explore other types of contextual information in different types of recommendation tasks besides restaurant recommendations."
