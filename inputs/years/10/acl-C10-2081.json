        "In this paper, we propose a fast and robust sentence alignment algorithm, i.e., Fast-Champollion, which employs a combination of both length-based and lexicon-based algorithm.",
        "By optimizing the process of splitting the input bilingual texts into small fragments for alignment, Fast-Champollion, as our extensive experiments show, is 4.0 to 5.1 times as fast as the current baseline methods such as Champollion (Ma, 2006) on short texts and achieves about 39.4 times as fast on long texts, and Fast-Champollion is as robust as Champollion."

        "Sentence level aligned parallel corpora are very important resources for NLP tasks including machine translation, cross-language information retrieval and so on.",
        "These tasks typically require support by large aligned corpora.",
        "In general, the more aligned text we have, the better result we achieve.",
        "Although there is a huge amount ofbilin-gual text on the Internet, most of them are either only aligned at article level or even not aligned at all.",
        "Sentence alignment is a process mapping sentences in the source text to their corresponding units in the translated text.",
        "Manual sentence alignment operation is both expensive and time-consuming, and thus automated sentence alignment techniques are necessary.",
        "A sentence alignment algorithm for practical use should be (1) fast enough to process large corpora, (2) robust enough to tackle noise commonly present in the real data, and (3) effective enough to make as few mistakes as possible.",
        "Various sentence alignment algorithms have been proposed, which generally fall into three types: length-based, lexicon-based, and the hybrid of the above two types.",
        "Length-based algorithms align sentences according to their length (measured by character or word).",
        "The first length-based algorithm was proposed in (Brown et al., 1991).",
        "This algorithm is fast and has a good performance if there is minimal noise (e.g., sentence or paragraph omission) in the input bilingual texts.",
        "As this algorithm does not use any lexical information, it is not robust.",
        "Lexicon-based algorithms are usually more robust than the length-based algorithm, because they use the lexical information from source and translation lexicons instead of solely sentence length to determine the translation relationship between sentences in the source text and the target text.",
        "However, lexicon-based algorithms are slower than length-based sentence alignment algorithms, because they require much more expensive computation.",
        "Typical lexicon-based algorithms include (Ma, 2006; Chen, 1993; Utsuro et al., 1994; Melamed, 1996).",
        "Sentence length and lexical information are also combined to achieve more efficient algorithms in two ways.",
        "One way is to use both sentence length and lexical information together to determine whether two sentences should be directly aligned or not (Simard et al., 1993; Wu, 1994).",
        "The other way is to produce a rough alignment based on sentence length (and possibly some lexical information at the same time), and then build more precise alignment by using more effective lexicon-based algorithms (Moore, 2002; Vargaetal., 2005).",
        "But both of the two ways suffer from high computational cost and are not fast enough for processing large corpora.",
        "Lexical information is necessary for improving robustness of a sentence alignment algorithm, but use of lexical information will introduce higher computational cost and cause a lower speed.",
        "A common fact is that the shorter the text is, the less combination possibilities it would introduce and the less computational cost it would need.",
        "So if we can first split the input bilingual texts into small aligned fragments reliably with a reasonable amount of computational cost, and then further align these fragments one by one, we can speed up these algorithms remarkably.",
        "This is the main idea of our algorithm Fast-Champollion.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents formal definitions of sentence alignment problem, and briefly reviews the length-based sentence alignment algorithm and Champollion algorithm; Section 3 proposes the Fast-Champollion algorithm.",
        "Section 4 shows the experiment results; and Section 5 is the conclusion."

        "A bead represents a group of one or more sentences in the source text and the corresponding sentence(s) in the target text, denoted by Ai = (SAi] Tai) = Tbi ), where Si and Tj are the ith and jth sentence of S and T respectively.",
        "In practice, we rarely encounter crossing alignment, e.g., sentences Si and Sj of the source language are aligned to the sentences Tj and Ti of the target language respectively.",
        "But much more effort has to be taken for an algorithm to process crossing alignment well.",
        "So we do not consider crossing alignment here.",
        "In addition, only a few type of beads are frequently observed in the real world.",
        "As it can save significantly in terms of computational cost and it would not do significant harm to algorithm without considering rare bead types, a common practice for designing sentence alignment algorithms is to only consider the frequently observed types of beads.",
        "Following this practice, we only consider beads of 1-to-0, 0-to-1, 1-to-1, 1-to-2, 2-to-1, 1-to-3, 3-to-1, 1-to-4, 4-to-1 and 2-to-2 types in our algorithm, where n-to-m means the bead consists of n sentence(s) of the source language and m sentence(s) of the target language.",

        "For any two segments, a similarity is assigned based on the term pair weight, sentence number and sentence length.",
        "And the dynamic programming algorithm is used to search for the alignment with the greatest total similarity.",
        "This alignment is treated as the best alignment.",
        "Champollion aligner can produce good alignment even on noisy input as reported in (Ma, 2006).",

        "In this section we propose a new sentence alignment algorithm: Fast-Champollion.",
        "Its basis is splitting the input bilingual texts into small aligned fragments and then further aligning them one by one to reduce running time while maintaining Champollion-equivalent (or better) alignment quality; it takes the advantages of both length-based and lexicon-based algorithms to the maximum extent.",
        "The outline of the algorithm is that first the length-based splitting module is used to split the input bilingual texts into aligned fragments, and then the components of each of these fragments will be identified and aligned by a Champollion-based algorithm.",
        "The details are described in the following sections.",
        "Although length-based sentence alignment algorithm is not robust enough, it can produce rough alignment very fast with a certain number of reliably translated beads.",
        "Length-based splitting module is designed to select these reliably translated beads to be used for delimiting and splitting the input bilingual texts into fragments.",
        "These beads will be referred to as anchor beads in the remaining sections.",
        "There are four steps in this module as described below in detail.",
        "Step 1: decide whether to skip step 2-4 or not",
        "When there is too much noise in the input bilingual texts, the percentage of reliably translated beads in the alignment produced by the length-based algorithm will be very low.",
        "In this case, we will skip step 2 through 4.",
        "An evidence for such a situation is that the difference between the sentence numbers of the source and target language is too big.",
        "Suppose Ns and NT are the number of sentences of the source and target language respectively.",
        "We specify r = |Ns – NT|/ min{NS, NT} as a measure of the difference, where min means minimum.",
        "If r is bigger than a threshold, we say the difference is too big.",
        "In our experiments, the threshold is set as 0.4 empirically.",
        "Step 2: align the input texts using length-based algorithm",
        "In this step, length-based sentence alignment algorithm is used to align the input bilingual texts.",
        "Brown, et al.",
        "(1991) models the process of sentence alignment as two steps.",
        "First, a bead is generated according to a fixed probability distribution over bead types, and then sentence length in the bead is generated according to this model: for the 0 to-1 and 1-to-0 type of beads, it is assumed that the sentence lengths are distributed according to a probability distribution estimated from the data.",
        "For other type of beads, the lengths of sentences of the source language are generated independently from the probability distribution for the 0-to-1 and 1 to-0 type of beads, and the total length of sentences of the target language is generated according to a probability distribution conditioned on the total length of sentences of the source language.",
        "For a bead Ai = (SAi] Taî), lsAi and lTAi are the total lengths of sentences in SAi and TAi respectively, which are measured by word.",
        "Brown, et al.",
        "(1991) assumed this conditioned probability distribution is where Ai = log(lTAi/lSAi) and a is a normalization factor.",
        "Moore (2002) assumed the conditioned probability distribution is where r is the ratio of the mean length of sentences of the target language to the mean length of sentences of the source language.",
        "We tested the two models on our development corpus and the result shows that the first model performs better, so we choose the first one.",
        "Step 3: determine the anchor beads",
        "In this step, the reliably translated beads in the alignment produced by the length-based algorithm in Step 2 will be selected as anchor beads.",
        "The length-based algorithm can generate a probability for each bead it produces.",
        "So a trivial way is to choose the beads with a probability above certain threshold as anchor beads.",
        "But as pointed out before, when there is too much noise, the alignment produced by the length-based algorithm is no longer reliable, and so is it with the probability.",
        "A fact is that if we select a non-translated bead as an anchor bead, we will split the input bilingual texts into wrong fragments and may cause many errors.",
        "So we have to make decision conservatively in this step and we decide to use lexical information instead of the probability to determine the anchor beads.",
        "For a bead Ai = (SAi] Taî), the proportion of translation term-pairs is a good measure for determine whether this bead is reliably translated or not.",
        "In addition, use of local information will also be greatly helpful.",
        "To explain the use of \"local information\", let's define the fingerprint of a sentence first.",
        "Suppose we have a sequence of sentences Si; S2, • • • , Sm, and W(Si)is the set of distinct words in Si, then the fingerprint of Si is and specially f (Sm) = W(Sm) - W(Sm_i).",
        "The fingerprints of SAi and TAi, denoted by f (SAi) and f (TAi), are the unions of all the fingerprints of sentences in SAi and TAi respectively.",
        "As you can see, the fingerprint of a sentence is the set of words in the sentence that do not appear in the adjacent sentence(s), and thus can distinguish this sentence from its neighbors.",
        "So fingerprint is also a good measure.",
        "By combining these two measures together, we can select out more reliably translated beads.",
        "For a word w, we use dD(w) to denote the set of all its translations in a bilingual dictionary D, and use tD (w) to denote the union of {w} and dD(w), i.e., tD(w) = {w} U dD(w).",
        "Given two sets of words A and B.",
        "We say a word w of A is translated by B if either one of its translations in the dictionary D or the word itself appears in B, i.e., tD (w) n B = 0.",
        "The set of all the words of A that are translated by B is:",
        "hD(A, B) = {w G A and tD(w) n B = 0}.",
        "Then the proportion of terms in A that are translated by B is",
        "We specify the proportion of translation term pairs in a bead, denoted as arD(Ai), to be min{rD (W (Sa,),W (Ta{]),td(W (Ta,),W (Sa,))}, where W(SAi) and W(TAi) are the sets of distinct words in SAi and TAi respectively.",
        "Also we specify the proportion of translation term-pairs in the fingerprint, denoted as frD (Ai), to be min{rD(f (SAi), f (TAi)), rD(f (TAi), f (SAi))}.",
        "Given thresholds THar and THfr, a bead is selected as an anchor bead when arD(Ai) and frD (Ai) are not smaller than THar and THfrrespectively.",
        "We will show that Fast-Champollion algorithm is not sensitive to THar and TH/r to some extent in Section 4.2.",
        "Step 4: split the input bilingual texts",
        "The anchor beads determined in Step 3 are used to split the input texts into fragments.",
        "The ending location of each anchor bead is regarded as a splitting point, resulting in two fragments.",
        "The similarity function used by Champollion aligner is defined as follows.",
        "Given two (source and target language) groups of sentences in a fragment, denoted by GS=Si, S2,-• • ,Sm and GT=Ti, T2,-• • ,Tn, suppose there are k pairs of translated terms in GS and GT denoted by (wsi, wti),(ws2, wt2)^ • • ,(wsk, wtk), where wsi is in GS and wti is in GT.",
        "For each pair of the translated terms (wsi,wti), define idtf (wsi) to be",
        "Total # of terms in the whole document # occurrences of wsi in GS ' and define where stf (wsi) and stf (wti) are the frequency of wsi and wti in GS and GT respectively.",
        "The similarity between GS and GT is defined as x alignment .penalty xlength_penalty, where alignment .penalty is 1 for 1-to-1 alignment type of beads and a number between 0 and 1 for other type of beads, length_penalty is a function of the total sentence lengths of GS and GT.",
        "The reason for choosing Champollion aligner instead of other algorithms will be given in Section 4.2.",
        "And another question is how idtf values should be calculated.",
        "idtf is used to estimate how widely a term is used.",
        "An intuition is that idtf will work better if the texts are longer, because if the texts are short, most words will have a low frequency and will seem to only appear locally.",
        "In Fast-Champollion, we calculate idtf according to the whole document instead of each fragment.",
        "In this way, a better performance is achieved.",
        "A development corpus is used to estimate the parameters needed by Fast-Champollion.",
        "For the length-based algorithm, there are five parameters that need to be estimated.",
        "The first one is the probability distribution over bead types.",
        "The ratio of different types of beads in the development corpus is used as the basis for the estimation.",

        "Fast-Champollion is about 39.4 times as fast as Champollion with slightly lower Precision, Recall and F1-measure, and is just about 1.2 times slower than the length-based algorithm, which has much lower Precision, Recall and F1-measure.",
        "So Fast-Champollion is also applicable for long text, and has a significantly higher speed.",
        "The reason for Fast-Champollion can achieve relatively high speed is that the length-based splitting module can split the bilingual input texts into many small fragments reliably.",
        "We investigate the fragments produced by the length-based splitting module when aligning the long article used in Section 4.3.",
        "The length-based splitting module splits the long article at 1,993 places, and 1,972 segments are correct.",
        "The numbers of Chinese and English segments with no more than 30 Chinese and English sentences are shown in Figure 5.",
        "As there are only 27 and 29 segments with more than 30 sentences for Chinese and English respectively, we omit them in the figure.",
        "We can conclude that although the length-based splitting module is simple, it is efficient and reliable."

        "In this paper we propose a new sentence alignment algorithm Fast-Champollion.",
        "It reduces the running time by first splitting the bilingual input texts into small aligned fragments and then further aligning them one by one.",
        "The evaluations show that Fast-Champollion is fast, robust and effective enough for practical use, especially for aligning large amount of bilingual texts or long bilingual texts.",
        "Fast-Champollion needs a dictionary for aligning sentences, and shares the same problem of Champollion aligner as indicated in (Ma, 2006), that is the precision and recall will drop as the size of the dictionary decreases.",
        "So how to build bilingual dictionaries automatically is an important task for improving the performance of Fast-Champollion in practice, and is a critical problem for applying Fast-Champollion on language pairs without a ready to use dictionary.",
