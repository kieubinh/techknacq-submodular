        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL, Màrquez, 2009) is generally understood as the task of identifying the arguments of a given predicate and assigning them semantic labels describing the roles they play.",
        "For example, given a sentence The luxury auto maker sold 1,214 cars., the goal is to identify the arguments of sold and produce the following output: [A0 The luxury auto maker] [V sold] [A1 1,214 cars].",
        "Here A0 represents the seller, and A1 represents the things sold (CoNLL 2008 shared task, Surdeanu et al., 2008).",
        "This work has been done while the author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia.",
        "Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) first tackled SRL as an independent task, which is divided into several subtasks such as argument identification, argument classification, global inference, etc.",
        "Some researchers (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Koomen et al., 2005; Cohn and Blunsom, 2005; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Toutanova et al., 2005; Toutanova et al., 2008) used a pipelined approach to attack the task.",
        "Some others resolved the subtasks simultaneously.",
        "For example, some work (Musillo and Merlo, 2006; Merlo and Mu-sillo, 2008) integrated syntactic parsing and SRL into a single model, and another (Riedel and jointly handled all subtasks using Markov Logic Networks (MLN, Richardson and Domingos, 2005).",
        "All the above methods conduct sentence level SRL, and rely on parsers.",
        "Parsers have showed great effects on SRL performance.",
        "For example, Xue and Palmer (2004) reported that SRL performance dropped more than 10% when they used syntactic features from an automatic parser instead of the gold standard parsing trees.",
        "Even worse, parsers are not robust and cannot always analyze any input, due to the fact that some inputs are not in the language described by the parser's formal grammar, or adequately represented within the parser's training data.",
        "We propose a novel MLN-based method that collectively conducts SRL on groups of news sentences to leverage the content redundancy in news.",
        "To isolate the negative effect of noise from parsers and thus focus on the study of the contribution of redundancy to SRL, we use no parsers in our approach.",
        "We built a baseline SRL, which depends on no parsers, and use the MLN framework to exploit redundancy.",
        "Our intuition is that SRL on one sentence can help that on other differently phrased sentences with similar meaning.",
        "For example, consider the following sentence from a news article:",
        "A suicide bomber blew himself up Sunday in market in Pakistan's northwest crowded with shoppers ahead of a Muslim holiday, killing 12 people, including a mayor who once supported but had turned against the Taliban, officials said.",
        "The state-of-art MLN-based system (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009), hereafter referred to as MLNBS for brevity, incorrectly labels northwest instead of bomber as A0 of killing.",
        "Now consider another sentence from another news article:",
        "Police in northwestern Pakistan say that a suicide bomber has killed at least 13 people and wounded dozens of others.",
        "Here MLNBS correctly identify bomber as A0 of killing.",
        "When more sentences are observed where bomber as A0 of killing is correctly identified, we will be more confident that bomber should be labeled as A0 of killing, and that northwest should not be the A0 of killing according to the constraint that one predicate has at most one A0.",
        "We manually construct a news corpus to evaluate our method.",
        "In the corpus, semantic role information is annotated and sentences with similar meanings are grouped together.",
        "Experimental results show that news redundancy can significantly improve the performance of the baseline system.",
        "Our contributions can be summarized as follows:",
        "1.",
        "We present a novel method that conducts SRL on a set of sentences collectively, instead of on a single sentence, by extending MLNBS to leverage redundancy.",
        "2.",
        "We show redundancy can significantly improve the performance of the baseline system, indicating a promising research direction towards open SRL.",
        "In the next section, we introduce news sentence extraction and clustering.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our collective inference method.",
        "In Section 4, we show our experimental results.",
        "Finally, in Section 5 we conclude our paper with a discussion of future work."

        "To construct a corpus to evaluate our method, we extract sentences from clustered news articles returned by news search engines such as Bing and Google, and divide them into groups so that sentences in a group have similar meaning.",
        "News articles in the same cluster are supposed to report the same event.",
        "Thus we first group sentences according to the news cluster they come from.",
        "Then we split sentences in the same cluster into several groups according to the similarity of meaning.",
        "We assume that two sentences are more similar in meaning if they share more synonymous proper nouns and verbs.",

        "Our method includes two core components: a baseline system that conducts SRL on every sentence; and a collective inference system that accepts as input a group of sentences with preliminary SRL information provided by the baseline.",
        "We build the baseline by removing formulas involving syntactic parsing information from MLNBS (while keeping other rules) and retraining the system using the tool and scripts provided by Riedel and Meza-Ruiz (2008) on the manually annotated news corpus described in Section 4.",
        "A collective inference system is constructed to leverage redundancy in the SRL information from the baseline.",
        "We first redefine the predicate role and treat it as observed:",
        "predicate role: Int x Int x Int x Role; role has four parameters: the first one stands for the number of sentence in the input, which is necessary to distinguish the sentences in a group; the other three are taken from the arguments of the role predicate defined by Riedel and Meza-Ruiz (2008), which denote the positions of the predicate and the argument in the sentence and the role of the argument, respectively.",
        "If the predication holds, it returns 1, otherwise 0.",
        "A hidden predicate final_role is defined to present the final output, which has the same parameters as the predicate role:",
        "predicate finalrole: Int x Int x Int x Role;",
        "We introduce the following formula, which directly passes the semantic role from the baseline to the final output:",
        "Here s is the sentence number in a group; p and a denote the positions of the predicate and argument in s, respectively; r stands for the role of the argument; the \"+\" before the variable r indicates that different r has different weight.",
        "Then we define another formula for collective inference:",
        "Here p_lemma(a_lemma) stands for the lemma of the predicate(argument), which is obtained from the lemma dictionary.",
        "This dictionary is extracted from the dataset of CoNLL 2008 shared task and is normalized using synonym dictionary described in Section 2; lemma is an observed predicate that states whether or not the word has the lemma.",
        "Formula 2 encodes our basic ideas about collective SRL: given several sentences expressing similar meaning, if one sentence has a predicate p with an argument a of role r, the other sentences would be likely to have a predicate p ' with an argument a ' of role r, where p ' and a ' are the same or synonymous with p and a, respectively, as illustrated by the example in Section 1.",
        "Besides, we also apply structural constraints (Riedel and Meza-Ruiz, 2008) to finalrole.",
        "To learn parameters of the collective inference system, we use thebeast (Riedel and Meza-Ruiz, 2008), which is an open Markov Logic Engine, and train it on manually annotated news corpus described in Section 4."

        "We observe that predicate-argument relationships in sentences with complex syntax are usually not recognized by the baseline, but some of them are correctly identified by the collective inference systems.",
        "This, we guess, explains in large part the difference in performance.",
        "For instance, consider the following sentences in a group, where order and tell are synonyms:",
        "• Colombia said on Sunday it will appeal to the U.N. Security Council and the OAS after Hugo Chavez, the fiery leftist president of neighboring Venezuela, ordered his army to prepare for war in order to assure peace.",

        "As Table 1 shows, the CI system achieves the highest F-score (67.66%), and a higher precision than the CI-1 system, indicating the effectiveness of Formula 1.",

        "CI-1 mislabels (ordered, Venezuela, A1) for the first sentence because the baseline labels it for the second sentence.",
