        "In recent years, automatically extracting biomedical information has been the subject of significant research efforts due to the rapid growth in biomedical development and discovery.",
        "A wide concern is how to characterize protein interaction partners since it is crucial to understand not only the functional role of individual proteins but also the organization of the entire biological process.",
        "However, manual collection of relevant Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) information from thousands of research papers published every day is so time-consuming that automatic extraction approaches with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques become necessary.",
        "Various machine learning approaches for relation extraction have been applied to the biomedical domain, which can be classified into two categories: feature-based methods (Mitsumori et al., 2006; Giuliano et al., 2006; Sœtre et al., 2007) and kernel-based methods (Bunescu et al., 2005; Erkan et al., 2007; Airola et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2010).",
        "Provided a large-scale manually annotated corpus, the task of PPI extraction can be formulated as a classification problem.",
        "Typically, for featured-based learning each protein pair is represented as a vector whose features are extracted from the sentence involving two protein names.",
        "Early studies identify the existence of protein interactions by using \"bag-of-words\" features (usually uni-gram or bi-gram) around the protein names as well as various kinds of shallow linguistic information, such as POS tag, lemma and orthographical features.",
        "However, these systems do not achieve promising results since they disregard any syntactic or semantic information altogether, which are very useful for the task of relation extraction in the newswire domain (Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhou et al., 2005).",
        "Furthermore, feature-based methods fail to effectively capture the structural information, which is essential to",
        "Corresponding author",
        "identify the relationship between two proteins in a syntactic representation.",
        "With the wide application of kernel-based methods to many NLP tasks, various kernels such as subsequence kernels (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) and tree kernels (Li et al., 2008), are also applied to PPI detection..",
        "Particularly, dependency-based kernels such as edit distance kernels (Erkan et al., 2007) and graph kernels (Airola et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2010) show some promising results for PPI extraction.",
        "This suggests that dependency information play a critical role in PPI extraction as well as in relation extraction from newswire stories (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).",
        "In order to appreciate the advantages of both feature-based methods and kernel-based methods, composite kernels (Miyao et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2009a; Miwa et al., 2009b) are further employed to combine structural syntactic information with flat word features and significantly improve the performance of PPI extraction.",
        "However, one critical challenge for kernel-based methods is their computation complexity, which prevents them from being widely deployed in real-world applications regarding the large amount of biomedical literature being archived everyday.",
        "Considering the potential of dependency information for PPI extraction and the challenge of computation complexity of kernel-based methods, one may naturally ask the question: \"Can the essential dependency information be maximally exploited in featured-based PPI extraction so as to enhance the performance without loss of efficiency?\"",
        "\"If the answer is Yes, then How?\"",
        "This paper addresses these problems, focusing on the application of dependency information to feature-based PPI extraction.",
        "Starting from a baseline system in which common lexical and syntactic features are incorporated using Support Vector Machines (SVM), we further augment the baseline with various features related to dependency information, including predicates in the dependency tree.",
        "Moreover, in order to reveal the linguistic difference between distinct domains we also compare the effects of various features on PPI extraction from biomedical texts with those on relation extraction from newswire narratives.",
        "Evaluation on the AIMed and other PPI corpora shows that our method achieves the best performance among all feature-based systems.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "A feature-based PPI extraction baseline system is given in Section 2 while Section 3 describes our dependency-driven method.",
        "We report our experiments in Section 4, and compare our work with the related ones in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 concludes this paper and gives some future directions."

        "For feature-based methods, PPI extraction task is recast as a classification problem by first transforming PPI instances into multidimensional vectors with various features, and then applying machine learning approaches to detect whether the potential relationship exists for a particular protein pair.",
        "In training, a feature-based classifier learning algorithm, such as SVM or MaxEnt, uses the annotated PPI instances to learn a classifier while, in testing, the learnt classifier is in turn applied to new instances to determine their PPI binary classes and thus candidate PPI instances are extracted.",
        "As a baseline, various linguistic features, such as words, overlap, chunks, parse tree features as well as their combined ones are extracted from a sentence and formed as a vector into the feature-based learner.",
        "Four sets of word features are used in our system: 1) the words of both the proteins; 2) the words between the two proteins; 3) the words before M1 (the 1st protein); and 4) the words after M2 (the 2nd protein).",
        "Both the words before M1 and after M2 are classified into two bins: the first word next to the proteins and the second word next to the proteins.",
