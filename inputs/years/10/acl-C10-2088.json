        "Most of participatory websites such as Amazon (amazon.com) do not collect from users featureratings for services, simply because it may cost users too much effort to provide detailed feature ratings.",
        "Even for a very few websites that do collect feature ratings such as a popular travel website TripAdvisor (tripadvisor.com), a big portion (approximately 43%) of users may still not provide them.",
        "However, feature ratings are useful for users to make informed consumption decisions especially in the case where users may be interested more in some particular features of the services.",
        "Machine learning techniques have been proposed for sentiment classification (Pang et al., 2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004) based on annotated samples from experts, but they have limited performance especially when estimating ratings of a multipoint scale (Pang and Lee, 2005).",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel review selection approach for accurate feature rating estimation.",
        "More specifically, our approach selects reviews written by the users who comprehensively talk about a certain feature of a service - that are comprehensive on this feature, using information distance of reviews on the feature based on Kolmogorov complexity (Li and Vitanyi, 1997).",
        "This feature is obviously important to the users.",
        "People tend to be more knowl-edgable in the aspects they consider important.",
        "These users therefore represent a subset of experts.",
        "Statistical analysis reveals that these expert users are more likely to agree on a common rating for the feature of the service.",
        "The rating estimation of the feature for these selected reviews based on annotated samples from experts using machine learning techniques is thus able to provide more accurate results than that for other reviews.",
        "This statistical evidence also allows us to use the average of the estimated feature ratings to better represent an overall opinion of experts for the feature of the service, which will be particularly useful for assisting other users to correctly make their consumption decisions.",
        "We verify our approach and arguments based on real data collected from the TripAdvisor website.",
        "First, our approach is shown to be able to effectively select reviews that comprehensively talk about features of a service.",
        "We then adopt the machine learning method proposed in (Pang and Lee, 2005) and the Bayesian Network classifier (Russell and Norvig, 2002) for feature rating estimation.",
        "Our experimental results show that the accuracy of estimating feature ratings for these selected reviews is higher than that for other reviews, for both the machine learning methods.",
        "And, the average of these estimated ratings is testified to closely represent the overall feature rating of the service.",

        "The task of sentiment classification is to determine the semantic orientations of words, sentences or documents.",
        "(Pang et al., 2002) is the earliest work of automatic sentiment classification at document level, using several machine learning approaches with common textual features to classify movie reviews.",
        "Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004) integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors and some syntactic relations into the features of SVM.",
        "Pang and Lee (Pang and Lee, 2004) proposed another machine learning method based on subjectivity detection and minimum-cut in graph.",
        "However, these approaches focus only on binary classification of reviews.",
        "In 2005, Pang and Lee extended their earlier work in (Pang and Lee, 2004) to determine a reviewer's evaluation with respect to multi-scales (Pang and Lee, 2005).",
        "The rating estimation is viewed as multi-class sentiment categorization on documents.",
        "They used SVM regression as the multi-class classifier, and also applied a meta-algorithm based on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, which alters a given nary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels.",
        "They collected movie reviews from a website named IMDB and tested the performance of their classifier under both four-class and five-class categorization.",
        "The five-class sentiment classification is adopted in the evaluation of our method (see Section 5).",
        "The performance of their approach is limited.",
        "One important reason is that their method considers every review when estimating a feature rating of a movie.",
        "However, some reviews do not contain much of the users' opinions about a certain feature simply because the users do not care much or are not knowledgable about the feature.",
        "In our work, we study the characteristics of reviews' feature ratings.",
        "We investigate which reviews are more useful for us to estimate feature ratings.",
        "From some observations stated in the next section, we will see that reviews written by different users reflect their own preferred features of a service."

        "Participatory websites allow users to write textual reviews to discuss features of services that they have consumed.",

        "Our review selection approach selects reviews that comprehensively talk about a feature.",
        "According to this definition, a review's comprehensiveness depends on the amount of information discussed on a feature.",
        "We use Kolmogorov complexity and information distance to measure the amount of information.",
        "Kolmogorov complexity was introduced almost half a century ago by R. Solomonoff, A.N.",
        "Kolmogorov and G. Chaitin, see (Li and Vitanyi, 1997).",
        "It is now widely accepted as an information theory for individual objects parallel to that of Shannon's information theory which is defined on an ensemble of objects.",
        "Fix a universal Turing machine U.",
        "The Kolmogorov complexity (Li and Vitanyi, 1997) of a binary string x condition to another binary string y, Ku (x|y), is the length of the shortest (prefix-free) program for U that outputs x with input y.",
        "It can be shown that for different universal Turing machine U', for all x, y where the constant C depends only on UThus Ku(x|y) can be simply written as K(x|y).",
        "They write K(x|e), where e is the empty string, as K (x).",
        "It has also been defined in (Bennett et al., 1998) that the energy to convert between x and y to be the smallest number of bits needed to convert from x to y and vice versa.",
        "That is, with respect to a universal Turing machine U, the cost of conversion between x and y is:",
        "It is clear that E(x,y) < K(x|y) + K(y|x).",
        "From this observation, the following theorem has been proved in (Bennett et al., 1998):",
        "Theorem 1 E(x,y) = max{K (x|y),K (y|x)}.",
        "This distance is shown to satisfy the basic distance requirements such as positivity, sym-metricity, triangle inequality and is admissible.",
        "Here for an object x, we can measure its information by Kolmogorov complexity K(x); for two objects x and y, their shared information can be measured by information distance D(x,y).",
        "In (Long et al., 2008), the authors generalize the theory of information distance to more than two objects.",
        "Similar to Equation 1, given strings xi,..., xn, they define the minimum amount of thermodynamic energy needed to convert from any xi to any xj as:",
        "Theorem 2 Modulo to an O(log n) additive factor,",
        "Given n objects, the left-hand side of Equation 3 may be interpreted as the most comprehensive object that contains the most information about all of the others.",
        "Our review selection method is based on the information distance discussed in the previous section.",
        "However, our problem is that neither the Kolmogorov complexity K(•, •) nor Dmax(-, •) is computable.",
        "Therefore, we find a way to \"approximate\" these two measures.",
        "The most useful information in a review article is the English words that are related to the features.",
        "If we can extract all of these related words from the review articles, the size of the word set can be regarded as a rough estimation of information content (or Kolmogorov complexity) of the review articles.",
        "In Section 5 we will see that this gives very good practical results.",
        "Our method is outlined in the following.",
        "First, for each type of product or service (such as a hotel), a small set of core feature words (such as price and room) is generated through statistics.",
        "Then, these feature words are used to generate the expanded words.",
        "Third, a parser is used to find the dependent words associated with the occurrence of the core feature words and expanded words in a review.",
        "For each review-feature pair, the union of the core feature words, expanded words and dependent words in the review defines the related word set of the review on the feature.",
        "Lastly, information distance is used to select the most comprehensive reviews on a feature.",
        "Feature words are the most direct and frequent words describing a feature, for example, price, room or service of a hotel.",
        "Given a feature, the core feature words are the very few most common English words that are used to refer to that feature.",
        "For example, both \"value\" and \"price\" are used to refer to the same feature of a hotel.",
        "In (Hu and Liu, 2004), the authors indicate that when customers comment on product features, the words they use converge.",
        "If we remove the feature words with frequency lower than 1% of the total frequency of all feature words, the remaining words, which are just core feature words, can still cover more than 90% occurrences.",
        "So firstly we extract those words through statistics; then some of those with the same meaning (such as \"value\" and \"price\") are grouped into one feature.",
        "They are just \"core feature words\".",
        "Apart from core feature words, many other less-frequently used words that are connected to the feature also contribute to the information content of the feature.",
        "For example, \"price\" is an important feature of a hotel, but the word \"price\" is usually dropped from a sentence.",
        "Instead, words such as \"$\", \"dollars\", \"USD\", and \"CAD\" are used.",
        "We use information distance .)",
        "based on Google to expand words (Cili-brasi and Vitanyi, 2007).",
        "Let a be a feature and A be the set of its core feature words.",
        "The distance between a word w and the feature a is then defined to be",
        "A distance threshold is then used to determine which words should be in the set of expanded words for a given feature.",
        "If a core feature word or an expanded word is found in a sentence, the words which have grammatical dependent relationship with it are called the dependent words (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "For example, in sentence \"It has a small, but beautiful room\", the words \"small\" and \"beautiful\" are both dependent words of the core feature word \"room\".",
        "All these words also contribute to the reviews and are important to determine the reviewer's attitude towards a feature.",
        "The Stanford Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) is used to parse each review.",
        "For review i and feature j, the core feature words and expanded words in the review are first computed.",
        "Then the parsing result is examined to find all the dependent words for the core feature words and expanded words, all of which are called \"related words\".",
        "If there are m reviews x1; x2,..., xm, n features u1; u2,..., un, and the related word set Siis defined to be the union of all the related words that occur in the review xi.",
        "From the left-hand side of Equation 3, the most comprehensive xi on feature uk is such that",
        "Let Si and Sj be two sets of words, where w G Sj and w is in xj's related word set on feature uk.",
        "For each word w in a set S, the Kol-mogorov complexity can be estimated through coding theorem (Li and Vitanyi, 1997):",
        "where P(w, uk) can be estimated by df (w, uk), which is the document frequency of word w and feature uk coexist on the whole corpus.",
        "Similarly, P(uk) can be estimated by feature uk's document frequency on the corpus.",
