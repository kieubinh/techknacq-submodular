        "Most prior work on transliteration has been done for MT of English, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc., for CLIR (Lee and Choi., 1998; Jeong et al., 1999; Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001; Sakai et al., 2002; Pirkola et al., 2003; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003; Yan et al., 2003), and for the development of multilingual resources (Kang and Choi, 2000; Yan, Gregory et al., 2003).",
        "The terms transliteration and transcription are often used as generic terms for various processes like transliteration, transcription, romanization, transcribing and technography (Halpern, 2002).",
        "In general, the speech processing community uses the term transcription to denote a process of conversion from the script or writing system to the sound (phonetic representation).",
        "For example, the transcription of the word \"love\" in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is [lav].",
        "While the text processing community uses the term transliteration and defines it as a process of converting a word written in one writing system into another writing system while preserving the sound of the original word (Al-Onaizan and",
        "Knight, 2002; AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003).",
        "More precisely, the text processing community defines the term transliteration as two transcription processes \"source script to sound transcription\" and \"sound to target script transcription\" and sometimes as one transcription process \"source script to target script transcription\".",
        "We propose a new term Scriptural Translation for this combined process.",
        "Scriptural translation is a process of transcribing a word written in the source language script into the target language script by preserving its articulation in the original language in such a way that the native speaker of the target language can produce the original pronunciation.",

        "Finite-state methods are robust and efficient to implement scriptural translation rules in a very precise and compact manner.",

        "The above results support our hypothesis that lack of important information in the source texts considerably lowers the quality of scriptural translation.",
        "They are crucial and their absence in the input texts decreases the performance considerably, from more than 80% to less than 60% at word level.",
        "Thus restoration of the missing information and the diacritical marks or reducing the effect of their absence on the scriptural translation is one of the major questions for further study and work.",
        "In general, only word accuracy rates are reported.",
        "We have observed that only word accuracy rates may depict a good performance, but the performance of the same system at sentence-level may be not very good.",
        "Therefore, subjective evaluations and usage of translation results in real life should also be considered while evaluating the translation quality."
