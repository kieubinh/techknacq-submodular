        "Visual document analysis systems such as INSPIRE have demonstrated their applicability in managing large text corpora, identifying topics within a document and quickly identifying a set of relevant documents by visual exploration.",
        "The success of such systems depends on several factors with the most important one being the quality of the dimensionality reduction.",
        "This is obvious as visual exploration can be made possible only when the dimensionality reduction preserves the structure of the original space, i.e., documents that convey similar topics are mapped to nearby regions in the low dimensional 2D or 3D space.",
        "Standard dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), locally linear embedding (LLE) (Roweis and Saul, 2000), or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) take as input a set of feature vectors such as bag of words.",
        "An obvious drawback is that such methods ignore the textual nature of documents and instead consider the vocabulary words vi,...,vn as abstract orthogonal dimensions.",
        "In this paper we introduce a framework for incorporating domain knowledge into dimensionality reduction for text documents.",
        "Our technique does not require any labeled data, therefore is completely unsupervised.",
        "In addition, it applies to a wide variety of domain knowledge.",
        "We focus on the following type of non-Euclidean geometry where the distance between document x and y is defined as",
        "Here T G Rnxn is a symmetric positive semidef-inite matrix, and we assume that documents x, y are represented as term-frequency (tf) column vectors.",
        "Since T can always be written as HTH for some matrix H G Rnxn, an equivalent but sometimes more intuitive interpretation of (1) is to compose the mapping x H> Hx with the Euclidean geometry",
        "We can view T as encoding the semantic similarity between pairs of words and H as smoothing the tf vector by mapping observed words to related but unobserved words.",
        "Therefore, the geometry realized by (1) or (2) may be used to derive novel dimensionality reduction methods that are customized to text in general and to specific text domains in particular.",
        "The main challenge is to obtain the matrices H or T that describe the relationship among vocabulary words appropriately.",
        "We consider three general ways of obtaining H or T using domain knowledge.",
        "The first corresponds to manually specifying H or T based on the semantic relationship among words (determined by domain expert).",
        "The second corresponds to constructing H or T by analyzing relationships between different words using corpus statistics.",
        "The third is based on knowledge obtained from linguistic resources.",
        "Whether to specify H directly or indirectly by specifying T =",
        "HTH depends on the knowledge type and is discussed in detail in Section 4.",
        "We investigate the performance of the proposed dimensionality reduction methods for three text domains: sentiment visualization for movie reviews, topic visualization for newsgroup discussion articles, and visual exploration of ACL papers.",
        "In each of these domains we evaluate the dimensionality reduction using several different quantitative measures.",
        "All the techniques mentioned in this paper are unsupervised, making use of labels only for evaluation purposes.",
        "Our take home message is that all three approaches mentioned above improves dimensionality reduction for text upon standard embedding (H = I).",
        "Furthermore, geometries obtained from corpus statistics are superior to manually constructed geometries and to geometries derived from standard linguistic resources such as WordNet.",
        "Combining heterogenous types of knowledge provides the best results."

        "It is reasonable to expect that the words emphasized for visualizing topics in news stories might be different than the words emphasized for visualizing writing styles or sentiment content.",
        "Applying the geometry (1) or (2) to dimensionality reduction is easily accomplished by first mapping document tf vectors x H> Hx and proceeding with standard dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE.",
