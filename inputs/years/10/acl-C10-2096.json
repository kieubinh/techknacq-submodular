        "In this paper, we have proposed a lattice-forest based model to alleviate the problem of error propagation in traditional single-best pipeline framework.",
        "Unlike previous works, which only focus on one module at a time, our model successfully integrates lattice into a state-of-the-art forest tree-to-string system.",
        "We have explored the algorithms of lattice parsing, rule extraction and decoding.",
        "Our model postpones the disambiguition of segmentation and parsing into the final translation step, so that we can make a more global decision to search for the best segmentation, parse-tree and translation in one step.",
        "The experimental results show that our lattice-forest approach achieves an absolute improvement of +0.9 points in term of BLEU score over a state-of-the-art forest-based model.",
        "For future work, we would like to pay more attention to word alignment between lattice pairs and forest pairs, which would be more principled than our current method of word alignment between most-refined segmentation and string.",
