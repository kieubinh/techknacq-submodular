        "In this paper, an automatic method for Persian WordNet construction based on Prenceton WordNet 2.1 (PWN) is introduced.",
        "The proposed approach uses Persian and English corpora as well as a bilingual dictionary in order to make a mapping between PWN synsets and Persian words.",
        "Our method calculates a score for each candidate synset of a given Persian word and for each of its translation, it selects the synset with maximum score as a link to the Persian word.",
        "The manual evaluation on selected links proposed by our method on 500 randomly selected Persian words, shows about 76.4% quality respect to precision measure.",
        "By augmenting the Persian WordNet with the unambiguous words, the total accuracy of automatically extracted Persian WordNet is about 82.6% which outperforms the previously semi-automated generated Persian WordNet by about 12.6%."

        "A broad overview of the different PWN applications such as \"Machine Translation\", \"Information Retrieval\", \"Document Classification\", \"Query Answering\" and \"Conceptual Identification\" have been presented in (Morato et al., 2004).",

        "PWN database contains about 150000 words organized in over 115000 synsets.",
        "Manual construction of WordNet is a time consuming task and requires linguistic knowledge.",
        "A number of automatic methods were proposed for constructing WordNet for other languages that use PWN and other existing lexical resources.",
        "In order to help the development of WordNets for other languages rather than English, especially for European one, a project named EuroWordNet was found (Vossen, 1999), in which a number of automatic methods for construction of such databases were proposed (Farreres et al., 1998).",
        "There have been some other efforts to create a WordNet for Persian language (Famian, 2007; Rouhizadeh et al., 2008; Shamsfard, 2008) but there exists no Persian WordNet yet that covers all Persian words in dictionary and comparable with PWN.",
        "These projects have tried to construct Persian WordNet in the manually or semi automatic manner.",
        "In (Shamsfard, 2008) a semi automatic method is proposed in which for each Persian word a number of PWN synsets are suggested by system in order to be supervised by a human annotator to select a relevant synset.",
        "Based on experiments mentioned by Shamsfard (2008), the proposed WordNet extracted automatically by the system, retrieved about 70% accuracy.",
        "In this paper a fully automatic method for constructing a large-scale Persian WordNet from available resource such as PWN, MRDs and corpora has been proposed.",
        "Our approach uses different word similarity metrics like mutual information and WordNet similarity to map Persian words to appropriate PWN synsets."

        "In the related field of automatic and semi automatic WordNet construction, several efforts have been made.",

        "About 1500 verbs and 1500 nouns have been gathered manually to make WorldNet's core.",
        "Then some heuristics and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods have been used to find the most likely related Persian synsets.",
        "According to the first heuristic, a Persian word has only one synset if it's be translated to a single English word.",
        "In this case no ambiguity exists for the Persian word whose one of synsets will be equivalent with that of English word.",
        "In other cases, second heuristic is used: if two translations of a Persian word have only one common synset then for the Persian word this common synset is selected.",
        "The existence of a single common synset in fact implies the existence of a single common sense between the two words and therefore their Persian translations shall be connected to this synset (Shamsfard, 2008).",
        "For words whose English translations have more than one synset and second heuristic cannot find the appropriate synset, WSD methods have been used to select correct synset.",
        "For each candidate synset, a score is calculated using the measure of semantic similarity and synset gloss words.",

        "The candidate links between Thai words and synsets have been derived from semantic links which are obtained from WordNet and the translation links which are obtained from LEXiTRON.",
        "In order to derive links between Thai words and PWN synsets, 13 criteria have been used which are categorized into three groups: monosemic, polysemic and structural criteria.",
        "Monosemic criteria focus on an English word which has only one meaning.",
        "Such English word has one synset in PWN.",
        "Polysemic criteria focus on an English word which has multiple meaning.",

        "In order to verify links that constructed using these 13 criteria, stratified sampling technique has been applied and for each criterion 400 links have been verified manually.",
        "The results of verification show that the best criterion has 92% correctness and the lowest correctness is equal 49.25%.",
        "In PWN, there is a gloss for each synset that can be used in automatic WordNet construction.",
        "In (Kaji and Watanabe, 2006) this information has been used for automatic construction of Japanese WordNet.",
        "Given an English synset, it calculates the score for each of its Japanese translation candidates according to the gloss appended to the synset.",
        "A pair of words is called associated if mutual information between them be larger than a threshold.",
        "The score is defined as the sum of correlations between the translation candidate and the associated words appearing in the gloss.",
        "Whereas availability of bilingual corpora is limited, for calculating pair wise correlation between the Japanese translations of an English word and its associated words an iteratively approach has been proposed that calculate this correlation without using bilingual corpora.",
        "In (Lee et al., 2000) a set of automatic WSD techniques have been described for linking Korean words collected from a bilingual MRD to PWN synsets.",
        "For a given synset, 6 individual heuristic scores are calculated and then a decision tree is used to combine these scores to classify the synset as linking or discarding.",
        "In order to make the decision tree, a set of synsets have been labeled manually as linking or discarding and corresponding heuristic scores have been calculated and then used for training data set.",
        "To evaluate the accuracy of proposed method the candidate synsets of 3260 senses of Korean words have been classified manually as linking or discarding.",
        "This test set has been used to calculate precision of each heuristic.",
        "The results of experiments show that the precision of all heuristics is better than random mapping and the best heuristic have 75.21% precision.",
