        "An online debate is a forum where each user post an opinion on a particular topic while other users state their positions by posting their remarks within the debate.",
        "The supporting or opposing remarks are made by directly replying to the opinion, or indirectly to other remarks (to express local agreement or disagreement), which makes the task of identifying users' general positions difficult.",
        "A prior study has shown that a link-based method, which completely ignores the content of the remarks, can achieve higher accuracy for the identification task than methods based solely on the contents of the remarks.",
        "In this paper, we show that utilizing the textual content of the remarks into the link-based method can yield higher accuracy in the identification task."

        "Social computing tools, such as a SNS (Social Network Service) or an online discussion board have become very powerful communication tools for discussing topics with people around the world.",
        "Many companies use these kinds of social computing tools to understand their customers' requirements and their marketing activities.",
        "Social computing tools are very useful not only for aggregating customers' opinions outside the companies, but also for aggregating their employees' ideas.",
        "For example, IBM has held Jam sessions, which are short-term online discussions to aggregate ideas from employees and customers.",
        "The results of Jam sessions help management decisions, for instance the technology areas to invest.",
        "Not just enterprises, but some nations are trying to aggregate their citizens' ideas in the Internet and provide systems for discussions at the people-to-people levels as part of the movement for open government.",
        "The United States government has the Idea Factory website for collecting ideas to enhance activities of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Open For Questions^ to collect requests for the US government.",
        "The motivation for creating these kinds of online discussions is not limited to collecting ideas but also to help understand the trends of opinions about the ideas or topics.",
        "This means that getting a quick overview of opinions about ideas is a key point for the success of online discussions.",
        "In this paper we propose a method to show quick overview of participants' positions, \"Support\" or \"Oppose\" for the main idea or topic in online debates.",
        "It is difficult to identify each person's position for a topic directly, since most of opinionative expressions are made not for main topic but for adjacent remarks.",
        "This causes a difficulty in building answer sets for classifier.",
        "The following example shows opinion expressions for a main topic focused on an adjacent remark in a debate.",
        "In this example, The main topic is \"Travel and F2F (face-to-face) meeting is fundamental to business\".",
        "Remark A Travel isn't necessary because besides the high cost oftrav-els around the world, today we have a lot of communication tools, for instance web conference, video chat that can easily contribute to join leaders around the world in a cheaper way.",
        "Remark B I disagree.",
        "Without travel and F2F meetings global integration does not work as well or as quickly.",
        "It doesn't mean that everybody has to travel all the time, but at least some meetings are key to success.",
        "The author of Remark A mentions that travel is not necessary to business.",
        "This opinion opposed to the main topic, so that the position for the main topic is \"Oppose\".",
        "In contrast, the opinion expression in Remark B is not an opinion about the main topic, but relates to the previous opinion in Remark A.",
        "This opinion expression indicates that the author of Remark B disagrees with the opinion of Remark A, and indirectly implies agreement with the main topic.",
        "Thus, although it is hard to infer the global position of Remark B from only the surface expressions, it is straightforward to infer that an opinion in Remark B about Remark A is negative (i.e., Remark B expresses disagreement with Remark A).",
        "In this paper, positions with regards to the main topic (global positions) are classified into two classes: support and oppose, while opinions about the previous remarks (local positions) are classified into three: agree, disagree, and neutral.",
        "For example, let us consider the case in Fig. 1, where Remark \"a\" is the main topic, and Remark \"b\" is the reply to Remark \"a\" and Remark \"c\" is the reply to Remark \"b\".",
        "Here, let b(a) be the local position, that is, opinion (agree/disagree/neutral) in Remark \"b\" on the topic in Remark \"a\".",
        "For example, if b(a) and c(b) are disagree, one can determine that the authors of the corresponding remarks are in the opposition.",
        "That is, the author of Remark \"c\" agrees with Author A (the author of Remark \"a\"), that is, the main topic, while Author B is against the others.",
        "On the contrary, if b(a) is disagree and c(b) is agree, then Author C agrees with Author B and therefore it implies that Author C is against Author A.",
        "In this case, only Author A supports the main topic while Author B and Author C oppose to the main topic.",
        "To infer supporting or opposing positions with regards to the main topic, two steps are used.",
        "First, the degree of disagreement between any two users is computed from the link structure and the text of each pair of their adjacent replies.",
        "This is used as the link weight between nodes (which correspond to users in a debate) in the network.",
        "Second, the bipartition of the users in the weighted network is computed by finding a bipartition that induces the maximum cut of the network, a partition of nodes into two disjoint sets that maximizes the sum of the weights of the links connecting nodes in different sets.",
        "Since the weight of the links is higher (more positive) when the degree of disagreement is higher, the bipartition is expected to express two groups of opposing positions.",
        "In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some experiments to identify the supporting and opposing positions of participants in online debates.",
        "The experimental results indicate that our method leads to higher precision than the baseline method, which is described in (Agrawal et al., 2003).",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "First we describe related work in Section 2, and in Section 3 we propose our method for identifying participants' positions from their reply activities and text contents.",
        "In Section 4 we explain the data sets used for the evaluations and show the experimental results of an opinion classifier for adjacent remarks and a support/oppose classifier for the participants in online debates.",
        "We conclude this paper and describe future work in Section 5."

        "We call the degree of divergence in the opinions between participants a reaction coefficient.",
        "This reaction coefficient is defined as a function of the participants i,j, represented as r(i,j).",
        "To calculate reaction coefficients, we extracted pairs of a remark and its reply remark, and assigned \"local position flags\" to the pairs.",
        "There are three local position flags, \"agree\", \"disagree\", and \"neutral\".",
        "The reaction coefficient r(i, j) between participants i and j is defined as:",
        "where Nopinion (i, j) is the number of remark pairs with opinion as the corresponding local position flag between participants i and j.",
        "Typically we assign a positive value to a, a slightly positive value to ÃŸ, and a negative value to 7.",
        "This means that r(i, j) is positive when there are only neutral remarks between user i and j.",
        "This is based on the hypothesis in (Agrawal et al., 2003) that replies usually indicate disagreement with previous remarks.",
        "There is no directionality in reaction coefficients so that r(i, j) = r(j, i).",
        "3.2 Classification of Participants' Positions based on the Max Cut Problem",
        "Let the graph corresponding to the activity network of the participants in an online debate be G(V, E), where V is the set of nodes that corresponds to participants and E is the set of edges each of which links participants that exchanged remarks.",
        "For any i, j G V, let r(i, j) be the weight of the link between i and j.",
        "A partition of the participants into supporting and opposing parties, Ssup and Sopp respectively, is computed by solving the max cut problem on G(V, E) defined as follows.",
        "[Max cut problem] Given G(V, E) as above, find a bipartition of V into Ssup and Sopp = V \\ Ssup so that Eiessup,iesopp j) is maximized.",
        "The max cut problem is known to be NP-hard, and thus in general is difficult to solve.",
        "However, good approximation algorithms based on Linear Programming and Semidefinite Programming have been developed recently, and combined with branch-and-bound techniques a good exact max-cut solver called BiqMac exists (Rendl et al., 2010).",
        "We used BiqMac for solving the max cut problem exactly on the activity network.",
        "Although a faster approximate max cut solver is used in (Agrawal et al., 2003), it is based on the limiting assumption that the size of Sopp is approximately the same as Sopp.",
        "This cannot be assumed for the networks in this paper."

        "However, in an online debate the replies are also used for clarifying previous remarks and quite often for supporting the previous ones.",
        "Our proposed method uses not only the link structure of the replies, but also the textual contents of the local agreement/disagreement positions between the remarks to boost the accuracy of the task of classifying users into the supporting and opposing parties.",
        "The proposed method is based on the observation that it is easier to use the textual contents for classifying the local positions of a user's replies with regards to the previous remarks, than to use them (e.g., by aggregating them) for classifying his/her global position with regards to the main topic of the debate.",
        "In our experiments, we used a rule-based classifier to classify the replies into agree, disagree, and neutral (with regards to the previous replies) and used these classifier's result to determine the weight of the corresponding links in the link structure of the reply network.",
