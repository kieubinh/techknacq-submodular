        "A dictionary plays an important role in Japanese morphological analysis, or the joint task of segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Kurohashi et al., 1994; Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000; Kudo et al., 2004).",
        "Like Chinese and Thai, Japanese does not delimit words by white-space.",
        "This makes the first step of natural language processing more ambiguous than simple POS tagging.",
        "Accordingly, morphemes in a predefined dictionary compactly represent our knowledge about both segmentation and POS.",
        "One obvious problem with the dictionary-based approach is caused by unknown morphemes, or morphemes not defined in the dictionary.",
        "Even though, historically, extensive human resources were used to build high-coverage dictionaries (Yokoi, 1995), texts other than newspaper articles, in particular web pages, contain a large number of unknown morphemes.",
        "These unknown morphemes often cause segmentation errors.",
        "For example, morphological analyzer JU-MAN 6.0 wrongly segments the phrase \"C£ol£ (saQporo eki, \"Sapporo Station\"), where \" C£ol£6> \" (saQporo) is an unknown morpheme, as follows:",
        "\"cC\" (sa, noun-common, \"difference\"), \"o\" (Q, UNK), (po, UNK), \"6\" (ro, noun-common, \"sumac\") and \"II\" (eki, noun-common, \"station\"), where UNK refers to unknown morphemes automatically identified by the analyzer.",
        "Such an erroneous sequence has disastrous effects on applications of morphological analysis.",
        "For example, it can hardly be identified as a LOCATION in named entity recognition.",
        "One solution to the unknown morpheme problem is unknown morpheme acquisition (Mori and Nagao, 1996; Murawaki and Kurohashi, 2008).",
        "It is the task of automatically augmenting the dictionary by acquiring unknown morphemes from text.",
        "In the above example, the goal is to acquire the morpheme (saQporo) with the POS tag \"noun-location name.\"",
        "However, unknown morpheme acquisition usually adopts a coarser POS tagset that only represents the morphology level distinction among noun, verb and adjective.",
        "This means that \" cC o f3?6\" (saQporo) is acquired as just a noun and that the semantic label \"location name\" remains to be assigned.",
        "The reason only the morphology level distinction is made is that the semantic level distinction cannot easily be captured with morphological clues that are exploited in unknown morpheme acquisition.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the remaining problem and introduce the new task of semantic classification that is to be applied to automatically acquired nouns.",
        "In this task, we can exploit syntactic clues in addition to morphological ones because, as a result of acquisition, we can now rely on automatic parsing.",
        "For example, since text containing \"£of3?6\" (saQporo, noun-unclassified) is correctly segmented, we can extract not only the phrase \"saQporo station,\" but the tree fragment \"(/> go to saQporo,\" and we can determine its semantic label.",
        "Japanese semantic classification poses an interesting challenge: proper nouns need to be distinguished from common nouns.",
        "Like Chinese and Thai, Japanese has no orthographic distinction between common and proper nouns as there is no such thing as capitalization.",
        "In addition, there seems no morphosyntactic (i.e. grammatical) distinction between them.",
        "In this paper, we explore lexico-syntactic clues that can be extracted from automatically parsed text.",
        "We train a classification model on manually registered nouns and apply it to automatically acquired nouns.",
        "We then investigate the effects of lexico-syntactic clues."

        "Our goal is to identify unknown morphemes in unsegmented text and assign POS tags to them.",
        "In this section, we omit the details of boundary identification (segmentation) and review the Japanese POS tagset to see why we propose a two-stage approach to assign full POS tags.",
        "The Japanese POS tagset derives from traditional grammar.",
        "It is a mixture of several linguistic levels: morphology, syntax and semantics.",
        "In other words, information encoded in a POS tag is more than how the morpheme behaves in a sequence of morphemes.",
        "In fact, POS tags given to predefined morphemes are useful for applications of morphological analysis, such as dependency parsing (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), named entity recognition (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003; Sasano and Kurohashi, 2008) and anaphora resolution (Iida et al., 2009; Sasano and Kurohashi, 2009).",
        "In these applications, POS tags are incorporated as features for models.",
        "On the other hand, the mixed nature of the POS tagset poses a challenge to unknown morpheme acquisition.",
        "Previous approaches (Mori and Na-gao, 1996; Murawaki and Kurohashi, 2008) directly or indirectly reply on morphology, or our knowledge on how a morpheme behaves in a sequence of morphemes.",
        "This means that semantic level distinction is difficult to make in these approaches, and in fact, is left unresolved.",
        "To be specific, nouns are only distinguished from verbs and adjectives but they have subcategories in the original tagset.",
        "These are what we try to classify acquired nouns into in this paper.",
        "The Japanese noun subcategories may require an explanation since they are different from the English ones (Marcus et al., 1993) in many respects.",
        "Singular and mass nouns are not distinguished from plural nouns because Japanese has no grammatical distinction between them.",
        "More importantly for this paper, proper nouns have subcategories such as person name, location name and organization name in addition to the distinction from common nouns.",
        "These subcategories provide important information to named entity recognition among other applications.",
        "For proper nouns, we adopt these subcategories as semantic labels in our task.",
        "In contrast to proper nouns, common nouns have only one subcategory \"common.\"",
        "However, we consider that subcategories of common nouns similar to those of proper nouns are useful for, for example, anaphora resolution (Sasano and Kurohashi, 2009).",
        "We adopt the \"categories\" of morphological analyzer JUMAN, with which common nouns in its dictionary are annotated.",
        "There are 22 \"categories\" including PERSON, ORGANIZATION and CONCEPT.",
        "We collapse these \"categories\" into coarser semantic labels that roughly correspond to those for proper nouns.",
        "To sum up, we define 9 semantic labels as shown in Table 1.",
        "A line of research is dedicated to identify unknown morphemes with varying degrees of identification.",
        "Asahara and Matsumoto (2004) only focus on boundary identification (segmentation) of unknown morphemes.",
        "Mori and Nagao (1996), Nagata (1999) and Murawaki and Kurohashi (2008) assign POS tags at the morphology level.",
        "Uchimoto et al.",
        "(2001) assign full POS tags but unsurprisingly the accuracy is low.",
        "Nakagawa and Matsumoto (2006) also assign full POS tags.",
        "They address the fact that local information used in previous studies is inherently insufficient and present a method that uses global information, in other words, takes into consideration all occurrences of each unknown word in a document.",
        "They report an improvement in tagging proper nouns in Japanese.",
        "A related task is named entity recognition (NER).",
        "It can handle a named entity longer than a single morpheme and is usually formalized as a chunking problem.",
        "Since Japanese does not delimit words by white-space, the unit of chunking can be a character (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003; Kazama and Torisawa, 2008) or a morpheme (Sasano and Kurohashi, 2008).",
        "In either case, NER models encode the output of morphological analysis and therefore are affected by its errors.",
        "In fact, Saito et al.",
        "(2007) report that a majority of unknown named entities (those never appear in a training corpus) contain unknown morphemes as their constituents and that NER models perform poorly on them.",
        "A straightforward solution to this problem would be to acquire unknown morphemes and to assign semantic labels to them.",
        "Another related task is supersense tagging (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).",
        "A supersense corresponds to one of the 26 broad categories defined by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Each noun synset is associated with a supersense.",
        "For example, \"chair\" has supersenses PERSON, ARTIFACT and ACT because it belongs to several synsets.",
        "Since supersense tagging is studied in English, it differs from our task in several respects.",
        "In English, the distinction between common and proper nouns is clear.",
        "In fact, the tagging models can use POS features even for unknown nouns.",
        "In addition, the syntactic behavior of English nouns is different from that of Japanese nouns (Gil, 1987).",
        "Definiteness is not marked in Japanese as it lacks determiners (e.g. \"the\" and \"a\"), and Japanese has no obligatory plural marking.",
        "On the other hand, Japanese obligatorily uses numeral classifiers to indicate the count of nouns, as in",
        "(1) saN satsuno hoN three CL GEN book three volumes of books, or three books, where \"satsu\" is a numeral classifier for books.",
        "A number together with its numeral classifier forms a numeral quantifier.",
        "Numeral quantifiers would be informative about the semantic categories of nouns.",

        "Using automatically parsed text to extract syntactic features has an advantage.",
        "Since no manual annotation is necessary, we can utilize a huge raw corpus.",
        "On the other hand, parsing errors are inevitable.",
        "However, we can circumvent this problem by using the constraints of Japanese dependency structures: head-final and projective.",
        "The simplest example is the second last element of a sentence, which always depends on the last element.",
        "With these constraints, we can focus on syntactically unambiguous dependency pairs and extract syntactic features accurately.",

        "Modeling a mixture of semantic labels might be a solution, but we do not take this approach on the grounds that each occurrence of a noun corresponds to a single semantic label.",
        "In our strategy, we perform classification multiple times for each noun and aggregate the results at the end.",
        "The features for each classification are extracted from a relatively small subset of a corpus where the noun is supposedly consistent in terms of semantic labels.",

        "For the specific procedures we took in the experiments, see Section 4.1.",
        "Following unknown morpheme acquisition (Mu-rawaki and Kurohashi, 2008), we create training data using manually registered nouns, for which we can obtain correct semantic labels.",
