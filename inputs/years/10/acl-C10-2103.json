        "To reduce the efforts taken to correct grammatical errors in English writing, there has been a great deal of work on grammatical error detection (Brockett et al., 2006; Chodorow and Lea-cock, 2000; Chodorow and Leacock, 2002; Han et al., 2004; Han et al., 2006; Izumi et al., 2003; Nagata et al., 2004; Nagata et al., 2005; Nagata et al., 2006).",
        "One of its promising applications is writing learning assistance by detecting errors and showing the results to the learner as feedback that he or she can use to rewrite his or her essay.",
        "Grammatical error detection has greatly improved in detection performance as well as in the types of the errors it is able to detect, including errors in articles, number, prepositions, and agreement.",
        "In view of writing learning assistance, however, one important factor has been missing in the previous work.",
        "In the application to writing learning assistance, error detection methods should be evaluated by learning effect obtained by error detection.",
        "Nevertheless, they have been evaluated only by detection performance such as -measure.",
        "This brings up a further research question – are any of the previous methods effective as writing learning assistance?",
        "It is very important to answer this question because it is almost impossible to develop a perfect method.",
        "In other words, one has to use an imperfect method to assist learners no matter how much improvement is achieved.",
        "In practice, it is crucial to reveal the lower bound of detection performance that has a learning effect.",
        "Related to this, one should discuss the following question.",
        "Most error detection methods are adjustable to be recall-oriented/precision-oriented by tuning their parameters.",
        "Despite this fact, no one has examined which is better in terms of learning effect – recall-oriented or precision-oriented?",
        "(hereafter, this problem will be referred to as the recall-precision problem).",
        "Chodorow and Leacock (2000) and Chodorow et al.",
        "(2007) argue that precision-oriented is better, but they do not give any concrete reason.",
        "This means that the recall-precision problem has not yet been solved.",
        "Accordingly, this paper explores the relation between detection performance and learning effect.",
        "To do this, this paper sets out two hypotheses:",
        "Hypothesis I : imperfect, rather than perfect, error detection maximizes learning effect",
        "Hypothesis II : precision-oriented is better than recall-oriented in terms of learning effect",
        "Hypothesis I contradicts the intuition that the better the detection performance is, the higher the learning effect is.",
        "To see the motivation for this, suppose that we had a perfect method.",
        "It would detect all errors in a given essay with no false-positives.",
        "In that case, the learner would not have to find any errors by himself or herself.",
        "Neither would he or she have to examine the causes of the errors.",
        "In the worst case, they just copy the detection results.",
        "By contrast, with an imperfect method, he or she has to do these activities, which is expected to result in better learning effect.",
        "Besides, researchers, including Robb et al.",
        "(1986), Bitchener et al.",
        "(2005), and Ferris and Roberts (2001), report that the amount of feedback that learners receive does not necessarily correspond to the amount of learning effect.",
        "For instance, Robb et al.",
        "(1986) compared four types of feedback ((1) error detection and correction, (2) error detection and error type, (3) error detection, and (4) number of errors per line) and reported that (1), the most-detailed feedback, did not necessarily have the highest learning effect.",
        "Hypothesis II concerns the recall-precision problem.",
        "If a limited number of errors are detected with high precision (i.e., precision-oriented), learners have to carefully read their own essay to find the rest of the errors by examining whether their writing is correct or not, using several sources of information including (i) the information that can be obtained from the detected errors, which is useful for finding undetected errors similar to the detected ones; (ii) their knowledge on English grammar and writing, and (iii) dictionaries and textbooks.",
        "We believe that learning activities, especially learning from similar instances, have a favorable learning effect.",
        "By contrast, in a recall-oriented setting, these activities relatively decrease.",
        "Instead, learners focus on judging whether given detection results are correct or not.",
        "Besides, learning from similar instances is likely not to work well because a recall-oriented setting frequently makes false-positives.",

        "However, it would not be reasonable or feasible to do this from the beginning.",
        "Considering this, this paper targets errors in articles and number.",
        "The reasons for selecting these are that (a) articles and number are difficult for learners of English (Izumi et al., 2003; Nagata et al., 2005), and (b) there has been a great deal of work on the detection of these errors.",

        "It has been shown to be effective in the detection of errors in articles and number (Nagata et al., 2005; Nagata et al., 2006).",
        "It also has the favorable property that it can be adjusted to be recall-oriented or precision-oriented by setting a threshold for the probability used in countability prediction.",

        "(2006)'s method (See Nagata et al.",
        "(2006) for the details).",
        "The method, first, automatically generates training instances for countability prediction.",
        "Instances of each noun that head their noun phrase (NP) are collected from a corpus with their surrounding words.",
        "Then, the collected instances are tagged with their countability by a set of hand-coded rules.",
        "The resulting tagged instances are used as training data for countability prediction.",
        "Decision lists (Yarowsky, 1995) are used to predict countability.",
        "Tree types of contextual cue are used as features: (i) words in the NP that the target noun heads; (ii) three words to the left of the NP; (iii) three words to its right.",
        "The log-likelihood ratio (Yarowsky, 1995) decides in which order rules in a decision list are applied to the target noun in countability prediction.",
        "It is the log ratio of the probabilities of the target noun being count and non-count when one of the features appears in its context.",
        "To predict countability in error detection, each rule in the decision list is tested on the target noun in the sorted order until the first applicable one is found.",
        "The prediction is made by the first applicable one.",
        "After countability prediction, errors in articles and number are detected by using a set of rules.",
        "For example, if the noun in question is plural and predicted to be non-count, then it is an error.",
        "Similarly, the noun in question has no article and is singular and is predicted to be count, then it is an error.",
        "The balance of recall and precision in error detection can be adjusted by setting a certain threshold to the probabilities used to calculate the log-likelihood ratio.",
        "If the probability of the applied rule in countability prediction is lower than a certain threshed, error detection is blocked.",
        "Namely, the higher the threshed is, the more precision-oriented the detection is.",
        "The proposed method is based on a learning activity consisting of essay writing, error detection, and rewriting.",
        "Table 1 shows the flow of the learning activity.",
        "In Step 1, an essay topic is assigned to learners.",
        "In Step 2, they have time to think about what to write with a piece of white paper for preparation (e.g., to summarize his or her ideas).",
        "In Step 3, they write an essay on a blog system in which the error detection method (Nagata et al., 2005) is implemented.",
        "This system allows them to write, submit, and rewrite their essays (though it does not allow them to access the others' essays or their own previous essays).",
        "They are not allowed to use any dictionary or textbook in this step.",
        "They are required to write ten sentences or more.",
        "In Step 4, the system detects errors in each essay.",
        "It displays each essay of which errors are indicated in red to the corresponding learner.",
        "Although the detection itself takes only a few seconds, five minutes are assigned to this step for two purposes: to take a short break for learners and to remove time differences between learners.",
        "Finally, in Step 5, learners rewrite their essay using the given feedback.",
        "Here, they are allowed to use",
        "'Setting a threshold to the probability is equivalent to setting a threshold to the log-likelihood and both has the same effect on the balance of recall and precision.",
        "However, we use the former because it is intuitive and easy to set a threshold",
        "a dictionary (Konishi and Minamide, 2007) and an A4 paper that briefly explains article and number usage, which was made based on grammar books (Hirota, 1992; Iizuka and Hagino, 1997).",
        "They are informed that the feedback may contain false-positives and false-negatives.",
        "Before discussing how to measure learning effect, one has to define the ability to write English.",
        "Considering that this paper aims at the evaluation of error detection, it is reasonable to deine the ability as the degree of error occurrence (that is, the fewer errors, the better).",
        "To measure this, this paper uses error rate, which is deined by",
        "Ones are added to the numerator and denominator for a mathematical reason that will be clear shortly.",
        "The addition also has the advantage that it can evaluate a longer essay to be better when no errors occur.",

        "Simply, it is estimated by applying the linear regression to the numberofinstances oflearning and the corresponding error rates.",
        "Having said this, this paper applies an exponential regression instead of the linear regression.",
        "There are two reasons for this.",
        "The irst is that it becomes more dificult to decrease the error rate as it decreases (in other words, it becomes more dificulty to improve one's ability as one improves).",
        "The other is that the error rate is expected to asymptotically decrease to zero as learning proceeds.",
