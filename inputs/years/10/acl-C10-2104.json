        "The former features are generated by a polynomial kernel encoding entity features whereas tree kernels are used to model dependencies amongst tagged candidate examples.",
        "The experiments on two standard corpora in two languages, i.e. the Italian EVALITA 2009 and the English CoNLL 2003 datasets, show a large improvement on CRFs in F-measure, i.e. from 80.34% to 84.33% and from 84.86% to 88.16%, respectively.",
        "Our analysis reveals that both kernels provide a comparable improvement over the CRFs baseline.",

      "text": [
        "Reranking is a promising computational framework, which has drawn special attention in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community.",
        "Basically, this method first employs a probabilistic model to generate a list of top-n candidates and then reranks this n-best list with additional features.",
        "One appeal of this approach is its flexibility of incorporating arbitrary features into a model.",
        "These features help in discriminating good from bad hypotheses and consequently their automatic learning.",
        "Various algorithms have been applied for reranking in NLP applications (Huang, 2008;",
        "Koo, 2000), including parsing, name tagging and machine translation.",
        "This work has exploited the disciminative property as one of the key criterion of the reranking algorithm.",
        "Reranking appears extremely interesting if coupled with kernel methods (Dinarelli et al., 2009; Moschitti, 2004; Collins and Duffy, 2001), as the latter allow for extracting from the ranking hypotheses a huge amount of features along with their dependencies.",
        "Indeed, while feature-based learning algorithms involve only the dot-product between feature vectors, kernel methods allow for a higher generalization by replacing the dot-product with a function between pairs of linguistic objects.",
        "Such functions are a kind of similarity measure satisfying certain properties.",
        "An example is the tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), where the objects are syntactic trees that encode grammatical derivations and the kernel function computes the number of common subtrees.",
        "Similarly, sequence kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002) count the number of common subsequences shared by two input strings.",
        "Named-entities (NEs) are essential for defining the semantics of a document.",
        "NEs are objects that can be referred by names (Chinchor and Robinson, 1998), such as people, organizations, and locations.",
        "The research on NER has been promoted by the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs, 1987-1998), the shared task of the Conference on Natural Language Learning",
        "Extraction program (ACE, 2002-2005).",
        "In the literature, there exist various learning approaches to extract named-entities from text.",
        "A NER system often builds some generative/discriminative model, then, either uses only one classifier (Carreras et al., 2002) or combines many classifiers using some heuristics (Florian et al., 2003).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, reranking has not been applied to NER except for the rerank-ing algorithms defined in (Collins, 2002b; Collins, 2002a), which only targeted the entity detection (and not entity classification) task.",
        "Besides, since kernel methods offer a natural way to exploit linguistic properties, applying kernels for NE rerank-ing is worthwhile.",
        "In this paper, we describe how kernel methods can be applied for reranking, i.e. detection and classification of named-entities, in standard corpora for Italian and English.",
        "The key aspect of our reranking approach is how structured and flat features can be employed in discriminating candidate tagged sequences.",
        "For this purpose, we apply tree kernels to a tree structure encoding NE tags of a sentence and combined them with a polynomial kernel, which efficiently exploits global features.",
        "Our main contribution is to show that (a) tree kernels can be used to define general features (not merely syntactic) and (b) using appropriate algorithms and features, reranking can be very effective for named-entity recognition.",
        "Our study demonstrates that the composite kernel is very effective for reranking named-entity sequences.",
        "Without the need of producing and heuristically combining learning models like previous work on NER, the composite kernel not only captures most of the flat features but also efficiently exploits structured features.",
        "More interestingly, this kernel yields significant improvement when applied to two corpora of two different languages.",
        "The evaluation in the Italian corpus shows that our method outperforms the best reported methods whereas on the English data it reaches the state-of-the-art."

        "See figure 2 for an example of the semantic tree for the first tagged sequence.",

        "Second, we associate each word of the corpus with the most frequent NE category assigned in the previous step.",
        "Finally, the above tags are used as features during the training of the improved NER and also for building the feature representation for a new classification instance.",

        "CFK based on unstructured features achieves higher accuracy than CTK based on structured features.",
        "However, the huge amount of subtrees generated by the PT kernel may limit the expressivity of some structural features, e.g. many fragments may only generate noise.",
        "This problem is less important with the polynomial kernel where global features are tailored for individual entities.",
        "In any case, the experiments demonstrate that both tagging kernels CTK and CFK give improvement over the CRFs baseline in both languages.",
        "This suggests that structured and unstructured features are effective in discriminating between competing NE annotations.",
        "Furthermore, the combination of the two tagging kernels on both standard corpora shows a large improvement in F-measure from 80.34% to 84.33% for Italian and from 84.86% to 88.16% for English data.",
        "This suggests that these two kernels, corresponding to two kinds of feature, complement each other.",
        "To better collocate our results with previous work, we report the best NER outcome on the Italian (Zanoli et al., 2009) and the English (Rati-nov and Roth, ) datasets, in the last row (in italic) of each table.",
        "This shows that our model outperforms the best Italian NER system and it is close to the state-of-art model for English, which exploits many complex features.",
        "Also note that we are very close to the F1 achieved by the best system of CoNLL 2003, i.e. 88.8."

        "We analyzed the impact of kernel-based approaches for modeling dependencies between tagged sequences for NER.",
        "Our study illustrates that each individual kernel, either with structured or with flat features clearly gives improvement to the base model.",
        "Most interestingly, as we showed, these contributions are independent and, the approaches can be used together to yield better results.",
        "The composite kernel, which combines both kinds of features, can outperform the state-of-the-art.",
        "In the future, it will be very interesting to use syntactic/semantic kernels, as for example in (Basili et al., 2005; Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b).",
        "Another promising direction is the use of syntactic trees, feature sequences and pairs of instances, e.g. (Nguyen et al., 2009; Moschitti, 2008)."
