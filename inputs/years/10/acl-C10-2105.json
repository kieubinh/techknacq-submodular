        "(2002).",
        "To make summaries coherent, the extracted sentences must be appropriately ordered.",
        "However, most summarization systems delink sentence extraction from sentence ordering, so a sentence can be extracted that can never be ordered naturally with the other extracted sentences.",

        "Although a lot of summarization algorithms have been proposed, most of them solely extract sentences from a set of sentences in the source document set.",
        "These methods perform extractive summarization and can be formalized as follows:",
        "T stands for all sentences in the source document set and S is an arbitrary subset of T. L(S) is a function indicating the score of S as determined by one or more criteria.",
        "length(S) indicates the length of S, K is the maximum size of the summary.",
        "That is, most summarization algorithms search for, or decode, the set of sentences S that maximizes function L under the given maximum size of the summary K. Thus most studies focus on the design of function L and efficient search algorithms (i.e. argmax operation in Eq.1).",
        "Objective Function",
        "Many useful L functions have been proposed including the cosine similarity of given sentences (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) and centroid (Radev et al., 2004); some approaches directly learn function L from references (Kupiec et al., 1995;Hirao et al., 2002).",
        "There are two approaches to defining the score of the summary.",
        "One defines the weight on each sentence forming the summary.",
        "The other defines a weight for a sub-sentence, concept, that the summary contains.",
        "McDonald (2007) and Martins and Smith (2009) directly weight sentences and use MMR to avoid redundancy (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998).",
        "In contrast to their approaches, we set weights on concepts, not sentences.",
        "Gillick and Favre (2009) reported that the concept-based model achieves better performance and scalability than the sentence-based model when it is formulated as ILP.",
        "There is a wide range of choice with regard to the unit of the concept.",
        "Concepts include words and the relationship between named entities (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004), bi-grams (Gillick and Favre, 2009), and word stems (Takamura and Okumura, 2009).",
        "Some summarization systems that target reviews, opinion summarizers, extract particular information, opinion, from the input sentences and leverage them to select important sentences (Carenini et al., 2006; Lerman et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, since we aim to summarize reviews, the objective function is defined through opinion as the concept that the reviews contain.",
        "We explain our detailed objective function in Section 3.",
        "We describe features ofabove existing summarizers in Section 4 and compare our method to them as baselines.",
        "Decoding Method",
        "The algorithms proposed for argmax operation include the greedy method (Filatova and Hatzivas-siloglou, 2004), stack decoding (Yih et al., 2007; Takamura and Okumura, 2009) and Integer Linear Programming (Clarke and Lapata, 2007; McDonald, 2007; Gillick and Favre, 2009; Martins and Smith, 2009).",
        "Gillick and Favre (2009) and Takamura and Okumura (2009) formulate summarization as a Maximum Coverage Problem.",
        "We also use this formulation.",
        "While these methods focus on extracting a set of sentences from the source document set, our method performs extraction and ordering simultaneously.",
        "Some studies attempt to generate a single sentence (i.e. headline) from the source document (Banko et al., 2000; Deshpande et al., 2007).",
        "While they extract and order words from the source document as a unit, our model uses the unit of sentences.",
        "This problem can be formulated as the Traveling Salesman Problem and its variants.",
        "Banko et al.",
        "(2000) uses beam search to identify approximate solutions.",
        "Deshpande et al.",
        "(2007) uses ILP and a randomized algorithm to find the optimal solution.",
        "It is known that the readability of a collection of sentences, a summary, can be greatly improved by appropriately ordering them (Barzilay et al., 2002).",
        "Features proposed to create the appropriate order include publication date of document (Barzilay et al., 2002), content words (Lapata, 2003; Althaus et al., 2004), and syntactic role of words (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005).",
        "Some approaches use machine learning to integrate these features (Soricut and Marcu, 2006; Elsner et al., 2007).",
        "Generally speaking, these methods score the discourse coherence of a fixed set of sentences.",
        "These methods are separated from the extraction step so they may fail if the set includes sentences that are impossible to order naturally.",
        "As mentioned above, there is a preceding work that attempted to perform sentence extraction and ordering simultaneously (Nishikawa et al., 2010).",
        "Differences between this paper and that work are as follows:",
        "• This work adopts ILP solver as a decoder.",
        "ILP solver allows the summarizer to search for the optimal solution much more rapidly than beam search (Deshpande et al., 2007), which was adopted by the prior work.",
        "To permit ILP solver incorporation, we propose in this paper a totally new ILP formulation.",
        "The formulation can be widely used for text summarization and generation.",
        "• Moreover, to learn better discourse coherence, we adopt the Passive-Aggressive algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006) and use Kendall's tau (Lapata, 2006) as the loss function.",
        "In contrast, the above work adopts Averaged Perceptron (Collins, 2002) and has no explicit loss function.",
        "These advances make this work very different from that work.",
        "We consider a summary as a sequence of sentences.",
        "As an example, document set D = {d^d2,d3} is given to a summarizer.",
        "We define d as a single document.",
        "Document di, which consists of four sentences, is describe by di = si2, si3, si4}.",
        "Documents d2 {s31, s32, s33}).",
        "If the summary consists of four sentences sn, s23, s32, s33 and they are ordered as sii – s23 – s32 – s33, we add symbols indicating the beginning of the summary so and the end of the summary s4, and describe the summary as S = (so, sii,S23,S32,S33,S4).",
        "Summary S can be represented as a directed path that starts at so and ends at s4 as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "We describe a directed arc between si and Sj as di,j G A.",
        "The directed path shown in Fig. 1 is decomposed into nodes, s0, sii, s23, s32,s33,s4, and arcs, G^lb all)23, a23,32, a32,33, a33,4.",
        "To represent the discourse coherence oftwo adjacent sentences, we define weight ci;j G C as the coherence score on the directed arc ai;j.",
        "We assume that better summaries have higher coherence scores, i.e. if the sum of the scores of the arcs J2ai j £S ci,j ai,j is high, the summary is coherent.",
        "We also assume that the source document set D includes set of concepts e G E. Each concept e is covered by one or more of the sentences in the document set.",
        "We show this schema in Table 2.",
        "According to Table 2, document set D has eight concepts ei, e2,..., e7, e8 and sentence siiincludes concepts ei and e6 while sentence si2 includes e2.",
        "We consider each concept ei has a weight Wj.",
        "We assume that concept ei will have high weight wi if it is important.",
        "This paper improves summary quality by maximizing the sum of these weights.",
        "We define, based on the above assumption, the following objective function:",
        "L(S) = Eei€S wiei + EaijGS ci,jai,j (2)",

        "Therefore, a highly efficient decoding method is essential.",
        "Our method requires two parameters: weights w G W of concepts and coherence c G C of two adjacent sentences.",
        "We describe them here.",
        "Content Score",
        "In this paper, as mentioned above, since we attempt to summarize reviews, we adopt opinion as a concept.",
        "We define opinion e = (t,a,p) as the tuple of target t, aspect a and its polarity p G { – 1, 0,1}.",
        "We define target t as the target of an opinion.",
        "For example, the target t of the sentence \"This digital camera has good image quality.\"",
        "is digital camera.",
        "We define aspect a as a word that represents a standpoint appropriate for evaluating products and services.",
        "With regard to digital cameras, aspects include image quality, design and battery life.",
        "In the above example sentence, the aspect is image quality.",
        "Polarity p represents whether the opinion is positive or negative.",
        "In this paper, we define p = – 1 as negative, p = 0 as neutral and p = 1 as positive.",
        "Thus the example sentence contains opinion e = (digital camera, image quality, 1).",
        "Opinions are extracted using a sentiment expression dictionary and pattern matching from dependency trees of sentences.",
        "This opinion extractor is the same as that used in Nishikawa et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "As the weight wi of concept ei, we use only the frequency of each opinion in the input document set, i.e. we assume that an opinion that appears frequently in the input is important.",
        "While this weighting is relatively naive compared to Ler-man et al.",
        "(2009)'s method, our ROUGE evaluation shows that this approach is effective.",
        "Coherence Score",
        "In this section, we define coherence score c. Since it is not easy to model the global coherence of a set of sentences, we approximate the global coherence by the sum of local coherence i.e. the sum of coherence scores of sentence pairs.",
        "We define local coherence score ci;j of two sentences x = {si,Sj} and their order y = (si,Sj) representing si – sj as follows:",
        "w-(/>(x, y) is the inner product of w and 0(x, y), w is a parameter vector and 0(x, y) is a feature vector of the two sentences si and sj.",
        "Since coherence consists of many different elements and it is difficult to model all of them, we approximate the features of coherence as the Cartesian product of the following features: content words, POS tags of content words, named entity tags (e.g. LOC, ORG) and conjunctions.",
        "Lapata (2003) proposed most of these features.",
        "Therefore, the score of order y is w • $(x, y).",
        "Given a training set, if trained parameter vector w assigns score w • $(x, yt) to correct order yt that is higher than score w • $(x, y) assigned to incorrect order y, it is expected that the trained parameter vector will give a higher score to coherently ordered sentences than to incoherently ordered sentences.",
        "We use the Passive-Aggressive algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006) to find w. The Passive-Aggressive algorithm is an online learning algorithm that updates the parameter vector by taking up one example from the training examples and outputting the solution that has the highest score under the current parameter vector.",
        "If the output differs from the training example, the parameter vector is updated as follows;",
        "wi is the current parameter vector and wi+i is the updated parameter vector.",
        "That is, Eq.5 means that the score of the correct order must exceed the score of an incorrect order by more than loss function ^(y; yt) while minimizing the change in parameters.",
        "When updating the parameter vector, this algorithm requires the solution that has the highest score under the current parameter vector, so we have to run an argmax operation.",
        "Since we are attempting to order a set of sentences, the operation is regarded as solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (Althaus et al., 2004); that is, we locate the path that offers the maximum score through all n sentences where s0 and sra+i are starting and ending points, respectively.",
        "This operation is NP-hard and it is difficult to find the global optimal solution.",
        "To overcome this, we find an approximate solution by beam search.",
        "We define loss function ^(y ; yt) as follows:",
        "t indicates Kendall's tau.",
        "S(y, yt) is the minimum number of operations that swap adjacent elements (i.e. sentences) needed to bring y to yt (La-pata, 2006).",
        "N indicates the number of elements.",
        "Since Lapata (2006) reported that Kendall's tau reliably reproduces human ratings with regard to sentence ordering, using it to minimize the loss function is expected to yield more reliable parameters.",
        "We omit detailed derivations due to space limitations.",
        "Parameters are updated as per the following equation.",
        "C in Eq.9 is the aggressiveness parameter that controls the degree of parameter change.",
        "Note that our method learns w from documents automatically annotated by a POS tagger and a named entity tagger.",
        "That is, manual annotation isn't required.",
        "This section describes an ILP formulation of the above model.",
        "We use the same notation convention as introduced in Section 3.1.",
        "We use s G S, a G A, e G E as the decision variable.",
        "Variable si G S indicates the inclusion of the i th sentence.",
        "If the i th sentence is part of the summary, then si is 1.",
        "If it is not part of the summary, then si is 0.",
        "Variable ai;j G A indicates the adjacency of the i th and j th sentences.",
        "If these two sentences are ordered as si – sj, then ai;j is 1.",
