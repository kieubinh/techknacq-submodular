        "Position information has been frequently used in document summarization.",
        "It springs from human's tendency of writing sentences of greater topic centrality at particular positions in a document.",
        "For example, in newswire documents, topic sentences are usually written earlier.",
        "A sentence position hypothesis is then given as: the first sentence in a document is the most important and the importance decreases as the sentence gets further away from the beginning.",
        "Based on this sentence position hypothesis, sentence position features are defined by the ordinal position of sentences.",
        "These position features have been proved to be very effective in generic document summarization.",
        "In more recent summarization tasks, such as query-focused and update summarization tasks, position features are also widely used.",
        "Although in these tasks position features may be used in different ways, they are all based on the sentence position hypothesis.",
        "So we regard them as providing the sentence position information.",
        "In this paper, we study a new kind of position information, i.e., the word position information.",
        "The motivation of word position information comes from the idea of assigning different importance to multiple appearances of one word in a document.",
        "As to many language models such as the bag-of-words model, it is well acknowledged that a word which appears more frequently is usually more important.",
        "If we take a closer look at all the appearances of one word, we can view this as a process that the different appearances of the same word raise the importance of each other.",
        "Now let's also take the order of the appearances into account.",
        "When reading a document, we can view it as a word token stream from the first token to the last.",
        "When a new token is read, we attach more importance to previous tokens that have the same lemma because they are just repeated by the new token.",
        "Inspired by this, we postulate a word position hypothesis here: for all the appearances of a fixed word, the importance of each appearance depends on all its following appearances.",
        "Therefore, the first appearance of a word is the most important and the importance decreases with the ordinal positions of the appearances.",
        "Then, a novel kind of position features can be defined for the word appearances based on their ordinal positions.",
        "We believe that these word position features have some advantages when compared to traditional sentence position features.",
        "According to the sentence position hypothesis, sentence position features generally prefer earlier sentences in a document.",
        "As to the word position features that attempt to differentiate word appearances instead of sentences, a sentence which is not the first one in the document may still not be penalized as long as its words do not appear in previous sentences.",
        "Therefore, word position features are able to discover topic sentences in deep positions of the document.",
        "On the other hand, the assertion that the first sentence is always the most important is not true in actual data.",
        "It depends on the writing style indeed.",
        "For example, some authors may like to write some background sentences before topic sentences.",
        "In conclusion, we can expect word position features to be more adaptive to documents with different structures.",
        "In the study of this paper, we define several word position features based on the ordinal positions of word appearances.",
        "We also develop a word-based summarization system to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed word position features on a series of summarization data sets.",
        "The main contributions of our work are:",
        "(1) representation of word position information, which is a new kind of position information in document summarization area.",
        "(2) empirical results on various data sets that demonstrate the impact of position information in different summarization tasks."

        "The use of position information in document summarization has a long history.",
        "In the seminal work by (Luhn, 1958), position information was already considered as a good indicator of significant sentences.",
        "In (Edmundson, 1969), a location method was proposed that assigns positive weights to the sentences to their ordinal positions in the document.",
        "Position information has since been adopted by many successful summarization systems, usually in the form of sentence position features.",
        "For example, Radev et al.",
        "(2004) developed a feature-based system",
        "MEAD based on word frequencies and sentence positions.",
        "The position feature was defined as a descending function of the sentence position.",
        "The MEAD system performed very well in the generic multi-document summarization task of the DUC 2004 competition.",
        "Later, position information is also applied to more summarization tasks.",
        "For example, in query-focused task, sentence position features are widely used in learning-based summarization systems as a component feature for calculating the composite sentence score (Ouyang et al., 2007; Toutanova et al., 2007).",
        "However, the effect of position features alone was not studied in these works.",
        "There were also studies aimed at analyzing and explaining the effectiveness of position information.",
        "Lin and Hovy (1997) provided an empirical validation on the sentence position hypothesis.",
        "For each position, the sentence position yield was defined as the average value of the significance of the sentences with the fixed position.",
        "It was observed that the average significance at earlier positions was indeed larger.",
        "Nenkova (2005) did a conclusive overview on the DUC 2001-2004 evaluation results.",
        "It was reported that position information is very effective in generic summarization.",
        "In generic single-document summarization, a lead-based baseline that simply takes the leading sentences as the summary can outperform most submitted summarization system in DUC 2001 and 2002.",
        "As in multi-document summarization, the position-based baseline system is competitive in generating short summaries but not in longer summaries.",
        "Schilder and Kondadadi (2008) analyzed the effectiveness of the features that are used in their learning-based sentence scoring model for query-focused summarization.",
        "By comparing the ROUGE-2 results of each individual feature, it was reported that position-based features are less effective than frequency-based features.",
        "In (Gillick et al., 2009), the effect of position information in the update summarization task was studied.",
        "By using ROUGE to measure the density of valuable words at each sentence position, it was observed that the first sentence of newswire document was especially important for composing update summaries.",
        "They defined a binary sentence position feature based on the observation and the feature did improve the performance on the update summarization data."

      "heading": "3. Methodology",
      "text": [
        "In the section, we first describe the word-based summarization model.",
        "The word position features are then defined and incorporated into the summarization model.",
        "To test the effectiveness of position information in document summarization, we first propose a word-based summarization model for applying the position information.",
        "The system follows a typical extractive style that constructs the target summary by selecting the most salient sentences.",
        "Under the bag-of-words model, the probability of a word w in a document set D can be scaled by its frequency, i.e., p(w)=freq(w)/\\D\\, where freq(w) indicates the frequency of w in D and \\ D\\ indicates the total number of words in D. The probability of a sentence s={w1, wN} is then calculated as the product of the word probabilities, i.e., p(s)=nip(wi).",
        "Moreover, the probability of a summary consisting a set of sentences, denoted as S={su sM}, can be calculated by the product of the sentence probabilities, i.e., p(S)=Hj p(s;).",
        "To obtain the optimum summary, an intuitive idea is to select the sentences to maximize the overall summary probability p(S), equivalent to maximizing log(p(S)) = ZjZi log(p(wji)) = EE (Xogfreq(wji)-log D ) = T,}Z,i log freq(wji) - S log |D|, where wn indicates the ith word in s}- and SI indicates the total number of words in S. As to practical summarization tasks, a maximum summary length is usually postulated.",
        "So here we just assume that the length of the summary is fixed.",
        "Then, the above optimization target is equivalent to maximizing EJEi logfreq(wp).",
        "From the view of information theory, the sum can also be interpreted as a simple measure on the total information amount of the summary.",
        "In this interpretation, the information of a single word Wji is measured by log freq(wJi) and the summary information is the sum of the word information.",
        "So the optimization target can also be interpreted as including the most informative words to form the most informative summary given the length limit.",
        "In extractive summarization, summaries are composed by sentence selection.",
        "As to the above optimization target, the sentence scoring function for ranking the sentences should be calculated as the average word information, i.e., score(s) = Ei log freq(wi) / |s|.",
        "After ranking the sentences by their ranking scores, we can select the sentences into the summary by the descending order of their score until the length limit is reached.",
        "By this process, the summary with the largest p(S) can be composed.",
        "With the above model, word position features are defined to represent the word position information and are then incorporated into the model.",
        "According to the motivation, the features are defined by the ordinal positions of word appearances, based on the position hypothesis that earlier appearances of a word are more informative.",
        "Formally, for the ith appearance among the total n appearances of a word w, four position features are defined based on i and n using different formulas as described below.",
        "(1) Direct proportion (DP) With the word position hypothesis, an intuitive idea is to regard the information degree of the first appearance as 1 and the last one as 1/n, and then let the degree decrease linearly to the position i.",
        "So we can obtain the first position feature defined by the direct proportion function, i.e., f(i)=(n-i+1)/n.",
        "(2) Inverse proportion (IP).",
        "Besides the linear function, other functions can also be used to characterize the relationship between the position and the importance.",
        "The second position feature adopts another widely-used function, the inversed proportion function, i.e., f(i)=1/i.",
        "This measure is similar to the above one, but the information degree decreases by the inverse proportional function.",
        "Therefore, the degree decreases more quickly at smaller positions, which implies a stronger preference for leading sentences.",
        "(3) Geometric sequence (GS).",
        "For the third feature, we make an assumption that the degree of every appearance is the sum of the degree of all the following appearances, i.e., fi) = fi+1)+ f(i+2)+...+fn).",
        "It can be easily derived that the sequence also satisfies fi) = 2f(i-1).",
        "That is, the information degree of each new appearance is halved.",
        "Then the feature value of the ith appearance can be calculated as f(i) = (1/2)i-1.",
        "(4) Binary function (BF).",
        "The final feature is a binary position feature that regards the first appearance as much more informative than the all the other appearances, i.e., f(i)=1, if i=1; X else, where X is a small positive real number.",
        "To incorporate the position features into the word-based summarization model, we use them to adjust the importance of the word appearance.",
        "For the ith appearance of a word w, its original importance is multiplied by the position feature value, i.e., log freq(w)-pos(w, i), where pos(w, i) is calculated by one of the four position features introduced above.",
        "By this, the position feature is also incorporated into the sentence scores, i.e., score'(s) = Ei [log freq(wi) â€¢ pos(wi)] / ^",
        "In our study, another type of position features, which model sentence position information, is defined for comparison with the word position features.",
        "The sentence position features are also defined by the above four formulas.",
        "However, for each appearance, the definition of i and n in the formulas are changed to the ordinal position of the sentence that contains this appearance and the total number of sentences in the document respectively.",
        "In fact, the effects of the features defined in this way are equivalent to traditional sentence position features.",
        "Since i and n are now defined by sentence positions, the feature values of the word tokens in the same sentence s are all equal.",
        "Denote it by pos(s), and the sentence score with the position feature can be written as which can just be viewed as the product of the original score and a sentence position feature.",
        "By using the four functions to measure word or sentence position information, we can generate a total of eight position features.",
        "Among the four functions, the importance drops fastest under the binary function and the order is BF > GS > IP > DP.",
        "Therefore, the features based on the binary function are the most biased to the leading sentences in the document and the features based on the direct proportion function are the least.",
        "On the other hand, as mentioned in the introduction, sentence-based features have larger preferences for leading sentences than word-based position features.",
        "An example is given below to illustrate the difference between word and sentence position",
        "For the word \"threshold\" which appears twice in the document, its original importance is log(2), for the appearance of \"threshold\" in the 4th sentence, the modified score based on word position feature with the direct proportion function is 1/2-log(2).",
        "In contrast, the score based on sentence position feature with the features.",

        "12 Mr Robertson said: 'No one knows at this time what the exact loss is'._ same function is 9/12-log(2), which is larger.",
        "For the appearance of the word \"estimate\" in the 8th sentence, its original importance is log(3) (the three boldfaced tokens are regarded as one word with stemming).",
        "The word-based and sentence-based scores are log(3) and 5/12-log(3) respectively.",
        "So its importance is larger under word position feature.",
        "Therefore, the system with word position features may prefer the 8thsentence that is in deeper positions but the system with sentence position feature may prefer the 4th sentence.",
        "As for this document, the top 5 sentences selected by sentence position feature are {1, 4, 3, 5, 2} and the those selected by the word position features are {1, 8, 3, 6, 9}.",

        "For the task on set A which is almost the same as the DUC 2005-2007 tasks, the results are also very similar.",
        "A small difference is that the systems with position features perform slightly better than the system None on these two data sets.",
        "Also, the difference between word position features and sentence position features becomes smaller.",
        "One reason may be that the shorter summary length increases the chance of generating good summaries only from the leading sentences.",
        "This is somewhat similar to the results reported in (Nenkova, 2005) that position information is more effective for short summaries.",
        "For the update set B, the results show that position information is indeed very effective.",
        "In the results, all the systems with position features significantly outperform the system None.",
        "We attribute the reason to the fact that we are more concerned with novel information when summarizing update set B.",
        "Therefore, the effect of the query is less on set B, which means that the effect of position information may be more pronounced in contrast.",
        "On the other hand, when comparing the position features, we can see that though the difference of the position features is quite small, word position features are still better in most cases.",
        "Based on the experiments, we briefly conclude the effectiveness of position information in document summarization.",
        "In different tasks, the effectiveness varies indeed.",
        "It depends on whether the given task has a preference for the sentences at particular positions.",
        "Generally, in generic summarization, the position hypothesis works well and thus the ordinal position information is effective.",
        "In this case, those position features that are more distinctive, such as GS and BF, can achieve better performances.",
        "In contrast, in the query-focused task that relates to specified content in the documents, ordinal position information is not so useful.",
        "Therefore, the more distinctive a position feature is, the worse performance it leads to.",
        "However, in the update summarization task that also involves queries, position information becomes effective again since the role of the query is less dominant on the update document set.",
        "On the other hand, by comparing the sentence position features and word position features on all the data sets, we can draw an overall conclusion that word position features are consistently more appreciated.",
        "For both generic tasks in which position information is effective and query-focused tasks in which it is not so effective, word position features show their advantages over sentence position features.",
        "This is because of the looser position hypothesis postulated by them.",
        "By avoiding arbitrarily regarding the leading sentences as more important, they are more adaptive to different tasks and data sets."
