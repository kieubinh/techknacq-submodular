        "The backbone of LSA is the co-occurrence distributional model in which words are conceived as points scattered in a texts-built n-dimensional space(Lenci, 2008).",
        "Rather than trying to predict the best performing model from a set of models, this study highlights the extent to which word space or semantic space measured from a vector-based model can access the verbal semantics and has influence on verbal acquisition.",
