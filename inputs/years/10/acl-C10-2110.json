        "Classes pertaining to unrestricted domains (e.g., west african countries, science fiction films, sir cameras) and their instances (cape verde, avatar, canon eos 7d) play a disproportionately important role in Web search.",
        "They occur prominently in Web documents and among search queries submitted most frequently by Web users (Jansen et al., 2000).",
        "They also serve as building blocks in formal representation of human knowledge, and are useful in a variety of text processing tasks.",
        "Recent work on offline acquisition of finegrained, labeled classes of instances applies manually-created (Banko et al., 2007; Talukdar et al., 2008) or automatically-learned (Snow et al., 2006) extraction patterns to large document collections.",
        "Although various methods exploit additional textual resources to increase accuracy (Van Durme and Paçca, 2008) and coverage (Talukdar et al., 2008), some of the extracted class labels are inevitably less useful (works) or spurious (car makers) for an associated instance (avatar).",
        "In Web search, the relative ranking of documents returned for a query directly affects the outcome of the search.",
        "Similarly, the relative ranking among class labels extracted for a given instance influences any applications using the labels.",
        "Our paper proposes the use of features other than those computed over the underlying document collection, such as the frequency of cooccurrence or diversity of extraction patterns producing a given pair (Etzioni et al., 2005), to determine the relative ranking of various class labels, given a class instance.",
        "Concretely, the method takes advantage of the co-occurrence of a class label and an instance within search queries from anonymized query logs.",
        "It re-ranks lists of class labels produced for an instance by standard extraction patterns, to promote class labels that co-occur with the instance.",
        "This corresponds to a soft ranking approach, focusing on the ranking of candidate extractions such as the less relevant ones are ranked lower, as opposed to removed when deemed unreliable based on various clues.",
        "By using queries in ranking, the ranked lists of class labels available for various instances are instrumental in determining the classes to which given sets of instances belong.",
        "The accuracy of the class labels exceeds that of previous work, over evaluation sets of instances associated with Web search queries.",
        "The results confirm the usefulness of the extracted IsA repository, which remains general-purpose and is not tailored to any particular task."

        "The initial extraction of labeled instances relies on handwritten patterns from (Hearst, 1992), widely used in work on extracting hierarchies from text (Snow et al., 2006; Ponzetto and Strube,",
        "([..] C [such as|including] I [and|,|.",
        "]), where I is a potential instance (e.g., diderot) and C is a potential class label (e.g., writers).",
        "Following (Van Durme and Pa§ca, 2008), the boundaries of potential class labels C are approximated from the part-of-speech tags of the sentence words, whereas the boundaries of instances I are identified by checking that I occurs as an entire query in query logs.",
        "Since users type many queries in lower case, the collected data is converted to lower case.",
        "When applied to inherently-noisy Web documents, the extraction patterns may produce irrelevant extractions (Kozareva et al., 2008).",
        "Causes of errors include incorrect detection of possible enumerations, as in companies such as Procter and Gamble (Downey et al., 2007); incorrect estimation of the boundaries of class labels, due to incorrect attachment as in years from on a limited number ofvehicles over the past few years, including the Chevrolet Corvette; subjective (famous actors) (Hovy et al., 2009), relational (competitors, nearby landmarks) and otherwise less useful (others, topics) class labels; or questionable source sentences, as in Large mammals such as deer and wild turkeys can be [..] (Van Durme and Pa§ca, 2008) .",
        "As a solution, recent work uses additional evidence, as a means to filter the pairs extracted by patterns, thus trading off coverage for higher precision.",
        "The repository extracted from a similarly-sized Web document collection using the same initial extraction patterns as here, after a weighted intersection of pairs extracted with patterns and clusters of distributionally similar phrases, contains a total of 9,080 class labels associated with 263,000 instances in (Van Durme and Pa§ca, 2008).",
        "Subsequent extensions of the repository, using data derived from tables within Web documents, increase instance coverage and induce a ranking among class labels of each instance, but do not increase the number of class labels (Taluk-dar et al., 2008).",
        "Due to aggressive filtering, the resulting number of class labels is higher than the often-small sets ofentity types studied previously, but may still be insufficient given the diversity of Web search queries.",
        "As an alternative, the soft ranking approach proposed here attempts to rank better class labels higher, without necessarily removing class labels deemed incorrect according to various criteria.",
        "For each instance I, the associated class labels are ranked in the following stages:",
        "1) Apply the scoring formula below, resulting in a ranked list of class labels Li(I):",
        "Thus, a class label C is deemed more relevant for an instance I if C is extracted by multiple extraction patterns and its original frequency-based score is higher.",
        "2) For each term within any class label from Li (I), compute a score equal to the frequency sum of the term within anonymized queries containing the instance I as a prefix, and the term anywhere else in the queries.",
        "Each class label is assigned the geometric mean of the scores of its terms, after ignoring stop words.",
        "The class labels are ranked according to the means, resulting in a ranked list L2(I).",
        "In case of ties, L2(I) preserves the relative ranking from Li (I).",
        "Thus, a class label is deemed more relevant if its individual terms occur in popular queries containing the instance.",
        "3) Compute a merged ranked list of class labels out of the ranked lists Li (I) and L2(I), by sorting the class labels in decreasing order of the inverse of the average rank, computed with the following formula:",
        "MerqedScore(C) = – – ,,„,-.-^ – , ,„r.",
        "where 2 is the number of input lists of class labels, and Rank(C, Lj) is the rank of C in the list Li of class labels computed for the corresponding input instance.",
        "The rank is set to 1000, if C is not present in the list Li.",
        "By using only the relative ranks of the class labels within the input lists, and not on their scores, the outcome of the merging is less sensitive to how class labels of a given instance are scored within the IsA repository.",
        "In case of ties, the scores of the class labels from Li (I) serve as a secondary ranking criterion.",
        "Note that the third stage is introduced because relying on query logs to estimate the relevance of class labels exposes the ranking method to significant noise.",
        "On one hand, arguably useful class labels (e.g., authors) may not occur in queries along with the respective instances (diderot).",
        "On the other hand, for each query containing an instance and (part of) useful class labels, there are many other queries containing, e.g., attributes (diderot biography or diderot beliefs) or the name of a book in the query diderot the nun.",

        "• from the repository extracted here, with class labels of an instance ranked based on the MergedScore from Section 2, in run Ru.",
        "The manual evaluation of open-domain information extraction output is time consuming (Banko et al., 2007).",
        "Fortunately, it is possible to implement an automatic evaluation procedure for ranked lists of class labels, based on existing resources and systems.",
        "Assume that a gold standard is available, containing gold class labels that are each associated with a gold set of their instances.",
        "The creation of such gold standards is discussed later.",
        "Based on the gold standard, the ranked lists of class labels available within an IsA repository can be automatically evaluated as follows.",
        "First, for each gold label, the ranked lists of class labels of individual gold instances are retrieved from the IsA repository.",
        "Second, the individual retrieved lists are merged into a ranked list of class labels, associated with the gold label.",
        "The merged list is computed using an extension of the MergedScore formula described earlier in Section 2.",
        "Third, the merged list is compared against the gold label, to estimate the accuracy of the merged list.",
        "Intuitively, a ranked list of class labels is a better approximation of a gold label, if class labels situated at better ranks in the list are closer in meaning to the gold label.",
        "Given a gold label and a list of class labels, if any, derived from the IsA repository, the rank of the highest class label that matches the gold label determines the score assigned to the gold label, in the form of the reciprocal rank, max(1/rankmatch).",
        "Thus, if the gold label matches a class label at rank 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the computed list, the gold label receives a score of 1, 0.5, 0.33, 0.25 or 0.2 respectively.",
        "The score is 0 if the gold label does not match any of the top 20 class labels.",
        "The overall score over the entire set of gold labels is the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score over all gold labels from the set.",
        "Two types of MRR scores are automatically computed:",
        "• MRRf considers a gold label and a class label to match if they are identical;",
        "• MRRp considers a gold label and a class label to match if one or more of their tokens that are not stop words are identical.",
        "During matching, all string comparisons are case-insensitive, and all tokens are first converted to their singular form (e.g., european countries to european country) when available, by using WordNet's morphological routines.",
        "Thus, insurance carriers and insurance companies are considered to not match in MRR/ scores, but match in MRRp scores, whereas insurance companies and insurance company match in both MRR/ and MRRp scores.",
        "Note that both MRRf and MRRpscores fail to give any credit to arguably valid and useful class labels, such as insurers for the gold label insurance carriers, or asian nations for the gold label asia countries.",
        "On the other hand, MRRp scores may give credit to less relevant class labels, such as insurance policies for the gold label insurance carriers.",
        "Therefore, MRRp is an approximate, and MRR/ is a conservative, lower-bound estimate of the actual usefulness of the computed ranked lists of class labels as approximations of the semantics of the gold labels."

        "In particular, when Iq is set to 10 and Ci to 20, run Ru identifies the original query as an exact match among the top four class labels returned; and as a partial match among the top two class labels returned, as an average over the Qe set.",
        "In this case, the original query is identified at ranks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for 16.8%, 8.7%, 6.1%, 3.7% and 1.7% of the queries, as an exact match; and for 48.8%, 14.2%, 6.1%, 3.6% and 1.9% respectively, as a partial match.",
        "The corresponding MRR/ score of 0.257 over the Qe set obtained with run Ru is higher than with run Rs, and much higher than with run Rg.",
        "In all experiments, the higher scores of Ru can be attributed to higher coverage of class labels, relative to Rg; and higher-quality lists of class labels, relative to Rsbut also to Rg, despite the fact that Rg combines high-precision seed data with using both unstructured and structured text as sources of class labels (cf. (Talukdar et al., 2008)).",
        "Among combinations of parameter settings described in Table 2, values around 15 for Iq and 20 for Ci give the highest scores over both Qe and Qm."

        "Knowledge including instances and classes can be manually compiled by experts (Fellbaum, 1998) or collaboratively by non-experts (Singh et al., 2002).",
        "Alternatively, classes of instances acquired automatically from text are potentially less expensive to acquire, maintain and grow, and their coverage and scope are theoretically bound only by the size of the underlying data source.",
        "Existing methods for extracting classes of instances acquire sets of instances that are each either un-labeled (Wang and Cohen, 2008; Pennacchiotti sociated with a class label (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Banko et al., 2007; Wang and Cohen, 2009).",
        "When associated with a class label, the sets of instances may be organized as flat sets or hierarchically, relative to existing hierarchies such as WordNet (Snow et al., 2006) or the category network within Wikipedia (Wu and structured text was shown to be a complementary resource to unstructured text, for the purpose of extracting relations from Web documents (Cafarella et al., 2008).",
        "The role of anonymized query logs in Web-based information extraction has been explored in the tasks of class attribute extraction (Paçca and Van Durme, 2007) and instance set expansion (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009).",
        "Our method illustrates the usefulness of queries considered in isolation from one another, in ranking class labels in extracted IsA repositories.",
        "Previous work on generating relevant labels, given sets or clusters of items, focuses on scenarios where the items within the clusters are descriptions of, or full-length documents within document collections.",
        "The documents are available as a flat set (Cutting et al., 1993; Carmel et al., 2009) or are hierarchically organized (Treeratpituk and Callan, 2006).",
        "Relying on semi-structured content assembled manually as part of the structure of Wikipedia articles, such as article titles or categories, the method introduced in (Carmel et al., 2009) derives labels for clusters containing 100 full-length documents each.",
        "In contrast, our method relies on IsA relations automatically extracted from unstructured text within arbitrary Web documents, and computes labels given textual input that is orders of magnitude smaller, i.e., around 10 phrases (instances).",
        "The experiments described in (Carmel et al., 2009) assign labels to one of 20 sets of newsgroup documents from a standard benchmark.",
        "Each set of documents is associated with a higher-level, coarse-grained label used as a gold label against which the generated labels are compared.",
        "In comparison, our experiments compute text-derived class labels for finer-grained, often highly-specific gold labels.",
        "Reducing the granularity of the items to be labeled from full documents to condensed document descriptions, (Geraci et al., 2006) submits arbitrary search queries to external Web search engines.",
        "It organizes the top 200 returned Web documents into clusters, by analyzing the text snippets associated with each document in the output from the search engines.",
        "Any words and phrases from the snippets may be selected as labels for the clusters, which in general leads to labels that are not intended to capture any classes that may be associated to the query.",
        "For example, labels of clusters generated in (Geraci et al., 2006) include armstrong ceilings, italia, armstrong sul sito and louis jazz for the query armstrong; and madonnaweb, music, madonna online and madonna itself for the query madonna.",
        "The amount of text available as input for the purpose of labeling is at least two orders of magnitude larger than in our method, and the task of selecting any phrases as labels, as opposed to selecting only labels that correspond to classes, is more relaxed and likely easier.",
        "Another approach specifically addresses the problem of generating labels for sets of instances, where the labels are extracted from unstructured text.",
        "In (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004), given a collection of news articles that is both cleaner and smaller than Web document collections, a syntactic parser is applied to document sentences in order to identify and exploit syntactic dependencies for the purpose of selecting candidate class labels.",
        "Such methods are comparatively less applicable to Web document collections, due to scalability issues associated with parsing a large set of Web documents of variable quality.",
        "Moreover, the class labels generated in (Pantel and Ravichan-dran, 2004) tend to be rather coarse-grained.",
        "For example, the top labels generated for a set of Chinese universities (qinghua university, fudan university, beijing university) are university, institution, stock-holder, college and school."
