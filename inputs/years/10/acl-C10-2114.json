        "The Person Cross Document Coreference, CDC, task requires that all the personal name mentions, PNMs, in a corpus be clustered together according to the individuals they refer to (Grishman 1994).",
        "The coreference between two PNMs is decided on the basis of the local contexts.",
        "In this paper we consider a news corpus, and the local context is the piece of news to which a particular PNM belongs.",
        "We work on a seven year Italian local newspaper corpus, Adige 500K (Magnini et.",
        "al.",
        "2006).",
        "While there are certain similarities between a disambiguation task and the CDC task, we maintain that there is a significant difference which sets the CDC task apart.",
        "Unlike in other disambiguation tasks, in the CDC tasks the relevant coreference context depends on the corpus itself.",
        "In word sense disambiguation, for instance, the distribution of the relevant context is mainly regulated by strong syntactic and semantic rules.",
        "The existence of such rules allows for disambiguation decisions which are made by considering the local context only.",
        "On the other hand, the distribution of the PNMs in a corpus is rather random and the relevant coreference context is a dynamic variable which depends on the diversity of the corpus, that is, on how many different persons with the same name share a similar context.",
        "Unlike the word senses which are subject to strong linguistic constraints, the name distribution is more or less random.",
        "To exemplify, consider the name \"John Smith\" and an organization, say \"U.N.\".",
        "The extent to which \"works for U.N.\" in \"John Smith works for U.N.\" is a relevant coreference context depends on the diversity of the corpus itself.",
        "If in that corpus, among all the \"John Smiths\" there is only one person who works for \"U.N.\" then \"works for U.N.\" is a relevant coreference context, but if there are many \"John Smiths\" working for U.N., then \"works for U.N.\" is not a relevant coreference system.",
        "In this paper we present a method to exactly determine the relevance of a piece of context for the coreference.",
        "As above, the exactness is understood in relationship with the whole system of clusters.",
        "The relevance of a piece of context is computed by means of a weighting procedure.",
        "The classic weighting procedures are static, each piece of context receives an initial value that is also a final one and the clustering proceeds on the basis of these values.",
        "We demonstrate that this approach has serious drawbacks and we argue that in order to obtain accurate results, a dynamic weighting procedure is necessary, which outputs new values depending on the cluster configuration.",
        "In Section 2 we review the relevant literature.",
        "In Section 3 we present the problems related to the classical approach to the CDC task and we present evidence that the data distribution in a news corpus requires a proper treatment of these problems.",
        "In Section 4 we present the technique that permits to overcome the problems identified in Section 3.",
        "In Section 5 we present the context extraction technique that supports the method developed in Section 4.",
        "In Section 6 we present the results of an evaluation experiment.",

        "In a classical paper (Bagga and Baldwin 1998), a PCDC system based on the vector space model (VSM) is proposed.",
        "While there are many advantages in representing the context as vectors on which a similarity function is applied, it has been shown that there are inherent limitations associated with the vectorial model (Popescu 2008).",
        "These problems, related to the density in the vectorial space (superposition) and to the discriminative power of the similarity power (masking), become visible as more cases are considered.",
        "Testing the system on many names, (Gooi and Allan, 2004), it has been noted empirically that the accuracy of the results varies significantly from name to name.",
        "Indeed, by considering just the sentence level context, which is a strong requirement for establishing coreference, a PCDC system obtains a good score for \"John Smith\".",
        "This happens because the prior probability of coreference of any two \"John Smiths\" mentions is low, as this is a very common name and none of the \"John Smiths\" has an overwhelming number of mentions.",
        "But for other types of names the same system is not accurate.",
        "If it considers, for instance, \"Barack Obama\", the same system obtains a very low recall, as the probability of any two \"Barack Obama\" mentions to corefer is very high and the relevant coreference context is very often found beyond the sentence level.",
        "Without further adjustments, a vectorial model cannot resolve the problem of considering too much or too little contextual evidence in order to obtain a good precision for \"John Smith\" and simultaneously a good recall for \"Barack Obama\".",
        "These types of name have different cluster systems",
        "In an experiment using bigrams (Pederson et al.",
        "2005) on a news corpus, it has been observed that the relationship between the amount of information given to a CDC system and the performances is not linear.",
        "If the system has received in input the correct number of persons with the same name, the accuracy of the system has dropped.",
        "A typical case for this situation is when there is a person that is very often mentioned, and few other persons that have few mentions.",
        "When the number of clusters is passed in the input, the clusters representing the persons who are rarely mentioned are wrongly enriched.",
        "However, this situation can be avoided if there is a measure of how big the threshold should be.",
        "The system of clusters is not developed unrealistically if we are able to handle the fact that individuals obey different constraints which are derived directly from the ontological properties.",
        "These constraints are determined directly from the context and adequate weights can be set.",
        "Recently, there has been a major interest in the CDC systems, and, in the last two years, two important evaluation campaigns have been organized: Web People Search-1 (Artiles et al.",
        "2007) and ACE 2008 (www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/).",
        "It has been noted that the data variance between training and test is very high (Lefever 2007).",
        "Rather than being a particularity of those corpora, the problem is general.",
        "The performances of a bag of words VSM depends to a very high extent on the corpus diversity (see Section 3.2).",
        "For reliable results, a CDC system must have access to global information regarding the coreference space.",
        "Rich biographic facts have been shown to improve the accuracy of CDC (Mann and Ya-rowsky 2003).",
        "Indeed, when available, the birth date, the occupation etc.",
        "represent a relevant co-reference context because the probability that two different persons have the same name, the same birth date and the same occupation is negligible.",
        "However, it is equally unlikely to find this information in a news corpus a sufficient number of times.",
        "Even for a web corpus, where the amount of this kind of information is higher than in a news corpus, the extended biographic facts, including email address, phones, etc., contribute only with approximately 3% to the total number of coreferences (Elmacioglu et al.",
        "2007).",
        "In order to improve the performances of the CDC systems based on VSM, the special importance of pieces of context has been exploited by implementing a cascade clustering technique (Wei 2006).",
        "Other authors have relied on advanced clustering techniques (among others Han et al.",
        "2005, Chen 2006).",
        "However, these techniques rely on the precise analysis of the context, which is a time consuming process.",
        "It has been also noted that, in spite of deep analysis, the relevant coreference context is hard to find (Vu 2007)."

        "The coreference of two PNMs is realized on the basis of the context.",
        "In a news corpus, the context surrounding each PNM, which is relevant for coreference, is extracted into a set, called association set.",
        "In Table 1 we present an example of association sets related to the same name.",
        "A weighting schema, a global metrics and threshold are set, and the distance between two association sets is computed.",
        "The decision of coreferencing two PNMs is made on comparing the distance to the threshold and clustering the PNMs representing the same individual into a unique cluster.",
        "The accuracy of a CDC system based on association sets depends on two factors:",
        "(1) the ability to extract the relevant elements for the association sets from the news context and (2) the adequacy of the similarity formula - metrics and threshold.",
        "Regarding the first factor, the ability to extract the relevant pieces of context, the right heuristics must be found, because the exact syntax-semantics analysis of text is unfortunately very hard or impossible to implement.",
        "A strong limitation comes from the fact that even a shallow parsing requires too much time in order to be practical.",
        "However, it has been shown that accurate parings of PNMs and co-occurring special words can be found by employing relaxed extraction techniques (Buitelaar&Magnini 2005).",
        "The association sets built in this way are effective in solving the CDC task (Sekine 2008, Popescu 2008).",
        "We make use of these findings in order to build the association sets, which mainly include named entities and certain special words, which are bound to an ontology.",
        "The details of these particular association sets are given in Section 5.",
        "As straightforward as the classical approach based on the distance between association sets may seem, there are actually a series of problems related to the second requirement, namely the adequacy of similarity formula.",
        "We make these problems explicit below.",
        "In order to introduce the first problem we start with an intuitive example.",
        "Suppose that we want to individuate the persons with the name Michael Jackson in a news corpus.",
        "A simplistic solution is to cluster together all such PNMs and declare that than there is just one person mentioned in the whole corpus with this name.",
        "This solution has the advantage of being very simple and of obtaining a very high score in terms of precision and recall.",
        "This is because most of such PNMs refer to only one person indeed - the pop star.",
        "However, the above method fails short when it comes to presenting the evidence for its corefe-rence decision.",
        "Actually, it turns out that this is a very hard task, because the number of PNMs, which do not refer to the pop star, is extremely small.",
        "Thus, the prior chances of correctly finding two PNMs which do not refer to this person are quite small.",
        "Unfortunately, the classical metrics are too coarse to capture the difference in such cases, even if the association sets are 100% correct.",
        "To support this statement, let us consider three classes under the same name, with each class corresponding to a different individual.",
        "Let us further suppose that two classes contain the great majority of the PNMs, and the third class only has a small number of PNMs.",
        "A linear decision is likely to confound the elements of the third class to the ones of the first two.",
        "This happens because the elements of the third class are transparent to the hyper plane that separates the two well-represented classes.",
        "This situation is called masking, and is a direct effect of applying an inaccurate weighting schema and metrics (Hastie&Tibshirani 2001).",
        "The effects of masking on the CDC task have been empirically noticed in (Pederson 2005).",
        "The main obstacle in dealing with masking is the correct treatment of the border elements.",
        "8y, the discrimant function between two classes, i and j respectively, must assign zero to all border elements.",
        "In Section 4, we directly address this problem.",
        "The second problem that needs to be solved by the CDC systems based on associated sets may be regarded as the negative effect of counter balancing the sparseness problem.",
        "In general, the association sets are too sparse to permit pair to pair comparison.",
        "Rather, the information must be interpolated from a set of corefered association sets.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, any two association sets chosen from the three ones on the left, AS1, AS2 and AS3 respectively, are similar enough to one another to corefer.",
        "However, none of these association sets is similar enough to the one on the right - AS4.",

        "By interpolating the information in the set of the initial three association sets, the coreference becomes possible between all four association sets.",
        "In general, by interpolating from a set of the association sets, one wants to find the right core-ferences and to avoid the false ones accurately.",
        "In a vector space, the interpolation is safe if the initial vectors are orthogonal to each other, because the sum of orthogonal vectors is also orthogonal to any other vector that is not part of the sum.",
        "Therefore the right coreferences have a big dot product with the sum, while the false ones have a dot product with the sum close to zero.",
        "This property of the sum of the orthogonal vectors is called superposition (Gallant 1993).",
        "By representing the association sets as vectors, where each set of vectors is associated exclusively with a certain individual, the sum of these vectors has the superposition property.",
        "However, if the vectors representing the association sets are not orthogonal, then the interpolated vectors are prone to false coreferences.",
        "In this case, the accidental coincidences - which are responsible for the original vectors not being orthogonal - biases the dot product and introduces false coreferences.",
        "Consequently the superposition affects negatively the overall accuracy.",
        "The aggravating effect of superposition in conjunction with an agglomerative clustering procedure has been empirically noted in Gooi&Allan.",
        "The third problem is directly related to the fact that in the most ambiguous cases the association sets lead to high-dimensional, very sparse vectors.",
        "The basic fact is that inside a cluster of correctly corefered PNMs that refer to the same individual, the distance from most of these PNMS to the center of the cluster is smaller than the distance from these PNMs to the border.",
        "Let us consider that all the m PNMs representing the same individual are points in an n dimensional vector space and their cluster is normalized to the unit sphere.",
        "The distance from the center of the sphere to the closest point is an exponentially growing formula both in 1/n and 1/m.",
        "Even for small values, the distance from the center to the closest point is larger than A.",
        "The points representing the PNMs in the same cluster are closer to the border, and not to the center of the sphere.",

        "Many PNMs are the mentions of the same name, considered as a string.",
        "We are interested in the frequency with which a certain name appears.",
        "We have noticed that there is a strict relationship between the names, their frequencies and the number of mentions; see Table",
        "The names have a very unbalanced distribution.",
        "A name which has a frequency over 20 and is ambiguous represents a difficult case.",
        "The measure we use in order to evaluate the difficulty is the Gini's mean difference.",
        "Let X1, X2, Xnbe the individuals that are named with the same name and let S be the set of the PNMs of this name PNMS, S1, S2, ... Sn.",
        "The Gini's mean difference is a measure of the spread of the information in the set S:",
        "The uniform distribution makes Gini's factor null.",
        "A value of this factor close to 1 shows a skewed distribution.",
        "In the first case, G ~ 0, the superposition effect is likely to be responsible for false coreferences, while in the latter case, G ~ 1, the masking effect is predominant.",
        "However, there is a close relationship between all the three problems above.",
        "As the most ambiguous cases are near the border.",
