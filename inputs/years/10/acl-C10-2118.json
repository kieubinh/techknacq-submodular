        "Discourse relations that hold between the content of clauses and of sentences - including relations of cause, contrast, elaboration, and temporal ordering - are important for natural language processing tasks that require sensitivity to more than just a single sentence, such as summarization, information extraction, and generation.",
        "In written text, discourse relations have usually been considered to be signaled either explicitly, as lexical-ized with some word or phrase, or implicitly due to adjacency.",
        "Thus, while the causal relation between the situations described in the two clauses in Ex.",
        "(1) is signalled explicitly by the connective As a result, the same relation is conveyed implicitly in Ex.",
        "(2).",
        "(1) John was tired.",
        "As a result he left early.",
        "(2) John was tired.",
        "He left early.",
        "This paper focusses on the problem of how to characterize and identify explicit signals of discourse relations, exemplified in Ex.",
        "(1).",
        "To refer to all such signals, we use the term \"discourse relation markers\" (DRMs).",
        "Past research (e.g., (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Martin, 1992; Knott, 1996), among others) has assumed that DRMs are frozen or fixed expressions from a few well-defined syntactic classes, such as conjunctions, adverbs, and prepositional phrases.",
        "Thus the literature presents lists of DRMs, which researchers try to make as complete as possible for their chosen language.",
        "In annotating lexicalized discourse relations of the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008), this same assumption drove the initial phase of annotation.",
        "A list of \"explicit connectives\" was collected from various sources and provided to annotators, who then searched for these expressions in the text and annotated them, along with their arguments and senses.",
        "The same assumption underlies methods for automatically identifying DRMs (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009).",
        "Since expressions functioning as DRMs can also have non-DRM functions, the task is framed as one of classifying given individual tokens as DRM or not DRM.",
        "In this paper, we argue that placing such syntactic and lexical restrictions on DRMs limits a proper understanding of discourse relations, which can be realized in other ways as well.",
        "For example, one should recognize that the instantiation (or exemplification) relation between the two sentences in Ex.",
        "(3) is explicitly signalled in the second sentence by the phrase Probably the most egregious example is, which is sufficient to express the instantiation relation.",
        "(3) Typically, these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations.",
        "Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny.",
        "Cases such as Ex.",
        "(3) show that identifying DRMs cannot simply be a matter of preparing a list of fixed expressions and searching for them in the text.",
        "We describe in Section 2 how we identified other ways of expressing discourse relations in the PDTB.",
        "In the current version of the corpus (PDTB 2.0.",
        "), they are labelled as AltLex (alternative lexicalizations), and are \"discovered\" as a result of our lexically driven annotation of discourse relations, including explicit as well as implicit relations.",
        "Further analysis of AltLex annotations (Section 3) leads to the thesis that DRMs are a lexically open-ended class of elements which may or may not belong to well-defined syntactic classes.",
        "The open-ended nature of DRMs is a challenge for their automated identification, and in Section 4, we point to some lessons we have already learned from this annotation.",
        "Finally, we suggest that methods used for automatically generating candidate paraphrases may help to expand the set of recognized DRMs for English and for other languages as well (Section 5)."

        "We assumed that such relations are triggered by adjacency, and (because of resource limitations) considered only those that held between sentences within the same paragraph.",
        "Annotators were thus instructed to supply a connective - called \"implicit connective\" - for each pair of adjacent sentences, as long as the relation was not already expressed with one of the explicit connectives provided to them.",
        "This procedure led to the annotation of implicit connectives such as because in Ex.",

        "For all such cases, annotators were instructed to supply \"NONE\" as the implicit connective.",
        "Later, we subdivided these \"NONE\" im-plicits into \"EntRel\", for the (a) type above (an entity-based coherence relation, since the second sentence seemed to continue the description of some entity mentioned in the first); \"NoRel\" (no relation) for the (c) type; and \"AltLex\", for the (b) type, which we turn to next.",
        "Closer investigation of the (b) cases revealed that the awkwardness perceived by annotators when inserting an implicit connective was due to redundancy in the expression of the relation: Although no explicit connective was present to relate the two sentences, some other expression appeared to be doing the job.",

        "Given the importance of DRMs for recognizing and classifying discourse relations and their arguments, what have we learned from the annotation of AltLex?",
        "First, the number of expressions found through AltLex annotation, that belong to syntactic classes admitted as connectives and also similarly frozen (Table 1, row 1) shows that even in the PDTB, there are additional instances of what we have taken to be explicit connectives.",
        "By recognizing them and unambiguously labelling their senses, we will start to reduce the number of \"hard cases\" of implicit connectives whose sense has to be recognized (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Pitler et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009).",
        "Secondly, the number of tokens of expressions from other syntactic classes that have been annotated as AltLex (Table 1, rows 2 and 3) may actually be higher than was caught via our Alt-Lex annotation, thus making them even more important for discourse processing.",
        "To assess this, we selected five of them and looked for all their tokens in the WSJ raw files underlying both the PTB and the PDTB.",
        "After eliminating those tokens that had already been annotated, we judged whether the remaining ones were functioning as connectives.",

        "Preliminary analysis of the results reveals many DRMs that don't appear anywhere in the WSJ Corpus (eg, as a consequence, as an example, by the same token), as well as additional DRMs that appear in the corpus but were not annotated as AltLex (e.g., above all, after all, despite that).",
        "Many of these latter instances appear in the initial sentence of a paragraph, but the annotation of implicit connectives – which is what led to AltLex annotation in the first place (Section 2) – was not carried out on these sentences.",
        "There are two further things to note before closing this discussion.",
        "First, there is an additional source of noise in using back-translation paraphrase to expand the set of identified DRMs.",
        "This arises from the fact that discourse relations can be conveyed either explicitly or implicitly, and a translated text may not have made the same choices vis-a-vis explicitation as its source, causing additional word alignment errors (some of which are interesting, but most of which are not).",
        "Secondly, this same method should prove useful for languages other English, although there will be an additional problem to overcome for languages (such as Turkish) in which DRMs are conveyed through morphology as well as through distinct words and phrases."

        "Challenging the RST assumption that the basic unit of a discourse is a clause, with discourse relations holding between adjacent clausal units, Kibble (1999) provides evidence that informational discourse relations (as opposed to intentional discourse relations) can hold intra-clausally as well, with the relation \"verbalized\" and its arguments realized as nominalizations, as in Early treatment with Brand X can prevent a cold sore developing.",
        "Since his focus is intra-clausal, he does not observe that verbalized discourse relations can hold across sentences as well, where a verb and one of its arguments function similarly to a discourse adverbial, and in the end, he does not provide a proposal for how to systematically identify these alternative realizations.",
