        "In recent years a variety of statistical models for realization ranking that take syntax into account have been proposed, including generative models (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Cahill and van Genabith, 2006; Hogan et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008), maximum entropy models (Velldal and Oepen, 2005; Nakanishi et al., 2005) and averaged perceptron models (White and Rajkumar, 2009).",
        "To our knowledge, however, none of these models have included features specifically designed to handle grammatical agreement, an important task in surface realization.",
        "In this paper, we show that incorporating linguistically motivated features to ensure correct animacy and verbal agreement in an averaged perceptron ranking model for CCG realization helps improve a state-of-the-art baseline even further.",
        "We also demonstrate the utility of such an approach in ensuring the correct presentation of balanced punctuation marks.",
        "Traditionally, grammatical agreement phenomena have been modelled using hard constraints in the grammar.",
        "Taking into consideration the range of acceptable variation in the case of ani-macy agreement and facts about the variety of factors contributing to number agreement, the question arises: tackle agreement through grammar engineering, or via a ranking model?",
        "In our experience, trying to add number and animacy agreement constraints to a grammar induced from the CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007) turned out to be surprisingly difficult, as hard constraints often ended up breaking examples that were working without such constraints, due to exceptions, sub-regularities and acceptable variation in the data.",
        "With sufficient effort, it is conceivable that an approach incorporating hard agreement constraints could be refined to underspec-ify cases where variation is acceptable, but even so, one would want a ranking model to capture preferences in these cases, which might vary depending on genre, dialect or domain.",
        "Given that a ranking model is desirable in any event, we investigate here the extent to which agreement phenomena can be more robustly and simply handled using a ranking model alone, with no hard constraints in the grammar.",
        "We also show here that the perceptron model can reduce balanced punctuation errors that would otherwise require a post-filter.",
        "As White and Rajkumar (2008) discuss, in CCG it is not feasible to use features in the grammar to ensure that balanced punctuation (e.g. paired commas for NP ap-positives) is used in all and only the appropriate places, given the word-order flexibility that crossing composition allows.",
        "While a post-filter is a reasonably effective solution, it can be prone to search errors and does not allow balanced punctuation choices to interact with other choices made by the ranking model.",
        "The starting point for our work is a CCG realization ranking model that incorporates Clark & Curran's (2007) normal-form syntactic model, developed for parsing, along with a variety of n-gram models.",
        "Although this syntactic model plays an important role in achieving top BLEU scores for a reversible, corpus-engineered grammar, an error analysis nevertheless revealed that many errors in relative pronoun animacy agreement and subject-verb number agreement remain with this model.",
        "In this paper, we show that features specifically designed to better handle these agreement phenomena can be incorporated into a realization ranking model that makes many fewer agreement errors, while also yielding significant improvements in BLEU scores on Section 23 of the CCG-bank.",
        "These features make use of existing corpus annotations – specifically, PTB function tags and BBN named entity classes (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) – and thus they are relatively easy to implement.",
        "To illustrate the variation that can be found with animacy agreement phenomena, consider first an-imacy agreement with relative pronouns.",
        "In English, an inanimate noun can be modified by a relative clause introduced by that or which, while an animate noun combines with who(m).",
        "With some nouns though – such as team, group, .squad, etc.",
        " – animacy status is uncertain, and these can be found with all the three relative pronouns (who, which and that).",
        "Google counts suggest that all three choices are almost equally acceptable, as the examples below illustrate:",

        "(WSJ0518.35)",
        "Subject-verb agreement can be described as a constraint where the verb agrees with the subject in terms of agreement features (number and person).",
        "Agreement has often been considered to be a syntactic phenomenon and grammar implementations generally use syntactic features to enforce agreement constraints (e.g. Velldal and Oepen, 2005).",
        "However a closer look at our data and a survey of the theoretical linguistics literature points toward a more heterogeneous conception of English agreement.",
        "Purely syntactic accounts are problematic when the following examples are considered:",
        "(4) King prawns cooked in chili salt and pepper was very much better, a simple dish succulently executed.",

        "(WSJ0071.53)",
        "In Example (3) above, the subject and determiner are plural while the verb is singular.",
        "In (4), the singular verb agrees with the dish, rather than with individual prawns.",
        "Measure nouns such as lot, ton, etc.",
        "exhibit singular agreement with the determiner a, but varying agreement with the verb depending on the head noun of the measure noun's of-complement.",
        "As is also well known, British and American English differ in subject-verb agreement with collective nouns.",
        "Kathol (1999) proposes an explanation where agreement is determined by the semantic properties of the noun rather than by its morphological properties.",
        "This accounts for all the cases above.",
        "In the light of this explanation, specifying agreement features in the logical form for realization could perhaps solve the problem.",
        "However, the semantic view of agreement is not completely convincing due to counterexamples like the following discussed in the literature (reported in Kim (2004)):",
        "(7) Suppose you meet someone and they are totally full of themselves (8) Those scissors are missing.",
        "In Example (7), the pronoun they used in a generic sense is linked to the singular antecedent someone, but its plural feature triggers plural agreement with the verb.",
        "Example (8) illustrates a situation where the subject scissors is arguably semantically singular, but exhibits plural morphology and plural syntactic agreement with both the determiner as well as the verb.",
        "Thus this suggests that English has a set of heterogeneous agreement patterns rather than purely syntactic or semantic ones.",
        "This is also reflected in the proposal for a hybrid agreement system for English (Kim, 2004), where the morphology tightly interacts with the system of syntax, semantics, or even pragmatics to account for agreement phenomena.",
        "Our machine learning-based approach approximates the insights discussed in the theoretical linguistics literature.",
        "Writing grammar rules to get these facts right proved to be surprisingly difficult (e.g. discerning the actual nominal head contributing agreement feature in cases like areas of the factory were/*was vs. a lot of wines are/*is) and required a list of measure nouns and partitive quantifiers.",
        "We investigate here the extent to which a machine learning-based approach is a simpler, practical alternative for acquiring the relevant generalizations from the data by combining information from various information sources.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides CCG background.",
        "Section 3 describes the features we have designed for animacy and number agreement as well as for balanced punctuation.",
        "Section 4 presents our evaluation of the impact of these features in averaged perceptron realization ranking models, tabulating specific kinds of errors in the CCGbank development section as well as overall automatic metric scores on Section 23.",
        "Section 5 compares our results to those obtained with related systems.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes with a summary of the paper's contributions."

        "2.1 Surface Realization with Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)",
        "CCG (Steedman, 2000) is a unification-based categorial grammar formalism which is defined almost entirely in terms of lexical entries that encode sub-categorization information as well as syntactic feature information (e.g. number and agreement).",
        "Complementing function application as the standard means of combining a head with its argument, type-raising and composition support transparent analyses for a wide range of phenomena, including right-node raising and long distance dependencies.",
        "An example syntactic derivation appears in Figure 1, with a long-distance dependency between point and make.",
        "Semantic composition happens in parallel with syntactic composition, which makes it attractive for generation.",
        "OpenCCG is a parsing/generation library which works by combining lexical categories for words using CCG rules and multi-modal extensions on rules (Baldridge, 2002) to produce derivations.",
        "Conceptually these extensions are on lexical categories.",
        "Surface realization is the process by which logical forms are transduced to strings.",

        "sdci\\np/np",
        "Figure 2: Semantic dependency graph from the CCGbank for He has a point he wants to make [...], along with gold-standard supertags (category labels) binators to combine signs.",
        "Edges are grouped into equivalence classes when they have the same syntactic category and cover the same parts of the input logical form.",
        "Alternative realizations are ranked using integrated n-gram or perceptron scoring, and pruning takes place within equivalence classes of edges.",
        "To more robustly support broad coverage surface realization, OpenCCG greedily assembles fragments in the event that the realizer fails to find a complete realization.",
        "To illustrate the input to OpenCCG, consider the semantic dependency graph in Figure 2.",
        "In the graph, each node has a lexical predication (e.g. make.03) and a set of semantic features (e.g. (NUM)sg); nodes are connected via dependency relations (e.g. (Arg0)).",
        "(Gold-standard supertags, or category labels, are also shown; see Section 2.2 for their role in hypertagging.)",
        "Internally, such graphs are represented using Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS), a dependency-based approach to representing linguistic meaning (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002).",
        "In HLDS, each semantic head (corresponding to a node in the graph) is associated with a nominal that identifies its discourse referent, and relations between heads and their dependents are modeled as modal relations.",
        "For our experiments, we use an enhanced version of the CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steed-man, 2007) – a corpus of CCG derivations derived from the Penn Treebank – with Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005) roles projected onto it (Boxwell and White, 2008).",
        "Additionally, certain multi-word NEs were collapsed using underscores so that they are treated as atomic entities in the input to the realizer.",
        "To engineer a grammar from this corpus suitable for realization with OpenCCG, the derivations are first revised to reflect the lexical-ized treatment of coordination and punctuation assumed by the multi-modal version of CCG that is implemented in OpenCCG (White and Rajkumar, 2008).",
        "Further changes are necessary to support semantic dependencies rather than surface syntactic ones; in particular, the features and unification constraints in the categories related to semantically empty function words such complementizers, infinitival-to, expletive subjects, and case-marking prepositions are adjusted to reflect their purely syntactic status.",
        "A crucial component of the OpenCCG realizer is the hypertagger (Espinosa et al., 2008), or supertagger for surface realization, which uses a maximum entropy model to assign the most likely lexical categories to the predicates in the input logical form, thereby greatly constraining the realizer's search space.",
        "Category label prediction is done at runtime and is based on contexts within the directed graph structure as shown in Figure 2, instead of basing category assignment on linear word and POS context as in the parsing case."

        "In this paper, we have shown for the first time that incorporating linguistically motivated features to ensure correct animacy and number agreement in a statistical realization ranking model yields significant improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline.",
        "While agreement has traditionally been modelled using hard constraints in the grammar, we have argued that using a statistical ranking model is a simpler and more robust approach that is capable of learning competing preferences and cases of acceptable variation.",
        "Our approach also approximates insights about agreement which have been discussed in the theoretical linguistics literature.",
        "We have also shown how a targeted error analysis can reveal substantial reductions in agreement errors, whose impact on quality no doubt exceeds what is suggested by the small BLEU score increases.",
        "As future work, we also plan to learn such patterns from large amounts of unlabelled data and use models learned thus to rank paraphrases."

        "The last example in Table 7 shows the case of a NP subject which is a disjunction of two individual NPs.",
        "In both these cases, while the baseline models do not enforce the correct choice, the models with the agreement features do get this right.",
        "This is because our agreement features are sensitive to the properties of both NP and VP con-juncts/disjuncts.",
        "In addition, most of the realizations involving of-complements are also ranked correctly.",
