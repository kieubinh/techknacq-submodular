      "text": [
        "A key capability for successful information extraction, topic detection and tracking, and question answering is the ability to identify equivalence classes of entity mentions.",
        "An entity is a real-world person, place, organization, or object, such as the person who serves as the 44th president of the United States.",
        "An entity mention is a string which refers to such an entity, such as \"Barack Hussein Obama\", \"Senator Obama\" or \"President Obama\".",
        "The goal of coreference resolution is to identify and connect all textual entity mentions that refer to the same entity.",
        "The first step towards this goal is to identify all references within the same document, or within document coreference resolution.",
        "A document often has a leading canonical reference to the entity (\"Barack Obama\") followed by additional expressions for the same entity (\"President Obama.\")",
        "An intra-document coreference system must first identify each reference, often relying on named entity recognition, and then decide if these references refer to a single individual or multiple entities, creating a coreference chain for each unique entity.",
        "Feature representations include surface form similarity, lexical context of mentions, position in the document and distance between references.",
        "A variety of statistical learning methods have been applied to this problem, including use of decision trees (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002), graph partitioning (Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006), maximum-entropy models (Luo et al., 2004), and conditional random fields (Choi and Cardie, 2007).",
        "Given preprocessed documents, in which entities have been identified and entity mentions have been linked into chains, we seek to identify across an entire document collection all chains that refer to the same entity.",
        "This task is called cross document coreference resolution (CDCR).",
        "Several of the challenges associated with CDCR differ from the within document task.",
        "For example, it is unlikely that the same document will discuss John Phillips the American football player and John Phillips the musician, but it is quite probable that documents discussing each will appear in the same collection.",
        "Therefore, while matching entities with the same mention string can work well for within document coreference, more sophisticated approaches are necessary for the cross document scenario where a one-entity-per-name assumption is unreasonable.",
        "One of the most common approaches to both within document and cross document corefer-ence resolution has been based on agglomerative clustering, where vectors might be bag-of-word contexts (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998; Mann and",
        "Yarowsky, 2003; Gooi and Allan, 2004; Chen and Martin, 2007).",
        "These algorithms creates a O(n) dependence in the number of mentions for within document - and documents - for cross document.",
        "This is a reasonable limitation for within document, since the number of references will certainly be small; we are unlikely to encounter a document with millions of references.",
        "In contrast to the small n encountered within a document, we fully expect to run a CDCR system on hundreds of thousands or millions of documents.",
        "Most previous approaches cannot handle collections of this size.",
        "In this work, we present a new method for cross document coreference resolution that scales to very large corpora.",
        "Our algorithm operates in a streaming setting, in which documents are processed one at a time and only a single time.",
        "This creates a linear (O(n)) dependence on the number of documents in the collection, allowing us to scale to millions of documents and millions of unique entities.",
        "Our algorithm uses streaming clustering with common coreference similarity computations to achieve large scale.",
        "Furthermore, our method is designed to support both name disambiguation and name variation.",
        "In the next section, we give a survey of related work.",
        "In Section 3 we detail our streaming setup, giving a description of the streaming algorithm and presenting efficient techniques for representing clusters over streams and for computing similarity.",
        "Section 4 describes the data sets on which we evaluate our methods and presents results.",
        "We conclude with a discussion and description of ongoing work."

      "text": [
        "Traditional approaches to cross document coref-erence resolution have first constructed a vector space representation derived from local (or global) contexts of entity mentions in documents and then performed some form of clustering on these vectors.",
        "This is a simple extension of Firth's distributional hypothesis applied to entities (Firth, 1957).",
        "We describe some of the seminal work in this area.",
        "Some of the earliest work in CDCR was by Bagga and Baldwin (1998).",
        "Key contributions of their research include: promotion of a settheoretic evaluation measure, B-CUBED; introduction of a data set based on 197 New York Times articles which mention a person named John Smith; and, use of TF/IDF weighted vectors and cosine similarity in single-link greedy agglomerative clustering.",
        "Mann and Yarowsky (2003) extended Bagga and Baldwin's work and contributed several innovations, including: use of biographical attributes (e.g., year of birth, occupation), and evaluation using pseudonames.",
        "Pseudonames are sets of artificially conflated names that are used as an efficient method for producing a set of gold-standard disambiguations.",
        "Mann and Yarowsky used 4 pairs of conflated names in their evaluation.",
        "Their system did not perform as well on named entities with little available biographic information.",
        "Gooi and Allan (2004) expanded on the use of pseudonames by semi-automatically creating a much larger evaluation set, which they called the 'Person-X' corpus.",
        "They relied on automated named-entity tagging and domain-focused text retrieval.",
        "This data consisted of 34,404 documents where a single person mention in each document was rewritten as 'Person X'.",
        "Besides their novel construction of a large-scale resource, they investigated several minor variations in clustering, namely (a) use of Kullback-Leibler divergence as a distance measure, (b) use of 55-word snippets around entity mentions (vs. entire documents or extracted sentences), and (c) scoring clusters using average-link instead of single-or completelink.",
        "Finally, in more recent work, Chen and Martin (2007) explore the CDCR task in both English and Chinese.",
        "Their work focuses on use of both local, and document-level noun-phrases as features in their vector-space representation.",
        "There have been a number of open evaluations of CDCR systems.",
        "For example, the Web People Search (WePS) workshops (Artiles et al., 2008) have created a task for disambiguating personal names from HTML pages.",
        "A set of ambiguous names is chosen and each is submitted to a popular web search engine.",
        "The top 100 pages are then manually clustered.We discuss several other data sets in Section 4.",
        "All of the papers mentioned above focus on disambiguating personal names.",
        "In contrast, our system can also handle organizations and locations.",
        "Also, as was mentioned earlier, we are committed to a scenario where documents are presented in sequence and entities must be disambiguated instantly, without the benefit of observing the entire corpus.",
        "We believe that such a system is better suited to highly dynamic environments such as daily news feeds, blogs, and tweets.",
        "Additionally, a streaming system exposes a set of known entity clusters after each document is processed instead of waiting until the end of the stream."

      "text": [
        "Our cross document coreference resolution system relies on a streaming clustering algorithm and efficient calculation of similarity scores.",
        "We assume that we receive a stream of corefer-ence chains, along with entity types, as they are extracted from documents.",
        "We use SERIF (Ramshaw and Weischedel, 2005), a state of the art document analysis system which performs intra-document coreference resolution.",
        "BBN developed SERIF to address information extraction tasks in the ACE program and it is further described in Pradhan et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Each unique entity is represented by an entity cluster c, comprised of entity chains from many documents that refer to the same entity.",
        "Given an entity coreference chain e, we identify the best known entity cluster c. If a suitable entity cluster is not found, a new entity cluster is formed.",
        "An entity cluster is selected for a given corefer-ence chain using several similarity scores, including document context, predicted entity type, and orthographic similarity between the entity mention and previously discovered references in the entity cluster.",
        "An efficient implementation of the similarity score allows the system to identify the top k most likely mentions without considering all m entity clusters.",
        "The final output of our system is a collection of entity clusters, each containing a list of coreference chains and their documents.",
        "Additionally, due to its streaming nature, the system can be examined at any time to produce this information based on only the documents that have been processed thus far.",
        "In the next sections, we describe both the clustering algorithm and efficient computation of the entity similarity scores.",
        "We use a streaming clustering algorithm to create entity clusters as follows.",
        "We observe a set of points from a potentially infinite set X, one at a time, and would like to maintain a fixed number of clusters while minimizing the maximum cluster radius, defined as the radius of the smallest ball containing all points of the cluster.",
        "This setup is well known in the theory and information retrieval community and is referred to as the dynamic clustering problem (Can and Ozkarahan, 1987).",
        "Others have attempted to use an incremental clustering approach, such as Gooi and Allan (2004) (who eventually prefer a hierarchical clustering approach), and Luo et al.",
        "(2004), who use a Bell tree approach for incrementally clustering within document entity mentions.",
        "Our work closely follows the Doubling Algorithm of Charikar et al.",
        "(1997), which has better performance guarantees for streaming data.",
        "Streaming clustering means potentially linear performance in the number of observations since each document need only be examined a single time, as opposed to the quadratic cost of agglomerative clustering.",
        "The Doubling Algorithm consists of two stages: update and merge.",
        "Update adds points to existing clusters or creates new clusters while merge combines clusters to prevent the clusters from exceeding a fixed limit.",
        "New clusters are created according to a threshold set using development data.",
        "We selected a threshold of 0.5 since it worked well in preliminary experiments.",
        "Since the number of entities grows with time, we have skipped the merge step in our initial experiments so as not to limit cluster growth.",
        "We use a dynamic caching scheme which backs the actual clusters in a disk based index, but re-",
        "log(Rank)",
        "Figure 1: Frequency vs. rank for 567k people, 136k organizations, and 25k locations in the New York Times Annotated Corpus (Sandhaus, 2008).",
        "tains basic cluster information in memory (see below).",
        "Doing so improves paging performance as observed in Omiecinski and Scheuermann (1984).",
        "Motivated by the Zipfian distribution of named entities in news sources (Figure 1), we organize our cluster store using an LRU policy, which facilitates easy access to named entities that were observed in the recent past.",
        "We obtain additional performance gains by hashing the clusters based on the constituent mention string (details below).",
        "This allows us to quickly retrieve a small but related number of clusters, k. It is always the case that k << m, the current number of clusters.",
        "As part of any clustering algorithm, each new item must be compared against current clusters.",
        "As we see more documents, the number of unique clusters (entities) grows.",
        "Therefore, we need efficient methods to select candidate clusters.",
        "To select the top candidate clusters, we obtain those that have high orthographic similarity with the head name mention in the coreference chain e. We compute this similarity using the dice score on either word unigrams or character skip bigrams.",
        "For each entity mention string associated with a cluster c, we generate all possible n-grams using one of the above two policies.",
        "We then index the cluster by each of its n-grams in a hash maintained in memory.",
        "In addition, we keep the number of ngrams generated for each cluster.",
        "When given a new head mention e for a coref-erence chain, we generate all of the n-grams and look up clusters that contain these n-grams using the hash.",
        "We then compute the dice score:",
        "where {ngram(e)} are the set of n-grams in entity mention e and {ngram(c)} are the set of n-grams for all entity mentions in cluster c. Note that we can calculate the numerator (the intersection) by looking up the n-grams of e in the hash and counting matches with c. The denominator is equivalent to the number of n-grams unique to e and to c plus the number that are shared.",
        "The number that are shared is the intersection.",
        "The number unique to e is the total number of n-grams in e minus the intersection.",
        "The final term, the number unique to c, is computed by taking the total number of n-grams in c (a single integer stored in memory) minus the intersection.",
        "Through this strategy, we can select only those clusters that have the highest orthographic similarity to e without requiring the cluster contents, which may not be stored in memory.",
        "In our experiments, we evaluate settings where we select all candidates with non-zero score and a pruned set of the top k dice score candidates.",
        "We also include in the n-gram list known aliases to facilitate orthographically dissimilar, but reasonable matches (e.g., IBM or 'Big Blue' for 'International Business Machines, Inc.').",
        "For further efficiency, we keep separate caches for each named entity type.",
        "We then select the appropriate cache based on the automatically determined type of the named entity provided by the named entity tagger, which also prevents spurious matches of non-matching entity types.",
        "After filtering by orthographic information to quickly obtain a small set of candidate clusters, a full similarity score is computed for the current entity coreference chain and each retrieved candidate cluster.",

        "For each of these methods, we compute a similarity score as dice(e c) and select the highest scoring cluster.",
