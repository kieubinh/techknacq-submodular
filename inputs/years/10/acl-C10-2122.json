        "Text summarization evaluation has always been a complex and controversial issue in computational linguistics.",
        "In the last decade, significant advances have been made in the summarization evaluation field.",
        "Various evaluation frameworks have been established and evaluation measures developed.",
        "SUMMAC (Mani et al., 2002), in 1998, provided the first system independent framework for summary evaluation; the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) (Over et al., 2007) was the main evaluation forum from 2000 until 2007; nowadays, the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) provides a forum for assessment of different information access technologies including text summarization.",
        "Evaluation in text summarization can be extrinsic or intrinsic (Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996).",
        "In an extrinsic evaluation, the summaries are assessed in the context of an specific task a human or machine has to carry out; in an intrinsic evaluation, the summaries are evaluated in reference to some ideal model.",
        "SUMMAC was mainly extrinsic while DUC and TAC followed an intrinsic evaluation paradigm.",
        "In order to intrinsically evaluate summaries, the automatic summary (peer) has to be compared to a model summary or summaries.",
        "DUC used an interface called SEE to allow human judges compare a peer summary to a model summary.",
        "Using SEE, human judges give a coverage score to the peer summary representing the degree of overlap with the model summary.",
        "Summarization systems obtain a final coverage score which is the average of the coverage's scores associated to their summaries.",
        "The system's coverage score can then be used to rank summarization systems.",
        "In the case of query-focused summarization (e.g. when the summary has to respond to a question or set of questions) a Responsiveness score is also assigned to each summary which indicates how responsive the summary is to the question(s).",
        "Because manual comparison of peer summaries with model summaries is an arduous and costly process, a body of research has been produced in the last decade on automatic content-based evaluation procedures.",
        "Early studies used text similarity measures such as cosine similarity (with or without weighting schema) to compare peer and model summaries (Donaway et al., 2000), various vocabulary overlap measures such as set of n-grams overlap or longest common subsequence between peer and model have also been proposed (Saggion et al., 2002; Radev et al., 2003).",
        "The Bleu machine translation evaluation measure (Papineni et al., 2002) has also been tested in summarization (Pastra and Saggion, 2003).",
        "The DUC conferences adopted the ROUGE package for content-based evaluation (Lin, 2004).",
        "It implements a series of recall measures based on n-gram co-occurrence statistics between a peer summary and a set of model summaries.",
        "ROUGE measures can be used to produce systems ranks.",
        "It has been shown that system rankings produced by some ROUGE measures (e.g., ROUGE-2 which uses bi-grams) correlate with rankings produced using coverage.",
        "In recent years the Pyramids evaluation method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) was introduced.",
        "It is based on the distribution of \"content\" in a set of model summaries.",
        "Summary Content Units (SCUs) are first identified in the model summaries, then each SCU receives a weight which is the number of models containing or expressing the same unit.",
        "Peer SCUs are identified in the peer, matched against model SCUs, and weighted accordingly.",
        "The Pyramids score given to the peer is the ratio of the sum of the weights of its units and the sum of the weights of the best possible ideal summary with the same number of SCUs as the peer.",
        "The Pyramids scores can be used for ranking summarization systems.",
        "Nenkova and Passonneau (2004) showed that Pyramids scores produced reliable system rankings when multiple (4 or more) models were used and that Pyramids rankings correlate with rankings produced by ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU2 (i.e. ROUGE with skip bi-grams).",
        "Still this method requires the creation of models and the identification, matching, and weighting of SCUs in both models and peers.",
        "Donaway et al.",
        "(2000) put forward the idea of using directly the full document for comparison purposes, and argued that content-based measures which compare the document to the summary may be acceptable substitutes for those using model summaries.",
        "A method for evaluation of summarization systems without models has been recently proposed (Louis and Nenkova, 2009).",
        "It is based on the direct content-based comparison between summaries and their corresponding source documents.",
        "Louis and Nenkova (2009) evaluated the effectiveness of the Jensen-Shannon (Lin, 1991b) theoretic measure in predicting systems ranks in two summarization tasks query-focused and update summarization.",
        "They have shown that ranks produced by Pyramids and ranks produced by the Jensen-Shannon measure correlate.",
        "However, they did not investigate the effect of the measure in past summarization tasks such as generic multi-document summarization (DUC 2004 Task 2), biographical summarization (DUC 2004 Task 5), opinion summarization (TAC 2008 OS), and summarization in languages other than English.",
        "We think that, in order to have a better understanding of document-summary evaluation measures, more research is needed.",
        "In this paper we present a series of experiments aimed at a better understanding of the value of the Jensen-Shannon divergence for ranking summarization systems.",
        "We have carried out experimentation with the proposed measure and have verified that in certain tasks (such as those studied by (Louis and Nenkova, 2009)) there is a strong correlation among Pyramids and Responsiveness and the Jensen-Shannon divergence, but as we will show in this paper, there are datasets in which the correlation is not so strong.",
        "We also present experiments in Spanish and French showing positive correlation between the Jensen-Shannon measure and ROUGE.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized in the following way: First in Section 2 we introduce related work in the area of content-based evaluation identifying the departing point for our inquiry; then in Section 3 we explain the methodology adopted in our work and the tools and resources used for experimentation.",
        "In Section 4 we present the experiments carried out together with the results.",

        "One of the first works to use content-based measures in text summarization evaluation is due to (Donaway et al., 2000) who presented an evaluation framework to compare rankings of summarization systems produced by recall and cosine-based measures.",
        "They showed that there was weak correlation between rankings produced by recall, but that content-based measures produce rankings which were strongly correlated, thus paving the way for content-based measures in text summarization evaluation.",

        "(2003) also compared various evaluation measures based on vocabulary overlap.",
        "Although these measures were able to separate random from non-random systems, no clear conclusion was reached on the value of each of the measures studied.",
        "Nowadays, a widespread summarization evaluation framework is Rouge (Lin and Hovy, 2003) which, as we have mentioned before, offers a set of statistics that compare peer summaries with models.",
        "Various statistics exist depending on the used n-gram and on the type of text processing applied to the input texts (e.g., lemmatization, stop-word removal).",

        "(2006) proposed a method of evaluation based on the use of \"distances\" or divergences between two probability distributions (the distribution of units in the automatic summary and the distribution of units in the model summary).",
        "They studied two different Information Theoretic measures of divergence: the Kullback-Leibler (KL) (Kullback and Leibler, 1951) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) (Lin, 1991a) divergences.",
        "In this work we use the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence that is defined as follows:",
        "This measure can be applied to the distribution of units in system summaries P and reference summaries Q and the value obtained used as a score for the system summary.",
        "The method has been tested by (Lin et al., 2006) over the",
        "DUC 2002 corpus for single and multi document summarization tasks showing good correlation among divergence measures and both coverage and Rouge rankings.",
        "Louis and Nenkova (2009) went even further and, as in (Donaway et al., 2000), proposed to directly compare the distribution of words in full documents with the distribution of words in automatic summaries to derive a content-based evaluation measure.",
        "They found high correlation among rankings produced using models and rankings produced without models.",

        "• We have also carried out large-scale experiments in Spanish and French which show positive medium to strong correlation among system's ranks produced by Rouge and divergence measures that do not use the model summaries.",
        "• We have also presented a new framework, Fresa, for the computation of measures based on Jensen-Shannon divergence.",
        "Following the Rouge approach, Fresa implements word uni-grams, bi-grams and skip n-grams for the computation of divergences.",
        "The framework is being made available to the community for research purposes.",
        "Although we have made a number of contributions, this paper leaves many questions open that need to be addressed.",
        "In order to verify correlation between Rouge and J S, in the short term we intend to extend our investigation to other languages and datasets such as Portuguese and Chinese for which we have access to data and summarization technology.",
        "We also plan to apply our evaluation framework to the rest of the DUC and TAC summarization tasks to have a full picture of the correlations among measures with and without human models.",
        "In the long term we plan to incorporate a representation of the task/topic in the computation of the measures."
