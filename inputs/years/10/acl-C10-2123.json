        "The LinGO Grammar Matrix customization system (Bender et al., 2002; 2010) is a web-based tool that creates starter grammars based on users' input to a questionnaire.",
        "The system comprises a core grammar covering linguistic phenomena that are posited to be universal (e.g. semantic compo-sitionality) and a set of libraries providing analyses for phenomena that vary across languages (e.g. case).",
        "These resources are developed in the context of HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2005), and the LKB grammar development environment (Copestake, 2002).",
        "Previous to the work reported here, the Grammar Matrix customization system did not handle argument optionality – the possibility of leaving arguments unexpressed in lieu of overt pronouns.",
        "This phenomenon, also called pro-drop, argument drop, or null instantiation, is extremely common: according to Dryer (2008), 79% of the 674 languages sampled cannot or do not normally use independent pronouns in subject position.",
        "Accordingly, adding it to the customization system improves the system's ability to handle a large class of core sentences in many languages.",
        "For example, in Modern Standard Arabic [arb] (Semitic), overt pronominal subjects are dropped in non-emphatic contexts.",
        "Previously, the system was able to model only the longer variant of (1).",
        "She slept.",
        "[arb]",
        "Furthermore, there was no way to adequately account for languages such as Hausa [hau] (Chadic) which do not allow overt simple pronominal subjects and prohibit overt objects after certain verb forms.",
        "The grammar would predict the opposite grammaticality for the examples in (2).",
        "I know the answer.",
        "[hau]",
        "It might seem that these facts could be handled by adding a rule that allows arguments to be dropped if an appropriate option is checked in the customization system.",
        "However, the data from Arabic and Hausa suggest that such an approach would be insufficient, as languages place different constraints on the contexts in which overt arguments are required or prohibited.",
        "In §2 we discuss the broad range of typological variation in argument optionality in the world's languages.",
        "In §3 we offer a set of HPSG analyses for these patterns.",
        "§4 explains how these analyses were incorporated into the Grammar Matrix customization system and integrated with the existing libraries.",
        "We then present the results of a three-tiered evaluation of the implemented system in §5.",
        "The results demonstrate that the system is capable of accurately modeling the attested syntactic argument optionality patterns exhibited by a typologically diverse group of languages as well as the currently unattested but logically possible co-occurrence restrictions on affixes and overt arguments.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first such system.",
        "The paper closes with a brief look at how the library could be extended even further to capture the range of semantic distinctions."

      "heading": "2. Typological Patterns",
      "text": [
        "The typological literature shows that argument optionality is extremely common: Dryer (2008) found that of 674 geographically and genetically diverse languages, only 141 normally or obligatorily used independent pronominal subjects.",
        "Dryer distinguishes 4 categories in the remaining 533 languages, corresponding to how information about the person, number, and gender (PNG) of the subject is encoded: affixation on the verb, clitics on variable hosts, no encoding, or a mixed strategy.",
        "In addition, there are other dimensions in which languages vary, e.g., constraints on contexts in which dropping is done (see (1)-(2)).",
        "Although we were unable to find a similar comprehensive survey of unexpressed objects, there is evidence to suggest that it too may be very widespread.",
        "In particular, lexically-licensed object dropping seems to be very common.",
        "Even English, which has a very strong preference for overt subjects, can be analyzed as licensing lexically-based object dropping (Fillmore, 1986).",
        "As with subject dropping, we also found a number of different co-occurrence restrictions on the presence of verbal affixes and overt objects.",
        "Some languages always encode the PNG of an object on the verb, others optionally do so if an overt object is present and obligatorily do so if one is not, while still others do not encode this information at all.",
        "Drawing on work by Dryer and others, Table 1 summarizes the 6 major dimensions along which the rules licensing argument dropping differ.",
        "The first constraint is syntactic context.",
        "Most languages that license argument dropping do so regardless of tense/aspect, mood, or person.",
        "Finnish [fin] and Hebrew [heb] are two notable exceptions (Vainikka and Levy, 1999).",
        "The second constraint, lexically-based licensing, is most commonly found in object dropping.",
        "For example, while English usually prohibits argument dropping, it arguably licenses it with verbs such as 'found out', 'agree', and 'promise' (Fillmore, 1986).",
        "Lexically-based subject drop is found in Tamil [tam], which generally licenses subject dropping aside from some weather related verbs (Asher, 1985).",
        "The third constraint, noun phrase type, captures the difference between a language such as Hausa which generally prohibits independent pronouns from appearing as subjects and other languages, which allow pronouns in subject position (possibly with emphatic interpretations).",
        "The fourth constraint concerns the position of PNG markers.",
        "Of the languages with subject PNG markers and subject dropping, many encode subject PNG as a verbal affix.",
        "This pattern is exhibited by such geographically and genetically diverse languages as Spanish [spa], Arabic [arb], West Greenlandic [kal], Tamil [tam], and Nkore-Kiga [nyn].",
        "Other languages such as Chemehuevi [ute], Polish [pol], and Warlpiri [wbp] make use of a clitic which can attach to different types of hosts (Dryer, 2008).",
        "The final two constraints concern cooccurrence restrictions between PNG markers and overt objects.",
        "In some Bantu languages such as Nkore-Kiga, a verbal affix is not used unless the object precedes the verb or is pronominal.",
        "Object markers are not used when a full NP follows the verb (Taylor, 1985).",
        "In written French [fra], verbal affixes are required if an object is dropped and not permitted if it is overt.",
        "In Arabic, for most transitive verbs, an object marker is required if an object is dropped and is optional if it is present.",
        "Hausa exhibits a more complex pattern: for tenses in which the verbal affix denoting PNG is morphologically separable from the tense marker, the PNG affix is optional if an overt noun phrase is present and required if it is not (Newman, 2000).",
        "Noting these differences led us to posit that when an argument is dropped, there are three possibilities.",
        "A verbal affix can be: not permitted, optional, or required.",
        "The same three possibilities exist for overt objects as well.",
        "Combining what happens when an argument is dropped with what happens when it is present, gives us nine logically possible co-occurrence patterns.",
        "Our review of the typological literature has shown that languages place different constraints on argument dropping.",
        "These constraints can be lexical, syntactic, or related to affixation and affix/overt-argument co-occurrence restrictions."

        "This section presents HPSG analyses modeling the six dimensions of variation described in §2.",
        "HPSG models natural language by positing lexical entries, lexical rules, and phrase structure rules, all described in terms of feature structures.",
        "A central idea, inspired by earlier work in Categorial Grammar (Ajdukiewicz, 1935; Bar-Hillel, 1953), is the notion of valence features.",
        "These list-valued features (including SUBJ and COMP S) contain information about the dependents required by a head.",
        "The valence lists are projected up the tree within the domain of each head, but shortened as the dependents are realized.",
        "A sentence is thus a verbal projection with empty SUBJ and COMPS lists.",
        "In this context, argument dropping is the shortening of a valence list without the overt realization of the argument.",
        "Formally, this can be accomplished in at least three different ways: (1) In the mapping of arguments from the ARG-ST (argument structure) feature to the valence lists, one or more arguments can be suppressed, (2) lexical rules can operate on the valence lists, shortening them, or (3) unary (non-branching) phrase structure rules can cancel off valence elements.",
        "In this work, we take the third approach, as we find it affords us the most flexibility to deal with variations across languages in constraints on argument optionality, while promoting similarity of analyses across languages.",
        "We control the applicability of the unary-branching rules with the boolean feature OPT, marked on elements of valence lists.",
        "For languages which allow subject/object dropping, we instantiate new phrase structure rules: head-opt-subj-phrase and/or head-opt-comp-phrase.",
        "These rules allow the head verb to satisfy a valence requirement without combining with another expression.",
        "To undergo these rules, the head daughter (the verb) must specify that the argument that is to be dropped is compatible with [OPT +].",
        "This is sufficient to account for many languages.",
        "However, to ensure that languages which have lexical, syntactic context, and affix co-occurrence restrictions do not overgenerate, further additions to the grammar are necessary.",
        "For lexical and affix-co-occurrence restrictions, we prevent overgeneration by manipulating the OPT feature.",
        "In languages which only license argument dropping for certain lexical items, we force those verbs which do not allow argument dropping to have arguments that are constrained to be [OPT – ].",
        "This prevents them from undergoing the subject/object dropping rules.",
        "Verbs are then classified into four different types based on whether or not they allow subject and/or object dropping.",
        "Individual lexical items instantiate these types.",

        "Languages with complex affix co-occurrence restrictions are modeled by manipulating the op t feature in a different way: Constraints are placed on lexical and phrase structure rules, as well as on lexical types.",
        "In particular, we constrain the rules which combine verbs with overt arguments to check that that argument position is compatible with [opt – ].",
        "This allows the lexical rules attaching the afixes to constrain the optionality of the corresponding argument position.",
        "In some of the nine logical possibilities, enforcing these constraints requires sending the verb through \"no-marker\" lexical rules so that constraints associated with markerless verbs can be enforced.",

        "The irst column of this table lists the nine logically possible combinations described in §2.",

        "Each of the phenomena correspond to a page of the questionnaire.",
        "As the user answers questions, the choices are saved in a 'choices' file.",
        "The questionnaire is dynamic and the answers contained in the 'choices' ile affect the types of features that the user is able to choose from on subsequent pages.",
        "For example, if the user describes the language as having 1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons on the Person page, then on the lexicon page, the user can create separate noun types for each person.",
        "Once the 'choices' ile contains responses to required sections, the user is able to create the customized starter grammar by clicking on the 'create grammar' button.",
        "This invokes the customization script which uses the responses contained in the ile to create a grammar that is compatible with the lkb grammar development environment.",
        "Our implementation entailed additions to two major components of the system: the web-based questionnaire and the customization script.",
        "To determine which, if any, of the analyses presented in §3 should be included in the customized grammar, we needed to elicit the type of argument optionality pattern the language exhibited.",
        "Thus, we added an Argument Optionality page to the questionnaire.",
        "The page is divided into two sections – one for subject dropping and one for object dropping.",
        "In the section on subject dropping, the user is asked whether subject dropping exists and if so, whether it is context-dependent.",
        "For context-dependent subject dropping, the user is allowed to specify the syntactic contexts in which subject dropping is licensed by choosing from a multi-select list of features.",
        "There is the option to create multiple contexts.",
        "The features that appear in the list are drawn from those that the user chose on previous pages in the questionnaire.",

        "The questions presented in the object dropping section are identical to those in the subject dropping section with the exception that there is no question about context-dependent object dropping.",
        "Since some of the constraints must be placed on individual lexical items and morphological rules, the page also includes instructions to the user on additional steps that need to be taken when completing the Lexicon page.",
        "For example, when describing a language where afixes are optional if an argument is dropped and not permitted if an overt argument is present, users are instructed to select 'overt-arg-not-permitted' for those afixes on the Lexicon page.",

        "The three stages differed in the nature of the languages, the method by which the languages were selected, and the breadth of the customized grammars.",
        "The test suites are small, as they are speciically targeted at the phenomenon of argument optionality, but representative in the sense that they cover the space of relevant contrasts in each language.",
        "In the irst stage, we tested the analyses presented in §3 by creating and then using the GrammarMa-trix customization system to generate grammars for 38 pseudo-languages (sets of strings with associated grammaticality assignments) which collectively exhaustively exhibit each of the lexical, syntactic context or afix co-occurrence restriction patterns described in Table 1 (§2).",

        "Our current work has focused on modeling the variation in syntactic constraints on the licensing and restriction of argument dropping.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of argument optionality that combines typological breadth with precision analyses that have been implemented and tested on a number of geographically and genetically diverse languages.",
        "Although we have tried to account for the patterns found in the typological literature, there may be variants that we are unaware of.",
        "We hope to learn of more patterns as the Grammar Matrix customization sysargument optionality in six languages tem is applied to an ever wider set languages.",
        "While the current work focuses on syntactic variation, we intend to expand the argument optionality library to include semantic distinctions as well.",
        "A likely starting point would be the proposal given by Bender and Goss-Grubbs (2008) who present a way to model the discourse status (Prince, 1981) of an NP taking into account the differences between definite and indefinite null instantiation described by Fillmore (1986).",
        "In addition, ongoing work to improve the word order library may eventually allow us to more accurately model word-order based constraints."
