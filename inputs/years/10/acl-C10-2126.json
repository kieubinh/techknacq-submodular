        "Two problems in sentiment analysis consist of source attribution and target discovery – who has an opinion, and about what?",
        "These problems are usually presented in terms of techniques that relate them to the actual opinion expressed.",
        "We have a social science application in which the identification of sources and targets over a large volume of text is more important than identifying the actual opinions particularly in experimenting with social science models of opinion trends.",
        "Consequently, we are able to use lightweight techniques to identify sources and targets without using resource-intensive techniques to identify opinionated phrases.",
        "Our application for this work is the discovery of networks of influence among opinion leaders in the IT field.",
        "We are interested in answering questions about who the leaders in the field are and how their opinion matches the social and economic success of IT innovation.",
        "Consequently, it became necessary for us to construct a system (figure 1) that finds the expressions in text that refer to an opinion leader's activities in promoting or deprecating a technology.",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate an information extraction (Mooney and Bunescu, 2005) approach based in relation mining (Girju et al., 2007) that is effective for this purpose.",
        "We describe a technique by which corpus statistics allow us to classify pairs of entities and sentiment analysis targets as instances of an \"expresses-an-opinion-about\" relation in documents in the IT business press.",
        "This genre has the characteristic that many entities and targets are represented within individual sentences and paragraphs.",
        "Features based on the frequency counts of query results allow us to train classifiers that allow us to extract \"expresses-an-opinion-about\" instances, using a very simple annotation strategy to acquire training examples.",
        "In the IT business press, the opinionated language is different from the newswire text for which many extant sentiment tools were developed.",
        "We use an existing sentiment lexicon alongside other non-sentiment-specific measures that adapt resources from newswire-developed sentiment analysis projects without imposing the full complexity of those techniques.",
        "The \"expresses-an-opinion-about\" relation is a binary relation between opinion sources and targets.",
        "Sources include both people – typically known experts, corporate representatives, and other businesspeople – as well as organizations such as corporations and government bodies.",
        "The targets are the innovation terms.",
        "Therefore, the use of named-entity recognition in this project only focuses on persons and organizations, as the targets are a fixed list.",
        "A hypothesis implicit in our social science task is that opinion leaders create trends in IT innovation adoption partly by the text that their activities generate in the IT business press.",
        "This text has an effect on readers, and these readers act in such a way that in turn may generate more or less prominence for a given innovation – and may also generate further text.",
        "Some of these text-generating activities include expressions of private states in an opinion source (e.g., \"I believe that Web 2.0 is the future\").",
        "These kinds of expressions suggest a particular ontology of opinion analysis involving discourse relations across various types of clauses (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005; Wilson et al., 2005a).",
        "However, if we are to track the relative adoption of IT innovations, we must take into account the effect of the text on the reader's opinion about these innovations – there are expressions other than those of private states that have an effect on the reader.",
        "These can be considered to be \"opinionated acts.\"",
        "Opinionated acts can include things like purchasing and adoption decisions by organizations.",
        "For example:",
        "And like other top suppliers to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., BP has been involved in a mandate to affix radio frequency identification tags with embedded electronic product codes to its crates and pallets.",
        "(ComputerWorld, January 2005)",
        "In this case, both Wal-Mart and BP have expressed implicit approval for radio frequency identification by adopting it.",
        "This may affect the reader's own likelihood of support or adoption of the technology.",
        "In this context, we do not directly consider the subjectivity of the opinion source, even though that may be present.",
        "Opinionated acts include things like implications of technology use, not just adoption.",
        "We thus define opinion expressions as follows: any expression involving some actor that is likely to affect a reader's own potential to adopt, reject, or speak positively or negatively of a target.",
        "This would include \"conventional\" expressions of private states as well as opinionated acts.",
        "Our definition of \"expresses-an-opinion-about\" follows immediately.",
        "Source A expresses an opinion about target B if an interested third party C's actions towards B may be affected by A's textually recorded actions, in a context where actions have positive or negative weight (e.g. purchasing, promotion, etc.",
        ").",
        "We construct a system that uses named-entity recognition and supervised machine learning via SVMs to automatically discover instances of \"expresses-an-opinion-about\" as a binary relation at reasonably high accuracy and precision.",
        "The advantage of our approach is that, outside of HMM-based named-entity detection (BBN's IdentiFinder), we evade the need for resource-intensive techniques such as sophsticated grammatical models, sequence models, and semantic role labelling (Choi et al., 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006) by removing the focus on the actual opinion expressed.",
        "Then we can use a simple supervised discriminative technique with a joint model of local term frequency information and corpus-wide co-occurrence distributions in order to discover the raw data for opinion trend modelling.",
        "The most complex instrument we use from sentiment analysis research on conventional newswire is a sentiment keyword lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005b); furthermore, our techniques allow us to distinguish sentiment keywords that indicate opinion in this domain from keywords that actually indicate that there is no opinion relation between source and target.",
        "While we show that this lightweight technique works well at a paragraph level, it can also be used in conjunction with more resource-intensive techniques used to find \"conventional\" opinion expressions.",
        "Also, the use of topic aspects (Soma-sundaran and Wiebe, 2009) in conjunction with target names has been associated with an improvement in recall.",
        "However, our technique still performs well above the baseline without these improvements."

        "We have a list of IT innovations on which our opinion leader research effort is most closely focused.",
        "This list contains common names that refer to these technologies as well as some alternate names and abbreviations.",
        "We selected articles at random from the ComputerWorld IT journal that contained mentions of members of the given list.",
        "These direct mentions were tagged in the document as XML entities.",
        "Each article was processed by BBN's Identi-Finder 3.3 (Bikel et al., 1999), a named entity recognition (NER) system that tags named mentions of person and organization entities.",
        "The articles were then divided into paragraphs.",
        "For each paragraph, we generated candidate relations from the entities and innovations mentioned therein.",
        "To generate candidates, we paired every entity in the paragraph with every innovation.",
        "Redundant pairs are sometimes generated when an entity is mentioned in multiple ways in the paragraph.",
        "We eliminated most of these by removing entities whose mentions were substrings of other mentions.",
        "For example, \"Microsoft\" and \"Microsoft Corp.\" are sometimes found in the same paragraph; we eliminate \"Microsoft.\"",
        "We processed 20 documents containing 157 relations in the manner described in the previous section.",
        "Then two domain experts (chosen from the authors) annotated every candidate pair in every document according to the following scheme (illustrated in figure 2):",
        "• If the paragraph associated with the candidate pair describes a valid source-target relation, the experts annotated it with Y.",
        "• If the paragraph does not actually contain that source-target relation, the experts annotated it with N.",
        "• If either the source or the target is misidentified (e.g., errors in named entity recognition), the experts annotated it with X.",
        "The Cohen's k score was 0.6 for two annotators.",
        "While this appears to be only moderate agreement, we are still able to achieve good performance in our experiments with this value.",
        "Davis says she has especially enjoyed working with the PowerPad's bluetooth interfaces to phones and printers.",
        "\"It s nice getting into new wireless technology,\" she says.",
        "The bluetooth capability will allow couriers to transmit data without docking their devices in their trucks.",
        "We then selected 75 different documents for each annotator and processed and annotated them as above.",
        "At this point we have the instances and the classes to which they belong.",
        "We labelled 466 instances of Y, 325 instances of N, and 280 instances of X, for a total of 1071 relations.",
        "We have four classes of features for every relation instance.",
        "Each type of feature consists of counts extracted from an index of77,227 ComputerWorld articles from January 1988 to June 2008 generated by the University of Massachusetts search engine Indri (Metzler and Croft, 2004).",
        "Each vector is normalized to the unit vector.",
        "The index is not stemmed for performance reasons.",
        "The first type of feature consists of simple document frequency statistics for source-target pairs throughout the corpus.",
        "The second type consists of document frequency counts of source-target pairs when they are in particularly close proximity to one another.",
        "The third type consists of document frequency counts of source target pairs proximate to keywords that reflect subjectivity.",
        "The fourth and final type consist of TFIDF scores of vocabulary items in the paragraph containing the putative opinion-holding relation (unigram context features).",
        "We use the first three features types to represent the likelihood in the \"world\" that the source has an opinion about the target and the last feature type to represent the likelihood of the specific paragraph containing an opinion that reflects the source-target relation.",
        "We have a total of 7450 features.",
        "Each vector is represented as a sparse array.",
        "806 features represent queries on the Indri index.",
        "For all the features, we therefore have 863,226 index queries.",
        "We perform the queries in parallel on 25 processors to generate the full feature array, which takes approximately an hour on processors running at 8Ghz.",
        "We eliminate all values that are smaller in magnitude than 0.000001 after unit vector normalization.",
        "There are two simple frequency statistics features generated from Indri queries.",
        "The first is the raw frequency counts of within-document cooccurrences of the source and target in the relation.",
        "The second is the mean co-occurrence frequency of the source and target per ComputerWorld document.",
        "For every relation, we query Indri to check how often the source and the target appear in the same document in the ComputerWorld corpus within four word ranges: 5, 25, 100, and 500.",
        "That is to say, if a source and a target appear within five words of one another, this is included in the five-word proximity feature.",
        "This generates four features per relation.",
        "We augment the proximity counts feature with a third requirement: that the source and target appear within one of the ranges with a \"subjectivity keyword.\"",

        "Subjectivity keyword features dominated the ranks of feature weights under a linear kernel, and the features most predictive of membership in \"expresses-an-opinion-about\" are words with semantic significance in the context of the IT business press.",

        "We used somewhat naive statistics in a simple machine learning system in order to implement a form of opinion mining for a particular domain.",
        "The most direct linguistic guidance we provided our system were the query ranges and the subjectivity lexicon.",
        "The generality of this approach yields the advantage that it can be applied to other domains where there are ways of expressing sentiment unique to those domains outside ofnewswire text and product reviews.",
        "Our use of an existing sentiment lexicon opens the door in future work for the use of techniques to bootstrap a larger sentiment lexicon that emphasizes domain-specific language in the expression of opinion, including opinionated acts.",
        "In fact, our results suggest that terminology in the existing lexicon that is most prominently weighted in our classifier also tends to be domain-relevant.",
        "In a further iteration, we might also improve performance by using terms outside the lexicon that tend to co-occur with terms from the lexicon.",
        "Our annotation exercise was a very simple one involving a short reading exercise and the selection of one of three choices per relation instance.",
        "This type of exercise is ideally suited to the \"crowd-sourcing\" technique of paying many individuals small amounts of money to perform these simple annotations over the Internet.",
        "Previous research (Snow et al., 2008) suggests that we can generate very large datasets very quickly in this way; this is a requirement for expanding to other domains.",
        "In order to classify on the order of 1000 instances, it took nearly a million queries to the Indri index, which took a little over an hour to do in parallel on 25 processors by calling the Indri query engine afresh at each query.",
        "While each query is necessary to generate each feature value, there are a number of optimizations we could implement to accelerate the process.",
        "Various types of dynamic programming and caching could be used to handle related queries.",
        "One way of scaling up to larger datasets would be to use the MapReduce and cloud computing paradigms on which text processing tools have already been implemented (Moreira et al., 2007).",
        "The application for this research is a social science exercise in exploring trends in IT adoption by analysing the IT business press.",
        "In the end, the perfect discovery of all instances of \"expresses-an-opinion-about\" is not as important as finding enough reliable data over a large number of documents.",
        "This work brings us several steps closer in finding the right combination of features in order to acquire trend-representative data."
