        "Sentiment analysis is an important topic in computational linguistics that is of theoretical interest but is also useful in many practical applications.",
        "Usually, two aspects are of importance in sentiment analysis.",
        "The first is the detection of subjectivity, i.e., whether a text or an expression is meant to express sentiment at all; the second is the determination of sentiment orientation, i.e., what sentiment is to be expressed in a structure that is considered subjective.",
        "Work on sentiment analysis most often covers resources or analysis methods in a single language, usually English.",
        "However, the transfer of sentiment analysis between languages can be advantageous by making use of resources for a source language to improve the analysis ofthe target language.",
        "This paper presents an approach to the transfer of sentiment information between two languages that does not rely on resources with limited availability like parallel corpora.",
        "It is built around Sim-Rank, a graph similarity algorithm that has successfully been applied to the acquisition of bilingual lexicons (Laws et al., 2010) and semantic similarity (Michelbacher et al., 2010).",
        "It uses linguistic relations extracted from two monolingual corpora to determine the similarity of words in different languages.",
        "One of the main benefits of our method is its ability to handle sparse data about the relations between the languages well (i.e., a small seed lexicon).",
        "Further, we experiment with combining multiple types of linguistic relations for graph-based translation.",
        "Our experiments are carried out using English as a source language and German as a target language.",
        "We evaluate our method using a hand-annotated set of German adjectives which we intend to publish.",
        "In the following section, related work is discussed.",
        "Section 3.1 gives an introduction to Sim-Rank and its application to lexicon induction, while section 3.2 reviews SO-PMI (Turney, 2002), an unsupervised baseline method for the generation of sentiment lexicons.",

        "Since 0.5 is slightly positive, we do not believe that values above it are plausible.",
        "Then, each word w is positive if its human rating scoreh(w) > x, negative if scoreh(w) < – x, and neutral if – x < scoreh(w) < x.",

        "We demonstrated that SO-PMI is outperformed by SimRank when choosing a reasonable region of neutral adjectives.",
        "In addition, we showed that the improvements of SimRank lead to better accuracy in sentiment translation in some cases.",
        "In future work, we will apply a sentiment lexicon generated with SimRank in a sentiment classification task for reviews.",
        "The algorithms we compared are different in their purpose of application.",
        "While SO-PMI is applicable when large corpora are available for a language, it fails when used in a sparse-data situation, as noted by Turney (2002).",
        "We showed that despite reducing the seed lexicon for SimRank to a small fraction of its original size, it still performs better than SO-PMI.",
        "Currently, our experiments are limited by the choice of using adjectives for our test set.",
        "While the examination of adjectives is highly important for sentiment analysis (as shown by Pang et al.",
        "(2002) who were able to achieve high accuracy even when using only adjectives), the application of our algorithms to a broader set of linguistic units is an important goal for future work.",
