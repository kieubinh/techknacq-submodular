        "Generally, to compare the effectiveness of information retrieval systems, we need to prepare a test collection composed of a set of documents, a set of query topics, and a set of relevance judgments indicating which documents are relevant to which topics.",
        "Among these requirements, relevance judgment is the most human resource exhausting and time consuming part.",
        "It even becomes infeasible when the test collection is extremely large.",
        "To address this problem, the TREC conferences used a pooling technology (Voorhees and Harman, 1999), where the top n (e.g., n=100) documents retrieved by each participating system are collected into a pool and then only the documents in the pool are judged for system comparison.",
        "Zobel (1998) has shown that this pooling method leads to reliable results in term of determining the effectiveness of retrieval systems and their relative rankings.",
        "Yet, the relevance determination process is still very resource intensive especially when the test collection reaches or exceeds terabyte, or much more queries are included.",
        "More seriously, when we change to a new document collection, we have to redo the entire evaluation process.",
        "There are two possible solutions to the problem above, evaluation with incomplete relevance judgments and evaluation without relevance judgments.",
        "The former is well studied.",
        "Many well designed ranking methods with incomplete judgments were carried out.",
        "Two of them, Minimal Test Collection (MTC) method (Carterette et al., 2006) and Statistical evaluation (statMAP) method (Aslam et al., 2006), even got practical application in the Million Query (1MQ) track in TREC 2007 (Allan et al., 2007), and achieved satisfactory evaluation performance.",
        "The latter is comparatively less studied.",
        "Only a few papers concentrate on the issue of evaluating retrieval systems without relevance judgments.",
        "In Section 2 of this paper, we will briefly review some representative methods.",
        "We will see what they are and how they work.",
        "In this paper, we focus our effort on the retrieval evaluation without relevance judgments.",
        "Although 'blind' evaluation is really a hard problem and its evaluation performance is far less than that of methods with incomplete judgments, it is undeniable that non-judgment evaluation has its own advantages.",
        "In some cases, relevance judgments are non-attainable.",
        "For example, when researchers compare their novel retrieval algorithms to existing methods, or search for optimal parameters of their algorithms, or conduct data fusion in a dynamic environment, relevance judgment usually seems impossible.",
        "Besides, to construct a good evaluation method without relevance judgments, researchers need to mine the retrieval results thoroughly, and try to find laws that indicate the correlation between the effectiveness of a system and features of its retrieval result.",
        "These laws are not only useful for 'blind' evaluation methods but also valuable for evaluation methods with incomplete judgments.",
        "One of the useful laws for 'blind' evaluation methods is Authority Effect (Spoerri, 2005).",
        "Yet it always ruined by multiple similar results.",
        "In this work, we use clustering technique to solve this problem.",
        "By selecting one system to represent all the systems that are similar to it, we can largely reduce the negative effect of similar retrieval results.",
        "Details of this method will be presented Section 3.",
        "Experimental results, which are reported in Section 4, also verified that our idea is feasible and effective.",
        "Our method outperformed all the previous judgment free evaluation methods on every test bed.",
        "The overall average performance outperformed the best previous result by 20.5%.",
        "Finally, we conclude our work in Section 5."

        "In 2001, Soboroff et al.",
        "(2001) firstly proposed the concept of evaluating retrieval systems in the absence of relevance judgments.",
        "They generated a set of pseudo-relevance judgments by randomly selecting and declaring some documents from the pool of top 100 documents as relevant.",
        "This set of pseudo-relevance judgments (instead of a set of human relevance judgments) was then used to determine the effectiveness of the retrieval systems.",
        "Four versions of this random pseudo-relevance method were designed and tested on data from the ad hoc track in TREC 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8.",
        "They were simple random pseudo-relevance method, the variant with duplicate documents, the variant with Shallow pools and the variant with Exact-fraction sampling.",
        "All their resulting system assessments and rankings were well correlated with actual TREC rankings, and the variant with duplicate documents in pools got the best performance, with an average Kendall's tau value 0.50 over the data of TREC 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8.",
        "Soboroff et al.",
        "'s idea came from two results in retrieval evaluation.",
        "One is that incomplete judgments do not harm evaluation results greatly.",
        "Zobel's (1998) research had showed that the results obtained using pooling technology were quite reliable given a pool depth of 100.",
        "He also found that even though the pool depth was limited to 10, the relative performance among systems changed little, although actual precision scores did change for some systems.",
        "The other is that partially incorrect relevance judgments do not harm evaluation results greatly.",
        "Voorhees (1998) ascertained that despite a low average overlap between assessment sets, and wide variation in overlap among particular topics, the relative rankings of systems remained largely unchanged across the different sets of relevance judgments.",
        "These two points are bases of Soboroff et al.",
        "'s random pseudo-relevance method, and give explanation to the result that their rankings were positively related to that of the actual TRECs.",
        "As a matter of fact, the two points are bases of all the retrieval evaluation methods without or with incomplete relevance judgments.",
        "Aslam and Savell (2003) devised a method to measure the relative retrieval effectiveness of systems through system similarity computation.",
        "In their work, the similarity between two retrieval systems was the ratio of the number of documents in their intersection and union.",
        "Each system was scored by the average similarity between it and all other systems.",
        "This measurement produced results that were highly correlated with the random pseudo-relevance method.",
        "Aslam and Savell hypothesized that this was caused by 'tyranny of the masses' effect, and these two related methods were assessing the systems based on 'popularity' instead of 'performance'.",
        "The analysis by Spoerri (2005) suggested that the 'popularity' effect was caused by considering all the runs submitted by a retrieval system, instead of only selecting one run per system.",
        "Our later experimental results will show that this point of view is partially correct.",
        "The 'popularity' effect could not be avoided completely by only selecting one run per system.",
        "This is indeed a hard problem for all the evaluation methods without relevance judgments.",
        "Wu and Crestani (2003) developed multiple 'reference count' based methods to rank retrieval systems.",
        "They made the distinction between an 'original' document and its duplicates in all other lists, called the 'reference' documents, when computing a document's score.",
        "A system's score is the (weighted) sum of the scores of its 'original' documents.",
        "Several versions of reference count method were carried out and tested.",
        "The basic method (Basic) scored each 'original' document by the number of its 'reference' documents.",
        "The first variant (V1) assigned different weights to 'reference' documents based on their ranking positions.",
        "The second variant (V2) assigned different weights to the 'original' document based on its ranking position.",
        "The third variant (V3) assigned different weights to both the 'original' documents and the 'reference' documents based on their ranking positions.",
        "The fourth variant (V4) was similar to V3, except that it normalized the weights to 'reference' documents.",
        "Wu and Crestani's method output similar evaluation performance to that of the random pseudo-relevance method.",
        "Their work also showed that the similarity between the multiple runs submitted by the same retrieval system affected the ranking process.",
        "If only one run was selected for any of the participant system for any query, for 3-9 systems, V3 outperformed random pseudo-relevance method by 45.6%; for 10-15 systems, random pseudo-relevance method outperformed V3 by 6.5%.",
        "Nuray and Can (2006) introduced a method to rank retrieval systems automatically using data fusion.",
        "Their method consists of two parts.",
        "One is selecting systems for data fusion, and the other is selecting documents as pseudo relevant documents as the fusion result.",
        "In the former part, they hypothesized that systems returning documents different from the majority could provide better discrimination among the documents and systems.",
        "In return, this could lead to a more accurate pseudo relevant documents and more accurate rankings.",
        "To find proper systems, they introduced the 'bias' concept for system selection.",
        "In their work, bias was 1 minus the similarity between a system and the majority, where the similarity is a normalized dot product of two vectors.",
        "In the latter part, Nuray and Can tested three criterions, namely Rank position, Borda count and Condorcet.",
        "Experimental results on data from TREC 3, 5, 6 and 7 showed that bias plus Condorcet got the best evaluation results and it outperformed the reference count method and random pseudo relevance method greatly.",
        "More recently, Spoerri (2007) proposed a method using the structure of overlap between search results to rank retrieval systems.",
        "This method provides us a new view on how to rank retrieval systems without relevance judgments.",
        "He used local statistics of retrieval results as indicators of relative effectiveness of retrieval systems.",
        "Concretely, if there are N systems to be ranked, N groups are constructed randomly with the constraint that each group contains five systems and each system will appear in five groups; then the percentages of a system's documents not found by other systems (Single%) as well as the difference between the percentages of documents found by a single system and all five systems (Single%-AllFive%) are calculated as indicators of relative effectiveness respectively.",
        "Spoerri found that these two local statistics were highly and negatively correlated with the mean average precision and precision at 1000 scores of the systems.",
        "By utilizing the two statistics to rank systems from subsets of TREC 3, 6, 7 and 8, Spoerri obtained appealing evaluation results.",
        "The overlap structure of the top 50 documents were sufficient to rank retrieval systems and produced the best results, which outperformed previous attempts to rank retrieval systems without relevance judgments significantly.",
        "So far, we have reviewed 5 representatives of non-judgment evaluation methods.",
        "All these methods faced the same serious problem: similar runs harmed the effectiveness of ranking process.",
        "Different methods handled this problem differently.",
        "Aslam and Savell (2003) called this the 'tyranny of the masses' and provided no solution.",
        "Wu and Crestani (2003) addressed this problem by selecting only one run for any of the participant system for any query.",
        "Nuray and Can (2006) selected systems that were less similar to the majority for data fusion.",
        "Spoerri (2007) performed his method on a selected subset of all the systems.",
        "All these treatments led to evaluation performance improvement.",
        "Yet we will say it could be improved more.",
        "In the next section, we will present a new solution to this problem.",
        "Its performance is examined in Section 4.",
        "3 Using Clustering to Improve Retrieval Evaluation without Relevance Judgments",
        "As we reviewed in Section 2, previous research had shown that incomplete relevance judgments and partially incorrect relevance judgments do not harm retrieval evaluation greatly.",
        "This is why pooling technique can lead to reliable retrieval evaluation results.",
        "It is also the theoretical foundation of evaluation without relevance judgments.",
        "Besides, non-judgments methods armed with more laws inside retrieval results.",
        "These laws indicate the correlation between retrieval effectiveness of a system and features in its retrieval results.",
        "One of the most important laws used in non-judgments evaluation is Authority Effect (Spoerri, 2005): document, which is retrieval by more systems, is more likely being relevant.",
        "Unfortunately, similar retrieval results ruined this law.",
        "Aslam and Savell (2003) called this the 'tyranny of the masses'.",
        "So, how to alleviate the negative effect of similar retrieval results is a big issue in non-judgments evaluation.",
        "Generally, our solution to the 'tyranny of the masses' is removing similar systems by clustering.",
        "The whole process is as follows:",
        "Firstly, all systems to be evaluated are clustered into several subsets.",
        "Secondly, for each subset, one system is selected as a representative.",
        "Thirdly, all the information used for system evaluation comes from these representatives.",
        "Finally, score every system according to the information collected in the previous step.",
        "This is the general framework of our methodology.",
        "Notice that, in the third step, only selected systems contribute to the information required for system evaluation.",
        "So we can eliminate the negative effect caused by similar retrieval results.",
        "This solution can be applied to any method of retrieval evaluation without relevance judgments.",
        "To illustrate how to apply it to a retrieval evaluation method, we will describe using clustering to improve Average System Similarity, which is proposed by Aslam and Savell (2003), in detail as an example.",
        "In Aslam and Savell's (2003) method, each system is evaluated based on a criterion named Average System Similarity.",
        "The average system similarity of a given system S0 is calculated according to formula (1).",
        "AvgSysSim(S 0) where n is the number of systems to be evaluated, and similarity between two systems S and S0, SysSim(S, S0), is calculated based on formula (2).",
        "Ret1 n Ret2 where Reti indicates the set of documents returned by System i (i = 1, 2).",
        "When applying clustering technique to the system similarity method, we need to define an equivalence relation first.",
        "Definition 1 (System Equivalence): Suppose that all systems are clustered into m clusters namely C1, C2, Cm.",
        "Two systems S1 and S2are equivalent if and only if there exists k (1 < k < m) so that S1 e Ck and S2 e Ck.",
        "Given the definition of System Equivalence, we get the average system similarity based on clustering as follows: AvgSysSim(S 0) where m is the number of clusters and R is the representative system of a cluster.",
        "Replacing formula (1) with formula (4), we get the retrieval evaluation method Average System Similarity Based on Clustering, shortly",
        "ASSBC.",
        "There are two important issues for ASSBC that need to be addressed.",
        "Issue 1: How to select representative system from a cluster?",
        "Issue 2: How to decide the number of clusters we need?",
        "Before we address Issue 1, we introduce another definition, Cluster Similarity.",
        "Definition 2 (Cluster Similarity): for any given two clusters C1 and C2, with their respective representative systems S1 and S2, the cluster similarity between C1 and C2 is the system similarity between S1 and S2.",
        "ClusterSim(C1, C2) = SysSim(S1, S 2 ) (5)",
        "Now we come to selecting representative systems for clusters.",
        "Here, we utilize a hierarchical bottom up clustering technique.",
        "The entire clustering process is as follows.",
        "Initially, each system forms a cluster.",
        "Loop Until the number of clusters is m Two most similar clusters merge, and one of their representatives with higher average system similarity survives as the representative of the new cluster.",
        "End Loop.",
        "In the initial step, since every cluster contains only one system, the representative system is unquestionable.",
        "Within each loop, two representative systems of the old clusters are candidates of the new cluster, and the one with higher score, which means higher retrieval performance, becomes the representative of the new cluster.",
        "For Issue 2, technically, how to decide the number of clusters is always a problem for clustering.",
        "Yet, we do not have to rush in the decision.",
        "Let us examine the evaluation performance on different values of m first."

        "One of the main factors that depress the performance of judgments free evaluation is: similar retrieval results ruined the Authority Effect, which is one of the important bases for all the judgment free evaluation methods.",
        "In this paper, we use clustering technique to address this problem.",
        "By using one system to represent all the systems that are similar to it, we can largely reduce the negative effect of similar retrieval results.",
        "Experimental results also verified our idea.",
        "Our method outperforms all the previous judgment free evaluation methods on every test bed.",
        "The overall average performance outperforms the best previous result",
        "Besides, improving judgment free evaluation via clustering is more than just a method.",
        "It is a general framework that can be applied to any judgment free evaluation method.",
        "The Average System Similarity Based on Clustering method is an example.",
        "It works well means that the framework is feasible and successful.",
        "We will apply it to other judgment free evaluation methods in our future work.",

        "Since we add a terminal criterion for clustering with 14 as the minimum number of clusters, the average performance in Table 3 gains an improvement compared to that presented in Figure 5 and Table 2."
