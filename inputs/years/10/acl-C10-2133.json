        "Conventional information extraction tasks generally aim at extracting finer granularity semantic information units such as entities and relations.",
        "While such detailed information is no doubt very useful, extraction of such information also tends to be difficult especially when the mentions of the entities to be extracted do not conform to regular syntactic patterns.",
        "In this paper, we relax this conventional goal of extraction and study an easier extraction task where we aim at extracting sentences that belong to a set of predefined semantic categories.",
        "That is, we take a sentence as a unit for extraction.",
        "Specifically, we study this problem in the context of extracting medical case description from medical forums.",
        "A variety of medical health forums exist online.",
        "People use them to post their problems, get advices from experienced patients, get second opinions from other doctors, or merely to vent out their frustration.",
        "Compared with well-structured sources such as Wikipedia, forums are more valuable in the sense that they contain first hand patient experiences with richer information in terms of what treatments are better than others and why.",
        "Besides this, on forums, patients explain their symptoms much more freely than those mentioned on relatively formal sources like Wikipedia.",
        "And hence, forums are much more easier to understand for a naïve user.",
        "However, even on targeted forums (which focus on a single disease), data is quite unstructured.",
        "There is therefore a need to structure out this information and present it in a form that can directly be used for a variety of other information extraction applications like the collecting of medical case studies pertaining to a particular disease, mining frequently discussed symptoms, identifying correlation between symptoms and treatments, etc.",
        "A typical medical case description tends to consist of two aspects:",
        "• Physical Examination/Symptoms (PE):",
        "This covers current conditions and includes any condition that is the focus of current discussion.",
        "Note that if a drug causes an allergy, then we consider it as a PE and not a medication.",
        "Any condition that is the focus of conversation, i.e. around which treatments are being proposed or questions are being asked is considered PE even if the user is recounting their past experience.",
        "• Medications (MED): Includes medications the person is currently taking, or is intending to take, or any medication on which the question is targeted.",
        "Medications do not necessarily mean drugs.",
        "Any measures (including avoiding of substances) taken to treat or avoid the symptoms are considered as medication.",
        "Sometimes, users also mention other things like constituents of the drug, how much of the drug to consume at a time, how to get access to a medication, how much it costs, side effects of medications, other qualities of medications etc.",
        "We thus frame the problem of extracting medical case descriptions as extracting sentences that describe any of these two aspects.",
        "Specifically, the task is to identify sentences in each of the two related categories (i.e., PE and MED) from forum posts.",
        "As an extraction task, this task is \"shallower\" than conventional information extraction tasks such as entity extraction in the sense that we extract a sentence as a unit, which makes the extraction task more tractable.",
        "Indeed, the task is more similar to sentence categorization.",
        "However, it also differs from a regular sentence categorization task (e.g., sentiment analysis) in that the multiple categories are usually closely related and categorization of multiple sentences may be dependent in the sense that knowing the category of one sentence may influence our decision about the category of another sentence nearby.",
        "For example, knowing that a sentence is in the category",
        "PE should increase our belief that the next sentence is of category of PE or MED.",
        "We solve the problem using two popular machine learning methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF).",
        "We define and study a large set of features, including two kinds of novel features: (1) novel features based on semantic generalization of terms, and (2) novel features specific to forums.",
        "Since this is a novel task, there is no existing data set that we can use for evaluation.",
        "We thus create a new data set for evaluation.",
        "Experiment results show that both groups of novel features are effective and can improve extraction accuracy.",
        "With the best configurations, we can obtain an accuracy of up to 75%, demonstrating feasibility of automatic extraction of medical case descriptions from forums."

        "In this paper, we studied a novel shallow information extraction task where the goal is to extract relevant sentences to a predefined set of categories that describe a medical case.",
        "We proposed to solve the problem using supervised learning and explored two representative approaches (i.e., CRF and SVM).",
        "We proposed and studied two different types of novel features for this task, including generalized terms and forum structure features.",
        "We also created the first test set for evaluating this problem.",
        "Our experiment results show that (1) the proposed new features are effective for improving the extraction accuracy, and (2) it is feasible to automatically extract medical cases in this way, with the best prediction accuracy above 75%.",
        "Our work can be further extended in several ways.",
        "First, since constructing a test set is laborintensive, we could only afford experimenting with a relatively small data set.",
        "It would be interesting to further test the proposed features on larger data set.",
        "Second, while in CRF, we have shown adding dependency features improves performance, it is unclear how to evaluate this potential benefit with SVM.",
        "Since SVM generally outperforms CRF for this task, it would be very interesting to further explore how we can extend SVM to incorporate dependency."
