        "The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community faces new tasks and new domains all the time.",
        "Without enough labeled data of a new task or a new domain to conduct supervised learning, semi-supervised learning (SSL) is particularly attractive to NLP researchers since it only requires a handful of labeled examples, known as seeds.",
        "SSL starts with these seeds to train an initial model; it then applies this model to a large volume of unlabeled data to get more labeled examples and adds the most confident ones as new seeds to retrain the model.",
        "This iterative procedure has been successfully applied to a variety of NLP tasks, such as hypernym/hyponym extraction (Hearst, 1992), word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), and information extraction (Brin, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Yangarber et al., 2000; Chen and Ji, 2009).",
        "While SSL can give good performance for many tasks, it is a procedure born with two defects.",
        "One is semantic drift.",
        "When SSL is under-constrained, the semantics of newly promoted examples might stray away from the original meaning of seed examples as discussed in (Brin, 1998; Curran et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "For example, a SSL procedure to learn semantic patterns for the LocatedIn relation (PERSON in LOCATION/GPE) might accept patterns for the Employment relation (employee of GPE / ORGANIZATION) because many unlabeled pairs of names are connected by patterns belonging to multiple relations.",
        "Patterns connecting <Bill Clinton, Arkansas> include LocatedIn patterns such as \"visit\", \"arrive in\" and \"fly to\", but also patterns indicating other relations such as \"governor of\", \"born in\", and \"campaign in\".",
        "Similar analyses can be applied to many other examples such as <Bush, Texas> and <Schwarzenegger, California>.",
        "Without careful design, SSL procedures usually accept bogus examples during certain iterations and hence the learning quality degrades.",
        "The other shortcoming of SSL is its lack of natural stopping criteria.",
        "Most SSL algorithms either run a fixed number of iterations (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) or run against a separate labeled test set to find the best stopping criterion (Abney, 2008).",
        "The former solution needs a human to keep eyeballing the learning quality of different iterations and set ad-hoc thresholds accordingly.",
        "The latter requires a separate labeled test set for each new task or domain.",
        "They make SSL less appealing than it could be since the intention of using SSL is to minimize supervision.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework which can automatically monitor the semantic drift and find a natural stopping criterion for SSL.",
        "Central to our idea is that instead of using unlabeled data directly in SSL, we first cluster the seeds and unlabeled data in an unsupervised way before conducting SSL.",
        "The semantics of unsupervised clusters are usually unknown.",
        "However, the cluster to which the seeds belong can serve as the target cluster.",
        "Then we guide the SSL procedure using the target cluster.",
        "Under such learning settings, semantic drift can be automatically detected and a stopping criterion can be found: stopping the SSL procedure when it tends to accept examples belonging to clusters other than the target cluster.",
        "We demonstrate in this paper the above general idea by considering a bootstrapping procedure to discover semantic patterns for extracting relations between named entities (NE).",
        "Standard bootstrapping usually starts with some high-precision and high frequency seed patterns for a specific relation to match named entities, then it uses newly promoted entities to search for additional confident patterns connecting them.",
        "It is a procedure driven by the duality between patterns and entities: a good pattern can connect more than one pair of named entities and a pair of named entities is usually connected by more than one good pattern.",
        "We present a new bootstrapping procedure in which we first cluster the seed and other patterns in a large corpus based on distributional similarity.",
        "We then guide the bootstrapping using the target cluster.",

Then we adopt a vector space model, i.e., we construct a tf-idf feature vector for each P. Now we compute the similarity between two vectors/paths using Cosine similarity and cluster all the paths using Complete Linkage.",

        "This is because of the initial settings used in many SSL systems: seeds are assigned high confidence.",
        "Thus all NE pairs matched by initial seed patterns will have very high confidence.",
        "Suppose the target relation is LocatedIn, and \"visited\" is a seed pattern; then the <Clinton, Arkansas> example will be overrated because we cannot take into account that it would also match patterns of other relations such as PersonGovernorOfLocation and PersonBornlnLocation in a real corpus.",
        "This will cause a vicious circle, i.e., bogus NE pairs extract more bogus patterns which further extract more bogus NE pairs.",
        "We believe this flaw of the initial settings partially results in the semantic drift problem.",
        "One can imagine that this is not a problem that can be solved by using a different formula to replace the one presented here.",
        "A possible solution is to study the structure of unlabeled data (NE pairs in our case) and integrate this structure information into the initial settings.",
        "Indeed, this is where pattern clusters come into play.",
        "We will demonstrate this in Section 3.2.",
        "Step 2: Use NE pairs to search for new patterns and rank patterns.",
        "Similar to the intuition in Step 1, for a pattern p, if many of the NE pairs it matches are very confident then p has many supporters and should have a high ranking.",

        "Every pattern in our corpus now has a cluster membership (the seed patterns have the same membership).",
        "The most important benefit from our pattern clusters is that now we can measure how strongly a NE pair Ni is associated with our target cluster Ct (the one to which the seed patterns belong).",

        "Since each pattern in our corpus has a cluster membership, we can monitor the semantic drift easily and naturally stop: it drifts when the procedure tries to accept patterns which do not belong to the target cluster; we can stop when the procedure tends to accept more patterns outside of the target cluster.",
        "If our clustering algorithm can give us perfect pattern clusters, we can stop bootstrapping immediately after it accepts the first pattern not belonging to the target cluster.",
        "Then the bootstrapping becomes redundant since all it does is to consume the patterns of the target cluster.",
        "Facing the reality of the behavior of many clustering algorithms, we allow the procedure to occasionally accept patterns outside of the target cluster but we are not tolerant when it tries to accept more patterns outside of the target cluster than patterns in it.",
        "Note that when such patterns are accepted they will be moved to the target cluster and invoke the recomputation of Cluster Conf of NE pairs connected by these patterns.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, the theme explored in this paper is the first study of using pattern clusters for preventing semantic drift in semi-supervised pattern discovery.",
        "Recent research also explored the idea of driving SSL with explicit constraints constructed by hand such as identifying mutual exclusion of different categories (i.e., people and sport are mutually exclusive).",

        "The learning quality largely depends on the completeness of explicit constraints.",
        "While we share the same goal, i.e., to prevent semantic drift, we rely on unsupervised clusters to discover implicit constraints for us instead of generating constraints by hand.",
        "Our research is also close to semi-supervised IE pattern learners including (Riloff and Jones, 1999), (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), (Yangarber et al., 2000), and many others.",
