        "To find the basic language units, i.e. words, segmentation is a necessary initial step for Chinese language processing.",
        "There are two dominant models for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "The first one is what we call \"word-based\" approach, where the basic predicting units are words themselves.",
        "This kind of segmenters sequentially decides whether the local sequence of characters make up a word.",
        "This word-by-word approach ranges from naive maximum matching (Chen and Liu, 1992) to complex solution based on semi-Markov conditional random fields (CRF) (Andrew, 2006).",
        "The second is \"character-based\" approach, where basic processing units are characters which compose words.",
        "Segmentation is formulated as a classification problem to predict whether a character locates at the beginning of, inside or at the end of a word.",
        "This character-by-character method was first proposed in (Xue, 2003), and a number of sequence labeling algorithms have been exploited.",
        "This paper is concerned with the behavior of different segmentation models in general.",
        "We present a theoretical and empirical comparative analysis of the two dominant approaches.",
        "Theoretically, these approaches are different.",
        "The word-based models do prediction on a dynamic sequence of possible words, while character-based models on a static character sequence.",
        "The former models have a stronger ability to represent word token features for disambiguation, while the latter models can better induce a word from its internal structure.",
        "For empirical analysis, we implement two segmenters, both using the Passive-Aggressive algorithm (Crammeretal., 2006)to estimate parameters.",
        "Our experiments indicate that despite similar performance in terms of overall F-score, the two models produce different types of errors, in a way that can be explained by theoretical properties.",
        "We will present a detailed analysis that reveals important differences of the two methods in Sec. 4.",
        "The two types of approaches exhibit different behaviors, and each segmentation model has strengths and weaknesses.",
        "We further consider integrating word-based and character-based models in order to exploit their complementary strengths and thereby improve segmentation accuracy beyond what is possible by either model in isolation.",
        "We present a Bootstrap Aggregating model to combine multiple segmentation systems.",
        "By letting multiple segmenters vote, our combination model improves accuracy consistently on all the four different segmentation data sets from the second SIGHAN bakeoff.",
        "We also compare our integrating system to the state-of-the-art segmentation systems.",
        "Our system obtains the highest reported F-scores on three data sets."

      "text": [
        "First of all, we distinguish two kinds of \"words\": (1) Words in dictionary are word types; (2) Words in sentences are word tokens.",
        "The goal of word segmentation is to identify word tokens in a running text, where a large dictionary (i.e. list of word types) and annotated corpora may be available.",
        "From the view of token,we divide segmentation models into two main categories: word-based models and character-based models.",
        "There are two key points of a segmentation model: (1) How to decide whether a local sequence of characters is a word?",
        "(2) How to do disambiguation if ambiguous segmentation occurs?",
        "For each model, we separately discuss the strategies for word prediction and segmentation disambiguation.",
        "It may be the most natural idea for segmentation to find word tokens one by one.",
        "This kind of segmenters read the input sentences from left to right, predict whether current piece of continuous characters is a word token.",
        "After one word is found, segmenters move on and search for next possible word.",
        "There are different strategies for the word prediction and disambiguation problems.",
        "Take for example maximum matching, which was a popular algorithm at the early stage of research (Chen and Liu, 1992).",
        "For word prediction, if a sequence of characters appears in a dictionary, it is taken as a word candidate.",
        "For segmentation disambiguation, if more than one word types are matched, the algorithm chooses the longest one.",
        "In the last several years, machine learning techniques are employed to improve word-based segmentation, where the above two problems are solved in a uniform model.",
        "Given a sequence of characters c <ECn (n is the number of characters), denote a segmented sequence of words w eWm(m is the number of words, i.e. m varies with w), and a function GEN that enumerates a set of segmentation candidates GEN(c) for c. In general, a segmenter solves the following \"argmax\" problem:",
        "wGGEN(c)",
        "where $ and 0 are global and local feature maps and 9 is the parameter vector to learn.",
        "The inner product 9T0(c,W[1:i]) can been seen as the confidence score of whether wf is a word.",
        "The disambiguation takes into account confidence score of each word, by using the sum of local scores as its criteria.",
        "Markov assumption is necessary for computation, so 0 is usually defined on a limited history.",
        "Perceptron and semi-Markov CRFs were used to estimate 9 in previous work (Zhang and Clark, 2007; Andrew, 2006).",
        "Most previous data-driven segmentation solutions took an alternative, character-based view.",
        "This approach observes that by classifying characters as different positions in words, segmentation can be treated as a sequence labeling problem, assigning labels to the characters in a sentence indicating whether a character cf is a single character word (S) or the begin (B), middle (I)or end (£)ofa multi-character word.",
        "For word prediction, word tokens are inferred based on the character classes.",
        "The main difficulty of this model is character ambiguity that most Chinese characters can occur in different positions within different words.",
        "Linear models are also popular for character disambiguation (i.e. segmentation disambiguation).",
        "Denote a sequence of character labels y gY\"-, a linear model is defined as:",
        "Note that local feature map ip is defined only on the sequence of characters and their labels.",
        "Several discriminative models have been exploited for parameter estimation, including per-ceptron, CRFs, and discriminative latent variable CRFs (Jiang et al., 2009; Tseng, 2005; Sun et al., 2009b).",
        "Theoretically, the two types of models are different.",
        "We compare them from four aspects.",
        "Chinese words have internal structures.",
        "In most cases, Chinese character is a morpheme which is the smallest meaningful unit of the language.",
        "Though we cannot exactly infer the meaning of a word from its character components, the character structure is still meaningful.",
        "Partially characterizing the internal structures ofwords, one advantage of character-based models is the ability to induce new words.",
        "E.g., character \"^/person\" is usually used as a suffix meaning \"one kind of people\".",
        "If a segmenter never sees \"Ifp#/worker\" in training data, it may still rightly recognize this word by analyzing the prefix \"Ifp/work\" with label BI and the suffix with label E. In contrast, current word-based models only utilize the weighted features as word prediction criteria, and thus word formation information is not well explored.",
        "For more details about Chinese word fomation, see (Sun et al., 2009a).",
        "A majority of structured prediction models are linear models in the sense that the score functions are linear combination of parameters.",
        "Both previous solutions for word-based and character-based systems utilize linear models.",
        "However, both \"linear\" models incur nonlinearity to some extent.",
        "In general, a sequence classification itself involves nonlinearity in a way that the features of current token usually encode previous state information which is linear combination of features of previous tokens.",
        "The interested readers may consult (Liang et al., 2008) for preliminary discussion about the nonlinearity in structured models.",
        "This kind of nonlinearity exists in both word-based and character-based models.",
        "In addition, in most character-based models, a word should take a S label or start with a B label, end with E label, and only have I label inside.",
        "This inductive way for word prediction actually behaves nonlinearly.",
        "Since word-based models take the sum of part score of each individual word token, it increases the upper bound of the whole score to segment more words.",
        "As a result, word-based segmenter tends to segment words into smaller pieces.",
        "A difficult case occurs when a word token w consists of some word types which could be separated as words on their own.",
        "In such cases a word-based segmenter more easily splits the word into individual words.",
        "For example, in the phrase \"0 ^f\" HH/4300 7R/meter (4300 meters)\", the numeral \"0 H H\" consists of two individual numeral types \"0^ (4000)\" and \"HH(300)\".",
        "A word-based segmenter more easily made a mistake to segment two word tokens.",
        "This phenomenon is very common in named entities.",
        "In character-based models, features are usually defined by the character information in the neighboring n-character window.",
        "Despite a large set of valuable features that could be expressed, it is slightly less natural to encode predicted word token information.",
        "On the contrary, taking words as dynamic tokens, it is very easy to define word token features in a word-based model.",
        "Word-based segmenters hence have greater representational power.",
        "Despite of the lack of word token representation ability, character-based segmenters can use word type features by looking up a dictionary.",
        "For example, if a local sequence of characters following current token matches a word in a dictionary; these word types can be used as features.",
        "If a string matches a word type, it has a very high probability (ca.",
        "90%) to be a word token.",
        "So word type features are good approximation of word token features."

        "We assign each character an oracle label which is chosn by at least two segmenters.",
        "When the baseline segmenters are agree with each other, the gold segmenter cannot change the segmentation whether it is right or wrong.",
