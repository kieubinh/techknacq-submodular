        "Within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, we can tell apart two different usage scenarios for automatic systems that output or work with natural language.",
        "On one hand, we have the cases in which the output of such systems is expected to be used in a vanilla fashion, that is, without validating or correcting the results produced by the system.",
        "Within this usage scheme, the most important factor of a given automatic system is the quality of the results.",
        "Although memory and computational requirements of such systems are usually taken into account, the ultimate aim of most",
        "AP2006-01363.",
        "research that relates to this scenario is to minimize the amount of error (measured with metrics like Word Error Rate, BLEU, F-Measure, etc.)",
        "present within the results that are being produced.",
        "The second usage scenario arises when there exists the need for perfect and completely error-free results, for example, flawlessly translated sentences or correctly annotated syntactic trees.",
        "In such cases, the intervention of a human validator/corrector is unavoidable.",
        "The corrector will review and validate the results, making the suitable modifications before the system output can be employed.",
        "In these kind of tasks, the most important factor to be minimized is the human effort that has to be applied to transform the system's potentially incorrect output into validated and error-free output.",
        "Measuring user effort has an intrinsic subjectivity that makes it hard to be quantitatized.",
        "Given that the user effort is usually inversely proportional to the quality of the system output, most research about problems associated to this scenario t to minimize just the system's error rate as well.",
        "Interactive Predictive NLP Systems",
        "Only recently, more comparable and reproducible evaluation methods for Interactive Natural Language Systems have started to be developed, within the context of Interactive Predictive Systems (IPS).",
        "These systems formally integrate the correcting user into the loop, making him part of the system right at its theoretical framework.",
        "IPSs allow for human correctors to spare effort because the system updates its output after each individual user correction, potentially fixing several errors at each step.",
        "Interactive Predictive methods have been studied and successfully used in fields like Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) (Toselli et al., 2008) and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Vidal et al., 2006; Barrachina et al., 2009) to ease the work of transcriptors and translators.",
        "In IPS related research the importance of the system base error rate per se is diminished.",
        "Instead, the intention is to measure how well the user and the system work together.",
        "For this, formal user simulation protocols together with new objective effort evaluation metrics such as the Word Stroke Ratio (WSR) (Toselli et al., 2008) or the Key-Stroke and Mouse-Ratio (KSMR) (Barrachina et al., 2009) started to be used as a benchmark.",
        "These ratios reflect the amount of user effort (whole-word corrections in the case of WSR; keystrokes plus mouse actions in the case of KSMR) given a certain output.",
        "To get the amount of user effort into context they should be measured against the corresponding error ratios of comparable non-interactive systems: Word Error Rate for WSR and Character Error Rate for KSMR.",
        "This dichotomy in evaluating either system performance or user effort applies to Syntactic Parsing as well.",
        "The objective of parsing is to precisely determine the syntactic structure of sentences written in one of the several languages that humans use.",
        "Very bright research has been carried out in this field, resulting in several top performing completely automatic parsers (Collins, 2003;",
        "Huang, 2008; Petrov, 2010).",
        "However, these produce results that are erroneous to some extent, and as such unsuitable for some applications without a previous manual correction.",
        "There are many problems where error-free results consisting in perfectly annotated trees are needed, such as handwritten mathematical expression recognition (Ya-mamoto et al., 2006) or construction of large new gold treebanks (de la Clergerie et al., 2008).",
        "When using automatic parsers as a baseline for building perfect syntactic trees, the role of the human annotator is usually to post-edit the trees and correct the errors.",
        "This manner of operating results in the typical two-step process for error correcting, in which the system first generates the whole output and then the user verifies or amends it.",
        "This paradigm is rather inefficient and uncomfortable for the human annotator.",
        "For example, a basic two-stage setup was employed in the creation of the Penn Treebank annotated corpus: a rudimentary parsing system provided a skeletal syntactic representation, which then was manually corrected by human annotators (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "Additional works within this field have presented systems that act as a computerized aid to the user in obtaining the perfect annotation 2005).",
        "Subjective measuring of the effort needed to obtain perfect annotations was reported in some of these works, but we feel that a more comparable metric is needed.",
        "With the objective of reducing the user effort and making the laborious task of tree annotation easier, the authors of (Sanchez-Saez et al., 2009a) devised an Interactive Predictive Parsing (IPP) framework.",
        "That work embeds the human corrector into the automatic parser, and allows him to interact in real time within the system.",
        "In this manner, the system can use the readily available user feedback to make predictions about the parts of the trees that have not been validated by the corrector.",
        "The authors simulated user interaction and calculated effort evaluation metrics, establishing that an IPP system results in amounts slightly above 40% of effort reduction for a manual annotator compared to a two-step system.",
        "Confidence Measures in NLP",
        "Annotating trees syntactically, even with the aid of automatic systems, generally requires human intervention with a high degree of specialization.",
        "This fact partially justifies the shortage in large manually annotated treebanks.",
        "Endeavors directed at easing the burden for the experts performing this task could be of great help.",
        "One approach that can be followed in reducing user effort within an IPS is adding information that helps the user to locate the individual errors in a sentence, so he can correct them in a hastier fashion.",
        "The use of the Confidence Measure (CM) formalism goes in this direction, allowing us to assign a probability of correctness for individual erroneous constituents of a more complex output block of a NLP system.",
        "In fields such as HTR, SMT or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), the output sentences have a global probability (or score) that reflects the likeness of the output sentence being correct.",
        "CMs allow precision beyond the sentence level in predicting errors: they can be used to label the individual words as either correct or incorrect.",
        "Automatic systems can use CMs to help the user in identifying the erroneous parts of the output in a faster way or to aid with the amendments by suggesting replacement words that are likely to be correct.",
        "Previous research shows that CMs have been successfully applied within the ASR (Wessel et al., 2001), HTR (Tarazon et al., 2009; Serrano et al., 2010) and SMT (Ueffing and Ney, 2007) fields.",
        "In these works, the ability of CMs in detecting erroneous constituents is assessed by the classical confidence metrics: the Confidence Error Rate (CER) and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) (Ueffing and Ney, 2007).",
        "However, until recent advances, the use ofCMs remained largely unexplored in Parsing.",
        "Assessing the correctness of the different parts of a parsing tree can be useful in improving the efficiency and usability of an IPP system, not only by tagging parts with low confidence for the user to review, but also by automating part of the correction process itself by presenting constituents that yield a higher confidence when an error is confirmed by the user.",
        "CMs for parsing in the form of combinations of features calculated from n-best lists were proposed in (Benedi et al., 2007).",
        "Later on, the authors of (Sanchez-Saez et al., 2009b) introduced a statistical method for calculating a CM for each of the constituents in a parse tree.",
        "In that work, CMs are calculated using the posterior probability of each tree constituent, approach which is similar to the word-graph based methods in the ASR and SMT fields.",
        "In this paper, we apply Confidence Measures to the Interactive Predictive Parsing framework to asses how CMs are increasingly more accurate as the user validates subtrees within the interactive process.",
        "We prove that after each correction performed by the user, the CMs of the remaining un-validated constituents are more helpful to detect errors."
