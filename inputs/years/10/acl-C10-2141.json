        "Wikipedia is useful for obtaining comprehensive information of entities and concepts.",
        "However, even with 3.3 million English articles, Wikipedia does not necessarily include articles about an entity and concept of interest to a user.",
        "The ultimate goal of this study is to generate articles about an entity of a specified category from the Web by using Wikipedia articles in the same entity category as exemplars.",
        "This study follows previous work of the other authors on query-biased/focused summarization (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998; Berger",
        "and Mittal, 2000) for modeling the target article generation process.",
        "In that model, when a user inputs an entity of interest, Web pages are retrieved that describe the entity by issuing queries to an information retrieval system.",
        "Using the retrieved pages as an information source, an article (summary) can be produced specialized for the target entity.",
        "From the application point of view, the article should include the concepts that best describe the target entity.",
        "In addition, articles concerning the entities of a category should cover concepts that are typical of the category.",
        "For example, an article about an actor is expected to mention his nationality, date of birth, movie credits, awards, etc.",
        "A great number of researchers have addressed the problem of query-focused summarization (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; White et al., 2003; Dang, 2005; Daumé and Marcu, 2006; Varadarajan and Hristidis, 2006; Fuentes et al., 2007; Gupta et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007; Kanungo et al., 2009).",
        "However, these studies assume that a document collection is provided for the summarization systems.",
        "In other words, collecting source documents that include important concepts for the target entity is not in the scope of these studies.",
        "For example, queries such as \"(actor) was born in,\" \"(actor) born on,\" \"(actor) plays,\" and \"(actor) won\" may be more suitable than the simple query \"(actor)\" for obtaining concepts concerning the actor.",
        "Source documents can be collected by a similar idea in relation extraction, which extracts entities having specific relations with the target entity (Hearst, 1992; Brin, 1999; Agichtein and Gra-vano, 2000; Turney, 2001; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Blohm et al., 2007).",
        "These studies typically use statistical measures, such as frequency and point-wise mutual information (PMI), to assess the scores of the query patterns.",
        "However, these studies cannot eliminate the redundancy of concepts retrieved by a query set because they are designed to extract entities for each relation independently.",
        "For example, the query \"(actor) born on\" would not be necessary if the query \"(actor) was born in\" could gather documents referring to both the actor's nationality and date of birth.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel method for acquiring a set of high-quality query patterns that can gather source documents referring to important concepts about a specified entity.",
        "Given a category in which the entity is expected to be included, we use existing Wikipedia articles in this category to extract query patterns so that, when used together with the entity, they can retrieve important concepts related to the entity.",
        "We then select a small subset of query patterns that maximize the coverage and precision of the query result by modeling the query selection task as a weighted maximum satisfiability (weighted MaxSAT) problem."

        "A query pattern is a lexical pattern that contains a slot filled by an entity.",
        "Used with an entity, a query pattern instantiates a query that collects related concepts.",
        "For example, \"X was born in\" is a query pattern in which X is a slot.",
        "When replacing X with an entity (e.g., \"Dustin Hoffman\"), the query pattern instantiates a query that may return the birthplace.",
        "The goal of this study is, for a given entity category (e.g., American actor), to acquire a set of query patterns (template) for collecting related concepts from the Web.",
        "We learn the template by using Wikipedia articles of the category as supervision data.",
        "The method consists of three steps.",
        "1.",
        "Triplet extraction identifies, for each Wikipedia article, entity mentions, concepts, and phrases that form a bridge between the entity mentions and concepts.",
        "In the context of learning query patterns from Wikipedia, we assume that a Wikipedia article is written for an entity.",
        "By identifying entity mentions and concepts in the article, we obtain bridging phrases between entity mentions and concepts as candidates for query patterns.",
        "2.",
        "Pattern assessment verifies whether each candidate query pattern can actually retrieve concepts from the Web.",
        "This step issues queries of the form \"(entity) (pattern)\" to an information retrieval system, analyzes the retrieved Web pages, and examines whether each concept is found in the same sentence as the query expressions.",
        "3.",
        "Pattern selection obtains a template by choosing a small subset of patterns such that the retrieved Web pages contain as many kinds of concepts as possible.",
        "We also eliminate query patterns that can retrieve descriptions other than concepts.",
        "We formalize this step as a weighted Max-SAT problem.",
        "We first analyze Wikipedia articles to extract triplets of entities, query patterns, and concepts.",
        "Because a Wikipedia article usually describes a single entity, we identify the entity from the title of the article.",
        "We then search for occurrences of the entity in the body of the article.",
        "However, we might need to resolve coreference expressions because the entity might be described by a number of surface variations.",
        "For example, the Wikipedia article titled \"Dustin Hoffman\" might refer to the entity using \"he\" and \"Hoffman\" as well as \"Dustin Hoffman\"; the entity \"Microsoft Corporation\" might be described by \"Microsoft\" and \"the company\" in the article.",
        "In general, coreference resolution is a nontrivial NLP task.",

        "The second rule resolves the coreference expressions caused by pronouns and definite noun phrases.",
        "After detecting the entity mentions, we identify the concepts concerning the entity in the article.",
        "In this study, we employ WikiLink texts (anchor texts linked with other Wikipedia articles) that co-occur with the entity mentions in the same sentences.",

        "Currently, we use the text between an entity and a WikiLink as a candidate for a query pattern.",
        "In the future, we plan to use the text between two noun phrases as query patterns to increase the number of candidates for the pattern selection process.",
        "Moreover, we intend to build a text summarization application based on the proposed method to confirm that the selected pattern set is able to generate a comprehensive summary for an entity."
