        "This paper addresses the problem of searching for people with similar interests and expertise, given their field of expertise as the query.",
        "Many existing people search engines need people's names to do a \"keyword\" style search, using a person's name as a query.",
        "However, in many situations, such information is insufficient or impossible to know beforehand.",
        "Imagine a scenario where the statistics department of a university invited a worldwide known expert in Bayesian statistics and machine learning to give a keynote speech; how can the organizer notify all the people on campus who are interested without spamming those who are not?",
        "Our paper proposes a solution to the aforementioned scenario by providing a search engine which goes beyond \"keyword\" search and can retrieve such information semantically.",
        "The organizer would only need to input the research domain of the keynote speaker, i.e. Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and all professors and students who are interested in this topic will be retrieved and an email agent will send out the information automatically.",
        "Specifically, we propose a Citation-Author-Topic (CAT) model which extracts academic research topics and discovers different research communities by clustering experts with similar interests and expertise.",
        "CAT assumes three steps of a hierarchical generative process when producing a document: first, an author is generated, then that author generates topics which ultimately generate the words and cited authors.",
        "This model links authors to observed words and cited authors via latent topics and captures the intuition that when writing a paper, authors always first have topics in their mind, based on which, they choose words and cite related works.",
        "Corpus linguists or forensic linguists usually identify authorship of disputed texts based on stylistic features, such as vocabulary size, sentence length, word usage that characterize a specific author and the general semantic content is usually ignored (Diederich et al., 2003).",
        "On the other hand, graph-based and network based models ignore the content information of documents and only focus on network connectivity (Zhang et al., 2007; Jurczyk and Agichtein, 2007).",
        "In contrast, the model we propose in this paper fully utilizes the content words of the documents and combines them with the stylistic flavor contextual information to link authors and documents together to not only identify the authorship, but also to be used in many other applications such as paper reviewer recommendation, research community identification as well as academic social network search.",
        "The novelty of the work presented in this paper lies in the proposal of jointly modeling the cited author information and using a discriminative multinomial distribution to model the coauthor information instead of an artificial uniform distribution.",
        "In addition, we apply and evaluate our model in a semantic search scenario.",
        "While current search engines cannot support interactive and exploratory search effectively, our model supports search that can answer a range of exploratory queries.",
        "This is done by semantically linking the interests of authors to the topics of the collection, and ultimately to the distribution ofthe words in the documents.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first present some related work on author topic modeling and expert search in Sec. 2.",
        "Then our model is described in Sec. 3.",

        "Author topic modeling, originally proposed in (Steyvers et al., 2004; Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), is an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), a probabilistic generative model that can be used to estimate the properties of multinomial observations via unsupervised learning.",
        "LDA represents each document as a mixture of probabilistic topics and each topic as a multinomial distribution over words.",
        "The Author topic model adds an author layer over LDA and assumes that the topic proportion of a given document is generated by the chosen author.",
        "Author topic analysis has attracted much attention recently due to its broad applications in machine learning, text mining and information retrieval.",
        "For example, it has been used to predict authors for new documents (Steyvers et al., 2004), to recommend paper reviewers (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), to model message data (Mccallum et al., 2004), to conduct temporal author topic analysis (Mei and Zhai, 2006), to disambiguate proper names (Song et al., 2007), to search academic social networks (Tang et al., 2008) and to generate meeting status analyses for group decision making (Broniatowski, 2009).",
        "In addition, there are many related works on expert search at the TREC enterprise track from 2005 to 2007, which focus on enterprise scale search and discovering relationships between entities.",
        "In that setting, the task is to find the experts, given a web domain, a list of candidate experts and a set of topics .",
        "The task defined in our paper is different in the sense that our topics are hidden and our document repositories are more homogeneous since our documents are all research papers authored by the experts.",
        "Within this setting, we can explore in depth the influence of the hidden topics and contents to the ranking of our experts.",
        "Similar to (Johri et al., 2010), in this paper we apply CAT in a semantic retrieval scenario, where searching people is associated with a set of hidden semantically meaningful topics instead of their personal names.",
        "In recent literature, there are three main lines of work that extend author topic analyses.",
        "One line of work is to relax the model's \"bag-of-words\" assumption by automatically discovering multiword phrases and adding them into the original model (Johri et al., 2010).",
        "Similar work has also been proposed for other topic models such as Ngram topic models (Wallach, 2006; Wang and McCallum, 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Griffiths et al., 2007).",
        "Another line of work models authors information as a general contextual information (Mei and Zhai, 2006) or associates documents with network structure analysis (Mei et al., 2008; Serdyukov et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2009).",
        "This line of work aims to propose a general framework to deal with collections of texts with an associated networks structure.",
        "However, it is based on a different topic model than ours; for example, Mei's works (Mei and Zhai, 2006; Mei et al., 2008) extend probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), and do not have cited author information explicitly.",
        "Our proposal follows the last line of work which extends author topic modeling with specific contextual information and directly captures the association between authors and topics together with this contextual information (Tang et al., 2008; Mccallum et al., 2004).",
        "For example, in (Tang et al., 2008), publication venue is added as one extra piece of contextual information and in (Mccallum et al., 2004), email recipients, which are treated as extra contextual information, are paired with email authors to model an email message corpus.",
        "In our proposed method, the extra contextual information consists of the cited authors in each documents.",
        "Such contextual information directly captures linkage among authors and cited authors, enhances author-topic associations, and therefore produces more coherent author-topic distributions."
