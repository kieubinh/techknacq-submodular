        "Hindi and Urdu are official languages of India and Urdu is also the national language of Pakistan.",
        "Hindi is spoken by around 853 million people and Urdu by around 164 million people (Malik et al., 2008).",
        "Although native speakers of Hindi can comprehend most of spoken Urdu and vice versa, these languages have diverged a bit since independence of India and Pakistan - with Hindi deriving a lot of words from Sanskrit and Urdu from Persian.",
        "One clear difference between Hindi and Urdu is the script: Hindi is written in a left-to-right Devanagari script while Urdu is written in Nastaliq calligraphy style of the right-to-left Perso-Arabic script.",
        "Hence, despite the similarities, it is impossible for an Urdu speaker to read Hindi text and vice versa.",
        "The first problem we address is the translation between Hindi and Urdu in the absence of a Hindi-Urdu parallel corpus.",
        "Though these languages together are spoken by around a billion people they are not very rich in linguistic resources.",
        "A treebank for Hindi is still under development and part of speech taggers for Hindi and Urdu are trained on very small amounts of data.",
        "For translation between Hindi/Urdu and English there are no large corpora, the available corpora are an order of magnitude smaller than those available for European languages or Arabic-English.",
        "Given the lack of linguistic resources in each of the languages and the similarities between these languages, we explore whether each language can benefit from resources available in the other language.",
        "Sharing resources between Hindi and Urdu requires us to be able to convert from one written form to the other.",
        "Given that the languages share a good fraction of their spoken vocabularies, the obvious approach to convert between the two scripts would be to transliterate between them.",
        "While this approach has recently been attempted (Malik et al., 2009), (Malik et al., 2008) there are two main problems with this approach.",
        "Challenges in Hindi-Urdu transliteration: Urdu uses diacritical marks that were taken from the Arabic script which serve various purposes.",
        "Urdu has short and long vowels.",
        "Short vowels are indicated by placing a diacritic with the consonant that precedes it in the syllable.",
        "The diacritical marks are also used for gemination (doubling of a consonant), which in Hindi is handled using a conjunct form where the consonant is essentially repeated twice.",
        "Yet another function of diacritical marks is to mark the absence of a vowel following a base consonant.",
        "Though diacritical marks are critical for correct pronunciation and sometimes even for disambiguation of certain words, they are sparingly used in written material intended for native speakers of the language.",
        "Missing diacritical marks create substantial difficulties for transliteration systems.",
        "Another difficulty is created by the fact that Urdu words cannot have a short vowel at the end of a word, whereas the corresponding Hindi word can sometimes have a short vowel.",
        "This cannot be resolved deterministically and results ambiguity in transliteration from Urdu to Hindi.",
        "A third issue is the presence of certain sounds (and their corresponding letters) that have no equivalent in Urdu.",
        "These letters are approximated in Urdu with phonetic equivalents.",
        "Transliteration from Urdu to Hindi suffers in the presence of words with these letters.",
        "Recent work on Urdu-Hindi transliteration (Malik et al., 2009) report transliteration word error rates of 16.4% and 23.1% for Urdu sentences with and without diacritical marks respectively.",
        "This problem is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The figure shows an Urdu sentence that is transliterated to Hindi using the Hindi Urdu Machine Transliteration (HUMT) system and translated using our Statistical Machine Translation System.",
        "The words which are in red are transliteration errors (mainly because of missing diacritical marks).",
        "Difference in Word Frequency Distributions: Even if we could transliterate perfectly between Urdu and Hindi it might not be desirable to do so from the point of view of human understanding or for machine consumption.",
        "This is because word frequencies of shared words would be different in Hindi and Urdu.",
        "At the extreme, there are several Urdu words that a fluent Hindi speaker would not understand and vice versa.",
        "More commonly, native speakers of Hindi and Urdu would use different words to refer to the same concept, even though both these words are technically correct in either of these languages.",
        "In initial experiments to quantify this issue on our corpus, which is mainly from the news domain, we estimated that around 28% of the word tokens in Urdu would not be natural in Hindi.",
        "This estimate assumes perfect transliteration, and we estimated the total error rate including transliteration at around 55% for the publicly available HUMT system.",
        "In Figure 1, the words that have been underlined have been replaced using a different word by our SMT system, even though the original word might be technically correct.",
        "Our preliminary experiments exploring this issue convinced us that to be able to convert from Urdu into natural Hindi (and vice versa) we would need to go beyond transliteration to translation to deal with the divergence of the vocabularies in the written forms of the two languages.",
        "Importance of Context We would like to point out that in addition to word for word fidelity, there are more subtle issues in translating from Urdu-Hindi.",
        "One issue is that words in Hindi are drawn from different source languages, and with word to word translations, we might end up with phrases that are unnatural.",
        "For example, consider different ways of writing the English phrase National and News in Hindi.",
        "The word National in Hindi could possibly be written as rashtriya, kaumi or national which have origins in Sanskrit, Persian/Arabic and English respectively.",
        "Similarly the word News could be written as samachar, khabaren or news (once again with origins in Sanskrit, Persian/Arabic and English).",
        "The natural ways for writing the phrase national news are: rashtriya samachar, kaumi khabaren or national news, any of the other six combinations would be quite rare.",
        "Another issue is that corresponding words in Hindi and Urdu might have different genders.",
        "An example from (Sinha, 2009) are the words vajah (Urdu, feminine) and karan (Hindi, masculine), which would mean that the phrase because of him would be written as us ke karan in Hindi and as us ki vajah se in Urdu.",
        "We note that the ke in Hindi and ki in Urdu are different because of the difference in genders of the word following them.",
        "This suggests we would need to go beyond word for word translation and would need to use a higher order n-gram language model to translate with fidelity between Hindi and English.",
        "We have established the need for going beyond transliteration, but a key challenge is to achieve good translation accuracy in the absence of a Hindi-Urdu parallel corpus.",
        "In Section 3 we describe a multi-pronged approach to translate between Hindi and Urdu in the absence of a parallel corpus that exploits the similarities between the languages.",
        "We next outline the three tasks for which we consider sharing resources between Hindi and Urdu which serve as a test of the efficacy of our systems.",
        "Statistical machine translation",
        "In recent years, there is a lot of interest in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) Systems (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Modern SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007) learn translation models based on large amounts of parallel data.",
        "The quality of an SMT system is dependent on the amount of parallel data on which the system is trained.",
        "Unfortunately, for the pairs Urdu-English and Hindi-English, parallel data are not available in large quantities, thereby limiting the quality of these SMT systems.",
        "In this paper we show that we can improve the accuracy of an Urdu â€“ English SMT system by using a Hindi-English parallel corpus.",
        "Part of Speech tagging",
        "Part of Speech (POS) tagging involves marking the part of speech of a word based on its definition and surrounding context in a sentence.",
        "Sequential modeling techniques like Hidden Markov Models (Rabiner, 1990) and Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) are commonly used to build Part of Speech taggers.",
        "These models are typically trained using a manually tagged part of speech corpus.",
        "Manual tagging of data requires lot of human effort and hence large corpora are not readily available for many languages.",
        "We improve a Hindi POS tagger by using a manually tagged Urdu POS corpus.",
        "Supervised bitext alignment",
        "Machine generated word alignments between pairs of languages have many applications: building statistical machine translation systems, building dictionaries, projection of syntactic information to resource poor languages (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001).",
        "Most of the early work on generating word alignments has been unsupervised, e.g. IBM Models 1-5 (Brown et al., 1993), recent improvements on the IBM Models (Moore, 2004), and the HMM algorithm described in (Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "Recently, significant improvements in performance of aligners have been achieved by the use of human annotated word alignments (Itty-cheriah and Roukos, 2007; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006).",
        "We describe a method to transfer manual word alignments from Urdu-English to Hindi-English to improve Hindi-English word alignments.",
        "Our main contributions are summarized below: We present a hybrid technique to translate between Hindi and Urdu in the absence of a HindiUrdu parallel corpus that significantly improves upon past efforts to convert between Hindi and Urdu via transliteration.",
        "We validate the efficacy of the translation systems we present, by using it to share linguistic resources between Hindi and Urdu for three important tasks:",

      "heading": "3. Approach to translating between Hindi and Urdu",
      "text": [
        "As discussed in Section 1, transliteration between Hindi and Urdu is not a straightforward task and current efforts result in fairly high error rates.",
        "We would like to combine the approaches of transliteration and translation since our goal is to use the translation for sharing linguistic resources rather than for direct consumption.",
        "We use a fairly standard phrase based translation system to translate between Hindi and Urdu.",
        "The key challenge that we overcome is being able to develop such a system with acceptable accuracy in the absence of Hindi-Urdu resources (we have neither a parallel corpus nor a dictionary with sufficient coverage).",
        "In spite of the absence of resources, translation between this language pair is made feasible by the fact that word order is largely maintained and translation can be done maintaining a word to word correspondence.",
        "There are some exceptions to the monotonicity in the two languages.",
        "Consider the English phrase Government of Sindh which in Urdu would be hukumat e sindh in the same word order as in English, while in Hindi it would be sindhi sarkar with the word order flipped (with respect to English and Urdu).",
        "This example also shows that sometimes we do not have a word for word translation between Hindi and Urdu, the word sindhi in Hindi corresponding to the Urdu words e sindh.",
        "In spite of these exceptions, Hindi-Urdu translation can largely be done with the monotonicity assumption and with the assumption of word to word correspondences.",
        "Thus the central issue in translating between Hindi and Urdu is the creation of a word to word conditional probability table.",
        "We explain our technique assuming we are translating from Urdu to Hindi.",
        "We take a hybrid approach to creating this table, using three different approaches.",
        "The first approach is the pivot language approach (Wu and Wang, 2007), with English as a pivot language.",
        "We get probabilities of a Urdu word u being generated by a Hindi word h, considering intermediate English phrases e as:",
        "The translation probabilities P(u\\e) and P(e\\h) are obtained using an Urdu-English and an English-Hindi parallel corpus respectively.",
        "This approach works reasonably well, but suffers from a couple of drawbacks.",
        "There are several common Hindi and Urdu words for which the translation is unsatisfactory.",
        "This is because the alignments for these words are not precise, they often do not align to any English word, or align to an English words in combination with other Hindi words.",
        "A common example of this is with verbs, consider for example the English sentence He works which would translate into Hindi/Urdu as:",
        "vah kaam karta hai with word alignments He o vah, works o kaam karta hai .",
        "Automatic aligners often make mistakes on these multi-word alignments, and this create problems for words like karta and hai which often do not have direct equivalents in English.",
        "To deal with this issue we manually build a small phrase table for the most frequent Hindi and Urdu words by a consulting an online Hindi-Urdu-English dictionary (Platts, 1884).",
        "We also manually handle the frequent examples we observed of cases where we need to handle differences in tokenization between Hindi and Urdu (e.g keliye written as one word in Urdu and as ke liye in",
        "Hindi).",
        "The other issue with the pivot language approach is that for word pairs which are rare in one of the languages, e P(u\\e)P(e\\h) can easily work out to zero.",
        "This is exacerbated by alignment errors for rarer words.",
        "Thus, to strengthen our phrase table especially for infrequent words, we use a transliteration approach to build a phrase table.",
        "Note that for rare words like names of people and places, the words in Hindi and Urdu are transliterations of each other.",
        "In light of the issues in transliterating between al., 2009) we take a statistical approach (Abdul-Jaleel and Larkey, 2003) to building a transliteration based phrase table.",
        "We assume a generative model for producing Urdu words from Hindi words based on a character transliteration probability table Pc.",
        "The probability Pt(u\\h) of generating a Urdu word u from a Hindi word h is given by:",
        "where a represents the alignment between the Hindi and Urdu characters, a(i) is the the index of the Hindi character that the ith Urdu character is aligned to, Pc(uc\\hc) is the probability of an Urdu character uc being generated by a Hindi character hc and P (ai\\ai_i) represents a distortion probability.",
        "Since transliteration is monotonic and we want to encourage small jumps we set: P(ai\\ai_1) = cn(ai_\"i-l) for ai > ai_1 and 0 otherwise.",
        "To obtain Pc we use the EM algorithm and we can reuse standard machinery that is used to obtain HMM word alignments in Statistical Machine Translation (with the constraint of Monotone alignments).",
        "To calculate a transliteration based phrase table, for each Hindi word h we search over a large vocabulary of Urdu words and retain words u for which Pt(u\\h) is sufficiently high as possible transliterations of h. We set the probabilities in the transliteration based phrase table to be proportional to Pt(u\\h).",
        "Finding this table requires calculating Pt(u\\h) for every pair of words in the Urdu and Hindi vocabulary, we use the Forward-Backward algorithm for efficiency and parallelize the calculations over several machines.",
        "The only remaining issue is how we get training data to train our transliteration model.",
        "To obtain such training data we use a table ofconsonant character conversions between Hindi and Urdu as given in (Malik et al., 2008).",
        "We look for words in our pivot language based translation table, where there are at least three consonants and at least 50% of the consonants are shared.",
        "We observed that this yields pairs of words that are transliterations of one another with high precision.",
        "These word pairs are used as training data to build our character transliteration model Pc.",
        "Final word translation table is obtained by combining our three approaches as follows: If the word is present in our dictionary, we use the translation given in the dictionary and exclude all others, if not we linearly interpolate between the probability table we get based on using English as a pivot language and probability table we get based on transliteration."

        "We find that the two frequent error types that were greatly reduced were noun being tagged as main verb (reduction of 65% relative) and main verb tagged as auxiliary verb (reduction of 71%).",
        "Reduction in confusion between nouns and main verbs is expected since these are open word classes that can most benefit from additional data.",
        "This also causes the reduction in errors of tagging main verbs as auxiliary verbs, since in Hindi, verbs are multi word groups with a main verb followed by one or more auxiliary verbs.",
        "Reduction of error rate in most of the other error types were close to the overall error rate reduction.",
        "We experimented with using our internal Hindi-English parallel corpus ( 230k) sentences to obtain better translation for Urdu-English.",
        "The Urdu-English corpus we use is the NIST MT-08 training data set ( 70k sentences).",

        "We build our baseline Urdu â€“ English system using the NIST MT-08 training data.",
        "In training our DTM model we use HMM alignments, alignments with the MaxEnt aligner, and hand alignments for 10k sentences (the hand alignments were used to train the MaxEnt aligner).",
        "We translated the Hindi in our Hindi-English corpus to Urdu, creating an additional Urdu-English corpus.",
        "We then use a MaxEnt aligner to align the Urdu-English words in this corpus.",
        "Since we expect this corpus to be relatively noisy due to incorrect translation from Urdu to Hindi we do not include this corpus while generating HMM alignments.",
        "We add the synthetic Urdu-English data with MaxEnt alignments to our baseline data and train a DTM model.",
        "Results comparing to the baseline are given Table 3, which shows an improvement of 0.8 in BLEU score over the baseline system by using data from the Hindi-English corpus.",
        "This improvement is not due to unknown words being covered (the vocabulary covered is the same).",

        "In this paper, we showed that we can translate between Hindi and English without a parallel corpus and improve upon previous efforts at transliterating between the two languages.",

        "We believe this approach to sharing linguistic resources will be of immense value especially with resources like treebanks which require a large effort to develop."
