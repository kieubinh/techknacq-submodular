        "In order to effectively utilize such a huge amount of multimedia contents, we need provide tools to facilitate their management and retrieval.",
        "One of the most important tools is the automatic media concept detectors, which aim to assign highlevel semantic concepts such as \"bear\" to the multimedia data.",
        "More formally, the concept detection for an web image is defined as: given a set of predefined concepts C : [Ci, C2 ...Cn], we assign a semantic concept Ci to the image if it appears visually in the image.",
        "Traditionally, such concept detectors are built by the classifier approaches.",
        "The performance of such detectors depends highly on the quality of training data.",
        "However, preparing a set of high quality training data usually needs a large amount of human labors.",
        "On the other hand, the social web is changing the way people create and use information.",
        "For example, users started to develop novel strategies to annotate the massive amount of multimedia information from the web.",
        "In image annotation, Kennedy et al. (2006) explored the trade-offs in acquiring training data by automated web image search as opposed to manual human labeling.",
        "Although the performance of systems with training data obtained by manual human labeling is still better than those whose training data is acquired by automated web search, the latter approaches have attracted many researchers' interest due to their potential in reducing human label efforts.",
        "However, the tags in the web images are known to be ambiguous and overly personalized (Matusiak 2006).",
        "Figure i gives four examples to illustrate the relationships between the visual concept \"bear\" and the annotation tag \"bear\".",
        "Generally speaking, there are four types of relationships:",
        "• The relevant tag: The user-tag \"bear\" properly reflects the content of an image, as shown in Figure 1(a).",
        "While \"bear\" has multiple senses, the visual concept corresponds directly to the most common sense of \"bear\".",
        "• The ambiguous tag: The user-tag \"bear\" is ambiguously related to the visual content, as shown in Figure 1(b).",
        "In this example, the visual content is related to another sense of \"bear\": \"a surly, uncouth, burly, or shambling person\" (Merriam-Webster dictionary, 2010).",
        "• The noisy tag: The user-tag \"bear\" is a noisy tag, as shown in Figure 1(c).",
        "In this example, the visual content is irrelevant to the concept \"bear\".",
        "• The incomplete tag: The user-tag \"bear\" doesn't occur in the tag list of Figure 1(d).",
        "However, many human annotators believe that the visual concept \"bear\" exist in the Figure 1(d).",
        "Also, in Wikipeida, a panda is defined as a kind of a bear.",
        "the visual concept \"bear\" in NUS-Wide corpus.",
        "In this paper, we aim to assign relevant tags to images in order to reduce the effects of ambiguous, noisy and incomplete tags.",
        "To distinguish relevant tags from other sense of tags, a common practice is to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD) to predict the right sense of a tag.",
        "Nevertheless, performing a WSD on a noisy and sparse set of tags, where the order and position of tags do not matter, is by no means easy.",
        "Most existing works on WSD, such as Navigli (2009) are based on clean data and word neighborhood statistics.",
        "They cannot be directly applied to address this problem.",
        "Although there are some works such as Wang et al.",
        "(2003) on capturing the semantics of noisy data, the problem of ambiguous words has not been considered.",
        "In addition, some semantic models such as PLSA (Hofmann 1999), LDA (David et al.",
        "2003) have been proposed to capture the semantics.",
        "However, one challenge of employing such models is that there are many noisy tags in the web image domain.",
        "The reason for noisy tags is that the purpose of tagging is not only for content description, but also for other factors such as getting attention and so on (Ame and Naaman, 2007, Bischoff et al.",
        "2008).",
        "Given a web image with a tag list, we propose an approach to predict the \"Semantic Field\" of the image.",
        "Semantic Field (Jurafsky and Martin 2000) is designed to capture a more integrated relationship among the entire sets of tags.",
        "In our work, we consider four different cases of examples, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "In 1(a), the concept \"bear\" will be assigned to the image with relatively high probability, because \"zoo\", \"bear\", and \"polar\" provide clues that \"bear\" is the major focus of the image.",
        "In 1(b), the concept \"bear\" could possibly be disambiguated as not related to \"animal\", the most common sense of \"bear\", by investigating other tags such as \"men\",\"guys\".",
        "In 1(c), the image will not be labeled as \"bear\", since the surrounding tags such as \"dogs\", \"pups\" do not support the existence of \"bear\" in the image.",
        "In 1(d), although the concept \"bear\" is missing, the image will be still labeled as \"bear\" since the surrounding tags such as \"pandas\", \"animals\", and \"zoos\" jointly suggest that \"bear\" appears in the image.",
        "The significance of user tags towards a target concept can be modeled from three different sources: the statistics from the web image corpus, Wordnet and Wikipedia.",
        "In summary, instead of directly matching the keywords and tags, we consider tags of an image collectively to predict the underlying semantic field.",
        "Ideally, the semantic field can highlight the major visual concepts in images so that we can assign the correct semantic labels to the images.",

        "These works suggest that we can transfer the problem of visual concept detection to that of finding a text focus.",

        "2003) and continuous relevance model (Lavrenko and Jeon, 2003).",

        "Figures 8 and 9 report the performance in precision and recall respectively.",
        "From the results, we find that our approach is better than that of the baseline system in both precision and recall.",
        "This is because on one hand the Semantic Field tackles the ambiguous and noisy tag problems so that we could improve the precision.",
        "On the other hand, the Semantic Field analysis includes many highly related tags, which tackle the incomplete tags problem so that it could improve the performance in recall.",
        "Semantic Fields combine three information sources: WordNet, Wikipedia and the tag's cooccurrence information in the NUS-Wide corpus.",

        "Figure 10: The comparison between using single information source and fusion of multiple information sources.",
        "From Figure 10, we find that the performance of using WordNet alone obtains the worst result.",
        "This is because the number of tags carries the most common sense is limited and there are some noisy words in the description.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, the occurrence of the word \"long\" does not imply the occurrence of the concept \"bear\".",
        "Due to the lack of further information, using WordNet alone can hardly remove the noisy tag \"long\".",
        "The test result shows that such noisy information significantly degrade the performance of the system.",
        "This suggests the importance of incorperating other sources of informaiton to provide more complete information for the analysis.",
        "We can also observe that using Wikipedia or tag co-occurrence shows comparatively better performance.",
        "This is because both information sources include abundance information for analysis.",
        "Thus, compared to the keyword-based approach, the performance of the systems shows around 17% improvement.",
        "Finally, fusing the three information sources results in the best MAP performance.",
        "This is because information from different sources complements each other and helps in reducing the effects of the noisy, ambiguous and incomplete tags."
