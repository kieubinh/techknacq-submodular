        "In this paper we present a recent investigation into the role of linguistic cues in dialogue act (DA) classification.",
        "Dialogue acts (Bunt, 1994) are annotations over segments of dialogue that characterise the function of those segments.",
        "Linguistic cues, which can take many forms including lexical and syntactic structures, are features that can serve as useful indicators of discourse structure (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "In prior work, several researchers have shown that cue phrases can be a powerful feature for DA classification (Samuel et al., 1999; Webb et al., 2005a).",
        "Webb and Liu (2008) have previously shown that cue phrases automatically extracted from one corpus can be used to classify utterances from a new corpus.",
        "We take this approach and apply it to two established corpora with manually encoded dialogue act annotations, to investigate both the existence and the usefulness of cue phrases shared between the two corpora."

        "In parallel with the increased availability of manually annotated dialogue corpora there has been a proliferation of literature detailing dialogue act labelling as a classification task.",
        "Prior work describes the selection of features from the corpus (including word n-grams, cue phrases, syntactic structures, dialogue history and prosodic cues) which are then passed to some machine learning algorithm.",
        "Most studies have concentrated on a single corpus, and optimised feature selection and learning algorithm accordingly.",
        "In this work we focus on two corpora, Switchboard and ICSI-MRDA, and discuss prior classification efforts relating to these two corpora.",
        "The Switchboard corpus contains a large number of approximately 5-minute conversations between two people who are unknown to each other, who were asked to converse about a range of everyday topics with little or no constraint.",
        "The DA annotated portion of the Switchboard corpus (Juraf-sky et al., 1997) consists of 1155 annotated conversations, containing some 225,000 utterances, of which we use 200,000 utterances, the rest being held out for separate experiments.",
        "The dialogues are annotated with a non-hierarchical variant of the DAMSL annotation scheme (Core et al., 1999).",
        "The resulting Switchboard-DAMSL annotation was a set of more than 220 distinct labels.",
        "To obtain enough data per class for statistical modelling purposes, a clustered tag set was devised, which distinguishes 42 mutually exclusive DA types.",
        "Classification over the Switchboard corpus has been demonstrated using Decision Trees (Verbree et al., 2006), Memory-Based Learning (Rotaru, 2002) and Hidden Markov of Stolcke et al.",
        "(2000) is often cited as the best performing, achieving a classification accuracy of 71% over the 42 labels, although there is no cross-validation of these results.",
        "The approach of Stol-cke et al.",
        "(2000) combines HMM modelling of utterances with a tri-gram model of DA sequences.",
        "Webb et al.",
        "(2005a) report a slightly lower cross-validated score (of 69%) containing an individual classification high of 72%, using an intra-utterance, cue-based classification model.",
        "Like the Switchboard corpus, the ICSI Meeting was annotated using a variant of the DAMSL tagset, similar but not identical to the Switchboard-DAMSL annotation.",
        "The differences (and a translation between the two sets) can be seen in Shriberg et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "The underlying domain of the dialogues in the ICSI-MRDA corpus was that of multi-party meetings, with multiple participants discussing an agenda of items in a structured meeting.",
        "This application required the introduction of new tags specifically for this scenario, such as a label introduced to indicate when an utterance was used to take control of the meeting.",
        "The ICSI-MRDA corpus comprises 75 naturally occurring meetings, each around an hour in length.",
        "The section of the corpus we use consists of around 105,000 utterances.",
        "For each utterance in the corpus, one general tag was assigned, with zero or more additional specific tags.",
        "Excluding non-labelled cases, there are 11 general tags and 39 specific tags resulting in 1,260 unique dialogue acts used in the annotation.",
        "As with the Switchboard corpus, processing steps were introduced that compressed the number of unique DAs to 55.",
        "In later work, the dimensionality was further reduced, resulting in a subset of just 5 labels.",
        "Over the ICSI-MRDA corpus, we also see DA classification efforts using Decision Trees (Verbree et al., 2006) and Memory-Based Learning (Lendvai and Geertzen, 2007), in addition to",
        "Graph Models (Ji and Bilmes, 2006) and Maximum Entropy (Ang et al., 2005).",
        "Comparatively few approaches have been applied to the 55-label annotated corpus, with most choosing to focus on the 5-label clustering, presumably for the resulting increase in score.",
        "When Ji and Bilmes (2005) apply a Graph Model to the 55 category corpus, they achieve a classification accuracy of 66%.",
        "However, when they apply the exact same method to the 5-label corpus (Ji and Bilmes, 2006), classification accuracy is boosted to 81%.",
        "The best reported classification score on the the 5-label version of the corpus is reported by Verbree et al.",
        "(2006), who achieve 89% classification accuracy by modelling the words of the utterance, the DA history and some orthographic information (such as the presence of question marks).",
        "It remains very difficult to directly compare approaches, even when applied to the same corpus, so cross-corpora comparisons must be carefully considered.",
        "There are issues of the DA label set used, the labels considered and those ignored, the preprocessing of the corpus, the use of orthographic information, or prosody and so on.",
        "What seems clear is that there are no obvious leading contender for algorithm best suited to the DA classification task.",
        "Instead, we focus on the features used for DA classification."

        "First, below some maximal predictivity score, we assume that phrases will no longer be discriminative enough to be useful for labelling DAs.",

        "In their experiments, Samuel et al.",
        "(1999) constructed all n-grams of lengths 1 through 3 from the corpus, and then applied a range of measures which pruned the n-gram list until only candidate cue phrases remained.",
        "In order to test the effectiveness of these automatically acquired cue phrases, Samuel et al.",
        "(1999) passed them as features to a machine learning method, in their case transformation-based learning.",
        "More formally, we can describe our criteria, predictivity, for selecting cue phrases from the set of all possible cue phrases in the following way.",
        "The predictivity of phrase c for DA d is the conditional probability P(d|c), where:",
        "We represent the set of all possible cue phrases (all n-grams length 1 â€“ 4 from the corpus) as C, so given c G C : c represents some possible cue phrase.",
        "Similarly, D is the set of all dialogue act labels, and d G D : d represents some dialogue act label.",
        "Therefore #(c) is the count of (possible) cue phrase c in corpus, and #(c&d) is the count of occurrences of phrase c in utterances with dialogue act d in the training data.",
        "The maximal predictivity of a cue phrase c, written as mp(c), is defined as:",
        "In their experiments, Samuel et al.",

        "For our experiments, the word n-grams used as potential cue phrases during are automatically extracted from training data.",
        "All word n-grams of length 14 within the data are considered as candidates.",
        "The maximal predictivity of each cue phrase can be computed directly from the corpus.",
        "We can use this value as one threshold for pruning potential cue phrases from our model.",
        "Removing n-grams below some predictivity threshold will improve the compactness of the model produced.",
        "Another reasonable threshold would appear to be the frequency count of each potential cue phrase.",
        "Phrases which have a low frequency score are likely to have very high predictivity scores, possibly skewing the model as a whole.",
        "For example, any potential cue phrase which occurs only once will de-facto have a 100% predictivity score.",
        "We can use a minimal count value (t# ) and minimal predictivity thresholds (tmp) to prune the set C* of 'useful' cue phrases derived from the training data, as defined by:",
        "The n-grams that remain after this thresholding process are those we identify as cue phrases.",

        "We observed that cue phrases that contain a <start> tag (as described in Section 4) were used in the majority of cases.",
        "Our final experiment was to extract, from the 577 cue phrases, only those phrases that contain the <start> tag.",
        "This reduced the average number of cue phrases to 242.",
        "Classification performance remains unaffected, scoring an average of 72.52% for Switchboard and 47.30% for ICSI-MRDA, as seen in Condition (5) in the results tables.",
        "We note that of those 242 phrases, 148 appear in the intersection of every training fold of our 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "When we use only those 148 cue phrases for classification, as seen in Condition (6), average classification accuracy remains the same; 72.09% for Switchboard, and 46.34% for ICSI-MRDA."

        "In this paper, we investigate a cue-based approach to DA classification, applied to two corpora, Switchboard and ICSI-MRDA.",
        "We automatically extracted cue phrases from both corpora, and used them directly to classify unseen utterances from the corresponding corpus, demonstrating that our automatically discovered cue phrases are a sufficiently useful feature for this task.",
        "We then explored the generality of our cue phrases, by applying them directly as a classifier to data from the alternate corpus.",
        "Whilst there was some expected drop in performance, the classification accuracy for both experiments is good, given such a small number of features and the simple design of the classifier.",
        "The result indicates that cue phrases are a highly useful feature for DA classification, and can be used to classify data from new corpora, possibly as some part of some quasi-automatic first annotation effort.",
        "We experimented with reducing the set of cue phrases, using increasingly restrictive measures of retaining our automatically discovered cues.",
        "We found that we did not have a drop in performance compared to the cross-corpus classification accuracy, even when the cue set is drastically reduced (to 0.001% of the original Switchboard cue phrases, and 0.003% of the ICSI-MRDA cue phrases).",
        "This appears to be a strong indicator of the discriminative power of some small number of automatically discovered core cue phrases."
