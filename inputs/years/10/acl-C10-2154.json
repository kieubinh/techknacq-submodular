        "Recently various syntax-based models have been extensively investigated in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), including models between source trees and target strings (Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), source strings and target trees (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008), or source trees and target trees (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009).",
        "In these models, automatic extraction of translation rules is an important issue, in which translation rules are typically extracted using parse trees on source/target-language side or both sides of the bilingual text.",
        "Exploiting the syntactic information encoded in translation rules, syntax-based systems have shown to achieve comparable performance with phrase-based systems, even outperform them in some cases (Marcu et al., 2006).",
        "Among all the factors contributing to the success of syntax-based systems, rule coverage has been proved to be an important one that affects the translation accuracy of syntax-based systems (DeNeefe et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2008).",
        "However, these systems suffer from a problem that translation rules are extracted using only 1-best parse tree generated by a single parser, which generally results in relatively low rule coverage due to the limited scope in rule extraction (Mi and Huang, 2008).",
        "To alleviate this problem, a straightforward solution is to enlarge the scope of rule extraction, and obtain translation rules by using a group of diversified parse trees instead of a single parse tree.",
        "For example, Mi and Huang (2008) used £-best parses and forest to extract translation rules for improving the rule coverage in their forest-based SMT system, and achieved promising results.",
        "However, most previous work used the parse trees generated by only one parser, which still suffered somewhat from the relatively low diversity in the outputs of a single parser.",
        "Addressing this issue, we investigate how to extract diversified translation rules using multiple parsers.",
        "As different parsers (or parsing models) can provide us with parse trees having relatively large diversity, we believe that it is beneficial to employ multiple different parsers to obtain diversified translation rules and thus enlarge the rule coverage.",
        "Motivated by this idea, we propose a simple and effective method to improve rule coverage by using multiple parsers in rule extraction.",
        "Furthermore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the effectiveness of our method on Chinese-English translation in a string-to-tree system.",
        "Experimental results show that our method improves the baseline system by over 0.9 BLEU points on both NIST 2004 and 2005 test corpora, even achieves a +1 BLEU improvement when working with the k-best extraction method.",
        "More interestingly, we observe that the MT performance is not very sensitive to the parsing performance of the parsers used in rule extraction.",
        "Actually, the MT system does not show different preferences for different parsers.",
        "Related Work",
        "In machine translation, some efforts have been made to improve rule coverage and advance the performance of syntax-based systems.",
        "For example, Galley et al.",
        "(2006) proposed the idea of rule composing which composes two or more rules with shared states to form a larger, composed rule.",
        "Their experimental results showed that the rule composing method could significantly improve the translation accuracy of their syntax-based system.",
        "Following Galley et al.",
        "(2006)'s work, Marcu et al.",
        "(2006) proposed SPMT models to improve the coverage of phrasal rules, and demonstrated that the system performance could be further improved by using their proposed models.",
        "Wang et al.",
        "(2007) described a binarization method that binarized parse trees to improve the rule coverage on non-syntactic mappings.",
        "DeNeefe et al.",
        "(2007) analy-ized the phrasal coverage problem, and compared the phrasal coverage as well as translation accuracy for various rule extraction methods (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007).",
        "As another research direction, some work is focused on enlarging the scope of rule extraction to improve rule coverage.",
        "For example, (Venuextracted rules from the k-best parses and forest generated by a single parser to alleviate the problem of the limited scope of 1-best parse, and achieved promising results.",
        "Our work differs from previous work in that we are concerned with obtaining diversified translation rules using multiple different parsers (or parsing models) instead of a single parser (or parsing model).",
        "It can be regarded as an enhancement of previous studies.",
        "As shown in the following parts of this paper, it works very well with the existing techniques, such as rule composing (Galley et al., 2006), SPMT models (Marcu et al., 2006) and rule extraction with k-best parses (Venugopal et al., 2008).",
        "Translation Rule Extraction",
        "In this work, the issue of translation rule extraction is studied in the string-to-tree model proposed by Galley et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "We choose this model because it has been shown to be one of the state-of-the-art syntax-based models, and has been adopted in the most successful systems in",
        "NIST 2009 MT evaluation.",
        "Typically, (string-to-tree) translation rules are learned from the word-aligned bilingual text whose target-side has been parsed using a syntactic parser.",
        "As the basic unit of translation, a translation rule consists of sequence words or variables in the source language, and a syntax tree in the target language having words (terminals) and variables (non-terminals) at leaves.",
        "Figure 1 shows the translation rules extracted from a word-aligned sentence pair with a targetside parse tree.",
        "Rules extracted using Berkeley Parser",
        "(b) rule extraction using Collins Parser (Model 2)",
        "Figure 2: Rule extraction using two different parsers (Berkeley Parser and Collins Parser).",
        "The shaded rectangles denote the translation rules that can be extracted from the parse tree generated by one parser but cannot be extracted from the parse tree generated by the other parser.",
        "To obtain basic translation rules, the (minimal) GHKM extraction method proposed in (Galley et al., 2004) is utilized.",
        "The basic idea of GHKM extraction is to compute the set of the minimally-sized translation rules that can explain the mappings between source-language string and target-language tree while respecting the alignment and reordering between the two languages.",
        "For example, from the string-tree pair shown at the top of Figure 1, we extract the minimal GHKM translation rules r1-6.",
        "In addition to",
        "GHKM extraction, the SPMT models (Marcu et al., 2006) are employed to obtain phrasal rules that are not covered by GHKM extraction.",
        "For example, rule r8 in Figure 1 is a SPMT rule that is not obtained in GHKM extraction.",
        "Finally, the rule composing method (Galley et al., 2006) is used to compose two or more minimal GHKM or SPMT rules having shared states to form larger rules.",
        "For example, rule r7 in Figure 1 is generated by composing rules r2 and r6.",
        "4 Differences in Coverage between Rule Extractions with Different Parsers",
        "As described above, translation rule extraction relies on the outputs (parse trees) of parsers.",
        "As different parsers generally have large diversity between their outputs, rule extractions with different parsers generally result in very different sets of rules.",
        "For example, Figure 2 shows the rule extractions on a word-aligned sentence pair having two target-trees generated by Berkeley Parser and Collins Parser, respectively.",
        "It is observed that Figure 2 (a) and (b) cover different sets of rule due to the different target-trees used in rule extraction.",
        "Particularly, well-formed rules ra7-a9 are extracted in Figure 2 (a), while they do not appear in Figure 2 (b).",
        "Also, rules rb7-b9 in Figure 2 (b) have the similar situation.",
        "This observation gives us an intuition that there is a \"complementarity\" between the rules extracted using different parsers.",
        "We also conduct a quantitative study to investigate the impact of using different parsers (Berkeley Parser and Collins Parser) on rule coverage.",
        "Tables 1 shows the statistics of the rules extracted from 370K Chinese-English parallel sentence pairs using the method described in Section 3.",
        "In addition to the total number of rules extracted, the numbers of phrasal rules and useful rules are also reported to indicate the rule coverage of a rule set.",
        "Here phrasal rule refers to the rule whose source-side and the yield of its target-side contains only one phrase each, with optional surrounding variables.",
        "According to (DeNeefe et al., 2007), the number of phrasal rules is a good indicator of the coverage of a rule set.",
        "useful rule refers to the rule that can be applied when decoding the test sentences .",
        "As shown in Table 1, the two resulting rule sets only have about 70% overlaps (Column 4), and the rule coverage increases by about 20% when we combine them together (Column 5).",
        "This finding confirms that the rule coverage can be improved by using multiple different parsers in rule extraction."

        "On both test sets, using three parsers in rule extraction generally yields a +0.7 BLEU improvement, and using all the parsers together yields a +0.9 BLEU improvement which is the biggest improvement achieved in this set of experiment.",

        "In this work, all the parsers are trained using the same treebank.",
        "To obtain diversified parse trees for multi-parser based rule extraction, an alternative way is to learn parsers on treebanks annotated by different organizations (e.g. Penn Treebank and ICE-GB corpus).",
        "Since different treebanks can provide us with more diversity in parsing, we believe that our system can benefit a lot from the parsers that are learned on multiple different treebanks individually.",
        "But here is a problem that due to the different annotation standards used, there is generally an incompatibility between treebanks annotated by different organizations.",
        "It will result in that we cannot straightforwardly mix the resulting rule sets (or heterogeneous grammars for short) for probability estimation as well as the use for decoding.",
        "To solve this problem, a simple solution might be that we transform the incompatible rules into a unified form.",
        "Alternatively, we can use hetero- geneous decoding (or parsing) techniques (Zhu et al., 2010) to make use of heterogeneous grammars in the stage of decoding.",
        "Both topics are very interesting and worth studying in our future work.",
        "Besides /-best extraction, our method can also be applied to other rule extraction schemes, such as forest-based rule extraction.",
        "As (Mi and Huang, 2008) has shown that forest-based extraction is more effective than /-best extraction in improving translation accuracy, it is expected to achieve further improvements by using multiparser based rule extraction and forest-based rule extraction together.",
        "Conclusions",
        "In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to improve rule coverage by using multiple parsers in translation rule extraction.",
        "Experimental results show that",
        "• Using multiple parsers in rule extraction achieves large improvements of rule coverage over the baseline method where only a single parser is used, as well as a +0.9 BLEU improvement on both NIST 2004 and 2005 test corpora.",
        "• The MT system can be further improved by using multiple parsers and /-best parses together.",
        "However, with the consideration of extraction speed, it might not be a good choice to use /-best parses to improve multi-parser based rule extraction in practice.",
        "• The MT performance is not influenced by the parsing performance of the parsers used in rule extraction very much.",
        "Actually, the MT system does not show different preferences for different parsers."
