        "Minimally supervised machine-learning approaches to learning rules or patterns for relation extraction (RE) in a bootstrapping framework are regarded as very effective methods for building information extraction (IE) systems and for adapting them to new domains (e. g., (Riloff, 1996), (Brin, 1998), (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), (Yangarber, 2001), (Sudo et al., 2003), (Jones, 2005), (Greenwood and Stevenson, 2006), (Agichtein, 2006), (Xu et al., 2007), (Xu, 2007)).",
        "On the one hand, these approaches show very promising results by utilizing minimal domain knowledge as seeds.",
        "On the other hand, they are all confronted with the same problem, i.e., the acquisition of wrong rules because of missing knowledge for their validation during bootstrapping.",
        "Various approaches to confidence estimation of learned rules have been proposed as well as methods for identifying \"so-called\" negative rules for increasing the precision value (e.g., (Brin, 1998), (Agichtein and Gravano, 2009)).",
        "In this paper, we present a new approach to estimating or ranking the confidence value of learned rules by utilizing limited closed-world knowledge.",
        "As many predecessors, our ranking method is built on the \"Duality Principle\" (e.g., (Brin, 1998), (Yangarber, 2001) and (Agichtein, 2006)).",
        "We extend the validation method by an evaluation of extracted instances against some limited closed-world knowledge, while also allowing cases in which knowledge for informed decisions is not available.",
        "In comparison to previous approaches to negative examples or negative rules such as (Yangarber, 2003), (Etzioni et al., 2005) and (Uszkoreit et al., 2009), we implicitly generate many negative examples by utilizing the positive examples in the closed-world portion of our knowledge.",
        "Rules extracting wrong instances are lowered in rank.",
        "In (Xu et al., 2007) and (Xu, 2007), we develop a generic framework for learning rules for relations of varying complexity, called DARE (Domain Adaptive Relation Extraction).",
        "Furthermore, there is a systematic error analysis of the baseline system conducted in (Xu, 2007).",
        "We employ our system both as a baseline reference and as a platform for implementing and evaluating our new method.",
        "Our first experiments conducted on the same data used in (Xu et al., 2007) demonstrate: 1) limited closed-world knowledge is very useful and effective for improving rule confidence estimation and precision of relation extraction; 2) integration of soft constraints boosts the confidence value of the good and relevant rules, but without strongly decreasing the recall value.",
        "In addition, we validate our method on a new corpus of newspaper texts about celebrities and obtain promising results.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the relevant related work.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 describe DARE and our extensions.",
        "Section 5 reports the experiments with two ranking strategies and their results.",

        "For estimation of confidence/relevance values of rules, most of the approaches follow the so-called \"Duality Principle\" as mentioned by Brin (1998) and Yangarber (2001), namely, the confidence value of learned rules is dependent on the confidence value of their origins, which can be documents or relation instances.",
        "For example, Riloff (1996), Yangarber (2001), Sudo et al.",

        "Their methods are aimed at detecting all patterns for a specific domain, but those patterns cannot be applied directly to a specific relation.",
        "In contrast, systems presented by Brin (1998), Agichtein learn rules for a specific relation.",
        "They start with some relation instances as their so-called \"semantic seeds\" and detect rules from texts matching with these instances.",
        "The new rules are applied to new texts for extracting new instances.",
        "These new instances in turn are utilized as new seeds.",
        "All these systems calculate their rule confidence based on the confidence values of the instances from which they stem.",
        "In addition to the confidence value of the seed instances, most of them also consider frequency information and include some heuristics for extra validation.",
        "For example, Agichtein (2006) intellectually defines certain constraints for evaluating the truth value of extracted instances.",
        "But it is not clear whether this strategy can be adapted to new domains and other relations.",
        "In (Xu et al., 2007) we make use of domain relevance values of terms occurring in rules.",
        "This method is not applicable to general relations.",
        "Parallel to confidence estimation strategies, the learning of negative rules is useful for identifying wrong rules straightforwardly.",
        "Yangarber (2003) and Etzioni et al.",
        "(2005) utilize the so-called Counter-Training for detecting negative rules for a specific domain or a specific class by learning from multiple domains or classes at the same time.",
        "Examples of one certain domain or class are regarded as negative examples for the other ones.",
        "Bunescu and Mooney (2007) follow a classification-based approach to RE.",

        "Uszkoreit et al.",
        "(2009) exploit negative examples as seeds for learning further negative instances and negative rules.",

        "step 4 excludes dangerous rules such as the one in Figure 7 which drastically boosts the precision.",
        "Unfortunately, the exclusion of such general rules leads to the loss of many correct relation instances too, therefore, the immense drop of recall from threshold 3 to 4 as well as from threshold 4 to 5.",
        "Positive extraction rules such as Figure 8 are quite highly scored.",
        "Because of the large number of rules and instances, we start the quality analysis of rules with score 3.",

        "We propose a new way in which prior knowledge about domains can be efficiently used as additional criteria for confidence estimation of learned new rules or new instances in a minimally supervised machine learning framework.",
        "By introducing rule scoring on the basis of available domain knowledge (the cwDB), rules can be evaluated during the bootstrapping process with respect to their extraction precision.",
        "The results are rather promising.",
        "The rule score threshold is an easy way for users of an extraction system to adjust the precision-recall-trade-off to their own needs.",
        "The rule estimation method is also general enough to extend to integration of common sense knowledge.",
        "Although the relation instances in the closed-world knowledge database can also be used as seed in the beginning, the core idea of our research work is to develop a general confidence estimation strategy for discovered new information.",
        "As discussed in (Xu, 2007) and (Uszkoreit et al., 2009), the size of seed is not always relevant for the learning and extraction performance, in particular if the data corpus exhibits the small world property.",
        "Using all instances in the cwDB as seed, our experiments with the baseline system yield worse precision performance than the modified DARE algorithm with only one seed instance.",
        "This approach is quite general and easily adaptable to many domains; the only prerequisite is the existence of a database with relation instances from the target domain with a fulfilled closed-world property on some relational argument.",
        "A database of this kind should be easily obtainable for many domains, e. g. by exploiting structured and semi-structured information sources in the Internet, such as YAGO (Suchanek et al.",
        "(2007)) and DBpedia (Bizer et al.",
        "(2009)).",
        "Furthermore, in some areas, such as Business Intelligence, there is nearly complete knowledge already present for past years, while the task is to extract information only from recent news articles.",
        "Constructing closed-worlds out of the present knowledge to improve the learning of new information is therefore a straightforward approach.",
        "Even the manual collection of suitable data might be a reasonable choice since appropriate closed worlds could be rather small if cwDBis chosen properly."
