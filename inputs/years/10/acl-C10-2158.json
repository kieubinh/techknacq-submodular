        "The use of empty categories to represent the syntactic structure ofa sentence is the hallmark ofthe generative linguistics and they represent an important source of information in treebanks annotated in this linguistic tradition.",
        "The use of empty categories in the annotation of treebanks started with the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), and this practice is continued in the Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005) and the Arabic Treebank, the Penn series of treebanks.",
        "Empty categories come in a few different varieties, serving different purposes.",
        "One use of empty categories is to mark the extraction site of an dislocated phrase, thus effectively reconstructing the canonical structure of a sentence, allowing easy extraction of its predicate-argument structure.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the empty category *T*-1 is coindexed with the dislocated topic NP T (\"Ningbo\"), indicating that the canonical position of this NP is next to the verb M (\"come\").",
        "The empty category effectively localizes the syntactic dependency between the verb and this NP, making it easier to detect and extract this relation.",
        "Marking the extraction site of a dislocated item is not the only use of empty categories.",
        "For languages like Chinese, empty categories are also used to represent dropped pronouns.",
        "Chinese is a pro-drop language (Huang, 1989) and subject pronouns are routinely dropped.",
        "Recovering these elliptical elements is important to many natural language applications.",
        "When translated into another language, for example, these dropped pronouns may have to be made explicit and replaced with overt pronouns or noun phrases if the target language does not allow dropped pronouns.",
        "Although empty categories have been an integral part of the syntactic representation of a sentence ever since the Penn Treebank was first constructed, it is only recently that they are starting to receive the attention they deserve.",
        "Works on automatic detection of empty categories started to emerge (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Campbell, 2004; Gabbard et al., 2006) after substantial progress has been made in statistical syntactic parsing.",
        "This progress has been achieved after over a decade of intensive research on syntactic parsing that has essentially left the empty categories behind (Collins, 1999; Char-niak, 2000).",
        "Empty categories were and still are routinely pruned out in parser evaluations (Black et al., 1991).",
        "They have been excluded from the parser development and evaluation cycle not so much because their importance was not understood, but because researchers haven't figured out ningbo Ningbo \"Ningbo, this is the third time I came here.\"",
        "Figure 1 : A CTB tree with empty categories",
        "NP-OBJ -NONEa way to incorporate the empty category detection in the parsing process.",
        "In fact, the detection of empty categories relies heavily on the other components of the syntactic representation, and as a result, empty category recovery is often formulated as postprocessing problem after the skeletal structure of a syntactic parse has been determined.",
        "As work on English has demonstrated, empty category detection can be performed with high accuracy given high-quality skeletal syntactic parses as input.",
        "Because Chinese allows dropped pronouns and thus has more varieties of empty categories than languages like English, it can be argued that there is added importance in Chinese empty category detection.",
        "However, to our knowledge, there has been little work in this area, and the work we report here represents the first effort in Chinese empty category detection.",
        "Our results are promising, but they also show that Chinese empty category detection is a very challenging problem mostly because Chinese syntactic parsing is difficult and still lags significantly behind the state of the art in English parsing.",
        "We show that given skeletal gold-standard parses (with empty categories pruned out), the empty detection can be performed with a fairly high accuracy of almost 89%.",
        "The performance drops significantly, to 63%, when the output of an automatic parser is used.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we formulate the empty category detection as a binary classification problem where each word is labeled as either having a empty category before it or not.",
        "This makes it possible to use any standard machine learning technique to solve this problem.",
        "The key is to find the appropriate set of features.",
        "Section 3 describes the features we use in our experiments.",
        "We present our experimental results in Section 4.",
        "There are two experimental conditions, one with gold standard treebank parses (stripped of empty categories) as input and the other with automatic parses.",
        "Section 5 describes related work and Section 6 conclude our paper.",
        "2 Formulating the empty category detection as a tagging problem",
        "In the CTB, empty categories are marked in a parse tree which represents the hierarchical structure of a sentence, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "There are eight types of empty categories annotated in the CTB, and they are listed in Table 1.",
        "Among them, *pro* and *PRO* are used to represent nominal empty categories, *T* and *NP* are used to represent traces of dislocated items, *OP* is used to represent empty relative pronouns in relative clauses, and *RNR* is used to represent pseudo attachment.",
        "The reader is referred to the CTB bracketing manual (Xue and Xia, 2000) for detailed descriptions and examples.",
        "As can be seen from Table 1, the distribution of these empty categories is very uneven, and many of these empty categories do not occur very often.",
        "As a first step of learning an empty category model, we treat all the empty categories as a unified type, and for each word in the sentence, we only try to decide if there is an empty category before it.",
        "This amounts to an empty category detection task, and the objective is to first locate the empty categories without attempting to determine the specific empty category type.",
        "Instead of predicting the locations of the empty categories in a parse tree and having a separate classifier for each syntactic construction where an empty category is likely to occur, we adopt a linear view of the parse tree and treat empty categories, along with overt word tokens, as leaves in the tree.",
        "This allows us to identify the location of the empty categories in relation to overt word tokens in the same sentence, as illustrated in Example (1):",
        "In this representation, the position ofthe empty category can be defined either in relation to the previous or the next word, or both.",
        "To make this even more amenable to machine learning approaches, we further reformulate the problem as a tagging problem so that each overt word is labeled either with EC, indicating there is an empty category before this word, or NEC, indicating there is no empty category.",
        "This reformulated representation is illustrated in Example (2):",
        "In (2), the EC label attached to the final period indicates that there is an empty category before this punctuation mark.",
        "There is a small price to pay with this representation: when there is more than one empty category before a word, it is indistinguishable from cases where there is only one empty category.",
        "What we have gained is a simple unified representation for all empty categories that lend itself naturally to machine learning approaches.",
        "Another advantage is that for natural language applications that do not need the full parse trees but only need the empty categories, this representation provides an easy-to-use representation for those applications.",
        "Since this linear-lized representation is still aligned with its parse tree, we still have easy access to the full hierarchical structure of this tree from which useful features can be extracted."

        "Johnson (2002) describes a pattern-matching algorithm for recovering empty nodes from phrase structure trees.",

        "He evaluated his approach both on Penn Treebank gold standard trees stripped of the empty categories and on the output of the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000).",
        "(Dienes and Dubey, 2003) describes an empty detection method that is similar to ours in that it treats empty detection as a tagging problem.",
        "The difference is that the tagging is done without access to any syntactic information so that the identified empty categories along with word tokens in the sentence can then be fed into a parser.",
        "The success of this approach depends on strong local cues such as infinitive markers and participles, which are non-existent in Chinese.",
        "Not surprisingly, our model yields low accuracy if only lexical features are used.",
        "Cambell (2004) proposes an algorithm that uses linguistic principles in empty category recovery.",
        "He argues that a rule-based approach might perform well for this problem because the locations of the empty categories, at least in English, are inserted by annotators who follow explicit linguistic principles.",

        "Their approach is similar to ours in that they treat empty category recovery as a post-processing process and use a machine learning algorithm that has access to the skeletal information in the parse tree.",
        "Their approach is different from ours in that they have different classifiers for different types of empty categories.",
        "Although generally higher accuracies are reported in works on English empty category recovery, cross-linguistic comparison is difficult because both the types of empty categories and the linguistic cues that are accessible to machine learning algorithms are different.",
        "For example, there are no empty complementizers annotated in the CTB while English does not allow dropped pronouns."

        "We describe a unified framework to recover empty categories for Chinese given skeletal parse trees as input.",
        "In this framework, empty detection is formulated as a tagging problem where each word in the sentence receives a tag indicating whether there is an empty category before it.",
        "This advantage of this approach is that it is amenable to learning-based approaches and can be addressed with a variety of machine learning algorithms.",
        "Our results based on a Maximum Entropy model show that given skeletal gold standard parses, empty categories can be recovered with very high accuracy (close to 90%).",
        "We also report promising results (over 63%).",
        "when automatic parses produced by an off-the-shelf parser is used as input.",
        "Detecting empty categories is only the first step towards fully reproducing the syntactic representation in the CTB, and the obvious next step is to also classify these empty categories into different types and wherever applicable, link the empty categories to their antecedent.",
