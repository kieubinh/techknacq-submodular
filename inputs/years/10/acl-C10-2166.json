        "The development of a large-scale treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Hajic et al., 2000; Brants et al., 2002) with rich syntactic annotations is a highly rewarding task.",
        "But the huge amount of manual labor required for the annotation task itself, as well as the difficulties in standardizing linguistic analyses, results in long development cycles of such valuable language resources, which typically amounts to years or even decades.",
        "Despite the profound scientific and practical value of detailed syntactic treebanks, the requirement and necessity for long-term commitment raises the risk",
        "^The first author thanks the German Excellence Cluster of Multimodal Computing and Interaction for the support of the work.",
        "cost of such projects, a fact which often makes them not feasible in many current economical environments.",
        "In recent years, computational grammars have been employed to assist the construction of such language resources.",
        "A typical development model involves a parser which generates candidate analyses, and human annotators who manually identify the desired tree structure.",
        "This treebanking method dramatically reduces the cost of training annotators, for they are not required to spontaneously produce linguistic solutions to various phenomena.",
        "Instead, they are trained to associate their language intuition with specific linguistically-relevant decisions.",
        "How to select and carefully present such decisions to the annotators is thus crucial for achieving high annotation speed and quality.",
        "On the other hand, for large treebanking projects, parallel annotation with multiple annotators is usually necessary.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement is a crucial quality measure in such cases.",
        "But improvements on annotation speed should not be achieved at expense of the quality of the treebank.",
        "With both speed and quality in mind, a good treebank annotation method should acknowledge the complexity of the decision-making process; for instance, the same tree can be disambiguated by different sets of individual decisions which are mutually dependent.",
        "The annotation method should also strive to create a distraction-free environment for annotators who can then focus on making the judgments.",
        "To this effect, we present a simple statistical model that learns from the annotation history, and offers a ranking of disambiguation decisions from the most to the least relevant ones, which enables well-trained human annotators to speed-up treebanking without compromising on the quality of the linguistic decisions guiding the annotation task.",
        "The remaining of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the difficulties in syntactic annotation, and the potential ways of improving the annotation efficiency without damaging the quality; Section 3 presents the new annotation method which is based on a statistical discriminant ranking model; Sections 4 and 5 describe the setup and results of a series of annotation experiments; Section 6 concludes the paper and proposes future research directions."

        "Large-scale full syntactic annotation has for quite some time been approached with mixed feelings by researchers.",
        "On the one hand, detailed syntactic annotation serves as a basis for corpus-linguistic study and data-driven NLP methods.",
        "Especially, when combined with popular supervised machine learning methods, richly annotated language resources, like, for instance, treebanks, play a key role in modern computational linguistics.",
        "The public availability of large-scale treebanks in recent years has stimulated the blossoming of data-driven approaches to syntactic and semantic parsing.",
        "On the other hand, though, the creation of detailed syntactic structures turns out to be an extremely challenging task.",
        "From the choice of the appropriate linguistic framework and the design of the annotation scheme to the choice of the text source and the working protocols on the syn-cronization of the parallel development, as well as the quality assurance, none of these steps in the entire annotation procedure is considered a solved issue.",
        "Given the vast design choices, very few of the treebanking projects have made it through all these difficult annotation stages.",
        "Even the most outstanding projects have not been completed without receiving criticisms.",
        "Our treebanking project is no exception.",
        "The aim of the project is to provide annotations of the Wall Street Journal (henceforward WSJ) sections of the Penn Treebank (henceforward PTB (Marcus et al., 1993)) with the help of the English Resource Grammar (henceforward ERG; (Flickinger, 2002)), a handwritten large-scale and wide-coverage grammar of English in the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; (Pollard and Sag, 1994)).",
        "Such annotations are very rich linguistically, since apart from syntax they also incorporate semantic information.",
        "The annotation cycle is organized into iterations of parsing, treebanking in the sense of disambiguating syntactic and semantic analyses of the various linguistic phenomena contained in the corpus, error analysis and grammar/treebank update cycles.",
        "That is, sentences from the WSJ are first parsed with the PET parser (Callmeier, 2001) , an efficient unification-based parser, using the ERG.",
        "The parsing results are then manually disambiguated by human annotators.",
        "However, instead of considering individual trees, the annotation process is mostly invested on binary decisions which are made on either accepting or rejecting constructions or lexical types.",
        "Each of such decisions, called discriminants, as we will also see in the following, reduces the number of the trees satisfying the constraints.",
        "The process is presented in the next section in more detail.",
        "What should, though, be clear is that the aforementioned multicycle annotation procedure is as time-consuming and human-error prone as any other, despite the fact that at the center of the entire annotation cycle lies a valuable linguistic resource, which has been developed with a lot of effort over many years, namely the ERG.",
        "For the first period of this project, we have established an average speed of 40 sentences per annotator hour, meaning a total of ~1200 hours of annotation for the entire WSJ.",
        "Including the long training period at the beginning of the project, and periodical grammar and treebank updates, the project period is roughly two years with two part-time annotators employed."

        "One common characteristic of modern treebank-ing efforts - especially, in so-called dynamic treebanking platforms (cf., for instance, (Oepen et al., 2002) and http://redwoods.stanford.",
        "edu), like the one we are describing and referring to extensively in the following, is that the candidate trees are constructed automatically by the grammar, and then manually disambiguated by human annotators.",
        "In doing so, linguistically rich annotation is built efficiently with minimum manual labor.",
        "In order to further improve the manual disambiguation efficiency, systems like [incr tsdb()] (Oepen, 2001) compute the difference between candidate analyses.",
        "Instead of looking at the huge parse forest, the treebank annotators select or reject the features that distinguish between different parses, until no ambiguity remains (either one analysis is accepted from the parse forest, or all of them are rejected).",
        "The number of decisions for each sentence is normally around log2n where n is the total number of candidate trees.",
        "For a sentence with 5000 candidate readings, only about 12 treebanking decisions are required for a complete disambiguation.",
        "A similar method was also proposed in (Carter, 1997).",
        "Formally, an attribute that distinguishes between different parses is called a discriminant.",
        "For Redwoods-style treebanks, this is extracted either from the syntactic derivation trees or the semantic representations (in the form of Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; (Copestake et al., 2005))).",

        "as the head daughter.",
        "When the discriminant is clicked, the annotator can say yes or no to it, hence narrowing the remaining trees to the In Parses or Out Parses.",
        "The unknown button is used to mark the uncertainties and is rarely used.",
        "Note that in this interface, the discriminants are sorted in descending order according to their length, meaning that the discriminants related to higher level constructions are shown before the lexical type choices.",
        "When up to 500 parses are stored in the forest, the average number of discriminants per forest is about 100.",
        "Scanning through the long list manually can be time-consuming and distracting.",
        "Kordoni and Zhang (2009) show that annotators tend to start with the decisions with the most certainty, and delay the \"hard\" decisions as much as possible.",
        "As the decision progresses, many of the \"hard\" discriminants will receive an inferred value from the certain decisions.",
        "Our annotation guideline only describes specific decisions.",
        "The order in which discriminants are chosen is left underspecified and very much depends on personal styles.",
        "In practice, we see that our annotators gradually developed complex strategies which involve both top-down and bottom-up pruning.",
        "One potential drawback of such a discriminant-based treebanking method is that the process is very sensitive to decision errors.",
        "One wrong judgment can rule out the correct tree and ruin the analysis of the sentence.",
        "In such a case, the annotators usually resort to backtracking to previous decisions they had made.",
        "To compensate for this, we ask our annotators to double-check the treebanked analysis before saving the disambiguation result.",
        "And in case of doubt, they are instructed to avoid ambivalent decisions as much as possible.",
        "Suppose for a sentence w, a parse forest Y was generated by the grammar.",
        "Note that for efficiency reasons, the parse forest might have been trimmed to only contain up to n top readings ranked by the parse disambiguation model.",
        "For convenience, we note the parse forest Y as a set of parses {yi, y2,..., yn}.",
        "Each discriminant d defines a binary valued function ö on the parse forest (ö : Y H> {0,1}), which can be interpreted as whether a parse yi has attribute d or not.",
        "By the nature of this definition, each discriminant function defines a bipartition of the parse forest.",
        "When both subsets of the partition are non-empty, i.e., there exists at least one yp and yq such that ö(yp) = 0 and ö(yq) = 1, the discriminant is considered effective on the forest Y.",
        "In the following discussion, we are only considering the set of effective discriminants D for parse forest Y.",
        "Instead of directly predicting the outcome of disambiguation decision on each discriminant (i.e., whether the gold tree has discriminant function value 0 or 1), our model tries to measure the probability of a discriminant being chosen by human annotators, regardless of the yes/no decision.",
        "For each discriminant d, and the parse forest Y, a set of feature functions f1,f2,...,fk receive real values, and contribute to the following loglinear model:",
        "where A1, A2,..., Ak are the parameters of the model.",
        "To estimate these model parameters, we gather the annotation logs from our treebank annotators on the completed datasets with detailed information about each discriminant.",
        "Apart from the necessary information to reconstruct the discriminants from the forest, the log also contains the status information of i) whether the discriminant takes value 0 or 1 on the gold tree; ii) whether the human annotator has said yes or no to the discriminant.",
        "Note that the human annotator does not need to manually decide on the value of each discriminant.",
        "Whenever a new decision is made, the forest will be pruned to the subset oftrees compatible with the decision.",
        "And all remaining discriminants are checked for effectiveness on the pruned forest.",
        "Discriminants which become ineffective from previous decisions are said to have received inferred values.",
        "The parameters of the model are estimated by the open-source maximum entropy parameter estimation toolkit tadm.",
        "For training, we use all the manually disambiguated discriminants as positive instances, and automatically inferred discriminants as negative instances.",
        "The discriminant ranking model is applied during the manual annotation sessions.",
        "When a parse forest is loaded and the discriminants are constructed, each discriminant is assigned an (un-normalized) score i=1 Ajfj(d,Y), and the list of discriminants is sorted by descending order of the score accordingly.",
        "The scoring and sorting adds negligible additional computation on the treebanking software, and is not noticeable to the human annotators.",
        "By putting those discriminants that are potentially to be manually judged near the top of the list, the model saves manual labor on scanning through the lengthy list by filtering out ambivalent discriminants.",
        "Note that this discriminant ranking model predicts the possibility of a discriminant being manually disambiguated.",
        "It is not modeling the specific decision that the human annotator makes on the discriminant.",
        "Including the decision outcome in the model can potentially damage the annotation quality if annotators develop a habit of over-trusting the model prediction, making the whole manual annotation pointless.",
        "A discriminant ranking model, however, only suggestively reorders the discriminants on the presentation level, which are much safer when the annotation quality is concerned.",
        "In practice, there are different ways of finding discriminants from the parse forest.",
        "For instance, the [incr tsdb()] system supports both syntax-based and semantics-based discriminants.",
        "The syntax-based discriminants are extracted from the derivation trees of the HPSG analyses.",
        "All HPSG rule applications (unary or binary) and choices of lexical entries are picked as candidate discriminants and checked for effectiveness.",
        "The semantics-based discriminants, on the other hand, represent the differences on the semantic structures (MRS in the cases of DELPH-IN grammars).",
        "With a few exceptions, many DELPH-IN HPSG treebanks choose to use the syntactic discriminants which allow human annotators to pick the low-level constructions.",
        "The above proposed ranking model works for different types of discriminants (and potentially a mixture of different discriminant types).",
        "But for the evaluation of this paper, we show the feature model designed for the syntactic discriminants only.",
        "The syntactic discriminants record the differences between derivation trees by memorizing direct rule applications and lexical choices.",
        "Beside the rule or lexical entry name, the discriminant also records the information concerning the corresponding constituent, e.g., the category and spanning of the constituent, the parent and daughters of the constituent, etc.",
        "Furthermore, given the discriminant d and the parse forest Y, we can calculate the distribution of parses over the value of the discriminant function ö, which can be characterized by J2yeY ö(y)/|Y|.",

        "It can be dynamically integrated into the treebank development cycles in which the annotation habit evolves over time.",
        "Such a model can also shorten the training period for new annotators, which is an interesting aspect for our future investigation.",
        "From a different point of view, the rankings of the discriminants show annotators' confidence on various ambiguities.",
        "The clearly uneven distribution over discriminants can also provide grammar writers with interesting feedback, helping with the improvement of the linguistic analysis.",
        "We would also like to integrate confidence measures into the computer-assisted treebank annotation process, which could potentially help annotators make difficult decisions, such as whether to reject all trees for a sentence."
