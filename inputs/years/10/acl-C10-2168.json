        "Many nlp tasks and applications require the processing of massive amounts of textual data.",
        "For example, knowledge acquisition efforts can involve processing billions of words of text (Cur-ran, 2004).",
        "Also, the increasing need to process large amounts of web data places an efficiency demand on existing nlp tools.",
        "TextRunner, for example, is a system that performs open information extraction on the web (Lin et al., 2009).",
        "However, the text processing that is performed by TextRunner, in particular the parsing, is rudimentary: finite-state shallow parsing technology that is now decades old.",
        "TextRunner uses this technology largely for efficiency reasons.",
        "Many of the popular wide-coverage parsers available today operate at around one newspaper sentence per second (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Petrov and Klein, 2007).",
        "There are dependency parsers that operate orders of magnitude faster, by exploiting the fact that accurate dependency parsing can be achieved by using a shift-reduce linear-time process which makes a single decision at each point in the parsing process (Nivre and Scholz, 2004).",
        "In this paper we focus on the Combinatory Cat-egorial Grammar (ccg) parser of Clark and Curran (2007).",
        "One advantage of the ccg parser is that it is able to assign rich structural descriptions to sentences, from a variety of representations, e.g. ccg derivations, ccg dependency structures, grammatical relations (Carroll et al., 1998), and first-order logical forms (Bos et al., 2004).",
        "One of the properties of the grammar formalism is that it is lexicalised, associating ccg lexical categories, or ccg supertags, with the words in a sentence (Steedman, 2000).",
        "Clark and Curran (2004) adapt the technique of supertagging (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999) to ccg, using a standard maximum entropy tagger to assign small sets of supertags to each word.",
        "The reduction in ambiguity resulting from the supertagging stage results in a surprisingly efficient parser, given the rich structural output, operating at tens of newspaper sentences per second.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate that the ccg parser can be made more than twice as fast, with little or no loss in accuracy.",
        "A noteworthy feature of the ccg parser is that, after the supertagging stage, the parser builds a complete packed chart, storing all sentences consistent with the assigned supertags and the parser's CCG combinatory rules, with no chart pruning whatsoever.",
        "The use of chart pruning techniques, typically some form of beam search, is essential for practical parsing using Penn Treebank parsers (Collins, 1999; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Charniak and Johnson, 2005), as well as practical parsers based on linguistic formalisms, such as HPSG (Ninomiya et al., 2005) and lfg (Kaplan et al., 2004).",
        "However, in the CCG case, the use of the supertagger means that enough ambiguity has already been resolved to allow the complete chart to be represented.",
        "Despite the effectiveness of the supertagging stage, the number of derivations stored in a packed chart can still be enormous for typical newspaper sentences.",
        "Hence it is an obvious question whether chart pruning techniques can be profitably applied to the CCG parser.",
        "Some previous work (Djordjevic et al., 2007) has investigated this question but with little success.",
        "In this paper we investigate two types of chart pruning: a standard beam search, similar to that used in the Collins parser (Collins, 1999), and a more aggressive strategy in which complete cells are pruned, following Roark and Hollingshead (2009).",
        "Roark and Hollingshead use a finite-state tagger to decide which words in a sentence can end or begin constituents, from which whole cells in the chart can be removed.",
        "We develop a novel extension to this approach, in which a tagger is trained to infer the maximum length constituent that can begin or end at a particular word.",
        "These lengths can then be used in a more agressive pruning strategy which we show to be significantly more effective than the basic approach.",
        "Both beam search and cell pruning are highly effective, with the resulting CCG parser able to process almost 100 sentences per second using a single CPU, for both newspaper and Wikipedia data, with little or no loss in accuracy."

        "The parser is described in detail in Clark and Curran (2007).",
        "It is based on CCGbank, a CCG version of the Penn Treebank developed by Hocken-maier and Steedman (2007).",
        "The stages in the parsing pipeline are as follows.",
        "First, a POS tagger assigns a single POS tag to each word in a sentence.",
        "Second, a CCG supertagger assigns lexical categories to the words in the sentence.",
        "Third, the parsing stage combines the categories, using CCG's combinatory rules, and builds a packed chart representation containing all the derivations which can be built from the lexical categories.",
        "Finally, the Viterbi algorithm finds the highest scoring derivation from the packed chart, using the normal-form log-linear model described in Clark and Curran (2007).",
        "Sometimes the parser is unable to build an analysis which spans the whole sentence.",
        "When this happens the parser and supertagger interact using the adaptive supertagging strategy described in Clark and Curran (2004): the parser effectively asks the supertagger to provide more lexical categories for each word.",
        "This potentially continues for a number of iterations until the parser does create a spanning analysis, or else it gives up and moves to the next sentence.",
        "The parser uses the CKY algorithm (Kasami, 1965; Younger, 1967) described in Steedman (2000) to create a packed chart.",
        "The CKY algorithm applies naturally to CCG since the grammar is binary.",
        "It builds the chart bottom-up, starting with two-word constituents (assuming the su-pertagging phase has been completed), incrementally increasing the span until the whole sentence is covered.",
        "The chart is packed in the standard sense that any two equivalent constituents created during the parsing process are placed in the same equivalence class, with pointers to the children used in the creation.",
        "Equivalence is defined in terms of the category and head of the constituent, to enable the Viterbi algorithm to efficiently find the highest scoring derivation.",

Summing the probabilities of these disjoint events gives the probability that the largest constituent the word begins or ends has a size between 1 and x, inclusive.",
        "That is also the probability that all the constituents the word begins or ends are in the range of cells from rows 1 to row x in the corresponding column or diagonal.",
        "And therefore that is also the probability that the chart cells above row x in the corresponding column or diagonal do not contain any constituents, which means that the column and diagonal can be pruned from row x upward.",
