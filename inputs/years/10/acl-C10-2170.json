        "While textual order may guide the ordering in single-document summarization, no such guidance is available for MDS ordering.",

        "But global coherence, i.e., coherence between sentence groups with the whole text in view, is largely unaccounted for and few efforts are made at levels higher than entity or word in measuring sentence coherence.",

        "We will argue that event is instrumental for MDS information ordering, especially multi-document news summarization (MDNS).",
        "Ordering algorithms based on event and entity information outperform those based only on entity information.",
