        "Temporal expression normalization is very important for temporal information processing because it is in charge of transforming temporal expressions in surface texts to temporal information behind surface texts.",
        "Temporal information is defined as the knowledge about time or duration, which can be abstracted into some objects defined as temporal attributes in TIMEX2 Standard [Ferro et al., 2005].",
        "Human being can take temporal relation reasoning and anchor events on the time line with this information.",
        "Meanwhile, temporal expressions are defined as chunks of texts which convey explicit or implicit temporal information.",
        "So TERN evaluation plangives the task of temporal expression normalization that is annotating the appropriate temporal attributes for each temporal expression in texts.",
        "For example, a simple temporal expression, \"May 1, 2009\", can be normalized as <TIMEX2 VAL = \"2009-05-01\"> May 1, 2009 </TIMEX2>.",
        "Unfortunately, temporal expressions in real texts are more complicated because they contain a large number of Implicit Times besides Explicit Times.",
        "Here,",
        "(1) Explicit Time: Explicit Time can directly be laid in the timeline.",
        "Basically, it is a direct entry in the timeline and need not to be transformed.",
        "E.g., \"May 1, 2009\".",
        "(2) Implicit Time: Implicit Time can be mapped as an entry in the timeline with help of real contexts and some predefined knowledge and need to be transformed.",
        "E.g., \"May 1\", \"tomorrow\" and \"two day ago\".",
        "Consequently, temporal expression normalization is mainly aiming at Implicit Times that need to be transformed with referring to some specific times.",
        "However, the previous works on temporal expression normalization which basically adopt two mechanisms for choosing reference time, static time-value [Mani and Wilson, 2000; Wu et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2005] and static choosing-rules [Vozov, 2001; Jang et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2008], are not compatible with the real texts.",
        "The static time-value mechanism refers to taking the report time or publication time of the document as the fixed reference time for the whole text when normalizing.",
        "And the static choosing-rules mechanism means that the machine always uses fixed rules by contexts to choose reference time for each Implicit Time whatever its temporal semantics is.",
        "The rule based on the nearest narrative time [Lin et al., 2008] is the most typical and effective one, which uses the nearest narrative time in text above as the reference time all the while.",
        "But actually the context-free assumption or the rote operation is unsuitable for universal Implicit Times.",
        "For example, a news report is as Figure 1 shows:",
        "For these two Implicit Times in the text, \"after one week\" and \"this Monday\", obviously there will be critical conflicts when using these two mechanisms referred above to choose reference time.",
        "The static time-value is unsuited for the \"after one week\", and \"this Monday\" makes mistakes when taking the nearest narrative time (i.e., \"after one week\") as the reference time to normalize according to the static choosing-rules.",
        "Motivated by this issue, we propose a new reference time choosing mechanism for temporal expression normalization.",
        "Firstly, we segment the Implicit Time into two parts, modifier and temporal noun, and then train a classifier with referential features of these two parts to classify Implicit Times.",
        "As a result, we choose the corresponding reference time for each temporal expression depending on its class when normalizing.",
        "Meanwhile an acceptable defuzzification solution is introduced to normalize fuzzy times in our method.",
        "And the contributions of this paper are:",
        "(1) We introduce a simple but effective reference time choosing method, called dynamic-choosing mechanism, which can choose the appropriate reference times automatically for universal Implicit Times as well as be compatible with the dynamically changeable contexts.",
        "(2) Going beyond traditional normalization approaches, we develop a new way to deal with the defuzzification in order to figure out the fuzzy reference time (the reference time is vague or has imprecise start and end in timeline), which makes the normalization robust and improve the accuracy of reference times.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related works.",
        "In section 3 we describe the reference time dynamic-choosing mechanism.",
        "The temporal expression normalization is presented in section 4.",

        "Among them, the handcrafted rules-based methods [Saquete et al., 2002; Schilder and Habel, 2001; Mani and Wilson, 2000] can deal with various temporal expressions, but the procedure to build a robust rules system is quite time-consuming.",
        "With regard to the machine learning for normalization [Jang et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2005; Vicente-Diez et al., 2008], the potential task is the classification which is deciding one explanation of a temporal expression from several alternatives.",

        "Currently, the static time-value mechanism [Mani and Wilson, 2000; Wu et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2005] and the static choosing-rules mechanism [Vozov, 2001; Jang et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2008] for reference time choosing are applied into some systems widely.",
        "Nevertheless, as the discussion in section 1, these two ways are not adaptable to universal Implicit Times.",

        "In this paper, we define the Implicit Time consists of the modifier and the temporal noun which is modified by modifiers.",
        "And here we extend the modifier based on the TIMEX2 Standard, which include verb, conjunction, adverb and preposition that quantify or modify temporal nouns.",
        "For example, \"ten days\" is a temporal noun, but \"ten days ago\" is modified after adding the modifier \"ago\".",
        "Meanwhile we find no matter how long or how many modifiers modify the temporal noun, the whole temporal expression holds the original temporal reference inferred from the temporal noun.",
        "Moreover, the key point of normalizing temporal expressions is choosing the appropriate reference time according to the real context rather than deciding the right direction or computing the measurable offset.",
        "For instance, with regard to these two Implicit Times in Figure 1, \"after one week\" and \"this Monday\", we can achieve the referential direction easily from the modifiers through some mapping rules.",
        "Meanwhile, the offsets are able to be understood directly by machine with pattern matching.",
        "But for the reference time, we must build the context-depending reference reasoning to trace it.",
        "The reference link is described as Figure 2 shows.",
        "From the reference reasoning, we can see the full temporal reference comes from two parts: modifier reference and temporal noun reference.",
        "Because the former is inferred from the latter, the temporal noun reference reasoning plays more important roles in normalization.",
        "In other words, the reference reasoning of the whole Implicit Time strongly depends on the temporal noun.",
        "Furthermore, in the practical operation, we indeed take the report time or the nearest narrative time in text above as the reference time of the temporal noun when normalizing a whole Implicit Time.",
        "Therefore, we consider the classification of the Implicit Time based on the classes of temporal noun's reference time.",

        "The accuracy increases by 15.13% at most, and the errors by referent decreases by 3.92% at least.",
        "In contrast to the SCRM, we avoid the limitation that SCRM only concentrates on the nearest distance for choosing referent.",
        "Meanwhile, because the SCRM pays no attention to the normalization for fuzzy temporal expressions, the error by others (e.g. granularity) is greater than ours.",
        "Additionally, the STVM method applies the report time or the publication time of the document as the reference time for the whole text, so there is no referent updating in process.",
        "We mark all errors as referent errors as long as they involve with false reference time in results analysis, therefore, the STVM gets the highest referent errors ratio.",
        "With respect to the defuzzification, we evaluate it on fuzzy times separately.",
        "All defuzzi-fied fuzzy times are assessed by human, and then decided whether they are acceptable to the context.",
        "The evaluation results are shown in Table 7.",
        "For the fuzzy temporal expression in Local Time, it is much fewer and easier than the one in Global Time in number and expression respectively, so the defuzzification in Local Times achieves more expected results.",
        "On the other hand, the fuzzy time in Global Time is often the first temporal expression in the first paragraph, and the corresponding dictionary-based method certainly affects the experiment results.",
        "According to the percentages that the temporal expressions defuzzified successfully account for in the all reference times, it demonstrates that the de-fuzzification makes contributions to the referential normalization besides discovering the internal temporal information in the fuzzy time."
