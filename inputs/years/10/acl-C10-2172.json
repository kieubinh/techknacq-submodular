        "If there are discourse connectives between textual units to explicitly mark their relations, the recognition task on these texts is defined as explicit discourse relation recognition.",
        "Otherwise it is defined as implicit discourse relation recognition.",
        "Previous study indicates that the presence of discourse connectives between textual units can greatly help relation recognition.",

        "and Expansion (Exp.",
        "), can be disambiguated in explicit relations with more than 90% f-scores based only on the discourse connectives explicitly used to signal the relation (Pitler and Nenkova., 2009b).",
        "However, for implicit relations, there are no connectives to explicitly mark the relations, which makes the recognition task quite difficult.",
        "Some of existing works attempt to perform relation recognition without hand-annotated corpora (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) and (Blair-Goldensohn, 2007).",
        "They use unambiguous patterns such as [Arg1, but Arg2] to create synthetic examples of implicit relations and then use [Arg1, Arg2] as an training example of an implicit relation.",

        "However these implicit connectives do not exist in real texts.",
        "In this paper we overcome this difficulty by inserting a connective between two arguments with the use of a language model.",
        "Following the annotation scheme of PDTB, we assume that each implicit connective takes two arguments, denoted as Argl and Arg2.",
        "Typically, there are two possible positions for most of implicit connectives, i.e., the position before Arg1 and the position between Arg1 and Arg2.",
        "Given a set of possible implicit connectives {cj }, we generate two synthetic sentences, c^+Arg1+Arg2 and Arg1+c^+Arg2 for each a, denoted as SCi;1 and SCi,2.",
        "Then we calculate the perplexity (an intrinsic score) of these sentences with the use of a language model, denoted as PPL(SCij).",
        "According",
        "!For parallel connectives, e.g., if... then..., the two connectives will take the two arguments together, so there is only one possible combination for connectives and arguments.",
        "to the value of PPL(SCij) (the lower the better), we can rank these sentences and select the connectives in top N sentences as implicit connectives for this argument pair.",
        "The language model may be trained on large amount of unannotated corpora that can be cheaply acquired, e.g., North American News corpus.",
        "We predict implicit connectives on both training set and test set.",
        "Then we can use the predicted implicit connectives as additional features for supervised implicit relation recognition.",
        "Previous works exploited various linguistically informed features under the framework of supervised models.",
        "In this paper, we include 9 types of features in our system due to their superior performance in previous studies, e.g., polarity features, semantic classes of verbs, contextual sense, modality, inquirer tags of words, first-last words of arguments, cross-argument word pairs, ever used in (Pitler et al., 2009a), production rules of parse trees of arguments used in (Lin et al., 2009), and intra-argument word pairs inspired by the work of (Saitoetal.,2006).",
        "Here we provide the details of the 9 features, shown as follows:",
        "Verbs: Similar to the work in (Pitler et al., 2009a), the verb features consist of the number of pairs of verbs in Arg1 and Arg2 if they are from the same class based on their highest Levin verb class level (Dorr, 2001).",
        "In addition, the average length of verb phrase and the part of speech tags of main verb are also included as verb features.",
        "Context: If the immediately preceding (or following) relation is an explicit, its relation and sense are used as features.",
        "Moreover, we use another feature to indicate if Arg1 leads a paragraph.",
        "Polarity: We use the number of positive, negated positive, negative and neutral words in arguments and their cross product as features.",
        "For negated positives, we locate the negated words in text span and then define the closely behind positive word as negated positive.",
        "Modality: We look for modal words including their various tenses or abbreviation forms in both arguments.",
        "Then we generate a feature to indicate the presence or absence of modal words in both arguments and their cross product.",
        "Inquirer Tags: Inquirer Tags extracted from General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966) contains positive or negative classification of words.",
        "In fact, its fine-grained categories, such as Fall versus Rise, or Pleasure versus Pain, can indicate the relation between two words, especially for verbs.",
        "So we choose the presence or absence of 21 pair categories with complementary relation in Inquirer Tags as features.",
        "We also include their cross production as features.",
        "FirstLastFirst3: We choose the first and last words of each argument as features, as well as the pair of first words, the pair of last words, and the first 3 words in each argument.",
        "In addition, we apply Porter's Stemmer (Porter, 1980) to each word before preparation of these features.",
        "Production Rule: According to (Lin et al., 2009), we extract all the possible production rules from arguments, and check whether the rules appear in Arg1, Arg2 and both arguments.",
        "We remove the rules occurring less than 5 times in training data.",
        "Cross-argument Word Pairs: We perform the Porter's stemming (Porter, 1980), and then group all words from Argl and Arg2 into two sets W1and W2 respectively.",
        "Then we generate any possible word pair (wi, Wj )(wi G W1, Wj G W2).",
        "We remove the word pairs with less than 5 times.",
        "Intra-argument Word Pairs: Let Qi = (Qi,Q2,---,Qn) be the word sequence of Arg1.",
        "The intra-argument word pairs for Argl is defined as WP1 = ((9i,92), (9i,9s),---, (9i,9n), (92,93),â€¢â€¢â€¢, (qn-1,qn)).",
        "We extract all the intra-argument word pairs from Arg1 and Arg2 and remove word pairs appearing less than 5 times in training data.",
        "2.3 Relation recognition based only on predicted implicit connectives",
        "After the prediction of implicit connectives, we can address the implicit relation recognition task with the methods for explicit relation recognition due to the presence of implicit connectives, e.g., sense classification based only on connectives (Pitler and Nenkova., 2009b).",
        "The work of (Pitler and Nenkova., 2009b) showed that most of connectives are unambiguous and it is possible to obtain high performance in prediction of discourse sense due to the simple mapping relation between connectives and senses.",
        "Given two examples:",
        "(El) She paid less on her dress, but it is very nice.",
        "(E2) We have to harry up because the raining is getting heavier and heavier.",
        "The two connectives, i.e., but in E1 and because in E2, convey Comparison and Contingency sense respectively.",
        "In most cases, we can easily recognize the relation sense by the appearance of discourse connective since it can be interpreted in only one way.",
        "That means, the ambiguity of the mapping between sense and connective is quite few.",
        "We count the frequency of sense tags for each possible connective on PDTB training data for implicit relation.",
