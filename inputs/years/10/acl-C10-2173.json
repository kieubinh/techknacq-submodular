        "In recent years, sentiment analysis has received considerable attentions in Natural Language Processing (NLP) community (Blitzer et al., 2007; Dasgupta and Ng, 2009; Pang et al., 2002).",
        "Polarity classification, which determine whether the sentiment expressed in a document is positive or negative, is one of the most popular tasks of sentiment analysis (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009).",
        "Sentiment classification is a special type of text categorization, where the criterion of classification is the attitude expressed in the text, rather than the subject or topic.",
        "Labeling the reviews with their sentiment would provide succinct summaries to readers, which makes it possible to focus the text mining on areas in need of improvement or on areas of success (Gamon, 2004) and is helpful in business intelligence applications, recommender systems, and message filtering (Pang, et al., 2002).",
        "While topics are often identifiable by keywords alone, sentiment classification appears to be a more challenge task (Pang, et al., 2002).",
        "First, sentiment is often conveyed with subtle linguistic mechanisms such as the use of sarcasm and highly domain-specific contextual cues (Li et al., 2009).",
        "For example, although the sentence \"The thief tries to protect his excellent reputation\" contains the word \"excellent\", it tells us nothing about the author's opinion and in fact could be well embedded in a negative review.",
        "Second, sentiment classification systems are typically domain-specific, which makes the expensive process of annotating a large amount of data for each domain and is a bottleneck in building high quality systems (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009).",
        "This motivates the task of learning robust sentiment models from minimal supervision (Li, et al., 2009).",
        "Recently, semi-supervised learning, which uses large amount of unlabeled data together with labeled data to build better learners (Raina et al., 2007; Zhu, 2007), has drawn more attention in sentiment analysis (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009; Li, et al., 2009).",
        "As argued by several researchers (Bengio, 2007; Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2007), deep architecture, composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations (Hinton et al., 2006), is expected to perform well in semi-supervised learning because of its capability of modeling hard artificial intelligent tasks.",
        "Deep Belief Networks (DBN) is a representative deep learning algorithm achieving notable success for semi-supervised learning (Hinton, et al., 2006).",
        "Ranzato and Szummer (2008) propose an algorithm to learn text document representations based on semi-supervised auto-encoders that are combined to form a deep network.",
        "Active learning is another way that can minimize the number of required labeled data while getting competitive result.",
        "Usually, the training set is chosen randomly.",
        "However, active learning choose the training data actively, which reduce the needs of labeled data (Tong and Koller, 2002).",
        "Recently, active learning had been applied in sentiment classification (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009).",
        "Inspired by the study of semi-supervised learning, active learning and deep architecture, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised polarity classification algorithm called Active Deep Networks (ADN) that is based on a representative deep learning algorithm Deep Belief",
        "Networks (DBN) (Hinton, et al., 2006) and active learning (Tong and Koller, 2002).",
        "First, we propose the ADN architecture, which utilizes a new deep architecture for classification, and an exponential loss function aiming to maximize the separability of the classifier.",
        "Second, we propose the ADN algorithm.",
        "It firstly identifies a small number of manually labeled reviews by an active learner, and then trains the ADN classifier with the identified labeled data and all of the unlabeled data.",
        "Our paper makes several important contributions: First, this paper proposes a novel ADN architecture that integrates the abstraction ability of deep belief nets and the classification ability of backpropagation strategy.",
        "It improves the generalization capability by using abundant unla-beled data, and directly optimizes the classification results in training dataset using back propagation strategy, which makes it possible to achieve attractive classification performance with few labeled data.",
        "Second, this paper proposes an effective active learning method that integrates the labeled data selection ability of active learning and classification ability of ADN architecture.",
        "Moreover, the active learning is also based on the ADN architecture, so the labeled data selector and the classifier are based on the same architecture, which provides an unified framework for semi-supervised classification task.",
        "Third, this paper applies semi-supervised learning and active learning to sentiment classification successfully and gets competitive performance.",
        "Our experimental results on five sentiment classification datasets show that ADN outperforms previous sentiment classification methods and deep learning methods.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

        "Zagibalov and Carroll (2008) describe an automatic seed word selection for unsupervised sentiment classification of product reviews in Chinese.",
        "However, unsupervised learning of sentiment is difficult, partially because of the prevalence of sentimentally ambiguous reviews (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009).",
        "Using multi-domain sentiment corpus to sentiment classification is also hard to apply, because each domain has a very limited amount of training data, due to annotating a large corpus is difficult and time-consuming (Li and Zong, 2008).",

        "We preprocess these reviews to be classified, which is similar with Dasgupta and Ng (2009).",
        "Each review is represented as a vector of uni-grams, using binary weight equal to 1 for terms present in a vector.",

        "Finally, we sort the vocabulary by document frequency and remove the top 1.5%.",
        "It is because that many of these high document frequency words are stopwords or domain specific general-purpose words.",
        "After preprocess, every review can be represented by a vector.",
        "Then the dataset can be represented as a matrix:",
        "where R is the number of training samples, T is the number of test samples, D is the number of feature words in the dataset.",
        "Every column of X corresponds to a sample x, which is a representation of a review.",
        "A sample that has all features is viewed as a vector in WiD, where the z'th coordinate corresponds to the zth feature.",
        "The L labeled samples are chosen randomly from R training samples, or chosen actively by active learning, which can be seen as:",
        "where S is the index of selected training reviews to be labeled manually.",
        "Let Y be a set of labels corresponds to L labeled training samples and is denoted as:",
        "where C is the number of classes.",

        "We intend to seek the mapping function XL -Â» YL using the L labeled data and R+T-L unlabeled data.",
        "After training, we can determine y by the trained ADN while a new sample x is fed.",
        "To address the problem formulated in section 3.1, we propose a novel deep architecture for ADN method, as show in Figure 1.",
        "The deep architecture is a fully interconnected directed belief nets with one input layer h, N hidden layers h, h, hN, and one label layer at the top.",

        "The numbers of units for hidden layers, currently, are predefined according to the experience or intuition.",
        "The seeking of the mapping function XL -- YL, here, is transformed to the problem of finding the parameter space W={w, w,...,wN} for the deep architecture.",
        "The semi-supervised learning method based on ADN architecture can be divided into two stages: First, AND architecture is constructed by greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning using RBMs as building blocks.",
        "All the unlabeled data together with L labeled data are utilized to find the parameter space W with N layers.",
        "Second, ADN architecture is trained according to the exponential loss function using gradient descent method.",
