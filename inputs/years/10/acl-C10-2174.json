        "Information retrieval often suffers from the so called \"vocabulary mismatch\" problem.",
        "A document may be semantically relevant to a query despite the fact that the specific query terms used and the terms found in the document completely or partially differ (Furnas et al., 1987).",
        "Consequently, overlap with respect to linguistic terms should not be a necessary condition in query-document similarity and methods relying on the bag-of-words model can display poor performance as a result.",
        "In order to overcome the vocabulary mismatch problem, several solutions have been suggested which exploit semantic relations between text units.",
        "Among these methods, the latent model, the explicit model and the mixed model are commonly employed.",
        "The latent model (Landauer et al., 1998; Blei et al., 2003) tries to directly model the internal structure of \"topics\" or \"concepts\" in the text data, thus building meaningful groups beyond single words.",
        "Typically some form of dimension reduction (Fodor, 2002) is applied to the data matrix to find such latent dimensions which correspond to concepts.",
        "In contrast, the explicit model (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) indexes texts according to an external knowledge base.",
        "Typically the meaning of a piece of text is represented as a weighted vector of knowledge-based concepts derived from external resources such as ODP or Wikipediaarticles.",
        "The mixed model (Serban et al., 2005) extends the bag-of-words vector by adding external categories derived from WordNet or similar thesaurus.",
        "Based upon these definitions, the explicit model and the mixed model are similar in nature but differ in their use of external knowledge sources.",
        "Models such as those described above, however, have well documented drawbacks.",
        "Firstly, these methods are very computationally complex.",
        "In the latent model, complexity grows linearly with the number of dimensions and the number of documents.",
        "For example, the computational cost of singular value decomposition (SVD) is significant; no successful experiment has been reported with over one million documents (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "This has been the biggest obstacle to the widespread adoption of this kind of method.",
        "For the explicit and mixed model, the dimensions of projecting documents into the external knowledge space are often limited to ten thousand (Potthast et al., 2008) in order to facilitate the large size of the test collections used.",
        "Another problem with the explicit model is that the documents are often distributed over thousands of dimensions in which the semantic relatedness will degrade dramatically.",
        "For example, in (Sorg and Cimiano, 2008) when the whole Wikipedia collection is adopted to build the space, one document is mapped to ten thousand dimensions, in which it may only have very few truly semantically related dimensions.",
        "The means of identifying these dimensions is not reported and this may significantly influence the retrieval performance.",
        "Therefore, researchers started to consider integrating the aforementioned models into smaller, controlled document collections to overcome these shortcomings and assist the retrieval process.",
        "(Zhou and Wade, 2009b) proposed a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based method to model the latent structure of \"topics\" deduced from the initial retrieval results.",
        "The scores obtained from this process are then combined with initial ranking scores to produce a re-ranked list of results that are superior to original ordering.",
        "The method also enjoys the benefits of fast and tractable latent semantic computation and successfully avoids the incremental build problem (Landauer et al., 1998) which commonly exists in latent semantic analysis (LSA) techniques.",
        "There is an important factor, however, that needs to be taken into account when applying this method.",
        "Due to the smaller corpus size, fitting a latent model into this corpus is less meaningful than fitting the same model into a large, web-scale corpus.",
        "This means that some form of justification has to be applied to achieve better performance.",
        "A simple approach to address this problem is to directly apply the explicit or mixed model into a controlled corpus to improve ranking performance.",
        "A similar problem will arise in the latent model in this single semantic space, resulting in limited improvements.",
        "To address the challenges described above, this paper proposes a dual-space model which incorporates external knowledge to enhance the semantic space produced by the latent concept method.",
        "This model is intended to produce global consistency across the semantic space: similar entries are likely to have the same re-ranking scores with respect to the latent and manifest concepts.",
        "In other words: in this model, if a group of documents deal with the same topic induced from a dual semantic space which shares a strong similarity with a query, the documents will get allocated similar ranking as they are more likely to be relevant to the query.",
        "In the experiments carried out in this paper, the dual-space model is applied to ad-hoc document retrieval and compared with the initial language model-based ranker and singlespace model exploiting latent and explicit features.",
        "The results show that the explicit model could only bring minor improvements over the initial ranker.",
        "The latent model delivered more significant improvements than the explicit model.",
        "Both, however, are outperformed by the dual-space model.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is to propose a dual-space semantic model for the re-ranking problem, which aims to improve precision, especially of the most highly ranked results.",
        "Other contributions of the paper include proposing a novel way of applying the explicit model to the re-ranking problem, and performing a systematic comparison between different models.",
        "The rest of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "Related work on re-ranking and concept-based methods is briefly summarised in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 describes the latent space model and explicit space model used in the framework developed by this research, Section 4 presents details of how to build the dual-space model.",
        "In Section 5 a report is provided on a series of experiments performed over three different test collections written in English, French and German.",

        "Kurland and Lee performed re-ranking based on measures of centrality in the graph formed by the generation of links induced by language model scores, through a weighted version of the PageRank algorithm (Kurland and Lee, 2005) and a HITS-style cluster-based approach (Kurland and Lee, 2006).",

        "(Zhang et al., 2005) proposed a similar method to improve web search based on a linear combination of results from text search and authority ranking.",
        "The graph, which they named an \"affinity graph\", shares strong similarities with Kurland and Lee's work where the links are induced by a modified version of cosine similarity using the vector space model.",
        "Diaz (Diaz, 2005) used score regularisation to adjust document retrieval rankings from an initial retrieval by a semi-supervised learning method.",
        "Deng et al.",
        "(Deng et al., 2009) further developed this method by building a latent space graph based on content and explicit link information.",
        "Unlike their approach this research attempts to model the explicit information directly.",
        "The latent concept retrieval model has a long history in information retrieval.",
        "(Dumais, 1993; Dumais, 1995) conducted experiments with latent semantic indexing (LSI) on TREC documents and tasks.",
        "These experiments achieved precision at, or above, that of the median TREC participant.",
        "On about 20% of TREC topics this system was the top scorer, and reportedly slightly better than average results in comparison to standard vector spaces for LSI at about 350 dimensions.",
        "(Hofmann, 1999) provides an initial probabilistic extension of the basic latent semantic indexing technique.",
        "A more satisfactory formal basis for a probabilistic latent variable model for dimensionality reduction is the LDA model (Blei et al., 2003), which is generative and assigns probabilities to documents outside of the training set.",
        "Wei and Croft (Wei and Croft, 2006) presented the first large-scale evaluation of LDA, finding it to significantly outperform the query likelihood model.",
        "(Zhou and Wade, 2009b; Zhou and Wade, 2009a) successfully applied this method to document re-ranking and achieved significant improvement over language model-based ranking and various graph-based re-ranking methods.",
        "The explicit concept model has recently attracted much attention in the information retrieval community.",
        "Notably, explicit semantic analysis (ESA) has been proposed as an approach to computing semantic relatedness between words and thus, has a natural application in this field (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "In essence, ESA indexes documents with respect to the Wikipedia article space, indicating how strongly a given word in the document is associated to a specific Wikipedia article.",
        "In this model, each article is regarded as a concept, an analogical unit used in the latent model.",
        "As in the latent model, two words or texts can be semantically related in spite of not having any words in common.",
        "Specifically, this method has been widely adopted in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) as an approach to resolving an extreme case of the vocabulary mismatch problem, where queries and documents are written in different languages (Potthast et al., 2008).",
        "(Anderka et al., 2009) showed that this approach has comparable performance to linguistic matching methods.",
        "(Cimiano et al., 2009) compared this method with a latent concept model based on LSI/LDA and concluded that it will outperform the latent model if trained on Wikipedia articles."

        "The empirical results obtained using the dual space model are very promising.",
        "Pleasingly, both the LDA+ESA and LSI+ESA models outperformed the basic latent and explicit space model in the majority of retrieval runs, with the best scores relating to the LSI-based models.",
        "An important phenomenon is that statistically significant improvements are always recorded in the metrics which measure the most highly ranked results.",
        "An even more exciting observation is that in many cases, the dual-space model, even though tuned for MAP, can outperform various baselines and other models for all the evaluation metrics, with statistically significant improvements in many runs.",
        "Another observation that can be drawn from Table 2 is that the relative performance tends to be stable across test collections written in different languages.",
        "This indicates a promising future for studying document structure with respect to latent and explicit semantic space for re-ranking purposes.",
        "The Comparison of Latent Methods Table 2 also shows a side-by-side comparison of the various performance measurements between the latent model used in this research on the CLEF-2009 BL test collection.",
        "The LSI-based method appeared to outscore the LDA-based method in the latent model in the vast majority of cases, while the difference between the various scorings was fairly marginal as both methods deliver statistically significant results.",
        "For the dual-space model, similar results were observed.",
        "A possible reason is that the initial ranker used was based on the vector space model and LSI is also vector based.",
        "It shows that more research with respect to the latent model selection will be necessary in the future.",
        "Effectiveness of Explicit Methods As part of experimental objectives of this research, it was also necessary to test the newly developed explicit model for re-ranking.",
        "In the parameter tuning section, the explicit model displayed no obvious difference in terms of combination effectiveness.",
        "However, some variations could be observed when applying different dimensions where statistically significant results often appear in lower dimensions.",
        "This confirms the need to find more relevant dimensions, both for performance and efficiency purposes."
