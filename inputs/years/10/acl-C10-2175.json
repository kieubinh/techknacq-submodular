        "The automatic machine translation (MT) evaluation has aroused much attention from MT researchers in the recent years, since the automatic MT evaluation metrics can be applied to optimize MT systems in place of the expensive and time-consuming human assessments.",
        "The state-of-art strategy to automatic MT evaluation metrics estimates the system output quality according to its similarity to human references.",
        "To capture the language variability exhibited by different reference translations, a tendency is to include deeper linguistic information into machine learning based automatic MT evaluation metrics, such as syntactic and semantic information (Amigo et al., 2005; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007; Giménez and Màrquez, 2008).",
        "Generally, such efforts may achieve higher correlation with human assessments by including more linguistic features.",
        "Nevertheless, the complex and variously presented linguistic features often prevents the wide application of the linguistic motivated metrics.",
        "Essentially, linguistic motivated metrics introduce additional restrictions for accepting the outputs of translations (Amigö et al., 2009).",
        "With more linguistic features attributed, the model is actually capturing the sentence similarity in a finer granularity.",
        "In this sense, the practical effect of employing various linguistic knowledge is changing the calculation units of the matching in the process of the automatic evaluation.",
        "Similarly, the classical string-based metrics can be changed in their calculation units directly.",
        "For example, the calculation granularity in BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) metric is word: n-grams are extracted on the basis of single word as well as adjacent multiple words.",
        "And the calculation granularity in PosBLEU (Popovic and Ney, 2009) metric is Pos tag, which correlate well with the human assessments.",
        "Therefore, it is straight forward to apply the popular string-based automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, to compute the scores of the systems outputs in the surface or linguistic tag sequences on various granularities levels.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to change the original calculation units (granularities) of string-based metrics to generate new features.",
        "After that, we propose a powerful string-based automatic MT evaluation metric, combining all the features with various granularities based on SVM rank (Joachims, 2002) and regression (Drucker et al., 1996) models.",
        "Our analysis indicates that: i) the new features with various granularities can contribute to the automatic evaluation of translation quality; ii) our proposed string-based metrics with multiple granularities based on SVM regression model can achieve higher correlations with human assessments than the state-of-art automatic metrics .",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related researches on automatic MT evaluation.",
        "Section 3 describes some new calculation granularities of string-based metrics on sentence level.",
        "In Section 4, we propose string-based metrics with multiple granularities based on SVM rank and regression models.",
        "In Section 5, we present our experimental results on different sets of data.",
        "And conclusions are drawn in the Section 6."

      "text": [
        "The research on automatic string-based machine translation (MT) evaluation is targeted at a widely applicable metric of high consistency to the human assessments.",
        "WER (Nießen et al., 2000), PER (Tillmann et al., 1997), and TER (Snover et al., 2006) focuses on word error rate of translation output.",
        "GTM (Melamed et al., 2003) and the variants of ROUGE (Lin and Och, 2004) concentrate on matched longest common substring and discontinuous substring of translation output according to the human references.",
        "BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) are both based on the number of common n-grams between the translation hypothesis and human reference translations of the same sentence.",
        "BLEU and NIST are widely adopted in the open MT evaluation campaigns; however, the NIST MT evaluation in 2005 indicates that they can even error in the system level (Le and Przybocki, 2005).",
        "Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) detailed the deficits of the BLEU and other similar metrics, arguing that the simple surface similarity calculation between the machines translations and the human translations suffers from morphological issues and fails to capture what are important for human assessments.",
        "In order to attack these problems, some metrics have been proposed to include more linguistic information into the process of matching, e.g., Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) metric and MaxSim (Chan nad Ng, 2008) metrics, which improve the lexical level by the synonym dictionary or stemming technique.",
        "There are also substantial studies focusing on including deeper linguistic information in the metrics (Liu and Gildea, 2005; Owczarzak et al., 2006; Amigö et al., 2006; Mehay and Brew, 2007; Giménez and Màrquez, 2007; Owczar-zak et al., 2007; Popovic and Ney, 2007; Giménez and Màrquez, 2008b).",
        "A notable trend improving the string-based metric is to combine various deeper linguistic information via machine learning techniques in the metrics (Amigo et al., 2005; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007; Giménez and Màrquez, 2008).",
        "Such efforts are practically amount of introducing additional linguistic restrictions into the automatic evaluation metrics (Amigö et al., 2009), achiving a higher performance at the cost of lower adaptability to other languages owing to the language dependent linguistics features.",
        "Previous work shows that including the new features into the evaluation metrics may benefit to describe nature language accurately.",
        "In this sense, the string-based metrics will be improved, if the finer calculation granularities are introduced into the metrics.",
        "Our study analyzes the role of the calculation granularities in the performance of metrics.",
        "We find that the new features with various granularities can contribute to the automatic evaluation of translation quality.",
        "Also we propose a powerful string based automatic MT evaluation metric with multiple granularities combined by SVM.",
        "Finally, we seek a finer feature set of metrics with multiple calculation granularities.",
        "3 The New Calculation Granularities of String-based Metrics on Sentence Level",
        "The string-based metrics of automatic machine translation evaluation on sentence level adopt a common strategy: taking the sentences of the documents as plain strings.",
        "Therefore, when changing the calculation granularities of the string-based metrics we can simplify the information of new granularity with plain strings.",
        "In this work, five kinds of available calculation granularities are defined: \"Lexicon\", \"Letter\", \"Pos\", \"Constitute\" and \"Dependency\".",
        "Lexicon: The calculation granularity is common word in the sentences of the documents, which is popular practice at present.",
        "Letter: Split the granularities of \"Lexical\" into letters.",
        "Each letter is taken as a matching unit.",
        "Pos: The Pos tag of each \"Lexicon\" is taken as a matching unit in this calculation granularity.",
        "Constitute: Syntactic Constitutes in a tree structure are available through the parser tools.",
        "We use Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003a; Klein and Manning, 2003b) in this work.",
        "The Constitute tree is changed into plain string, travelling by BFS (Breadth-first search traversal) .",
        "Dependency: Dependency relations in a dependency structure are also available through the parser tools.",
        "The dependency structure can also be formed in a tree, and the same processing of being changed into plain string is adopted as \"Constitute\".",
        "The following serves as an example:",
        "Sentence:",
        "I have a dog",

        "The strings are taken as inputs of the string-based automatic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "The outputs of each metric are calculated on different matching units.",
        "4 String-based Metrics with Multiple Granularities Combined by SVM",
        "Introducing machine learning methods to established MT evaluation metric is a popular trend.",
        "Our study chooses rank and regression support vector machine (SVM) as the learning model.",
        "Features are important for the SVM models.",
        "Plenty of scores can be generated from the proposed metrics.",
        "In fact, not all these features are needed.",
        "Therefore, feature selection should be a necessary step to find a proper feature set and alleviate the language dependency by using fewer linguistic features.",
        "Feature selection is an NP-Complete problem; therefore, we adopt a greedy selection algorithm called \"Best One In\" to find a local optimal feature set.",
        "Firstly, we select the feature among all the features which best correlates with the human assessments.",
        "Secondly, a feature among the rest features is added in to the feature set, if the correlation with the human assessments of the metric using new set is the highest among all new metrics and higher than the previous metric in cross training corpus.",
        "The cross training corpus is prepared by dividing the training corpus into five parts.",
        "Each four parts of the five are for training and the rest one for testing; then, we integrate scores of the five tests as scores of cross training corpus.",
        "The fivefold cross training can help to overcome the overfitting.",
        "At the end, the feature selection stops, if adding any of the rest features cannot lead to higher correlation with human assessments than the current metric."

        "In this framework, on the one hand, string-based metrics with multiple granularities may introduce more potential features into automatic evaluation, with no necessarily of new similarity measuring method, compared with the other metrics.",
        "On the other hand, we succeed in finding a finer and small feature set among the combinations of plentiful features, keeping or improving the performance.",
        "Finally, we proposed a simple, effective and robust string-based automatic MT evaluation metric with multiple granularities.",
        "Our proposed metrics improve the flexibility and performance of the metrics based on the multiple features; however, it still has some drawbacks: i) some potential features are not yet considered, e.g. the semantic roles; and ii) the loss of information exists in the process of changing linguistic information into plain strings.",
        "For example, the dependency label in the calculation granularity \"Dependency\" is lost when changing information into string form.",
        "Though the final results obtain the better performance than the other linguistic metrics, the performance is promising to be further improved if the loss of information can be properly dealt with.",
