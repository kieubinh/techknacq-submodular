        "Recent years have seen extensive applications of machine learning methods to natural language processing problems.",
        "Typically, increase in the scale of training data boosts the performance of machine learning methods, which in turn enhances the quality of learning-based NLP systems (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "However, annotating data by human is time consuming and labor intensive.",
        "For this reason, human-annotated corpora are considered as the most valuable resource for NLP.",
        "In practice, there often exist more than one corpus for the same NLP tasks.",
        "For example, for constituent syntactic parsing (Collins, 1999; Char-niak, 2000; Petrov et al., 2006) for Chinese, in addition to the most popular treebank Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2002), there are also other treebanks such as Tsinghua Chinese Treebank (TCT) (Zhou, 1996).",
        "For the purpose of full use of readily available human annotations for the same tasks, it is significant if such corpora can be used jointly.",
        "Such attempt is especially significant for some languages that have limited size of labeled data.",
        "At first sight, a direct combination of multiple corpora is a way to this end.",
        "However, corpora created for the same NLP tasks are generally built by different organizations.",
        "Thus such corpora often follow different annotation standards and/or even different linguistic theories.",
        "We take CTB and TCT as a case study.",
        "Although both CTB and TCT are Chomskian-style treebanks, they have annotation divergences in at least two dimensions: a) CTB and TCT have dramatically different tag sets, including parts-of-speech and grammar labels, and the tags cannot be mapped one to one; b) CTB and TCT have distinct hierarchical structures.",
        "For example, the Chinese words \" ^ M (Chinese) # êt (traditional) X'fc (culture)\" are grouped as a flat noun phrase according to the CTB standard (right side in Fig. 1), but in TCT, the last two words are instead grouped together beforehand (left side in Fig. 1).",
        "The differences cause such treebanks of different annotation standard to be generally used independently.",
        "In this paper, we focus on unifying multiple constituency treebanks of distinct annotation standards through treebank conversion.",

        "The task of treebank conversion is defined to convert parse trees in a source treebank to fit the standard of a target treebank.",
        "In the informed decoding approach, treebank conversion proceeds in two steps: 1) build a parser on a target treebank; 2) apply the parser to decode sentences in a source treebank with the aid of information derived from the source treebank.",
        "For convenience, parse trees in a source treebank are referred to as source trees and corresponding, trees from a target treebank are referred to as target trees.",
        "Moreover, a parser built on a target treebank is referred to as target parser.",
        "In the following sections, we first describe motivation of our work and then present details of the informed decoding approach.",
        "We use the example in Fig. 2 to illustrate why original annotations in a source treebank can help in treebank conversion.",
        "The figure depicts three tree fragments for the Chinese words Â.",
        "(pay) 1 (already) – (one) 3t (day) (of) 3 Ifc(salary), among which Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) are tree fragments of the CTB standard and Fig. 2(c) is a tree fragment of the TCT standard.",
        "From the figure, we can see that these Chinese words actually have (at least) two plausible interpretations of the meaning.",
        "In Fig. 2(a), the words mean pay salary for one-day work while in Fig. 2(b), the words mean spend one day on paying salary.",
        "If Fig. 2(c) is a source tree to be converted into the CTB standard, then Fig. 2(b) will be rejected since it conflicts with Fig. 2(c) with respect to tree structures.",
        "Note that structures reflect underlying sentence meaning.",
        "On the other hand, although Fig. 2(a) also has (minor) differences in tree structures from Fig. 2(c), it is preferred as the conversion result.",
        "From the example we can get inspired by the observation that original annotations in a source treebank are informative and necessary to converting parse trees in the source treebank.",
        "In general, conversion like that from Fig. 2(c) to Fig. 2(a) requires sentence-specific conversion rules which are difficult to obtain in practice.",
        "In order to make use of information provided by original annotations in a source treebank, Wang et al.",
        "(1994) proposed a selecting-from-k-best approach where source trees are used to select one \"optimal\" parse tree from each k-best list generated by a target parser.",
        "In this paper, we instead incorporate information of original annotations into the parsing phase.",
        "The underlying motivation is two-fold:",
        "• The decoding phase of a parser is essentially a search process.",
        "Due to the extreme magnitude of searching space, pruning of search paths is practically necessary.",
        "If reliable information is provided to guide the pruning of search paths, more efficient parsing and better results are expected.",
        "• Selecting-from-k-best works on the basis of k-best lists.",
        "Unfortunately, we often see very few variations in k-best lists.",
        "For example, 50-best trees present only 5 to 6 variations (Huang, 2008).",
        "The lack of diversities in k-best lists makes information from the source treebank less effective in selecting parse trees.",
        "By contrast, incorporating such information into decoding makes the information affect the whole parse forest.",
        "In this paper, information from a source treebank translates into two strategies which help a target parser to prune illegal partial parse trees and to rank legal partial parse trees higher.",
        "Following are the two strategies:",
        "• Pruning strategy: despite distinctions existing between annotation standards of a source treebank and a target treebank, a source treebank indeed provides treebank conversion with indicative information on bracketing structures and grammar labels.",
        "So when a partial parse tree is generated, it should be examined against the corresponding source tree.",
        "Unless the partial parse tree does not conflict with any constituent in the source tree, it should be pruned out.",

        "In some cases even if a correct parse tree exits in the parse forest, parsers may fail to rank it to the top position.",
        "Rescoring strategy is used to increase scores for partial parse trees which are confidently thought to be valid.",
        "The pruning strategy used in this paper is based on the concept of conflict which is defined in two dimensions: structures and grammar labels.",
        "Since a tree structure can be equivalently represented as its span (interval of word indices) set, we can check whether two trees conflict by checking their spans.",
        "See Fig. 3 for an illustration of spans of a tree.",
        "Following are criteria determining whether two trees conflict in their structures.",
        "• If one node in tree A is raised to be a child of the node's grandfather in tree B, and the grandfather has more than two children, then tree A and tree B conflict in structures.",
        "• If tree A has a span [a, b] and tree B has a span [m, k] and these two spans satisfy the condition of either a < m < b < k or m< a < k < b, then tree A and B conflict in structures.",

        "Two labels are said to be conflicting if they are from different label sets and they cannot be mapped.",
        "By combining these two strategies, two parse trees (of different standards) which yield the same sentence are said to be conflicting if they conflict in both structures and labels.",
        "Note that we describe pruning strategy for the case of two parse trees.",
        "In informed decoding process, this strategy is actually applied to every partial parse tree generated during decoding.",
        "As mentioned above, despite that the pruning strategy helps in improving conversion accuracy, we are faced with the problem of how to rank valid parse trees higher in a parse forest.",
        "To solve the problem, we adjust the scores of those partial parse trees that are considered to be confidently \"good\".",

        "In detail, Wang94 proceeds in two steps: 1) use Berkeley parser to generate k-best lists for sentences in Sample-TCT; 2) select a parse tree from each k-best list with respect to original annotations in Sample-TCT.",

        "We can see that the score is much lower than the accuracy achieved by using the CTB training data (75.4% vs. 82.04%).",
        "Possible reasons that result in lower accuracy includes: 1) divergences in word segmentation standards between TCT and CTB; 2) divergences of domains of TCT and CTB; 3) conversions errors in newly-gained data.",

        "In the first parsing experiment, the TCT corpus is converted using portions of the CTB training data.",
        "As in the conversion experiments, parse trees in the CTB training data are randomly ordered before splitting of the training set.",
        "For each portion, newly-gained data together with the portion of the CTB training data are used to train a new parser.",
        "Evaluation results on the CTB test data are presented in Table 4.",
        "Here in Table 4, the first row represents ratios of parse trees from the CTB training data.",
        "For example, 40% means the first 40% parse trees in the CTB training data are used.",
        "The Collins row represents the results of only using portions of the CTB training data, and the Collins+ row contains the results achieved with enlarged training data.",
        "From the results, we find that new data indeed provides complementary information to the CTB training data, especially when the training data is small in size.",
        "But benefits of Collins parser gained from additional training data level out with the increment of the training data size.",
        "Actually if techniques like corpus weighting (Niu et al., 2009) are applied to weight differently training data and the additional data, higher parsing accuracy is reasonably expected.",
        "Another obversion from Table 4 is that the parser trained on 40% CTB training data plus additional training data achieves higher accuracy than using 60% CTB training data.",
        "We incrementally add labeled training data and automatic training data respectively to 40% CTB training data.",
        "The purpose of this experiment is to see the magnitude of automatic training data which can achieve the same effect as labeled training data does.",
        "The results are depicted in Table 5.",
        "From the results we see that accuracy gaps between using labeled data and using automatic data get large with the increment of added data.",
        "One possible reason is that more noise is taken when more data is added.",
        "This observation further verifies that refining techniques like corpus weighting are necessary for using automatically-gained data."
