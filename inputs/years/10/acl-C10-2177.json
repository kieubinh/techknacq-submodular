        "Though speech has long served as a basic method of human communication, revisiting and browsing speech content had never been a possibility before human can record their own voice.",
        "Recent technological advances in recording, compressing, and distributing such archives have led to the consistently increasing availability of spoken content.",
        "Along with this availability comes a demand for better ways to browse such archives, which is inherently more difficult than browsing text.",
        "In relying on human beings' ability to browse text, a solution is therefore to reduce the speech browsing problem to a text browsing task through technologies that can automatically convert speech to text, i.e., the automatic speech recognition (ASR).",
        "Research along this line has implicitly changed the traditional speaking-for-hearing and writing-for-reading construals: now speech can be read through its transcripts, though it was not originally intended for this purpose, which in turn raises a new set of problems.",
        "The efficiency and convenience of reading spoken documents are affected by at least two facts.",
        "First, the quality of transcripts can impair browsing efficiency, e.g., as shown in (Stark et al., 2000; Munteanu et al., 2006), though if the goal is only to browse salient excerpts, recognition errors on the extracts can be reduced by considering the confidence scores assigned by ASR (Zechner and Waibel, 2000; Hori and Furui, 2003).",
        "Even if transcription quality is not a problem, browsing transcripts is not straightforward.",
        "When intended to be read, written documents are almost always presented as more than uninterrupted strings of text.",
        "Consider that for many written documents, e.g., books, indicative structures such as section/subsection headings and tables-of-contents are standard constituents created manually to help readers.",
        "Structures of this kind, however, are rarely aligned with spoken documents.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in addressing the second issue: adding hierarchical browsable structures to speech transcripts.",
        "We define a hierarchical browsable structure as a set of nested labelled bracketing which, when placed in text, partition the document into labeled segments.",
        "Examples include the sequence of numbered section headings in this paper, or the hierarchical slide/bullet structure in the slides of a presentation.",
        "An ideal solution to this task would directly infer both the hierarchical structure and the labels from unstructured spoken documents.",
        "However, this is a very complex task, involving the analysis of not only local but also high-level discourse over large spans of transcribed speech.",
        "Specifically for spoken documents, spoken-language characteristics as well as the lack of formality and thematic boundaries in transcripts violate many conditions that a reliable algorithm (Marcu, 2000) relies on and therefore make the task even harder.",
        "In this paper, we aim at a less ambitious but naturally occurring problem: imposing a known hierarchical structure, e.g., presentation slides, onto the corresponding document, e.g., presentation transcripts.",
        "Given an ordered, nested set of topic labels, we must place the labels so as to correctly segment the document into appropriate units.",
        "Such an alignment would provide a useful tool for presentation browsing, where a user could easily navigate through a presentation by clicking on bullets in the presentation slides.",
        "The solution to this task should also provide insights and techniques that will be useful in the harder structure-inference task, where hierarchies and labels are not given.",
        "We present a dynamic-programming-based alignment framework that considers global document features and local hierarchical features.",
        "This pragmatic approach is computationally efficient and outperforms a baseline alignment that ignores the hierarchical structure of bullets within slides.",
        "We also explore the impact of speech recognition errors on this task.",
        "Furthermore, we study the feasibility of directly aligning a structure to raw speech, as opposed to a transcript."

        "Topic/slide boundary detection The previous work most directly related to ours is research that attempts to find flat structures of spoken documents, such as topic and slide boundaries.",
        "For example, the work of (Chen and Heng, 2003; Ruddarraju, 2006; Zhu et al., 2008) aims to find slide boundaries in the corresponding lecture transcripts.",
        "Malioutov et al.",
        "(2007) developed an approach to detecting topic boundaries of lecture recordings by finding repeated acoustic patterns.",
        "None of this work, however, has involved hierarchical structures that exist at different levels of a document.",
        "In addition, researchers have also analyzed other multimedia channels, e.g., video (Liu et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2006), to detect slide transitions.",
        "Such approaches, however, are unlikely to find semantic structures that are more detailed than slide transitions, e.g., the bullet hierarchical structures that we are interested in.",
        "Building tables-of-contents on written text A notable effort going further than topic segmentation is the work by Branavan et al.",
        "(2007), which aims at the ultimate goal of building tables-of-contents for written texts.",
        "However, the authors assumed the availability of the hierarchical structures and the corresponding text spans.",
        "Therefore, their problem was restricted to generating titles for each span.",
        "Our work here can be thought of as the inverse problem, in which the title of each section is known, but the corresponding segments in the spoken documents are unknown.",
        "Once the correspondence is found, an existing hierarchical structure along with its indicative titles is automatically imposed on the speech recordings.",
        "Moreover, this paper studies spoken documents instead of written text.",
        "We believe it is more attractive not only because of the necessity of browsing spoken content in a more efficient way but also the general absence of helpful browsing structures that are often available in written text, as we have already discussed above.",
        "Rhetoric analysis In general, analyzing discourse structures can provide thematic skeletons (often represented as trees) of a document as well as relationship between the nodes in the trees.",
        "Examples include the widely known discourse parsing work by Marcu (2000).",
        "However, when the task involves the understanding of high-level discourse, it becomes more challenging than just finding local discourse conveyed on small spans of text; e.g., the latter is more likely to benefit from the presence of discourse markers.",
        "Specifically for spoken documents, spoken-language characteristics as well as the absence of formality and thematic boundaries in transcripts pose additional difficulty.",
        "For example, the boundaries of sentences, paragraphs, and larger text blocks like sections are often missing.",
        "Together with speech recognition errors as well as other speech characteristics such as speech disfluences, they will impair the conditions on which an effective and reliable algorithm of discourse analysis is often built."

        "In our work, this is a sequence of lecture slides containing a set of slide titles and bullets, B = {b1, b2,bn}, organized in a tree structure T(RR, tt, where RR is the root of the tree that concatenates all slides of a lecture; i.e., each slide is a child of the root SR and each slide's bullets form a subtree.",

        "In implementation, we only need to find the starting point of a bullet, i.e., a pair (bi, uk), since we know the tree structure in advance and therefore we know that the starting position of the next sibling bullet is the ending boundary for the current bullet."

        "Our task is to find the correspondence between slide bullets and a speech sequence or its transcripts.",
        "Research on finding correspondences between parallel texts pervades natural language processing.",
        "For example, aligning bilingual sentence pairs is an essential step in training machine translation models.",
        "In text summarization, the correspondence between human-written summaries and their original texts has been identified (Jing, 2002), too.",
        "In speech recognition, forced alignment is applied to align speech and transcripts.",
        "In this paper, we keep the general framework of alignment in solving our problem.",
        "Our solution, however, should be flexible to consider multiple constraints such as those conveyed in hierarchical bullet structures and global word distribution.",
        "Accordingly, the model proposed in this paper depends on two orthogonal strategies to ensure efficiency and richness of the model.",
        "First of all, we formulate all our solutions within a classic dynamic programming framework to enforce computational efficiency (section 4.1).",
        "On the other hand, we explore the approach to incorporating hierarchical and global features into the alignment framework (Section 4.2).",
        "The associated parameters are then optimized with Powell's algorithm (Section 4.3).",
        "We formulate our solutions within the classic dynamic-programming-based alignment framework, dynamic time warping (DTW).",
        "To this end, we need to sequentialize the given hierarchies, i.e., bullet trees.",
        "We propose to do so through a pre-order walk of a bullet tree; i.e., at any step of a recursive traversal of the tree, the alignment model always visits the root first, followed by its children in a left-to-right order.",
        "This sequential-ization actually corresponds to a reasonable assumption: words appearing earlier on a given slide are spoken earlier by the speaker.",
        "The pre-order walk is also used by (Branavan et al., 2007) to reduce the search space of their discriminative table-of-contents generation.",
        "Our sequentialization strategy can be intuitively thought of as removing indentations that lead each bullet.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, the right panel is a bullet array resulting from a pre-walk of the slide in the left panel.",
        "In our baseline model, the resulted bullet array is directly aligned with lecture utterances.",
        "Other orders of bullet traversal could also be considered, e.g., when speech does not strictly follow bullet orders.",
        "In general, one can regard our task here as a tagging problem to allow further flexibility on bullet-utterance correspondence, in which bullets are thought of as tags.",
        "However, considering the fact that bullets are created to organize speech and in most cases they correspond to the development of speech content monotonically, this paper focuses on addressing the problem in the alignment framework.",

        "We propose to consider all these constraints in the phase of estimating similarity matrices.",
        "To this end, we use two levels of similarity matrices to capture local tree constraints and global word distributions, respectively.",
        "First of all, information conveyed in the hierarchies of bullet trees should be considered, such as the potentially discriminative nature between two sibling bullets (Branavan et al., 2007) and the relationships between ancestor and descendant bullets.",
        "We incorporate them in the bullet-utterance similarity matrices.",
        "Specifically, when estimating the similarity between a bullet bi and an utterance uj, we consider local tree constraints based on where the node bi is located on the slide.",
        "We do so by accounting for first and second-order tree features.",
        "Given a bullet, bi, we first represent it as multiple vectors, one for each of the following: its own words, the words appearing in its parent bullet, grandparent, children, grandchildren, and the bullets immediately adjacent to bi.",
        "That is, bi is now represented as 6 vectors of words (we do not discriminate between its left and right siblings and put these words in the same vector).",
        "Similarity between the bullet bi and an utterance uj is calculated by taking a weighted average over the similarities between each of the 6 vectors and the utterance uj.",
        "A linear combination is used and the weights are optimized on a development set.",
        "Global property of word distributions could be helpful, too.",
        "A general term often has less discriminative power in the alignment framework than a word that is localized to a subsection of the document and is related to specific subtopics.",
        "For example, in a lecture that teaches introductory computer science topics, aligning a general term \"computer\" should receive a smaller weight than aligning some topic-specific terms such as \"automaton.\"",
        "The latter word is more likely to appear in a more narrow text span.",
        "It is not straightforward to directly calculate idf scores unless a lecture is split into smaller segments in some way.",
        "Instead, in our models, the distribution property of a word is considered in word-level similarity matrices with the following formula.",
        "sim(wi, Wj )",
        "Aligning different words receives no bonus, while matching the same word between bullets and utterances receives a score of 1 minus a distribution penalty, as shown in the formula above.",
        "The function var(wi) calculates the standard variance of the positions where the word Wi appears.",
        "Divided by the maximal standard variance ofword positions in the same lecture, the score is normalized to [0,1].",
        "This distribution penalty is weighted by A, which is tuned in a development set.",
        "Again, a general term is expected to have a larger positional variance.",
        "Once a word-level matrix is acquired, it is combined with the bullet-utterance level matrix discussed above.",
        "Specifically, when measuring the similarity between a word vector (one of the 6 vectors) and the transcripts of an utterance, we sum up the word-level similarity scores of all matching words between them, normalize the resulted score by the length of the vector and utterance, and then renormalize it to the range [0, 1] within the same spoken document.",
        "The final bullet-utterance similarity matrix is incorporated into the pre-order-walk suquentialization discussed above, when alignment is conducted.",
        "Powell's algorithm (Press et al., 2007) is used to find the optimal weights for the constraints we incorporated above, to directly minimize the objective function, i.e., the Pk and WindowDiff scores that we will discuss later.",
        "As a summary, we have 7 weights to tune: a weight for each of the following: parent bullet, grandparent, adjacent siblings, children, grandchildren, and the current bullet, plus the word distribution penalty A.",
        "The values of these weights are determined on a development set.",
        "Note that the model we propose here does not exclude the use of further features; instead, many other features, such as smoothed word similarity scores, can be easily added to this model.",
        "We are conservative on our model complexity here, in terms of number of weights need to be tuned, for the consideration of the size of data that we can used to estimate these weights.",
        "Finally, with all the 7 weights being determined, we apply the standard dynamic time warping (DTW)."
