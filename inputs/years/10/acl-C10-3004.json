        "Therefore, it should be of particular concern to build an integrated Chinese processing platform.",
        "There are some key problems for such a platform: providing high performance language processing modules, integrating these modules smoothly, using processing results conveniently, and showing processing results directly.",

        "LTP (Language Technology Platform) is an integrated Chinese processing platform.",
        "Its architecture is shown in Figure 1.",
        "From bottom to up, LTP comprises 6 components: ® Corpora, © Various Chinese processing modules, © XML based internal data presentation and processing, © DLL API, ® Web service, and © Visualization tool.",
        "In the following sections, we will introduce these components in detail.",
        "Many NLP tasks are based on annotated corpora.",
        "We distributed two key corpora used by LTP.",
        "First, WordMap is a Chinese thesaurus which contains 100,093 words.",
        "In WordMap, each word sense belongs to a five-level categories.",
        "There are 12 top, about 100 second and 1,500 third level, and more fourth and fifth level categories.",
        "For instance, the Chinese word \"/|vffi-\" has the following two senses:",
        "We can see that the two senses belong to (entity) and \"À\" (human beings) top categories respectively.",
        "In each category, the concept becomes more and more specifical.",
        "The second corpus is Chinese Dependency Treebank (CDT) (Liu et al., 2006).",
        "It is annotated with the dependency structure and contains 24 dependency relation tags, such as SUB, OBJ, and ADV.",
        "It consists of 10,000 sentences randomly extracted from the first six-month corpus of People's Daily (China) in 1998, which has been annotated with lexical tags, including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition tags.",
        "We have developed 6 state-of-the-art Chinese processing modules for LTP.",
        "1.",
        "Word Segmentation (WordSeg): A CRF model (Lafferty et al., 2001) is used to segment Chinese words.",
        "All of the People's Daily (China) corpus is used as training data.",
        "2.",
        "Part-of-Speech Tagging (POSTag): We adopt SVMTool for Chinese POS tagging task (Wang et al., 2009).",
        "The People's Daily corpus is also used here.",
        "3.",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER): LTP can identify six sorts of named entity: Person, Loc, Org, Time, Date and Quantity.",
        "A maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) is adopted here.",
        "We still used the People's Daily corpus.",
        "4.",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): This is an all word WSD system, which labels the WordMap sense of each word.",
        "It adopts an SVM model (Guo et al., 2007), which obtains the best performance in SemEval 2009 Task 11: English Lexical Sample Task via English-Chinese Parallel",
        "Text.",
        "5.",
        "Syntactic Parsing (Parser): Dependency grammar is used in our syntactic parser.",
        "A high order graph-based model (Che et al., 2009) is adopted here which achieved the third place of the dependency syntactic parsing subtask in the CoNLL-2009 Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies in Multiple Languages Shared Task (Hajic et al., 2009).",
        "6.",
        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL): SRL is to identify the relations between predicates in a sentence and their associated arguments.",
        "The module is based on syntactic parser.",
        "A maximum entropy model (Che et al., 2009) is adopted here which achieved the first place in the joint task of syntactic and semantic dependencies of the CoNLL2009 Shared Task.",
        "Table 1 shows the performance and speed of each module in detail.",
        "The performances are obtained with n-fold cross-validation method.",
        "The speed is gotten on a machine with Xeon 2.0GHz CPU and 4G Memory.",
        "At present, LTP processes these modules with a cascaded mechanism, i.e., some higher-level processing modules depend on other lower-level modules.",
        "For example, WSD needs to take the output of POSTag as input; while before POSTag, the document must be processed with WordSeg.",
        "LTP can guarantee that the lower-level modules are invoked automatically when invoking higherlevel modules.",
        "We adopt eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as the internal data presentation for some reasons.",
        "First, XML is a simple, flexible text format, and plays an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere.",
        "Second, there exist many powerful and simple XML parsers.",
        "With these tools, we can easily and effectively achieve all kinds of operations on XML.",

        "The meaning of each tag and attribute are explained in Table 2.",
        "In order to gain the analysis results of LTP, we provide various DLL APIs (implemented in C++ and Python), which can be divided into three classes: I/O operation, module invoking, and result extraction.",
