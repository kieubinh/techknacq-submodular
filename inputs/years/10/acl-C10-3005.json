        "Bloggers, professional reviewers, and consumers continuously create opinion-rich web reviews about products and services, with the result that textual reviews are now abundant on the web and often convey a useful overall rating.",
        "However, an overall rating cannot express the multiple or conflicting opinions that might be contained in the text and screening the content of a large number of reviews could be a daunting task.",
        "For example, a restaurant might receive a great evaluation overall, while the service might be rated below-average due to slow and discourteous wait staff.",
        "Pinpointing opinions in documents, and the entities being referenced, would provide a finer-grained sentiment analysis and better summarize users' opinions.",
        "In addition, selecting salient sentences from the reviews to textually summarize opinions would add useful details to consumers that are not expressed by numeric ratings.",
        "This is especially true for so-called road warriors and mobile users \"on the run\" who are often dealing with limited time and display real estate in searching fora restaurant to make a decision.",
        "Have2eat is a popular mobile application available for iPhone and Android-based devices that addresses these challenges.",
        "Have2eat uses the geo-location information either from the GPS device or explicitly entered by the user to produce a list of restaurants sorted by distance and located within a specific radius from the originating location.",
        "In addition, when restaurant reviews are available, a compact one-screen digest displays a summary of the reviews posted on the web by other customers.",
        "Customers can expand to read a full review page and also enter their own ratings, comments and feedback.",
        "The review summaries are visualized on the mobile screen:",
        "• graphically by thumbs-up (positive reviews) and thumbs-down (negative reviews) for different aspects of the restaurant;",
        "• textually by a few sentences selected from review texts that best summarize the opinions about various aspects of the restaurant expressed in the reviews;",
        "Extracting opinions from text presents many natural language processing challenges.",
        "Prior work on sentiment analysis has been focusing on binary classification of positive and negative opinions (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003), while aspect rating inference (e.g., the task of determining the opinion polarity in a multipoint scale) has been previously analyzed in Pang and Lee (2005); Goldberg and Zhu (2006); Leung et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "More recently, Snyder and Barzilay (2007); Shimada and Endo (2008) extended the inference process to multi-aspect ratings where reviews include numerical ratings from mutually dependent aspects.",
        "Snyder and Barzilay (2007) shows that modeling the dependencies between aspect ratings in the same reviews helps to reduce the rank-loss (Crammer and",
        "Singer, 2001).",
        "There are similar mobile applications obtainable either on the Apple iPhone App Store or as web-based mobile application, such as Zagat, UrbanS-poon, YP Mobile, and Yelp, but, to the extent of our knowledge, most of them are only focused on finding the restaurant location based on proximity and some restaurant filtering criterion.",
        "When available, restaurant reviews are simply visualized as contiguous list of text snippets with the overall experience rating.",
        "None of the listed applications include extended rating predictions and reviews summarization."

        "The have2eat system architecture is composed of two parts: 1) predictive model training - illustrated in Figure 1 and described in section 2.1, and 2) graphical and textual summarization - shown in Figure 2 and described in section 2.2.",
        "The majority of textual reviews available online are accompanied by a single overall rating of the restaurant.",
        "To predict consistent ratings for different aspects, namely food, service, atmosphere, value, and overall experience, we use machine learning techniques to train predictive models, one for each aspect; see Figure 1.",
        "More specifically, we used approximately 6,000 restaurant reviews scraped from a restaurant review website.",
        "On this website, besides textual reviews, users have also provided numerical ratings for the five aspects mentioned above.",
        "Ratings are given on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being poor and 5 excellent.",
        "We experimented with different regression and classification models using a host of syntactic and semantic features.",
        "We evaluated these models using rank-loss metrics which measure the average difference between predicted and actual ratings.",
        "We found that a maximum entropy (Nigam et al., 1999) model combined with a re-ranking method that keeps in consideration the interdependence among aspect ratings, provided the best predictive model with an average rank-loss of 0.617 (Gupta et al., 2010).",
        "This results is better than previous work on the same task as described in Snyder and Barzilay (2007).",
        "To cope with the limited real estate on mobile phones for displaying and allowing users to input their opinions, the predicted ratings were mapped onto thumbs-up and thumbs-down.",
        "For each restaurant the proportion of reviews with rating of 1 and 2 was considered thumbs down and ratings of 4 and 5 were mapped to thumbs up.",
        "Table 1 shows an example of this mapping.",

        "Ratings of 3 are considered neutral and ignored in this mapping",
        "Figure 2 shows how summary sentences are selected from textual reviews.",
        "As described in the previous section, we trained predictive models for each aspect of the restaurant.",
        "To select summary sentences we split the review text into sentences.",
        "Using the predictive models and iterating over the restaurant listings, sentences in the reviews are classified by aspect ratings and confidence score.",
        "As a result, for each sentence we get 5 ratings and confidence scores for those ratings.",
        "We then select a few sentences that have extreme ratings and high confidence and present them as summary text.",
