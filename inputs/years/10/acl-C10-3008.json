        "There are potentially valuable nuggets of information hidden in large document collections.",

        "Data mining technology is giving us the ability to extract meaningful patterns from large quantities of structured data.",
        "Collections of text, however, are not as amenable to data mining.",
        "In this demonstration, we describe HCAMiner, a text mining system designed to detect hidden information between concepts from large text collections and expose previously unknown logic connections that connect facts, propositions or hypotheses.",
        "In our previous work, we have defined concept chain queries (CC0 (Jin et al. , 2007), a special case of text mining in document collections focusing on detecting links between two concepts across text documents.",
        "A traditional search involving, for example, two person names will attempt to find documents mentioning both of these names and produce a list of individual pages as result.",
        "In the event that there are no pages contain both names, it will return \"no pages found\" or pages with one of the names ranked by relevancy.",
        "Even if two or more interrelated pages contain both names, the existing search engines cannot integrate information into one relevant and meaningful answer.",
        "This research focuses on a different interpretation of such a query: what is the best concept chain across documents that potentially connects these two individuals?",
        "For example, both may be football lovers, but are mentioned in different documents.",
        "This information can only be gleaned from multiple documents.",
        "A generalization of this task involves query terms representing general concepts (e.g., airplane crash, foreign policy).",
        "The goal of this research is to sift through these extensive document collections and find such hidden links.",
        "Formally, a concept chain query involving concepts A and B has the following meaning: find the most plausible relationship between concept A and concept B assuming that one or more instances of both concepts occur in the corpus, but not necessarily in the same document.",
        "We go one step further and require the response to include text snippets extracted from multiple documents in which the discovered relationship occurs.",
        "This may assist users with the second dimension of the analysis process, i.e., when the user has to peruse the documents to figure out the nature of the relationship underlying a suggested chain."

        "A key part of the solution is the representation framework.",
        "What is required is something that supports traditional IR models (such as the vector space model), graph mining and probabilistic graphical models.",
        "We have formulated a representation referred to as concept association graphs (CAG).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a small portion of CAG that has been constructed based on processing the 9/11 commission report in the coun-terterrorism domain.",
        "The inputs for this module are paths for data collection and domain-specific dictionary containing concepts.",
        "In our experiments, we extract as concepts all named entities, as well as any noun or noun phrases participating in Subject-Verb-Object relationships.",
        "Domain ontological links are also illustrated, e.g., white house is a type of organization.",
        "Particularly, the CP for concept c is built by first identifying a relevant set of text segments from the corpus in which concept c occurs, and then identifying characteristic concepts from this set and assessing their relative importance as descriptors of concept c. Formally, the profile Profile(ci) for concept ci is described by a set of its related concepts ck as follows:",
        "Weight eoik denotes the relative importance of ck as an indicator of concept ci and is calculated as follows:",
        "log( f( i, k ) x idf k )log n",
        "Where n is the number of relevant text segments considered for concept ci (in our experiments, the basic unit of segmentation is a sentence).",
        "The function f (i, k) quantifies the correlation between concept ci and concept ck and is given by",
        "Where sfij is the frequency of concept ci in the j-th sentence and sfkj is the frequency of concept ck in the j-th sentence.",
        "This can be easily computed by constructing \"concept by sentence\" matrix Q whose entry Qij is the number of times concept ci occurs in sentence Sj.",
        "(QQT)j then represents the number of times concepts ci and c co-occur in sentences across the corpus.",
        "The inverse document frequency factor is computed as",
        "A concept profile (CP) is essentially a set of terms that together represent the corresponding concept.",
        "We generate concept profiles by adapting the Local Context Analysis technique in Information Retrieval and then integrate them into the graphical framework (Jin et al., 2007).",
        "Where N is the number of sentences in the document collection, npk is the number of sentences containing concept ck.",
        "X is a collection dependent parameter (in the experiments X=3).",
        "The factor Z is a constant parameter which avoids a value equals to zero for wik (which is useful, for instance, if the approach is to be used with probabilistic framework).",
        "Usually, Z is a small factor with values close to 0.1.",
        "Table 1 illustrates a portion of the CP constructed for concept Bin Ladin.",
        "The best concepts are shown based on their relative importance.",
        "Given the information provided by concept profiles, the strength of a relation (edge weight in the CAG) between concept ci and concept Cj is measured by the similarity between their respective profiles.",
        "If a concept X is related to another concept Y which has a similar context as that of X, then such a relation can be coherent and meaningful.",
        "More precisely, a scalar profile similarity matrix SiJ- is defined as follows:",
        "Where C(ci) and C(Cj) are profile vectors for concepts ci and Cj respectively.",
        "In terms of text mining and knowledge discovery, we also require the graphical representation relate concepts and associations to underlying text snippets in the corpus.",
        "Without this support, the framework is not complete since users need to validate conclusions by looking at actual documents.",
        "This is achieved by associating each edge with a Snippet Cluster, which links the snippets (e.g., sentences) in the corpus to the corresponding associations (e.g., co-occurrence of concepts in sentences) represented by edges in the CAG.",
        "The resulting snippet clusters offer a view of the document collection which is highly characterized by the presence of concept associations (illustrated in Fig. 1).",
        "Given two concepts of interest designated, conCept Chain query (CCQ) tries to find if (i) there is a direct connection (association) between them, or (ii) if they can be connected by several intermediate concepts (paths).",
        "Note that finding direct links between two concepts is trivial; in the following we mainly focus on discovering and ranking indirect connections between concepts.",
        "We formulate the CCQ problem as finding optimized transitive associations between concepts in the CAG.",
        "Given the source concept c1 and destination concept Cn, the transitive strength of a path from c1 to Cn made up of the links {(c;, C2), ... , (Cn-j, Cn)}, denoted by TS(cj, C2,Cn), is given by:",
        "Where w(ci, ci+1) represents the weight of the edge connecting concepts ci and ci+1.",
        "The formulation of generating and ranking transitive associations is then described as follows with input and output constraints specified:",
        "Given: an edge-weighted graph CAG, vertices s and t from CAG, and an integer budget l",
        "Find: ranked lists of concept chains CCs staring from s and ending at t, one list for each possible length (i.e., between the shortest connection length and the specified maximum length l).",
        "Within each list, top-K chains that maximize the \"goodness\" function TS() is returned.",
        "Our optimization problem is now to find an optimal path that maximizes the \"goodness\" measure for each possible length.",
        "This could be easily computed using dynamic programming given the inductive definition of the goodness function TS().",
        "Notice that in real applications there are often cases that users might be interested in exploring more potential chains instead of just one optimal chain, we have thus adapted the traditional dynamic programming algorithm into finding top-K chains connecting concepts for each possible length efficiently.",
