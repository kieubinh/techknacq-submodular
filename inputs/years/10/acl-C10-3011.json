        "Pronoun resolution is the well-known problem of identifying antecedents for pronominal references in text or dialogue.",
        "We present a prototype of new system for pronoun resolution, Antelogue, that handles both text and dialogues.",
        "In our approach, pronoun resolution is done in two steps: a) feature acquisition of properties of words and the entities they represent and b) resolution algorithm.",
        "We adopt a hybrid approach to the problem, using statistical and machine learning techniques widely available in the NLP literature to collect features and a symbolic algorithm informed by prior research in anaphora resolution and models of entity salience to appropriately rank and evaluate antecedents.",
        "The design and architecture of Antelogue is modular and flexible and will soon be released for off-the-shelf use as an independent component or for possible integration of larger anaphora resolution systems, such as the GuiTAR (General Tool for Anaphora Resolution) (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004) that currently is released with (Mitkov et al., 2002)'s statistical pronoun resolution algorithm, MARS, that processes pronouns in text.",
        "Motivation for building a new algorithm for text and dialogues has been the problem of alignment between caption dialogues and stage directions on one hand and video content in movies on the other.",
        "While pronoun resolution in stage directions proved to be a fairly easy task, in dialogues we are facing the following challenges:",
        "1.",
        "Part of speech taggers trained on text (typically the Wall Street Journal texts of Penn Treebank) perform poorly on dialogues, primarily due to the fragmented nature of spoken language.",
        "As a result NP tags are overgenerated.",

        "Multi-party dialogues, sometimes 3rd person pronouns are used to refer to other speakers.",
        "It is hard to identify when an instance of a 3rd person pronoun has an antecedent in the prior discourse or another speaker.",

        "For the feature acquisition step, any number of feature acquisition sub-modules can be implemented.",
        "The architecture is flexible such that new feature acquisition modules can be added as they may become available or deemed crucial for specific applications.",

        "The resolution step implements an algorithm for utilizing the features in the repository to make resolution decisions.",
        "The resolution module needs to communicate only with the repository to get feature information and outputs xml annotated text or, what we call, e-grid output in which pronouns have been replaced by their antecedents.",
        "If the identified antecedent is a pronoun, it is further looked-up until a non-pronominal antecedent is found.",

        "Despite well-known problems in making meaningful comparisons in pronoun resolution systems, An-telogue's performance is comparable to some of the highest reported performances, either identifying correctly an antecedent or correctly declaring a pronoun unresolvable or non-referential in 85% of 600 annotated pronouns.",
        "Text module: Antelogue's architecture for resolving pronouns in text is identical to dialogues except that a)the preprocessing text extracts text from the stage directions in the screenplay, b) addressee patterns are not used to filter out antecedents for \"he\" and \"she\" and instances of \"I\" and \"you\" are ignored.",
        "In the future we plan to implement resolution of \"I\" and \"you\" as well as a dialogue style resolution of \"he\" and \"she\" for instances of embedded speech.",
        "These instances were extremely rare in our data but they need to be catered for in the future.",
        "Antelogue's performance exceeds 90% for stage directions because stage directions are relatively simple and fairly unambiguous.",
        "For this reason, a syntactic parse which slows down the system considerably was not used.",
        "However, to retain similar levels of performance in different domains, the use of syntactic parse will be needed."
