        "E-HowNet, an evolution and extension ofHowNet (Dong & Dong, 2006), is an entity-relation representation model for lexical senses.",
        "Under the framework, word senses are defined by basic concepts as well as conceptual relations called attribute-values.",
        "The following is an example of lexical sense representation in E-HowNet.",
        "(1) 'tt iH|carefully choose' is expressed (or defined) by the expression ' (choose|iH #:manner=(cautious| tt}}'.",
        "In the representation, the meaning of \"'twill\" is comprised of two primitive concepts, \"choose |^ #\" and \"cautiousand the conceptual relation between the primitives is explained by the semantic role \"manner\".",
        "For further details, readers may refer to the E-HowNet technical report (CKIP 2009).",
        "With a well-established entity-relation model, semantic composition is applicable from the morphological level to the sentential level in E-HowNet.",
        "Semantic compositionality, together with syntactic information, contributes enormously to natural language understanding.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We describe the major features of E-HowNet in Section 2 and introduce the E-HowNet ontology in Section 3.",
        "Then, we present our online E-HowNet system in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 contains some concluding remarks.",
        "To achieve the goal of semantic compositional-ity and to extend the advantage from HowNet, the following features are implemented in E-HowNet.",
        "a) Multilevel definitions and semantic decomposition: Word senses (concepts) can be defined (expressed) by primitives as well as by any well-defined concepts and conceptual relations.",
        "However, using only primitives to express word senses, as in HowNet, causes information degradation and important ontological relations between concepts may be missed.",
        "b) Uniform sense representation and semantic compositionality: To achieve semantic com-positionality, it is necessary to encode the senses of both content words and function words in a uniform framework.",
        "HowNet performs well for defining content words, but it does not provide a well-form representational framework for expression the sense of function words, which indicate semantic relations.",
        "In contrast, E-HowNet provides uniform representations for the senses of content/function words and the senses of sentences/phrases.",
        "For example, the passive sense of the preposition by' introduces an agent role (relation) and the conjunction ' S h because' links the relation of reason between two events.",
        "The functional representation and semantic com-positionality are illustrated by the following example:",
        "(2) Because of the rain, the clothes are all wet.",
        "Suppose that the following dependency structure and semantic relations are derived by parsing sentence (2) as follows:",
        "The semantic composition in (4) is the result of unifying the features of the lexical representations shown in the above table.",

        "We adopt and extend approximately 2,600 primitives from HowNet to form the top-level ontology of E-HowNet, which includes two types of subtrees: entities and relations.",
        "The entities are comprised of events, objects, and attribute-values; while the relations are comprised of semantic-roles and functions.",
        "Entities indicate concepts that have substantial content, whereas relations link the semantic relations between entities (Chen et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2008).",
        "The taxonomic structure is organized by hypernym-hyponym relations; therefore, it forms an inheritable system, i.e., the hy-ponym concepts inherit the properties of hyper-nym concepts.",
        "The proposed approach facilitates the adoption of knowledge represented by other frameworks, such as FrameNet, and HowNet; and it allows concepts to be represented with varying degrees of specificity.",
        "Another advantage is that conceptual similarities can be modeled by their relational distances in the hierarchy (Resnik, 1999), and the taxonomic relations between lexical senses can be captured from their E-HowNet expressions automatically.",
        "With E-HowNet expressions, lexical senses are defined as entities and relations.",
        "Thus, all the taxonomic relations of lexical senses can be identified according to their E-HowNet definitions.",
        "Synonyms are identified by their identical E-HowNet expressions, and hyponymy relations are identified by the subsumption of attribute-values.",
