        "TypeCraft (or TC in short) is a multilingual online database of linguistically-annotated natural language texts, embedded in a collaboration and information tool.",
        "It is an online service which allows users (projects as well as individuals) to create, store and retrieve structured data of the kind mainly used in natural language research.",
        "In a system featuring graded access the user may create his own domain, invite others, as well as share his data with the public.",
        "The kernel of TypeCraft is morphological word level annotation in a relational database setting, wrapped into a wiki which is used as a communication and information gathering and sharing tool.",
        "TypeCraft allows the import of raw text for storage and annotation and export of annotated data to MS Word, OpenOf-fice.org, ILTjeX and XML.",
        "The online system is complemented by an offline client which is a Java application offering the same functionality as the online version.",
        "This allows a seamless exchange of data between the server and the user's own computer."

        "The client side consists of the TypeCraft editor interface and a wiki environment (content produced by MediaWiki on the server).",
        "Users perceive the wiki and the editor interface as a single TypeCraft web application.",
        "The TypeCraft server proper is a Java application running inside a Java application server.",
        "TypeCraft uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage.",
        "The data mapping between Java objects and database tables is managed by Hibernate, so the system is not bound to any specific SQL database.",
        "TypeCraft data can be divided into two distinct groups: common data, shared between all annotated tokens and users, such as the word and sentence level tag sets and an ISO 639-3 specification, and individual data, by which we mean specific texts, phrases, words and morphemes.",
        "Individual data references common data types.",
        "This for example means that all users of the system making use of the part of speech tag N share the reference to a single common tag N."

        "It is well known that generation of linguistic annotation of any kind is a time consuming enterprise quite independent of the form the primary data has and the tools chosen for processing this data.",
        "Equally well known are problems connected to the generation and storage of linguistic data.",
        "Standard word processing programs do not function well as linguistic tools and private computers are not a safe place to store linguistic resources (Bird and Simons, 2003).",
        "Although it is generally agreed that linguistic resources should be kept in a sustainable and portable format, it is less clear what that really means in practice.",
        "For the individual researcher it is not easy to decide which of the available tools serve his purpose best.",
        "To start with, it is often unclear which direction the research will take, which categories of data are needed and in which form the material should be organised and stored.",
        "We experience that it is too time consuming or requires expert knowledge to convert otherwise useful data into an acceptable 'resource format'.",
        "It is perhaps even more important that many tools turn out to be so complex that the goal of mastering them becomes an issue in its own right.",
        "Researchers working together with local communities on less-documented languages experience that linguistic software can be technically too demanding.",
        "In fact, researchers in all non-computational fields of linguistics encounter problems similar to those just described for field-oriented research.",
        "Concerned with timely publication, for which linguistic data mainly takes the form of Interlinear Glosses (IG), the efficiency with which linguistic data can be created is an important issue.",
        "Several factors will affect which form linguistic data management will take, namely the standardisation of data beyond the field of NLP, non-expert user IT solutions allowing the efficient creation of linguistic data, and finally, improved availability of linguistic data for human consumption in research and publication."

        "In addition, databases in general offer greater flexibility for search and retrieval.",
        "The other major difference between Toolbox and TypeCraft is that TypeCraft is an online service which frees the users from all the problems arising from maintaining an application on their own computer.",

        "Although not sufficiently rewarded at the moment, already now the creation and sharing of linguistic data online is an efficient way for the creation and propagation of annotated texts in form of Interlinear Glosses.",
        "Since the TypeCraft web application provides off-the-shelf data for linguistic publications already formatted for all main text processing systems, data creation and retrieval with TypeCraft is time efficient.",
        "This makes linguistic work more data oriented and enables reasonable scientific turnover rate."
