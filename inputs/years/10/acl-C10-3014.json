        "HowNet is an on-line common-sense knowledgebase unveiling inter-conceptual relationships and inter-attribute relationships of concepts as connoting in lexicons of the Chinese and their English equivalents.",
        "To put it simply, relationship is the soul of HowNet, as well as the world knowledge.",
        "The relationships that represent knowledge can be divided into two categories: Concept Relationship (CR) and Attribute Relationship (AR).",
        "It is believed that concept relationships fall into a net, which is called Concept Relation Net (CRN) and attribute relationships fall into a net too, called Attribute Relation Net (ARN).",
        "Different individual has different CRN, even of the same concept.",
        "This reflects different levels of knowledge among people.",
        "CRN is elastic or extendable as it varies with individual persons.",
        "The more knowledge one has, the more concepts he will master, and what is more, the larger or more complicated CRN of the concepts he will know.",
        "It can be imagined that a 6-year child may know \"doctor\" but his CRN of \"doctor\" would be far from that as shown in Fig. 1, which is believed to be mastered by an ordinary adult.",
        "The same case goes with mankind as a whole.",
        "Mankind increases his knowledge with each passing year when he enlarges his volume of concepts and at the same time, the CRN of the concepts.",
        "Careful observations find that the meaning of concepts is displayed not only by its CRN but also by the relationships among attributes of the concepts, as called Attribute Relation Net.",
        "In many cases it is the attributes of a concept that act in the role of meaning representation.",
        "Fig.",
        "2 reveals that it is not \"paper\" as a whole that is related to \"write\", but only one of its attributes, say \"color\", is related to \"write\" with \"contrast\" as the condition.",
        "Therefore in a strict sense, \"paper\" is not necessarily related to \"write\".",
        "We can sometimes even write on the sand with a twig or on the table with our wet finger.",
        "On the contrary, we cannot write on a piece of white paper with a chalk or on the blackboard in black ink.",
        "Therefore, for writing, what affects may not be the whole lot of the concept like \"paper\", but some attributes of the concept.",
        "Besides, we can use \"paper\" to wrap up something because of its attributes of the material, which are almost the same as cloth or plastic.",
        "HowNet is unique in its four peculiarities: (1) Use of sememes: HowNet uses sememes to interpret concepts.",
        "Sememes are regarded as the basic unit of the meaning.",
        "(2) Definition in a structuralized language: Each concept in HowNet lexicon is defined in a language, called Knowledge Database Markup Language (KDML).",
        "The KDML is mainly composed of sememes and semantic roles.",
        "The",
        "Knowledge Database Mark-up Language uses 2089 sememes, 128 secondary features and 94 semantic roles as its vocabulary and adopts an extended BNF as its syntax.",
        "The concept of \"doctor (medical)\" is defined in HowNet as:",
        "DEF={human | J^:HostOf={Occupation | jjjj^ï}, domain={medical\\M},{doctor\\M)ù'-agent={~}}} All the computation of meaning in HowNet is based on the definitions of the concepts.",
        "(3) Self-sufficiency: Systematic integration of hierarchical taxonomies, axiomatic inference, KDML-defined concepts.",
        "(4) Language independence: In the final analysis, HowNet is not word-oriented as WordNet, but concept-oriented.",
        "Only with the HowNet's shared definitions can we achieve a shared ontology for all languages."

        "Particular attention should be given to our newly developed tool, HowNet Inference Pool (E/C bilingual).",
        "With the help of an activator of the tool we can build a senses pool for any concept in HowNet.",
        "The pool covers all sorts of relationships under the key concept, for instance, when the concept of \"money\" as the key, it has a pool with 2600 concepts, including \"bank\", \"deposit\", \"borrow\", \"buy\", \"steal\", etc.",
        "Hence suppose a question like \"can we borrow money from a bank?\"",
        "is raised to an inference machine, we are sure that the machine can give a correct answer with correct selection of meanings, like \"bank\" as \"financial bank\".",
