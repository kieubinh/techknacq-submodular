        "One of the factors that makes Natural Language Processing (NLP) a challenging area is the fact that some linguistic phenomena are not entirely compositional or predictable.",
        "For instance, why do we prefer to say full moon instead of total moon or entire moon if all these words can be considered synonyms to transmit the idea of completeness?",
        "This is an example of a collocation, i.e. a sequence of words that tend to occur together and whose interpretation generally crosses the boundaries between words (Smadja, 1993).",
        "More generally, collocations are a frequent type of multiword expression (MWE), a sequence of words that presents some lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic or statistical idiosyncrasies (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "The definition of MWE also includes a wide range of constructions like phrasal verbs (go ahead, give up), noun compounds (ground speed), fixed expressions (a priori) and multiword terminology (design pattern).",
        "Due to their heterogeneity, MWEs vary in terms of syntactic flexibility (let alone vs the moon is at the full) and semantic opaqueness (wheel chair vs pass away).",
        "While fairly studied and analysed in general Linguistics, MWEs are a weakness in current computational approaches to language.",
        "This is understandable, since the manual creation of language resources for NLP applications is expensive and demands a considerable amount of effort.",
        "However, next-generation NLP systems need to take MWEs into account, because they correspond to a large fraction of the lexicon of a native speaker (Jackendoff, 1997).",
        "Particularly in the context of domain adaptation, where we would like to minimise the effort of porting a given system to a new domain, MWEs are likely to play a capital role.",
        "Indeed, theoretical estimations show that specialised lexica may contain between 50% and 70% of multiword entries (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Empirical evidence confirms these estimations: as an example, we found that 56.7% of the terms annotated in the Genia corpus are composed by two or more words, and this is an underestimation since it does not include general-purpose MWEs such as phrasal verbs and fixed expressions.",
        "The goal of mwetoolkit is to aid lexicographers and terminographers in the task of creating language resources that include multiword entries.",
        "Therefore, we assume that, whenever a textual corpus of the target language/domain is available, it is possible to automatically extract interesting sequences of words that can be regarded as candidate MWEs."

        "dates from the corpus; then we filter them, so that we can discard as much noise as possible.",
        "Candidate generation uses flat linguistic information such as surface forms, lemmas and parts of speech (POS).",
        "We can then define target sequences of POS, such as VERB NOUN sequences, or even more fine-grained constraints which use lemmas, like fake NOUN and give NOUN, or POS patterns that include wildcards that stand for any word or POS.",
        "The optimal POS patterns for a given domain, language and MWE type can be defined based on the analysis of the data.",
        "For the candidate filtering a set of association measures (AMs), listed in figure i, are calculated for each candidate.",
        "A simple threshold can subsequently be applied to filter out all the candidates for which the AMs fall below a user-defined value.",
        "If a gold standard is available, the toolkit can build a classifier, automatically annotating each candidate to indicate whether it is contained in the gold standard (i.e. it is regarded as a true MWE) or not (i.e. it is regarded as a non-MWE).",
        "This annotation is not used to filter the lists, but only by the classifier to learn the relation between the AMs and the MWE class of the candidate.",
        "This is particularly useful because, to date, it remains unclear which AM performs better for a particular type or language, and the classifier applies measures according to their efficacy in filtering the candidates.Some examples of output are presented in table i."

        "One of the biggest advantages of our approach is that, since it is language independent, it is straightforward to apply it on corpora in virtually any language.",
        "Moreover, it is not dependent on a specific type of construction or syntactic formalism.",
        "Of course, since it only uses limited linguistic information, the accuracy of the resulting lists can always be further improved with language-dependent tools.",
        "In sum, the toolkit allows users to perform systematic MWE extraction with consistent intermediary files and well defined scripts and arguments (avoiding the need for a series of ad hoc separate scripts).",
        "Even if some basic knowledge about how to run Python scripts and how to pass arguments to the command line is necessary, the user is not required to be a programmer.",
        "Nested MWEs are a problem in the current approach.",
        "Table 1 shows two bigrams International Cooperation and Cooperation Agreement, both evaluated as False candidates.",
        "However, they could be considered as parts of a larger MWE International Cooperation Agreement, but with the current methodology it is not possible to detect this kind of situation.",
        "Another case where the candidate contains a MWE is the example prohuman right, and in this case it would be necessary to separate the prefix from the MWE, i.e. to re-tokenise the words around the MWE candidate.",
        "Indeed, tools for consistent tokenisation, specially concerning dashes and slashes, could improve the quality of the results, in particular for specialised corpora.",
        "The toolkit provides full integration with web search engine APIs.",
        "The latter, however, are of limited utility because search engines are not only slow but also return more or less arbitrary numbers, some times even inconsistent (Ramisch et al., 2010c).",
        "When large corpora like EP are available, we suggest that it is better to use its counts rather than web counts.",
        "The toolkit provides an efficient indexing mechanism, allowing for arbitrary n-grams to be counted in linear time.",
        "The automatic evaluation of the candidates will always be limited by the coverage of the reference list.",
        "In the examples, Panama Canal is considered as a true MWE whereas US navy is not, but both are proper names and the latter should also be included as a true candidate.",
        "The same happens for the candidates Human Rights and human right.",
        "The mwetoolkit is an early prototype whose simple design allows fine tuning of knowledge-poor methods for MWE extraction.",

        "One of our goals for future versions is to be able to extract bilingual MWEs from parallel or comparable corpora automatically.",
        "This could be done through the inclusion of automatic word alignment information.",
        "Some previous experiments show, however, that this may not be enough, as automatic word alignment uses almost no linguistic information and its output is often quite noisy (Ramisch et al., 2010a).",
        "Combining alignment and shallow linguistic information seems a promising solution for the automatic extraction of bilingual MWEs.",
        "The potential uses of these lexica are multiple, but the most obvious application is machine translation.",
        "On the one hand, MWEs could be used to guide the word alignment process.",
        "For instance, this could solve the problem of aligning a language where compounds are separate words, like French, with a language that joins compound words together, like German.",
        "In statistical machine translation systems, MWEs could help to filter phrase tables or to boost the scores of phrases which words are likely to be multiwords.Some types of MWE (e.g. collocations) could help in the semantic disambiguation of words in the source language.",
        "The sense of a word defined by its collocate can allow to chose the correct target word or expression (Sere-tan, 2008).",
        "We would also like to improve the techniques implemented for candidate filtering.",
        "Related work showed that association measures based on contingency tables are more robust to data sparseness (Evert and Krenn, 2005).",
        "However, they are pairwise comparisons and their application on arbitrarily long n-grams is not straightforward.",
        "An heuristics to adapt these measures is to apply them recursively over increasing n-gram length.",
        "Other features that could provide better classification are context words, linguistic information coming from simple word lexica, syntax, semantic classes and domain-specific keywords.",
        "While for poor-resourced languages we can only count on shallow linguistic information, it is unreasonable to ignore available information for other languages.",
        "In general, machine learning performs better when more information is available (Pecina, 2008).",
        "We would like to evaluate our toolkit on several data sets, varying the languages, domains and target MWE types.",
        "This would allow us to assign its quantitative performance and to compare it to other tools performing similar tasks.",
        "Additionally, we could evaluate how well the classifiers perform across languages and domains.",
        "In short, we believe that the mwetoolkit is an important first step toward robust and reliable MWE treatment.",
        "It is a freely available core application providing flexible tools and coherent up-to-date documentation, and these are essential characteristics for the extension and support of any computer system."
