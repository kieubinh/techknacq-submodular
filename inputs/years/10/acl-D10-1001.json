        "Dynamic programming algorithms have been remarkably useful for inference in many NLP problems.",
        "Unfortunately, as models become more complex, for example through the addition of new features or components, dynamic programming algorithms can quickly explode in terms of computational or implementational complexity.",
        "As a result, efficiency of inference is a critical bottleneck for many problems in statistical NLP.",
        "This paper introduces dual decomposition (Dantzig and Wolfe, 1960; Komodakis et al., 2007) as a framework for deriving inference algorithms in NLP.",
        "Dual decomposition leverages the observation that complex inference problems can often be decomposed into efficiently solvable sub-problems.",
        "The approach leads to inference algorithms with the following properties:",
        "• The resulting algorithms are simple and efficient, building on standard dynamic-programming algorithms as oracle solvers for sub-problems, together with a method for forcing agreement between the oracles.",
        "• The algorithms provably solve a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the original inference problem.",
        "• Empirically, the LP relaxation often leads to an exact solution to the original problem.",
        "The approach is very general, and should be applicable to a wide range of problems in NLP.",
        "The connection to linear programming ensures that the algorithms provide a certificate of optimality when they recover the exact solution, and also opens up the possibility of methods that incrementally tighten the LP relaxation until it is exact (Sherali and Adams, 1994; Sontag et al., 2008).",
        "The structure of this paper is as follows.",
        "We first give two examples as an illustration of the approach: 1) integrated parsing and trigram part-of-speech (POS) tagging; and 2) combined phrase-structure and dependency parsing.",
        "In both settings, it is possible to solve the integrated problem through an \"intersected\" dynamic program (e.g., for integration of parsing and tagging, the construction from Bar-Hillel et al.",
        "(1964) can be used).",
        "However, these methods, although polynomial time, are substantially less efficient than our algorithms, and are considerably more complex to implement.",
        "Next, we describe exact polyhedral formulations for the two problems, building on connections between dynamic programming algorithms and marginal polytopes, as described in Martin et al.",
        "(1990).",
        "These allow us to precisely characterize the relationship between the exact formulations and the",
        "LP relaxations that we solve.",
        "We then give guarantees of convergence for our algorithms by showing that they are instantiations of Lagrangian relaxation, a general method for solving linear programs of a particular form.",
        "Finally, we describe experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",
        "First, we consider the integration of the generative model for phrase-structure parsing of Collins (2003), with the second-order discriminative dependency parser of Koo et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "This is an interesting problem in its own right: the goal is to inject the high performance of discriminative dependency models into phrase-structure parsing.",
        "The method uses off-the-shelf decoders for the two models.",
        "We find three main results: 1) in spite of solving an LP relaxation, empirically the method finds an exact solution on over 99% of the examples; 2) the method converges quickly, typically requiring fewer than 10 iterations of decoding; 3) the method gives gains over a baseline method that forces the phrase-structure parser to produce the same dependencies as the first-best output from the dependency parser (the Collins (2003) model has an F1 score of 88.1%; the baseline method has an F1 score of 89.7%; and the dual decomposition method has an F1 score of 90.7%).",
        "In a second set of experiments, we use dual decomposition to integrate the trigram POS tagger of Toutanova and Manning (2000) with the parser of Collins (2003).",
        "We again find that the method finds an exact solution in almost all cases, with convergence in just a few iterations of decoding.",
        "Although the focus of this paper is on dynamic programming algorithms – both in the experiments, and also in the formal results concerning marginal polytopes – it is straightforward to use other combinatorial algorithms within the approach.",
        "For example, Koo et al.",

        "Our approach similarly makes use of combinatorial algorithms to efficiently solve subproblems of the global inference problem.",

        "Given the widespread use of dynamic programming in NLP, there should be many applications for the approach.",
        "There are several possible extensions of the method we have described.",
        "We have focused on cases where two models are being combined; the extension to more than two models is straightforward (e.g., see Komodakis et al.",

        "We now give an example of a point (ß, v) G Q'\\conv(Q) that demonstrates that the relaxation Q' is strictly larger than conv( Q).",
        "Fractional points such as this one can arise as solutions of the LP relaxation for worst case instances, preventing us from finding an exact solution.",
        "Recall that the constraints for Q' specify that ß G conv(Y), v G conv(Z), and ß(i,t) = v(i,t) for all (i,t) G Iuni.",
        "Since ß G conv(Y), ß must be a convex combination of 1 or more members of Y; a similar property holds for v. The example is as follows.",
        "There are two possible parts of speech, A and B, and an additional non-terminal symbol X.",
        "The sentence is of length 3, w1 w2 w3.",

        "To demonstrate that this fractional point is not in conv(Q), we give parameter values such that this fractional point is optimal and all integral points (i.e., actual parses) are suboptimal.",
