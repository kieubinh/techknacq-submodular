        "The latent variable approach of Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) is capable of learning high accuracy context-free grammars directly from a raw treebank.",
        "It starts from a coarse treebank grammar (Charniak, 1997), and uses latent variables to refine the context-free assumptions encoded in the grammar.",
        "A hierarchical split-and-merge algorithm introduces grammar complexity gradually, iteratively splitting (and potentially merging back) each observed treebank category into a number of increasingly refined latent subcategories.",
        "The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to train the model, guaranteeing that each EM iteration will increase the training likelihood.",
        "However, because the latent variable grammars are not explicitly regularized, EM keeps fitting the training data and eventually begins over-fitting (Liang et al., 2007).",
        "Moreover, EM is a local method, making no promises regarding the final point of convergence when initialized from different random seeds.",
        "Recently, Petrov (2010) showed that substantial differences between the learned grammars remain, even if the hierarchical splitting reduces the variance across independent runs of EM.",
        "In order to counteract the overfitting behavior, Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) introduced a linear smoothing procedure that allows training grammars for 6 split-merge (SM) rounds without overfitting.",
        "The increased expressiveness of the model, combined with the more robust parameter estimates provided by the smoothing, results in a nice increase in parsing accuracy on a held-out set.",
        "However, as reported by Petrov (2009) and Huang and Harper (2009), an additional 7th SM round actually hurts performance.",
        "Huang and Harper (2009) addressed the issue of data sparsity and overfitting from a different angle.",
        "They showed that self-training latent variable grammars on their own output can mitigate data sparsity issues and improve parsing accuracy.",
        "Because the capacity of the model can grow with the size of the training data, latent variable grammars are able to benefit from the additional training data, even though it is not perfectly labeled.",
        "Consequently, they also found that a 7th round of SM training was beneficial in the presence of large amounts of training data.",
        "However, variation still remains in their self-trained grammars and they had to use a held-out set for model selection.",
        "The observation of variation is not surprising; EM's tendency to get stuck in local maxima has been studied extensively in the literature, resulting in various proposals for model selection methods (e.g., see",
        "Burnham and Anderson (2002)).",
        "What is perhaps more surprising is that the different latent variable grammars seem to capture complementary aspects of the data.",
        "Petrov (2010) showed that a simple randomization scheme produces widely varying grammars.",
        "Quite serendipitously, these grammars can be combined into an unweighted product model that substantially outperforms the individual grammars.",
        "In this paper, we combine the ideas of self-training and product models and show that both techniques provide complementary effects.",
        "We hypothesize that the main factors contributing to the final accuracy of the product model of self-trained grammars are (i) the accuracy of the grammar used to parse the unlabeled data for retraining (single grammar versus product of grammars) and (ii) the diversity of the grammars that are being combined (self-trained grammars trained using the same automatically labeled subset or different subsets).",
        "We conduct a series of analyses to develop an understanding of these factors, and conclude that both dimensions are important for obtaining significant improvements over the standard product models."

        "We conducted experiments in two genres: newswire text and broadcast news transcripts.",
        "For the newswire studies, we used the standard setup (sections 02-21 for training, 22 for development, and 23 for final test) of the WSJ Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1999) for supervised training.",
        "The BLLIP corpus (Charniak et al., 2000) was used as a source of unlabeled data for self-training the WSJ grammars.",
        "We ignored the parse trees contained in the BLLIP corpus and retained only the sentences, which are already segmented and tokenized for parsing (e.g., contractions are split into two tokens and punctuation is separated from the words).",
        "We partitioned the 1,769,055 BLLIP sentences into 10 equally sized subsets.",
        "For broadcast news (BN), we utilized the Broadcast News treebank from Ontonotes (Weischedel et al., 2008) together with the WSJ Penn Treebank for supervised training, because their combination results in better parser models compared to using the limited-sized BN corpus alone (86.7 F vs. 85.2 F).",
        "The files in the Broadcast News treebank represent news stories collected during different time periods with a diversity of topics.",
        "In order to obtain a representative split of train-test-development sets, we divided them into blocks of 10 files sorted by alphabetical filename order.",
        "We used the first file in each block for development, the second for test, and the remaining files for training.",
        "This training set was then combined with the entire WSJ treebank.",
        "We also used 10 equally sized subsets from the Hub4 CSR 1996 utterances (Garofolo et al., 1996) for self-training.",
        "The Hub 4 transcripts are markedly noisier than the BLLIP corpus is, in part because it is harder to sentence segment, but also because it was produced by human transcription of spoken language.",
        "The treebanks were preprocessed differently for the two genres.",
        "For newswire, we used a slightly modified version of the WSJ treebank: empty nodes and function labels were deleted and auxiliary verbs were replaced with AUXB, AUXG, AUXZ, AUXD, or AUXN to represent infinitive, progressive, present, past, or past participle auxiliaries.",
        "The targeted use of the broadcast models is for parsing broadcast news transcripts for language models in speech recognition systems.",
        "Therefore, in addition to applying the transformations used for newswire, we also replaced symbolic expressions with verbal forms (e.g., $5 was replaced with five dollars) and removed punctuation and case.",
        "The Hub4 data was segmented into utterances, punctuation was removed, words were down-cased, and contractions were tokenized for parsing.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the data set sizes used in our experiments, together with average sentence length and standard deviation.",

        "Using this method, BN scores were slightly (.05-.1) lower than if EDITED constituents were treated like any other, as in EVALB.",
        "We use the latent variable grammar (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006) implementation of Huang and Harper (2009) in this work.",
        "Latent variable grammars augment the observed parse trees in the treebank with a latent variable at each tree node.",
        "This effectively splits each observed category into a set of latent subcategories.",
        "An EM-algorithm is used to fit the model by maximizing the joint likelihood of parse trees and sentences.",
        "To allocate the grammar complexity only where needed, a simple split-and-merge procedure is applied.",
        "In every split-merge (SM) round, each latent variable is first split in two and the model is re-estimated.",
        "A likelihood criterion is used to merge back the least useful splits (50% merge rate for these experiments).",
        "This iterative refinement proceeds for 7 rounds, at which point parsing performance on a held-out set levels off and training becomes prohibitively slow.",
        "Since EM is a local method, different initializations will result in different grammars.",
        "In fact, Petrov (2010) recently showed that this EM-algorithm is very unstable and converges to widely varying local maxima.",
        "These local maxima correspond to different high quality latent variable grammars that have captured different types of patterns in the data.",
        "Because the individual models' mistakes are independent to some extent, multiple grammars can be effectively combined into an unweighted product model of much higher accuracy.",

        "We will further investigate the causes for this effect in Section 5.",

        "The product of ST-Reg grammars achieves significantly better performance over the individual grammars, however, the improvement is much smaller than that obtained by the product of regular grammars.",
        "In fact, the product of ST-Reg grammars performs quite similarly to the product of regular grammars despite the higher average accuracy of the individual grammars.",
        "This may be caused by the fact that self-training on the same data tends to reduce the variation among the self-trained grammars.",
        "We will show in Section 5 that the diversity among the individual grammars is as important as average accuracy for the performance attained by the product model.",
        "Since products of latent variable grammars perform significantly better than individual latent variable grammars, it is natural to try using the product model for parsing the unlabeled data.",
        "To investigate whether the higher accuracy of the automatically labeled data translates into a higher accuracy of the self-trained grammars, we used the product of 6th round grammars to parse the same subset of the unlabeled data as in the previous experiment.",

        "As can be seen in Table 4, using the product of the regular grammars for labeling the self-training data results in improved individual ST-Prod grammars when compared with the ST-Reg grammars, with 0.2 and 0.3 improvements for the best SM6 and SM7 grammars, respectively.",
        "Interestingly, the best individual SM7 ST-Prod grammar (91.9 F) performs comparably to the product of the regular grammars (92.0 F) that was used to label the BLLIP subset used for self-training.",
        "This is very useful for practical reasons because a single grammar is faster to parse with and requires less memory than the product model.",
        "The product of the SM6 ST-Prod grammars also achieves a 0.2 higher F score compared to the product of the SM6 ST-Reg grammars, but the product of the SM7 ST-Prod grammars has the same performance as the product of the SM7 ST-Reg grammars.",
        "This could be due to the fact that the ST-Prod grammars are no more diverse than the ST-Reg grammars, as we will show in Section 5.",
        "When creating a product model of regular grammars, Petrov (2010) used a different random seed for each model and conjectured that the effectiveness of the product grammars stems from the resulting diversity of the individual grammars.",
        "Two ways to systematically introduce bias into individual models are to either modify the feature sets (Baldridge and Osborne, 2008; Smith and Osborne, 2007) or to change the training distributions of the individual models (Breiman, 1996).",
        "Petrov (2010) attempted to use the second method to train individual grammars on either disjoint or overlapping subsets of the treebank, but observed a performance drop in individual grammars resulting from training on less data, as well as in the performance of the product model.",
        "Rather than reducing the amount of gold training data (or having treebank experts annotate more data to support the diversity), we employ the self-training paradigm to train models using a combination of the same gold training data with different sets of the self-labeled training data.",
        "This approach also allows us to utilize a much larger amount of low-cost self-labeled data than can be used to train one model by partitioning the data into ten subsets and then training ten models with a different subset.",

        "As can be observed, there are significant variations among the individual grammars, and the product of the regular grammars improves almost all categories, with a few exceptions (some individual grammars do better on QP and WHNP constituents).",

        "As more latent variables are introduced through the iterative SM training algorithm, the modeling capacity of the grammars increases, leading to improved performance.",
        "However, the performance of the regular grammars drops after 6 SM rounds, as also previously observed in (Huang and Harper, 2009; Petrov, 2009), suggesting that the regular SM7 grammars have overfit the relatively small-sized gold training data.",
        "In contrast, the performance of the self-trained grammars continues to improve in the 7th SM round.",
        "Huang and Harper (2009) argued that the additional self-labeled training data adds a smoothing effect to the grammars, supporting an increase in model complexity without overfitting.",
        "Although the performance of the individual grammars, both regular and self-trained, varies significantly and the product model consistently helps, there is a non-negligible difference between the improvement achieved by the two product models over their component grammars.",
        "The regular product model improves upon its individual grammars more than the ST-Prod-Mult product does in the later SM rounds, as illustrated by the relative error reduction curves in figures 2(a) and (b).",
        "In particular, the product of the SM7 regular grammars gains a remarkable 2.1% absolute improvement over the average performance of the individual regular SM7 grammars and 0.2% absolute over the product of the regular SM6 grammars, despite the fact that the individual regular SM7 grammars perform worse than the SM6 grammars.",
        "This suggests that the product model is able to effectively exploit less smooth, overfit grammars.",
        "We will examine this issue further in the next subsection.",
        "From the perspective of Products of Experts (Hinton, 1999) or Logarithmic Opinion Pools (Smith et al., 2005), each individual expert learns complementary aspects of the training data and the veto power of product models enforces that the joint prediction of their product has to be licensed by all individual experts.",
        "One possible explanation of the observation in the previous subsection is that with the addition of more latent variables, the individual grammars become more deeply specialized on certain aspects of the training data.",
        "This specialization leads to greater diversity in their prediction preferences, especially in the presence of a small training set.",
        "On the other hand, the self-labeled training set size is much larger, and so the specialization process is therefore slowed down.",
        "Petrov (2010) showed that the individually learned grammars are indeed very diverse by looking at the distribution of latent annotations across the treebank categories, as well as the variation in overall and individual category F scores (see Figure 1).",
        "However, these measures do not directly relate to the diversity of the prediction preferences of the grammars, as we observed similar patterns in the regular and self-trained models.",
        "Given a sentence s and a set of grammars G = [G\\, • • • , Gn}, recall that the decoding algorithm of the product model (Petrov, 2010) searches for the best tree T such that the following objective function is maximized:",
        "YllogP(r|s,G)",
        "where logp(r|s, G) is the log posterior probability of rule r given sentence s and grammar G. The power of the product model comes directly from the diversity in logp(r|s,G) among individual grammars.",
        "If there is little diversity, the individual grammars would make similar predictions and there would be little or no benefit from using a product model.",
        "We use the average empirical variance of the log posterior probabilities of the rules among the learned grammars over a held-out set S as a proxy of the diversity among the grammars:",
        "sESoeg ren(c,s) sesoeg ren(G,s)",

        "Note that the average empirical variance is only an approximation of the diversity among grammars.",
        "In particular, this measure tends to be biased to produce larger numbers when the posterior probabilities of rules tend to be small, because small differences in probability produce large changes in the log scale.",
        "This happens for coarser grammars produced in early SM stages when there is more uncertainty about what rules to apply, with the rules remaining in the parsing chart having low probabilities overall.",
        "As shown in Figure 2(c), the average variances all start at a high value and then drop, probably due to the aforementioned bias.",

        "It is also important to note that there is more variance among the ST-Prod-Mult grammars, which were trained on disjoint self-labeled training data, and a greater improvement in their product model relative to the ST-Reg and ST-Prod grammars, further supporting the diversity hypothesis.",

        "We demonstrated empirically on newswire and broadcast news genres that very high accuracies can be achieved by training grammars on disjoint sets of automatically labeled data.",

        "First, the accuracy of the model used for parsing the unla-beled data is important for the accuracy of the resulting single self-trained grammars.",
        "Second, the diversity of the individual grammars controls the gains that can be obtained by combining multiple grammars into a product model.",
        "Our most accurate single grammar achieves an F score of 91.6 on the WSJ test set, rivaling discriminative reranking approaches (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and products of latent variable grammars (Petrov, 2010), despite being a single generative PCFG.",
        "Our most accurate product model achieves an F score of 92.5 without the use of discriminative reranking and comes close to the best known numbers on this test set (Zhang et al., 2009).",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate additional methods for increasing the diversity of our self-trained models.",
        "One possibility would be to utilize more unlabeled data or to identify additional ways to bias the models.",
        "It would also be interesting to determine whether further increasing the accuracy of the model used for automatically labeling the unlabeled data can enhance performance even more.",
        "A simple but computationally expensive way to do this would be to parse the data with an SM7 product model.",
        "Finally, for this work, we always used products of 10 grammars, but we sometimes observed that subsets of these grammars produce even better results on the development set.",
        "Finding a way to select grammars from a grammar pool to achieve high performance products is an interesting area of future study."
