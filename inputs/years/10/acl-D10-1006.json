        "With the dramatic growth of opinionated user-generated content, consumers often turn to online product reviews to seek advice while companies see reviews as a valuable source of consumer feedback.",
        "How to automatically understand, extract and summarize the opinions expressed in online reviews has therefore become an important research topic and gained much attention in recent years (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "A wide spectrum of tasks have been studied under review mining, ranging from coarse-grained document-level polarity classification (Pang et al., 2002) to fine-grained extraction of opinion expressions and their targets (Wu et al., 2009).",
        "In particular, a general framework of summarizing reviews of a certain product is to first identify different aspects (a.k.a.",
        "features) of the given product and then extract specific opinion expressions for each aspect.",
        "For example, aspects of a restaurant may include food, staff, ambience and price, and opinion expressions for staff may include friendly, rude, etc.",
        "Because of the practicality of this structured summary format, it has been adopted in several previous studies (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Brody and Elhadad, 2010) as well as some commercial systems, e.g. the \"scorecard\" feature at Bing shopping.",
        "Different approaches have been proposed to identify aspect words and phrases from reviews.",
        "Previous methods using frequent itemset mining (Hu and Liu, 2004) or supervised learning (Jin and Ho, 2009; Jin et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2009) have the limitation that they do not group semantically related aspect expressions together.",
        "Supervised learning also suffers from its heavy dependence on training data.",
        "In contrast, unsupervised, knowledge-lean topic modeling approach has been shown to be effective in automatically identifying aspects and their representative words (Titov and McDonald, 2008; Brody and Elhadad, 2010).",
        "For example, words such as waiter, waitress, staff and service are grouped into one aspect.",
        "We follow this promising direction and extend existing topic models to jointly identify both aspect and opinion words, especially aspect-specific opinion words.",
        "Current topic models for opinion mining, which we will review in detail in Section 2, still lack this ability.",
        "But separating aspect and opinion words can be very useful.",
        "Aspect-specific opinion words can be used to construct a domain-dependent sentiment lexicon and applied to tasks such as sentiment classification.",
        "They can also provide more informative descriptions of the product or service being reviewed.",
        "For example, using more specific opinion words such as cozy and romantic to describe the ambience aspect in a review summary is more meaningful than using generic words such as nice and great.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, Brody and Elhadad (2010) are the first to study aspect-specific opinion words, but their opinion word detection is performed outside of topic modeling, and they only consider adjectives as possible opinion words.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new topic modeling approach that can automatically separate aspect and opinion words.",
        "A novelty of this model is the integration of a discriminative maximum entropy (Max-Ent) component with the standard generative component.",
        "The MaxEnt component allows us to leverage arbitrary features such as POS tags to help separate aspect and opinion words.",
        "Because the supervision relies mostly on non-lexical features, although our model is no longer fully unsupervised, the number of training sentences needed is relatively small.",
        "Moreover, training data can also come from a different domain and yet still remain effective, making our model highly domain adaptive.",
        "Empirical evaluation on large review data sets shows that our model can effectively identify both aspects and aspect-specific opinion words with a small amount of training data."

      "text": [
        "Our model is an extension of LDA (Blei et al., 2003) but captures both aspect words and opinion words.",
        "To model the aspect words, we use a modified version of the multi-grain topic models from (Titov and McDonald, 2008).",
        "Our model is simpler and yet still produces meaningful aspects.",
        "Specifically, we assume that there are T aspects in a given collection of reviews from the same domain, and each review document contains a mixture of aspects.",
        "We further assume that each sentence (instead of each word as in standard LDA) is assigned to a single aspect, which is often true based on our observation.",
        "To understand how we model the opinion words, let us first look at two example review sentences from the restaurant domain:",
        "The food was tasty.",
        "The waiter was quite friendly.",
        "We can see that there is a strong association of tasty with food and similarly offriendly with waiter.",
        "While both tasty and friendly are specific to the restaurant domain, they are each associated with only a single aspect, namely food and staff, respectively.",
        "Besides these aspect-specific opinion words, we also see general opinion words such as great in the sentence \"The food was great!\"",
        "These general opinion words are shared across aspects, as opposed to aspect-specific opinion words which are used most commonly with their corresponding aspects.",
        "We therefore introduce a general opinion model and T aspect-specific opinion models to capture these different opinion words.",
        "We now describe the generative process of the model.",
        "First, we draw several multinomial word distributions from a symmetric Dirichlet prior with parameter ß: a background model (f)B, a general aspect model <fiA'a, a general opinion model <fi°'a, T aspect models {^A't}f=1 and T aspect-specific opinion models {^°'t}f=1.",
        "All these are multinomial distributions over the vocabulary, which we assume has V words.",
        "Then for each review document d, we draw a topic distribution 9d^Dir(a) as in standard LDA.",
        "For each sentence s in document d, we draw an aspect assignment zd)s<~-Multi(#d).",
        "Now for each word in sentence s of document d, we have several choices: The word may describe the specific aspect (e.g. waiter for the staff aspect), or a general aspect (e.g. restaurant), or an opinion either specific to the aspect (e.g. friendly) or generic (e.g. great), or a commonly used background word (e.g. know).",
        "To distinguish between these choices, we introduce two indicator variable, ydsn and udsn, for the nth word wdsn.",
        "We draw ydsn from a multinomial distribution over {0,1, 2}, parameterized by nd,s,n.",
        "yd s n determines whether wdsn is a background word, aspect word or opinion word.",
        "We will discuss how to set ndsn in Section 3.2.",
        "We draw udssn from a Bernoulli distribution over {0,1} parameterized by p, which in turn is drawn from a symmetric Beta(7).",
        "udssnn determines whether wdssn is general or aspect-specific.",
        "We then draw wdss n as follows:",
        "A simple way to set nd's,n is to draw it from a symmetric Dirichlet prior.",
        "However, as suggested in (Mei et al., 2007; Lin and He, 2009), fully unsupervised topic models are unable to identify opinion words well.",
        "An important observation we make is that aspect words and opinion words usually play different syntactic roles in a sentence.",
        "Aspect words tend to be nouns while opinion words tend to be adjectives.",
        "Their contexts in sentences can also be different.",
        "But we do not want to use strict rules to separate aspect and opinion words because there are also exceptions.",
        "E.g. verbs such as recommend can also be opinion words.",
        "In order to use information such as POS tags to help discriminate between aspect and opinion words, we propose a novel idea as follows: We set nds,n using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model applied to a feature vector xdss n associated with wdssn.",
