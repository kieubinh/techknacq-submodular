        "We experiment with a variety of lexical and syntactic features, yielding significant performance gains over bag-of-words feature sets.",
        "In the second stage, we introduce Comparative LexRank, a novel random walk formulation to score sentences and pairs of sentences from opposite viewpoints based on both their representativeness of the collection as well as their contrastiveness with each other.",

      "text": [
        "The amount of opinionated text available online has been growing rapidly, increasing the need for systems that can summarize opinions expressed in such text so that a user can easily digest them.",
        "In this paper, we study how to summarize opinionated text in a such a way that highlights contrast between multiple viewpoints, which is a little-studied task.",
        "Usually, online opinionated text is generated by multiple people, and thus often contains multiple viewpoints about an issue or topic.",
        "A viewpoint/perspective refers to \"a mental position from which things are viewed\" (cf. WordNet).",
        "An opinion is usually expressed in association with a particular viewpoint, even though the viewpoint is usually",
        "*Now at Johns Hopkins University (mpaul@cs.jhu.edu).",
        "not explicitly given; for example, a blogger that is in favor of a policy would likely look at the positive aspects of the policy (i.e., positive viewpoint), while someone against the policy would likely emphasize the negative aspects (i.e., negative viewpoint).",
        "Moreover, in an opinionated text with diverse opinions, the multiple viewpoints taken by opinion holders are often \"contrastive\", leading to opposite polarities.",
        "Indeed, such contrast in opinions may be a main driving force behind many online discussions.",
        "Futhermore, opinions regarding news events and other short-term issues may quickly emerge and disappear.",
        "Such opinions may reflect many different types of viewpoints which cannot be modeled by current systems.",
        "For this reason, we believe that a viewpoint summarization system would benefit from the ability to extract unlabeled viewpoints without supervision.",
        "Even if such clustering has inaccuracies, it could still be a useful starting point for human editors to select representative excerpts.",
        "Thus, given a set of opinionated documents about a topic, we aim at automatically extracting and summarizing the multiple contrastive viewpoints implicitly expressed in the opinionated text to facilitate digestion and comparison of different viewpoints.",
        "Specifically, we will generate two types of multi-view summaries: macro multi-view summary and micro multi-view summary.",
        "A macro multi-view summary would contain multiple sets of sentences, each representing a different viewpoint; these different sets of sentences can be compared to understand the difference of multiple viewpoints at the \"macro level.\"",
        "A micro multi-view summary would contain a set of pairs of contrastive sentences (each pair consists of two sentences representing two different viewpoints), making it easy to understand the difference between two viewpoints at the \"micro level.\"",
        "Although opinion summarization has been extensively studied (e.g., (Liu et al., 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2006; Zhuang et al., 2006)), existing work has not attempted to generate our envisioned contrastive macro and micro multi-view summaries in an unsupervised way, which is the goal of our work.",
        "For example, Hu and Liu (2006) rank sentences based on their dominant sentiment according to the polarity of adjectives occuring near a product feature in a sentence.",
        "A contradiction occurs when two sentences are highly unlikely to be simultaneously true (cf. (Marneffe et al., 2008)).",
        "Although little work has been done on contradiction detection, there are a few notable approaches (Harabagiu et al., 2006; Marneffe et al., 2008; Kim and Zhai, 2009).",
        "The closest work to ours is perhaps that of Ler-man and McDonald (2009) who present an approach to contrastive summarization.",
        "They add an objective to their summarization model such that the summary model for one set of text is different from the model for the other set.",
        "The idea is to highlight the key differences between the sets, however this is a different type of contrast than the one we study here our goal is instead to make the summaries similar to each other, to contrast how the same information is conveyed through different viewpoints.",
        "In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to solving this novel summarization problem, which will be explained in the following two sections."

      "text": [
        "The first challenge to be solved in order to generate a contrastive summary of multiple viewpoints is to model and extract these viewpoints which are hidden in text.",
        "In this paper we propose to solve this challenge by employing the Topic-Aspect Model (TAM) (Paul and Girju, 2010), which is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003) for jointly modeling topics and viewpoints in text.",
        "While most existing work on such topic models (including TAM) has taken a topic model as a generative model for word tokens in text, we propose to take TAM as a generative model for more complex linguistic features extracted from text.",
        "These are more discriminative than single word tokens and can improve the accuracy of extracting multiple viewpoints as we will show in the experimental results' section.",
        "Below we first give a brief introduction to TAM and then present the proposed set of features.",
        "LDA-style probabilistic topic models of document content (Blei et al., 2003) have been shown to offer state-of-the-art summarization quality.",
        "Such models also provide a framework for adding additional structure to a summarization model (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",
        "In our case, we want to add more structure to a model to incorporate the notion of viewpoint/perspective into our summaries.",
        "When it comes to extracting viewpoints, recent research suggests that it may be beneficial to model both topics and perspectives, as sentiment may be expressed differently depending on the issue involved (Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Paul and Girju, 2010).",
        "For example, let's consider a set of product reviews for a home theater system.",
        "Content topics in this data might include things like sound quality, usability, etc., while the viewpoints might be the positive and negative sentiments.",
        "A word like speakers, for instance depends on the sound topic but not a viewpoint, while good would be an example of a word that depends on a viewpoint but not any particular topic.",
        "A word like loud would depend on both (since it would be considered positive sentiment only in the context of the sound quality topic), while a word like think depends on neither.",
        "We make use of a recent model, the Topic-Aspect Model (Paul and Girju, 2010), which can model such behavior with or without supervision.",
        "Under this model, a document has a mixture over topics as well as a mixture over viewpoints.",
        "The two mixtures are drawn independently of each other, and thus can be thought of as two separate clustering dimensions.",
        "A word is associated with variables denoting its topic and viewpoint assignments, as well as two binary variables to denote if the word depends on the topic and if the word depends on the viewpoint.",
        "A word may depend on the topic, the viewpoint, both, or neither, as in the above example.",
        "The generative process for a document d under this model can be briefly described as follows.",
        "For each word in a document:",
        "1.",
        "Sample a topic z from P(z|d) and a viewpoint v from P (v|d).",
        "2.",
        "Sample a \"level\" £ e {0,1} from P(£|d).",
        "This determines if the word will depend on the topic (topical level) or not (background level).",
        "3.",
        "Sample a \"route\" r e {0,1} from P(r|£, z).",
        "This determines if the word will depend on the viewpoint.",
        "4.",
        "Sample a word w from P(w|z, v, r, £).",
        "The probabilities are multinomial/binomial distributions with Dirichlet/Beta priors, and thus this model falls under the standard LDA framework.",
        "The number of topics and number of viewpoints are parameters that must be specified.",
        "Inference can be done with Gibbs sampling (Paul and Girju, 2010).",
        "TAM naturally gives us a very rich output to use in a viewpoint summarization application.",
        "If we are doing unsupervised viewpoint extraction, we can use the output of the model to compute P(v|sentence) which could be used to generate summaries that contain only excerpts that strongly highlight one viewpoint over another.",
        "Similarly, we could use the learned topic mixtures to generate topic-specific summaries.",
        "Futhermore, the variables r and £ tell us if a word is dependent on the viewpoint and topic, and we could use this information to focus on sentences that contain informative content words.",
        "Note that without supervision, TAM's clustering is based only on co-occurrences and the patterns it captures may or may not correspond with the viewpoints we wish to extract.",
        "Nonetheless, we show in this research that it can indeed find meaningful viewpoints with reasonable accuracy on certain data sets.",
        "Although we do not explore this in this paper, additional information about the viewpoints could be added to TAM by defining priors on the distributions to further improve the accuracy of viewpoint discovery.",
        "Previous work with TAM used only bag of words features, which may not be the best features for capturing viewpoints.",
        "For example, \"Israel attacked Palestine\" and \"Palestine attacked Israel\" are identical excerpts in an exchangable bag of words representation, yet one is more likely to come from the perspective of a Palestinian and the other from an Israeli.",
        "In this subsection, we will propose a variety of feature sets.",
        "We evaluate the utility of these features to the task of modeling viewpoints by measuring the accuracy of unsupervised clustering.",
        "We have experimented with simple bag of words features as baseline approaches, both with and without removing stop words, and found that the accuracy of clustering by viewpoint is better when retaining all words.",
        "This supports the observation that common function words may have important psychological properties (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007).",
        "Thus, we do not do any stop word removal for any of our other feature sets.",
        "We find that we get better results by stemming the words, so we apply Porter's stemmer to all of our features described.",
        "It has been shown that using syntactic information can improve the accuracy of sentiment models (Joshi and Rose, 2009).",
        "Thus, instead of representing documents as a bag of words, we will experiment with using features returned by a dependency parser.",
        "For this, we used the Stanford parser, which returns dependency tuples of the form rel(a, b) where rel is some dependency relation and a and b are tokens of a sentence.",
        "We can use these specific tuples as features, referred here as the full-tuple representation.",
        "One problem with this representation is that we are using very specific information and it is harder for learning algorithms to find patterns due to the lack of redundancy.",
        "One solution is to generalize these features and rewrite a tuple rel (a, b) as two tuples: rel (a, *) and rel(*, b) (Greene and Resnik, 2009; Joshi and Rose, 2009).",
        "We will refer to this as the split-tuple representation.",
        "If a word Wi appears in the head of a neg relation, then we would like this to be reflected in other dependency tuples in which wi occurs.",
        "For a tuple rel(wi, Wj), if either wi or Wj is negated, then we simply rewrite it as -rel(wi, Wj).",
        "An alternative would be to rewrite the individual word wi as -wi.",
        "However in our experiments this representation produced worse accuracies, perhaps because this produces less redundancy.",
        "We also hypothesize that lexical polarity information may improve our model.",
        "If we are using the full-tuple representation, then a tuple becomes more general by replacing the specific word with a + or – .",
        "In the case that both words are polarity words, we use two tuples, replacing only one word at a time rather than replacing both words with their polarity signs.",
        "To determine the polarity of a word, we simply use the Subjectivity Clues lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005) and as polarity values, positive (+), negative (-), and neutral (*).",
        "Under our split-tuple representation, this becomes more specific by replacing the * with the polarity sign.",
        "For example, the tuple amod(idea, good) would be represented as amod(idea, +) and amod(*,good).",
        "We collapse negated features to flip the polarity sign such that -rel(a, +) becomes rel(a, – ).",
        "We also experimented with backing off the relations themselves.",
        "Since the Stanford dependencies can be organized in a hierarchy, we will represent the relations at more generalized levels in the hierarchy.",
        "For example, both a direct object and an indirect object are a type of object.",
        "For a relation rel, we define Rrei as the relation above rel in the hierarchy - for example, Rdobj = obj.",
        "We make an exception for neg which has its own important properties that we wish to retain, so we let Rneg = neg.",
        "Thus, when using these features, we rewrite rel(a, b) as Rrei(a, b)."

        "The number of excerpts in each Xican be empirically set based on application needs.",
        "2) A micro contrastive summary Smicro consists of a set of excerpt pairs, each containing two excerpts from two different viewpoints, i.e., Smicro = {(s1, t1),(sn, tn)} where si e X and tie X are two comparable excerpts representing two different viewpoints.",
        "n is the length of the summary, which can be set empirically based on application needs.",
        "Note that both macro and micro summaries can reveal contrast between different viewpoints, though at different granularity levels.",
        "To generate macro and micro summaries based on the probabilistic assignment of excerpts to viewpoints given by TAM, we propose a novel extension to the LexRank algorithm (Erkan and Radev, 2004), a graph-based method for scoring representative excerpts to be used in a summary.",

        "As a result, the stationary distribution of the random walk model would capture representative contrastive excerpts and allow us to generate both macro and micro contrastive summaries within a unified framework.",
        "We now describe this novel summarization algorithm (called Comparative LexRank) in detail.",
        "LexRank is a PageRank-like algorithm (Page et al., 1998), where we define a random walk model on top of a graph that has sentences to be summarized as nodes and edges placed between two sentences that are similar to each other.",
        "We can then score all the sentences based on the expected probability of a random walker visiting each sentence.",
        "We use the shorthand P (xj |xi) to denote the probability of being at node xj at a time t given that the walker was at xi at time t – 1.",

        "The second modification is to further favor jumping between two excerpts that can potentially form a good contrastive pair for use in generating a micro contrastive summary.",

        "We define this decision as a binary variable z e {0,1}.",
        "Intuitively, if we can force the random walker to move back and forth between viewpoints, then the final scores will favor sentences that are similar across both viewpoints.",

        "In our experiments, P(v|x) comes from the output of TAM, and we define sim(xi, xj ) as the cosine between the vectors xi and xj, although again any similarity function could be used.",

        "Specifically:",

        "Many techniques could be used to accomplish this (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; McDonald, 2007), but we use a simple greedy approach: at each step of the summary generation algorithm, we add the excerpt with the highest relevance score as long as the excerpt's redundancy score - the cosine similarity between the candidate and the current summary - is under some threshold 5.",

        "Responses in this set tend to be short and often incomplete or otherwise ill-formed and informal sentences.",
        "Respondants indicate if they are 'for' or 'against' the bill, and there is a roughly even mix of the two viewpoints (45% for and 48% against).",
        "We also use the Bitterlemons corpus, a collection of 594 editorials about the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
        "This dataset is fully described in (Lin et al., 2006) and has been used in other perspective modeling literature (Lin et al., 2008; Greene and Resnik, 2009).",
        "The style of this data differs substantially from the healthcare data in that documents in this set tend to be long and verbose articles with well-formed sentences.",
        "It again contains a fairly even mixture of two different perspectives: 312 articles from Israeli authors and 282 articles from Palestinian authors.",
        "Moreover, for the healthcare data set, manually extracted opinion polls are available on the Web, which we further leverage to construct gold standard summaries to evaluate our method quantitatively.",
        "The data and test sets are available at",
        "http://apfel.ai.uiuc.edu/resources.html.",
        "The main research question we want to answer in modeling viewpoints is whether richer feature sets would lead to better accuracy than word features.",
        "We used our various feature sets as input to TAM and measured the accuracy of clustering documents by viewpoint.",
        "This evaluation serves both to measure how accurately this type of clustering can be done, as well as to measure which types of features are important for modeling viewpoints.",
        "We found that the clustering accuracy is improved if we measure the accuracy of only the subset of documents such that P (v|doc) is greater than some threshold (we used 0.8).",
        "Thus, the accuraries presented in this section are measured using this confidence threshold.",
        "We will use this approach for the summarization task as well, as it ensures we are only summarizing documents where we have high confidence about their viewpoint membership.",
        "There are several parameters to set for TAM.",
        "Since our focus is on comparing linguistic features with word features, we simply set these parameters to some reasonable values: We used Dirich-let pseudo-counts of 80.0 for P= 0), 20.0 for P= 1), uniform pseudo-counts of 5.0 for P(x), 0.1 for the topic and aspect mixtures, and 0.01 for the word distributions.",
        "We tell the model to use 2 viewpoints as well as 5 topics for the healthcare corpus and 8 topics for the Bitterlemons corpus.",
        "There is high variance in the accuracies depending on how the Gibbs samplers were initialized.",
        "We thus repeated the experiments many times to obtain relatively confident measures - 200 times for the healthcare set and 50 times for the Bitterlemons set, with 2000 iterations each time.",
        "A natural way to select a model is to choose the model that gives the highest likelihood to its input.",
        "To evaluate how well this selection strategy would work, we measured the correlation between accuracy and likelihood.",
        "The results are shown in Table 1.",
        "We can make several observations.",
        "(1) In all cases, the proposed linguistic features yield higher accuracy than the word features, supporting our hypothesis that for viewpoint modeling, applying TAM to these features improves performance over using simple word features.",
        "Since virtually all existing work on topic models assumes word tokens as data to be modeled, our results suggest that it would be interesting to explore applying generative topic models to complex features for other tasks as well.",
        "This may be because by adding additional complex features to the observed data, we artificially inflate the data likelihood to emphasize modeling co-occurrences of such features, which effectively biases the model to capture a certain perspective of co-occurrences.",
        "(2) The increase is substantially greater for the Bitterlemons corpus, which may be due to the fact that the parsing accuracy is likely better because the language is formal.",
        "The split-tuple representation is very significantly better for the healthcare corpus, but it is not clear which is better for the Bitterlemons corpus.",
        "It is also not clear how the generalized relations affect the performance.",

        "The 95% confidence interval using a standard t-test is also given.",
        "Max refers to the maximum accuracy obtained over the 200 or 50 instances.",
