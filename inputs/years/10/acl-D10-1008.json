        "Cross-character links indicate that a single event affects multiple characters.",

        "Situational Affect States: Positive and negative affect states can represent good and bad situational states that characters find themselves in.",

        "• Direct expressions of plans/goals: a plan/goal may be explicitly stated (e.g., \"John wants food\").",
        "• Speech acts: a plan or goal may be revealed through a speech act.",
        "For example, \"the wolfasked an eagle to extract the bone\" is a directive speech act that indicates the wolf's plan to resolve its negative state (having a bone stuck).",
        "This example illustrates how a negative state (bone stuck) can motivate a mental state (plan).",
        "When a speech act involves multiple characters, it produces multiple mental states.",
        "• Inferred plans/goals: plans and goals are sometimes inferred from actions.",
        "e.g., \"the lion hunted deer\" implies that the lion has a plan to obtain food.",
        "Similarly, \"the serpent spat poison at John\" implies that the serpent wants to kill John.",
        "• Plan/Goal completion: Plans and goals produce +/- affect states when they succeed or fail.",
        "For example, if the eagle successfully extracts the bone from the wolf's throat, then both the wolf and the eagle will have positive affect states because both were successful in their respective goals.",
        "We observed that situational and plan/goal states often originate from an action.",
        "When a character is acted upon (the patient of a verb), then the character may be in a positive or negative state depending upon whether the action was good or bad for them based on world knowledge.",

        "In recent years, many publicly available resources have been created for sentiment analysis and other types of semantic knowledge.",
        "We considered a wide variety of resources and ultimately decided to experiment with five resources that most closely matched our needs:",
        "• FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998): We manually identified 87 frame classes that seem to be associated with affect: 43 mental classes (e.g., communication and needing), 22 positive classes (e.g., accomplishment and supporting), and 22 negative classes (e.g., cause harm and prohibit-",
        "ING).",
        "We use the verbs listed for these classes to produce M, +, and - affect states.",
        "• MPQA Lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005b): We used the words listed as having positive or negative sentiment polarity to produce +/- states, when they occur with the designated part-of-speech.",
        "• OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2005a) (Version 1.4) : We used the +/- labels assigned by its contextual polarity classifier (Wilson et al., 2005b) to create +/- states and the MPQASD tags produced by its Direct Subjective and Speech Event Identifier (Choi et al., 2006) to produce mental (M) states.",
        "• Semantic Orientation Lexicon (Takamura et al., 2005): We used the words listed as having positive or negative polarity to produce +/- affect states, when they occur with the designated part-of-speech.",
        "• Speech Act Verbs: We used 228 speech act verbs from (Wierzbicka, 1987) to produce M states.",
        "For the purposes of this work, we made two simplifying assumptions: (1) There are only two characters per fable, and (2) Both characters are mentioned in the fable's title.",
        "The problem of corefer-ence resolution for fables is somewhat different than for other genres, primarily because the characters are often animals (e.g., he=owl).",
        "So we hand-crafted a simple rule-based coreference system.",
        "First, we apply heuristics to determine number and gender based on word lists, WordNet (Miller, 1990) and part-of-speech tags.",
        "If no determination of a character's gender or number can be made, we employ a process of elimination.",
        "Given the two character assumption, if one character is known to be male, but there are female pronouns in the fable, then the other character is assumed to be female.",
        "The same is done for number agreement.",
        "Finally, if there is only one character between a pronoun and the beginning of a document, then we resolve the pronoun with that character and the character assumes the gender and number of the pronoun.",
        "Lastly, WordNet provides some additional resolutions by exploiting hypernym relations, for instance, linking peasant with man.",
        "Plot unit representations are not just a set of affect states, but they are structures that capture the chronological ordering of states for each character as the narrative progresses.",
        "Consequently, every affect state needs to be attributed to a character.",
        "Since most plots revolve around events, we use verb argument structure as the primary means for projecting affect states onto characters.",
        "We developed four affect projection rules that orchestrate how affect states are assigned to the characters.",
        "We used the Sundance parser (Riloff and Phillips, 2004) to produce a shallow parse of each sentence, which includes syntactic chunking, clause segmentation, and active/passive voice recognition.",
        "We normalized the verb phrases with respect to active/passive voice to simplify the rules.",
        "We made the assumption that the Subject of the VP is its AGENT and the Direct Object of the VP is its PATIENT.The rules only project affect states onto AGENTS and PATIENTS that refer to a character in the story.",
        "The four projection rules are presented below.",
        "Recognizing plans and goals depends on world knowledge and inference, and is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "However, we identified two cases where affect states often can be inferred based on syntactic properties.",
        "The first case involves verb phrases (VPs) that have both an AGENT and PATIENT, which corresponds to projection rule #3.",
        "If the VP has polarity, then rule #3 assigns that polarity to the PATIENT, not the AGENT.",
        "For example, \"John killed Paul\" imparts negative polarity on Paul, but not necessarily on John.",
        "Unless we are told otherwise, one assumes that John intentionally killed Paul, and so in a sense, John accomplished his goal.",
        "Consequently, this action should produce a positive affect state for John.",
        "We capture this notion of accomplishment as a side effect of projection rule #3: if the VP has +/- polarity, then we produce an inferred positive state for the AGENT.",
        "The second case involves infinitive verb phrases of the form: \"AGENT VERB1 TO VERB2 PATIENT\" (e.g., \"Susan tried to warn Mary\").",
        "The infinitive VP construction suggests that the AGENT has a goal or plan that is being put into motion (e.g., tried to, wanted to, attempted to, hoped to, etc.).",
        "To capture this intuition, in rule #4 if VERB1 does not already have an affect state assigned to it then we produce an inferred mental state for the AGENT.",
        "Our research is focused primarily on creating affect states for characters, but plot unit structures also include cross-character links to connect states that are shared across characters and causal links between states for a single character.",
        "As an initial attempt to create complete plot units, AESOP produces links using simple heuristics.",
        "A cross-character link is created when two characters in a clause have affect states that originated from the same word.",
        "A causal link is created between each pair of (chronologically) consecutive affect states for the same character.",
        "Currently, AESOP only produces forward causal links (motivation (m), actualization (a)) and does not produce backward causal links (equivalence (e), termination (t)).",
        "For forward links, the causal syntax only allows for five cases: M A M, + A M, – A M, M A +, M A – .",
        "So when AESOP produces a causal link between two affect states, the order and types ofthe two states uniquely determine which label it gets (m or a)."

        "We exploit this idea inside a bootstrapping algorithm to iteratively learn verbs that co-occur in conjunctions.",

        "We developed annotation guidelines that instructed each annotator to judge whether a verb is generally good or bad for its patient, assuming the patient is animate.",
        "They assigned each verb to one of 6 categories: x (not a verb), 2 (always good), 1 (usually good), 0 (neutral, mixed, or requires inanimate patient), 1 (usually bad), 2 (always bad).",
        "Each annotator labeled 250 words: 50 words randomly sampled from each of our 4 PPV lexicons (Evil Agent PPVs, Kind Agent PPVs, Positive Basilisk PPVs, and Negative Basilisk PPVs) plus 50 verbs labeled as neutral in the MPQA lexicon.",
        "First, we measured agreement based on three groupings: negative (-2 and -1), neutral (0), or positive (1 and 2).",
        "We computed k scores to measure inter-annotator agreement for each pair of annotators., but the k scores were relatively low because the annotators had trouble distinguishing the positive cases from the neutral ones.",
        "So we recomputed agreement using two groupings: negative (-2 and -1) and not-negative (0 through 2), and obtained k scores of .69, .71, and .74.",
        "We concluded that people largely agree on whether a verb is bad for the patient, but they do not necessarily agree if a verb is good for the patient.",
        "One possible explanation is that many \"bad\" verbs represent physical harm or danger: these verbs are both plentiful and easy to recognize.",
        "In contrast, \"good\" verbs are often more abstract and open to interpretation (e.g., is being \"envied\" or \"feared\" a good thing?",

        "The third column of Table 3 shows the results when using systemgenerated affect states.",
        "We see that performance is much lower.",
        "This is not particularly surprising, since AESOP's F-score is 45%, so over half of the individual states are wrong, which means that less than a quarter of the pairs are correct.",

        "Our research is the first effort to fully automate the creation of plot unit structures.",
        "Other preliminary work has begun to look at plot unit modelling for single character stories (Appling and Riedl, 2009).",
        "More generally, our work is related to research in narrative story understanding (e.g., (El-son and McKeown, 2009)), automatic affect state analysis (Alm, 2009), and automated learning of scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977) and other conceptual knowledge structures (e.g., (Mooney and DeJong, 1985; Fujiki et al., 2003; Chambers and Ju-rafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Kasch and Oates, 2010)).",
        "Our work benefitted from prior research in creating semantic resources such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and sentiment lexicons and classifiers (e.g., (Takamura et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2005b; Choi et al., 2006)).",
        "We showed that affect projection rules can effectively assign affect states to characters.",
        "This task is similar to, but not the same as, associating opinion words with their targets or topics (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008).",
        "Some aspects of affect state identification are closely related to Hopper and Thompson's (1980) theory of transitivity.",
        "In particular, their notions of aspect (has an action completed?",
        "), benefit and harm (how much does an object gain/lose from an action?)",
        "and volition (did the subject make a conscious choice to act?",
        ").",
        "AESOP produces affect states with an F score of 45%.",
        "Identifying positive states appears to be more difficult than negative or mental states.",
        "Our system's biggest shortcoming currently seems to hinge around identifying plans and goals.",
        "This includes the M affect states that initiate plans, the +/- completion states, as well as their corresponding links.",
        "We suspect that the relatively low recall on positive affect states is due to our inability to accurately identify successful plan completions.",
        "Finally, these results are based on fables; plot unit analysis of other types of texts will pose additional challenges."
