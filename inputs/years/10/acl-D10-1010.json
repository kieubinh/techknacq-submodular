        "Open domain Question Answering (QA) is one of the most complex and challenging tasks in natural language processing.",
        "In general, a question answering system may need to integrate knowledge coming from a wide variety of linguistic processing tasks such as syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling, named entity recognition, and anaphora resolution (Prager, 2006).",
        "State of the art implementations of these linguistic analysis tasks are still limited in their performance, with errors that compound and propagate into the final performance of the QA system (Moldovan et al., 2002).",
        "Consequently, the performance of open domain QA systems has yet to arrive at a level at which it would become a feasible alternative to the current paradigms for information access based on keyword searches.",
        "Recently, community-driven QA sites such as Yahoo!",
        "Answers and WikiAnswers have established a new approach to question answering that shifts the inherent complexity of open domain QA from the computer system to volunteer contributors.",
        "The computer is no longer required to perform a deep linguistic analysis of questions and generate corresponding answers, and instead acts as a mediator between users submitting questions and volunteers providing the answers.",
        "An important objective in community QA is to minimize the time elapsed between the submission of questions by users and the subsequent posting of answers by volunteer contributors.",
        "One useful strategy for minimizing the response latency is to search the QA repository for similar questions that have already been answered, and provide the corresponding ranked list of answers, if such a question is found.",
        "The success of this approach depends on the definition and implementation of the question-to-question similarity function.",
        "In the simplest solution, the system searches for previously answered questions based on exact string matching with the reference question.",
        "Alternatively, sites such as WikiAnswers allow the users to mark questions they think are rephrasings (\"alternate wordings\", or paraphrases) of existing questions.",
        "These question clusters are then taken into account when performing exact string matching, therefore increasing the likelihood of finding previously answered questions that are semantically equivalent to the reference question.",
        "In order to lessen the amount of work required from the contributors, an alternative approach is to build a system that automatically finds rephrasings of questions, especially since question rephrasing seems to be computationally less demanding than question answering.",
        "According to previous work in this domain, a question is considered a rephrasing of a reference question Q0 if it uses an alternate wording to express an identical information need.",
        "For example, Qo and Qi below are rephrasings of each other, and consequently they are expected to have the same answer.",
        "Q0 What should I feed my turtle?",
        "Q1 What do I feed my pet turtle?",
        "Paraphrasings of a new question cannot always be found in the community QA repository.",
        "We believe that computing a ranked list of existing questions that at least partially address the original information need could also be useful to the user, at least until other users volunteer to give an exact answer to the original, unanswered reference question.",
        "For example, in the absence of any additional information about the reference question Q0, the expected answers to questions Q2 and Q3 below may be seen as partially overlapping in information content with the expected answer for the reference question Q0.",
        "An answer to question Q4, on the other hand, is less likely to benefit the user, even though it has a significant lexical overlap with the reference question.",
        "Q2 What kind of fish should I feed my turtle?",
        "Q3 What do you feed a turtle that is the size of a quarter?",
        "Q4 What kind of food should I feed a turtle dove?",
        "In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach to the question ranking problem, a generalization of the question paraphrasing problem in which questions are ranked in a partial order based on the relative information overlap between their expected answers and the expected answer of the reference question.",
        "Underlying the question ranking task is the expectation that the user who submits a reference question will find the answers of the highly ranked questions to be more useful than the answers associated with the lower ranked questions.",
        "For the reference question Q0 above, the learned ranking model is expected to produce a partial order in which Q1 is ranked higher than Q2, Q3 and Q4, whereas Q2 and Q3 are ranked higher than Q4."

        "Therefore, the information content of the answer to Q8 is strictly subsumed in the information content associated with the answer to Q5.",
        "Similarly, in Qg the focus noun phrase is further specialized through the prepositional phrase \"for girls\".",

        "The random baseline - assigning a random similarity value to each pair of questions results in 50% accuracy.",
        "Even though its use of word senses was expected to lead to superior results, mcs does not perform better than cos on this dataset.",
        "Our implementation of mcs did however perform better than cos on the Microsoft paraphrase corpus (Dolan et al., 2004).",
        "One possible reason for this behavior is that mcs seems to be less resilient than cos to differences in question length.",
        "Whereas the Microsoft paraphrase corpus was specifically designed such that \"the length of the shorter of the two sentences, in words, is at least 66% that of the longer\" (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), the question ranking datasets place no constraints on the lengths of the questions.",
        "However, even though by themselves the meaning aware mcs and the structure-and-meaning aware 0t do not outperform the bag-of-words cos, they do help in increasing the performance of the SVM ranking model, as can be inferred from the corresponding columns in Table 5.",

        "Q34 Where can I find a job around Vista, CA?",
        "If we take Q32 as reference question, the fact that the distance between Los Angeles and Anaheim is smaller than the distance between Vista and Anaheim leads the ranking system to rank Q33 as more useful than Q34 with respect to Q32, which is the expected result.",
        "The preposition \"around\" from the city context in the first pattern is a good indicator that proximity relations are relevant in this case.",
