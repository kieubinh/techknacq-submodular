        "Searching for clinically relevant information within this large amount of data is a difficult task that medical professionals are often unable to complete in a timely manner.",
        "A better access to clinical evidence represents a high impact application for physicians.",
        "Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) is a widely accepted paradigm for medical practice (Sackett et al., 1996).",
        "EBM is defined as the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about patient care.",
        "Practice EBM means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.",
        "It involves tracking down the best evidence from randomized trials or meta-analyses with which to answer clinical questions.",
        "Richardson et al.",
        "(1995) identified the following four aspects as the key elements of a well-built clinical question:",
        "• Patient-problem: what are the patient characteristics (e.g. age range, gender, etc.)?",
        "What is the primary condition or disease?",
        "• Exposure-intervention: what is the main intervention (e.g. drug, treatment, duration, etc.",
        ")?",
        "• Comparison: what is the exposure compared to (e.g. placebo, another drug, etc.",
        ")?",
        "• Outcome: what are the clinical outcomes (e.g. healing, morbidity, side effects, etc.",
        ")?",
        "These elements are known as the PECO elements.",
        "Physicians are educated to formulate their clinical questions in respect to this structure.",
        "For example, in the following question: \"In patients of all ages with Parkinson's disease, does a Treadmill training compared to no training allows to increase the walking distance?\"",
        "one can identify the following elements:",
        "• P: Patients of all ages with Parkinson's disease",
        "• E: Treadmill training",
        "• C: No treadmill training",
        "• O: Walking distance",
        "In spite of this well-defined question structure, physicians still use keyword-based queries when they search for clinical evidence.",
        "An explanation of that is the almost total absence of PECO search interfaces.",
        "PubMed, the most used search interface, does not allow users to formulate PECO queries yet.",
        "For the previously mentioned clinical question, a physician would use the query \"Treadmill AND Parkinson's disease\".",
        "There is intuitively much to gain by using a PECO structured query in the retrieval process.",
        "This structure specifies the role of each concept in the desired documents, which is a clear advantage over a keyword-based approach.",
        "One can for example differentiate two queries in which a disease would be a patient condition or a clinical outcome.",
        "This conceptual decomposition of queries is also particularly useful in a sense that it can be used to balance the importance of each element in the search process.",
        "Another important factor that prevented researchers from testing approaches to clinical information retrieval (IR) based on PECO elements is the lack of a test collection, which contains a set of documents, a set of queries and the relevance judgments.",
        "The construction of such a test collection is costly in manpower.",
        "In this paper, we take advantage of the systematic reviews about clinical questions from Cochrane.",
        "Each Cochrane review examines in depth a clinical question and survey all the available relevant publications.",
        "The reviews are written for medical professionals.",
        "We transformed them into a TREC-like test collection, which contains 423 queries and 8926 relevant documents extracted from MEDLINE.",
        "In a second part of this paper, we present a model integrating the PECO framework in a language modeling approach to IR.",
        "An intuitive method would try to annotate the concepts in documents into PECO categories.",
        "One can then match the PECO elements in the query to the elements detected in documents.",
        "However, as previous studies have shown, it is very difficult to automatically annotate accurately PECO elements in documents.",
        "To bypass this issue, we propose an alternative that relies on the observed positional distribution of these elements in documents.",
        "We will see that different types of element have different distributions.",
        "By weighting words according to their positions, we can indirectly weigh the importance of different types of element in search.",
        "As we will show in this paper, this approach turns out to be highly effective.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first briefly review the previous work, followed by a description of the test collection we have constructed.",

        "Nevertheless, the task of automatically identifying PECO elements is a very difficult one.",
        "There are two major reasons for that.",
        "First, previous studies have indicated that there is a low to moderate agreement rate among humans for annotating PECO elements.",
        "This is due to the lack of standard definition for the element' boundaries (e.g. can be words, phrases or sentences) but also to the existence of several levels of annotation.",
        "Indeed, there are a high number of possible candidates for each element and one has to choose if it is a main element (i.e. playing a major role in the clinical study) or secondary elements.",
        "Second is the lack of sufficient annotated data that can be used to train automatic tagging tools.",
        "Despite all these difficulties, several efficient detection methods have been proposed (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007; Chung, 2009).",
        "Nearly all of them are however restricted to a coarse-grain annotation level (i.e. tagging entire sentences as describing one element).",
        "This kind of coarser-grain identification is more robust and more feasible than the one at concept level, and it could be sufficient in the context of IR.",
        "In fact, for IR purposes, what is the most important is to correctly weight the words in documents and queries.",
        "From this perspective, an annotation at the sentence level may be sufficient.",
        "Notwithstanding, experiments conducted using a collection of documents that were annotated at a sentence-level only showed a small increase in retrieval accuracy (Boudin et al., 2010b) compared to a traditional bag-of-words approach.",
        "More recently, Boudin et al.",
        "(2010a) proposed an alternative to the PECO detection issue that relies on assigning different weights to words according to their positions in the document.",
        "A location-based weighting strategy is used to emphasize the most informative parts of documents.",
        "They show that a large improvement in retrieval effectiveness can be obtained this way and indicate that the weights learned automatically are correlated to the observed distribution of PECO elements in documents.",
        "In this work, we propose to go one step further in this direction by analyzing the distribution of PECO elements in a large number of documents and define the positional probabilities of PECO elements accordingly.",

        "This paper first presented the construction of a test collection for evaluating clinical information retrieval.",
        "From a set of systematic reviews, a group of annotators were asked to generate structured clinical queries and collect relevance judgments.",
        "The resulting test collection is composed of 423 queries and 8926 relevant documents.",
        "This test collection provides a basis for researchers to experiment with PECO-structured queries in clinical IR.",
        "The test collection introduced in this paper, along with the manual given to the group of annotators, will be available for download.",
        "In a second step, this paper addressed the problem of using the PECO framework in clinical IR.",
        "A straightforward idea is to identify PECO elements in documents and use the elements in the retrieval process.",

        "(|: t.test < 0.01, *: t.test < 0.05) cause of the difficulty to automatically detect these elements.",
        "Instead, we proposed a less demanding approach that uses the distribution of PECO elements in documents to re-weight terms in the document model.",
        "The observation of variable distributions in our test collection led us to believe that the position information can be used as a robust indicator of the presence of a PECO element.",
        "This strategy turns out to be promising.",
        "On a data set composed of 1.5 million citations extracted with PubMed, our best model obtains an increase of 28% for MAP and nearly 50% for P@5 over the classical language modeling approach.",
        "In future work, we intend to expand our analysis of the distribution of PECO elements to a larger number of citations.",
        "One way to do that would be to automatically extract PubMed citations that contain structural markers associated to PECO categories (Chung, 2009).",
