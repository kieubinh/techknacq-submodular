        "Over recent years increasingly huge amounts of text have been made available on the Web.",
        "Popular search engines such as Yahoo!",
        "and Google usually do a good job at retrieving a small number of relevant results from such an enormous collection of Web pages (i.e. retrieving with high precision, low recall).",
        "However, current search engines are still facing the lexical ambiguity issue (Furnas et al., 1987) - i.e. the linguistic property owing to which any particular word may convey different meanings.",
        "In a recent study (Sanderson, 2008) - conducted using WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Wikipedia as sources of ambiguous words - it was reported that around 3% of Web queries and 23% of the most frequent queries are ambiguous.",
        "Examples include: \"buy B-52\" (a cocktail?",
        "a bomber?",
        "a DJ workstation?",
        "tickets for a band?",
        "), \"Alexander Smith quotes\" (the novelist?",
        "the poet?",
        "), \"beagle search\" (dogs?",
        "the Linux search tool?",
        "the landing spacecraft?",
        ").",
        "Ambiguity is often the consequence of the low number of query words entered on average by Web users (Kamvar and Baluja, 2006).",
        "While average query length is increasing - it is now estimated at around 3 words per query - many search engines such as Google have already started to tackle the query ambiguity issue by reranking and diversifying their results, so as to prevent Web pages that are similar to each other from ranking too high on the list.",
        "In the past few years, Web clustering engines (Carpineto et al., 2009) have been proposed as a solution to the lexical ambiguity issue in Web Information Retrieval.",
        "These systems group search results, by providing a cluster for each specific aspect (i.e., meaning) of the input query.",
        "Users can then select the cluster(s) and the pages therein that best answer their information needs.",
        "However, many Web clustering engines group search results on the basis of their lexical similarity.",
        "For instance, consider the following snippets returned for the beagle search query:",
        "1.",
        "Beagle is a search tool that ransacks your...",

        "Beagle indexes your files and searches...",
        "While snippets 1 and 3 both concern the Linux search tool, they do not have any content word in common except our query words.",
        "As a result, they will most likely be assigned to two different clusters.",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach to Web search result clustering which is based on the automatic discovery of word senses from raw text - a task referred to as Word Sense Induction (WSI).",

        "Web directories.",
        "A first, historical solution to query ambiguity is that of Web directories, that is taxonomies providing categories to which Web pages are manually assigned (e.g., the Open Directory Project - http://dmoz.org).",
        "Given a query, search results are organized by category.",
        "This approach has three main weaknesses: first, it is static, thus it needs manual updates to cover new pages; second, it covers only a small portion of the Web; third, it classifies Web pages based on coarse categories.",
        "This latter feature of Web directories makes it difficult to distinguish between instances of the same kind (e.g., pages about artists with the same surname classified as Arts:Music:Bands and Artists).",
        "While methods for the automatic classification of Web documents have been proposed (e.g., (Liu et al., 2005b; Xue et al., 2008)) and some problems have been effectively tackled (Bennett and Nguyen, 2009), these approaches are usually supervised and still suffer from relying on a predefined taxonomy of categories.",
        "Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR).",
        "A different direction consists of associating explicit semantics (i.e., word senses or concepts) with queries and documents, that is, performing Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD, see Navigli (2009)).",
        "SIR is performed by indexing and/or searching concepts rather than terms, thus potentially coping with two linguistic phenomena: expressing a single meaning with different words (synonymy) and using the same word to express various different meanings (polysemy).",
        "Over the years, different methods for SIR have been proposed (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Voorhees, 1993; Mandala et al., 1998; Gonzalo et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2005a, inter alia).",
        "However, contrasting results have been reported on the benefits of these techniques: it has been shown that WSD has to be very accurate to benefit Information Retrieval (Sanderson, 1994) - a result that was later debated (Gonzalo et al., 1999; Stokoe et al., 2003).",
        "Also, it has been reported that WSD has to be very precise on minority senses and uncommon terms, rather than on frequent words (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Sanderson, 2000).",
        "SIR relies on the existence of a reference dictionary to perform WSD (typically, WordNet) and thus suffers from its static nature and its inherent paucity of most proper nouns.",
        "This latter problem is particularly important for Web searches, as users tend to retrieve more information about named entities (e.g., singers, artists, cities) than concepts (e.g., abstract information about singers or artists).",
        "Search Result Clustering.",
        "A more popular approach to query ambiguity is that of search result clustering.",
        "Typically, given a query, the system starts from a flat list of text snippets returned from one or more commonly-available search engines and clusters them on the basis of some notion of textual similarity.",
        "At the root of the clustering approach lies van Rijsbergen's (1979) cluster hypothesis: \"closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same requests\", whereas documents concerning different meanings of the input query are expected to belong to different clusters.",
        "Approaches to search result clustering can be classified as data-centric or description-centric (Carpineto et al., 2009).",
        "The former focus more on the problem of data clustering than on presenting the results to the user.",
        "A pioneering example is Scatter/Gather (Cutting et al., 1992), which divides the dataset into a small number of clusters and, after the selection of a group, performs clustering again and proceeds iteratively.",
        "Developments of this approach have been proposed which improve on cluster quality and retrieval performance (Ke et al., 2009).",
        "Other data-centric approaches use agglomerative hierarchical clustering (e.g., LASSI (Yoelle Maarek and",
        "or exploit link information (Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "Description-centric approaches are, instead, more focused on the description to produce for each cluster of search results.",
        "Among the most popular and successful approaches are those based on suffix trees (Zamir et al., 1997; Zamir and Etzioni, 1998), including later developments (Crabtree et al., 2005; Bernardini et al., 2009).",
        "Other methods in the literature are based on formal concept analysis (Carpineto and Romano, 2004), singular value decomposition (Osinski and Weiss, 2005), spectral clustering (Cheng et al., 2005), spectral geometry and graph connectivity measures (Di Giacomo et al., 2007).",
        "Search result clustering has also been viewed as a supervised salient phrase ranking task (Zeng et al., 2004).",
        "Diversification.",
        "Another recent research topic dealing with the query ambiguity issue is diversification, which aims to rerank top search results based on criteria that maximize their diversity.",
        "One of the first examples of diversification algorithms is based on the use of similarity functions to measure the diversity among documents and between document and query (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998).",
        "Other techniques use conditional probabilities to determine which document is most different from higher-ranking ones (Chen and Karger, 2006) or use affinity ranking (Zhang et al., 2005), based on topic variance and coverage.",
        "More recently, an algorithm called Essential Pages (Swaminathan et al., 2009) has been proposed to reduce information redundancy and return Web pages that maximize coverage with respect to the input query.",
        "Word Sense Induction (WSI).",
        "In contrast to the above approaches, we perform WSI to dynamically acquire an inventory of senses of the input query.",
        "Instead of performing clustering on the basis of the surface similarity of Web snippets, we use our induced word senses to group snippets.",
        "Very little work on this topic exists: vector-based WSI was successfully shown to improve bag-of-words ad-hoc Information Retrieval (Schütze and Pedersen, 1995) and preliminary studies (Udani et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008) have provided interesting insights into the use of WSI for Web search result clustering.",
        "A more recent attempt at automatically identifying query meanings is based on the use of hidden topics (Nguyen et al., 2009).",
        "However, in this approach topics - estimated from a universal dataset are query-independent and thus their number needs to be established beforehand.",
        "In contrast, we aim to cluster snippets based on a dynamic and finer-grained notion of sense."

        "(2009)) for visualization purposes.",
        "Our key idea is to improve step 2 by means of a Word Sense Induction algorithm: given a query q, we first dynamically induce, from a text corpus, the set of word senses of q (Section 3.1); next, we cluster the Web results on the basis of the word senses previously induced (Section 3.2).",
        "Word Sense Induction algorithms are unsupervised techniques aimed at automatically identifying the set of senses denoted by a word.",
        "These methods induce word senses from text by clustering word occurrences based on the idea that a given word used in a specific sense - tends to co-occur with the same neighbouring words (Harris, 1954).",
        "Several approaches to WSI have been proposed in the literature (see Navigli (2009) for a survey), ranging from clustering based on context vectors (e.g., Schütze (1998)) to word clustering (e.g., Lin (1998)) and co-occurrence graphs (e.g., Widdows and Dorow (2002)).",
        "Successful approaches such as HyperLex (Veronis, 2004) - a graph algorithm based on the identification of hubs in co-occurrence graphs have to cope with a high number of parameters to be tuned (Agirre et al., 2006).",
        "To deal with this issue we propose two variants of a simple, yet effective, graph-based algorithm for WSI, that we describe hereafter.",
        "The algorithm consists of two steps: graph construction and identification of word senses.",
        "Given a target query q, we build a co-occurrence graph Gq = (V, E) such that V is a set of context words related to q and E is the set of undirected edges, each denoting a co-occurrence between pairs of words in V. To determine the set of co-occurring words V, we use the Google Web1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006), a large collection of n-grams (n = I,..., 5) - i.e., windows of n consecutive tokens occurring in one terabyte of Web documents.",
        "First, for each content word w we collect the total number c(w) of its occurrences and the number of times c(w, w) that w and w' occur together in any 5-gram (we include inflected forms in the count); second, we use the Dice coefficient to determine the strength of co-occurrence between w and w':",
        "DlCe(w,w ) = – – r-~.-jr-.",
        "The rationale behind Dice is that dividing by the sum of total counts of the two words drastically decreases the ranking of words that tend to co-occur frequently with many other words (e.g., new, old, nice, etc.",
        ").",
        "The graph Gq = (V, E) is built as follows:",
        "• Our initial vertex set V(0) contains all the content words from the snippet results of query q (excluding stopwords); then, we add to V(0) the highest-ranking words co-occurring with q in the Web1T corpus, i.e., those words w for which Dice(q, w) > ö (the threshold ö is established experimentally, see Section 4.1).",
        "We set V := V(0)and E := 0.",
        "• For each word w G V(0), we select the highest ranking words co-occurring with w in Web1T, that is those words w' for which Dice(w, w') > ö.",
        "We add each of these words to V (note that some w' might already be in V(0)) and the corresponding edge {w,w'} to E with weight Dice(w,w').",
        "Finally, we remove disconnected vertices.",
        "The main idea behind our approach is that edges in the co-occurrence graph participating in cycles are likely to connect vertices (i.e., words) belonging to the same meaning component.",
        "Specifically, we focus on cycles of length 3 and 4, called respectively triangles and squares in graph theory.",
        "For each edge e, we calculate the ratio of triangles in which e participates:",
        "# triangles e could participate in where the numerator is the number of cycles of length 3 in which e = { w, w'} participates, and the denominator is the total number of neighbours of w and w'.",
        "Similarly, we define a measure Sqr(e) of the ratio of squares (i.e., cycles of length 4) an edge e participates in to the number of possible squares e could potentially participate in:",
        "# squares e participates in # squares e could participate in where the numerator is the number of squares containing e and the denominator is the number of possible distinct pairs of neighbours of w and w'.",
        "If no triangle (or square) exists for e, the value of the corresponding function is set to 0.",
        "In order to disconnect the graph and determine the meaning components, we remove all the edges whose Tri (or Sqr) value is below a threshold a.",
        "The resulting connected components represent the word senses induced for the query q.",
        "Notice that the number of senses is dynamically chosen based on the cooccurrence graph and the algorithm's thresholds.",
        "Our triangular measure is the edge counterpart of the clustering coefficient (or curvature) for vertices, previously used to perform WSI (Widdows and Dorow, 2002).",
        "However, it is our hunch that measuring the ratio of squares an edge participates in provides a stronger clue of how important that edge is within a meaning component.",
        "In Section 4, we will corroborate this idea with our experiments.",

        "We calculate the Sqr values of each edge in the graph.",

        "For instance, Sqr({ dog, breed }) = ^, as the edge participates in the square dog - breed - puppy - canine - dog, but it could also have participated in the potential square dog - breed - puppy - search - dog.",
        "In fact, the other neighbours of dog are canine, puppy and search, and the other neighbour of breed is puppy, thus the square can only be closed by connecting puppy to either canine or search.",
        "In our example, the only edges whose Sqr is below a are: { dog, puppy } , { dog, search } and { linux, mission } (they participate in no square).",
        "We remove these edges and select the resulting connected components as the senses of the query beagle (shown in Figure 1(b)).",

For the gold standard G we use the clustering induced by the sense annotations provided in our datasets for each snippet (i.e., each cluster contains the snippets manually associated with a particular Wikipedia subtopic).",
        "Similarly to what was done in Section 3.2, untagged results are grouped together in a special cluster of G.",
        "Results.",
        "The results of all systems on the AMBIENT and MORESQUE datasets according to the average Rand index are shown in Table 2.",
        "In accordance with previous results in the literature, KeySRC performed generally better than the other search result clustering systems, especially on smaller queries.",
        "Our Word Sense Induction systems, Squares and Triangles, outperformed all other systems by a large margin, thus showing a higher clustering quality (with the exception of KeySRC performing better than Triangles on AMBIENT).",
        "Interestingly, all clustering systems perform more poorly on longer queries (i.e., on the MORESQUE dataset), however our WSI systems, and especially Triangles, are more robust across query lengths.",

        "Search result clustering can also be used to diversify the top results returned by a search engine.",
        "Thus, for each query q, one natural way of measuring a system's performance is to calculate the subtopic recall-at-K (Zhai et al., 2003) given by the number of different subtopics retrieved for q in the top K results returned:",
        "I UK==1 subtopics(n)I where subtopics(ri) is the set of subtopics manually assigned to the search result ri and M is the number of subtopics for query q (note that in our experiments M is the number of subtopics occurring in the 100 results retrieved for q, so S-recall@100 = 1).",
        "However, this measure is only suitable for systems returning ranked lists (such as Yahoo!",
        "and EP).",
        "Given a clustering C = (C0, Ci,..., Cm), we flatten it to a list as follows: we add to the initially empty list the first element of each cluster Cj (j = 1,..., m); then we iterate the process by selecting the second element of each cluster Cj such that |Cj | > 2, and so on.",
        "The remaining elements returned by the search engine, but not included in any cluster of C \\ {C0}, are appended to the bottom of the list in their original order.",

        "In this paper we have presented a novel approach to Web search result clustering.",
        "Our key idea is to induce senses for the target query automatically by means of a graph-based algorithm focused on the notion of cycles.",
        "The results of a Web search engine are then mapped to the query senses and clustered accordingly.",
        "The paper provides three novel contributions.",
        "First, we show that WSI boosts the quality of search result clustering and improves the diversification of the snippets returned as a flat list.",
        "We provide a clear indication on the usefulness of a loose notion of sense to cope with ambiguous queries.",
        "This is in contrast to research on Semantic Information Retrieval, which has obtained contradictory and often inconclusive results.",
        "The main advantage of WSI lies in its dynamic production of word senses that cover both concepts (e.g., beagle as a breed of dog) and instances (e.g., beagle as a specific instance of a space lander).",
        "In contrast, static dictionaries such as WordNet - typically used in Word Sense Disambiguation - by their very nature encode mainly concepts.",
        "Second, we propose two simple, yet effective, graph algorithms to induce the senses of our queries.",
        "The best performing approach is based on squares (cycles of length 4), a novel graph pattern in WSI.",
        "Third, we contribute a new dataset of 114 ambiguous queries and 11,400 sense-annotated snippets which complements an existing dataset of ambiguous queries.",
        "Given the lack of ambiguous query datasets available (Sanderson, 2008), we hope our new dataset will be useful in future comparative experiments.",
        "Finally, we note that our approach needed very little tuning.",
        "Moreover, its requirement of a Web corpus of n-grams is not a stringent one, as such corpora are available for several languages and can be produced for any language of interest.",
        "As regards future work, we intend to combine our clustering algorithm with a cluster labeling algorithm.",
        "We also aim to implement a number of Word Sense Induction algorithms and compare them in the same evaluation framework with more Web search and Web clustering engines.",
        "Finally, it should be possible to use precisely the same approach presented in this paper for document clustering, by grouping the contexts in which the target query occurs - and we will also experiment on this in the future."
