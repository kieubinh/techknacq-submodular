        "In recent years, syntax-based translation models (Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006) have shown promising progress in improving translation quality, thanks to the incorporation of phrasal translation adopted from the widely used phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) to handle local fluency and the engagement of synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) to handle non-local phrase reordering.",
        "Approaches to syntax-based translation models can be largely categorized into two classes based on their dependency on annotated corpus (Chiang, 2007).",
        "Linguistically syntax-based models (e.g., (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006)) utilize structures defined over linguistic theory and annotations (e.g., Penn Treebank) and guide the derivation of SCFG rules with explicit parsing on at least one side of the parallel corpus.",
        "Formally syntax-based models (e.g., (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2007)) extract synchronous grammars from parallel corpora based on the hierarchical structure of natural language pairs without any explicit linguistic knowledge or annotations.",
        "In this work, we focus on the hierarchical phrase-based models of Chiang (2007), which is formally syntax-based, and always refer the term SCFG, from now on, to the grammars of this model class.",
        "On the one hand, hierarchical phrase-based models do not suffer from errors in syntactic constraints that are unavoidable in linguistically syntax-based models.",
        "Despite the complete lack of linguistic guidance, the performance of hierarchical phrase-based models is competitive when compared to linguistically syntax-based models.",
        "As shown in (Mi and Huang, 2008), hierarchical phrase-based models significantly outperform tree-to-string models (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), even when attempts are made to alleviate parsing errors using either forest-based decoding (Mi et al., 2008) or forest-based rule extraction (Mi and Huang, 2008).",
        "On the other hand, when properly used, syntactic constraints can provide invaluable benefits to improve translation quality.",
        "The tree-to-string models of Mi and Huang (2008) can actually significantly outperform hierarchical phrase-based models when using forest-based rule extraction together with forest-based decoding.",
        "Chiang (2010) also obtained significant improvement over his hierarchical baseline by using syntactic parse trees on both source and target sides to induce fuzzy (not exact) tree-to-tree rules and by also allowing syntactically mismatched substitutions.",
        "In this paper, we augment rules in hierarchical phrase-based translation systems with novel syntactic features.",
        "Unlike previous studies (e.g., (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006)) that directly use explicit treebank categories such as NP, NP/PP (NP missing PP from the right) to annotate phrase pairs, we induce a set of latent categories to capture the syntactic dependencies inherent in the hierarchical structure of phrase pairs, and derive a real-valued feature vector for each X nonterminal of a SCFG rule based on the distribution of the latent categories.",
        "Moreover, we convert the equality test of two sequences of syntactic categories, which are either identical or different, into the computation of a similarity score between their corresponding feature vectors.",
        "In our model, two symbolically different sequences of syntactic categories could have a high similarity score in the feature vector representation if they are syntactically similar, and a low score otherwise.",
        "In decoding, these feature vectors are utilized to measure the similarity between the syntactic analysis of the source side and the syntax of the SCFG rules that are applied to derive translations.",
        "Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies real-valued syntactic feature vectors to machine translation.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly reviews hierarchical phrase-based translation models.",
        "Section 3 presents an overview of our approach, followed by Section 4 describing the hierarchical structure of aligned phrase pairs and Section 5 describing how to induce latent syntactic categories.",

        "An SCFG is a synchronous rewriting system generating source and target side string pairs simultaneously based on a context-free grammar.",

        "In particular, the hierarchical model (Chiang, 2007) studied in this paper explores hierarchical structures of natural language and utilize only a unified nonterminal symbol X in the grammar, where ~ is the one-to-one correspondence between X's in 7 and a, and it can be indicated by un-derscripted co-indexes.",
        "Two example English-to-Chinese translation rules are represented as follows:",

        "Note that the boundary words of a phrase pair may not be aligned to any other word.",
        "We call the phrase pairs with all boundary words aligned tight phrase pairs (Zhang et al., 2008).",

        "In the second step, abstract rules are extracted from tight phrase pairs that contain other tight phrase pairs by replacing the sub phrase pairs with co-indexed X-nonterminals.",
        "Chiang (2007) also introduced several requirements (e.g., there are at most two nonterminals at the right hand side of a rule) to safeguard the quality of the abstract rules as well as keeping decoding efficient.",
        "In our example above, rule (2) can be extracted from rule (1) with the following sub phrase pair:",
        "The use of a unified X nonterminal makes hierarchical phrase-based models flexible at capturing non-local reordering of phrases.",
        "However, such flexibility also comes at the cost that it is not able to differentiate between different syntactic usages of phrases.",
        "Suppose rule X – (I am reading X1, • • • ) is extracted from a phrase pair with I am reading a book on the source side where X1 is abstracted from the noun phrase pair .",
        "If this rule is used to translate I am reading the brochure ofa book fair, it would be better to apply it over the entire string than over sub-strings such as I ... the brochure of.",
        "This is because the nonterminal X1 in the rule was abstracted from a noun phrase on the source side of the training data and would thus be better (more informative) to be applied to phrases of the same type.",
        "Hierarchical phrase-based models are not able to distinguish syntactic differences like this.",
        "Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) attempted to address this problem by annotating phrase pairs with treebank categories based on automatic parse trees.",
        "They introduced an extended set of categories (e.g., NP+V for she went and DT\\NP for great wall, an noun phrase with a missing determiner on the left) to annotate phrase pairs that do not align with syntactic constituents.",
        "Their hard syntactic constraint requires that the nonterminals should match exactly to rewrite with a rule, which could rule out potentially correct derivations due to errors in the syntactic parses as well as to data sparsity.",
        "For example, NP cannot be instantiated with phrase pairs of type DT+NN, in spite of their syntactic similarity.",
        "Venugopal et al.",
        "(2009) addressed this problem by directly introducing soft syntactic preferences into SCFG rules using preference grammars, but they had to face the computational challenges of large preference vectors.",
        "Chiang (2010) also avoided hard constraints and took a soft alternative that directly models the cost of mismatched rule substitutions.",

        "Figure 3 (b) shows the source-side parse tree of a sentence pair.",
        "The tag sequence for \"the pen\" is simply \"NP\" because it is a noun phrase, while phrase \"give the pen\" is dominated by a verb followed by a noun phrase, and thus its tag sequence is \"VBP NP\".",
        "Let TS = {ts1, • • • , tsm} be the set of all tag sequences extracted from a parallel corpus.",
        "The syntax of each X nonterminal in a SCFG rule can be then characterized by the distribution of tag sequences Px(TS) = (pxOi), • • • ,px(tsm)), based on the phrase pairs it is abstracted from.",
        "Table 1 shows an example distribution of tag sequences for Xi in X – (I am reading Xi, • • •}.",
        "Instead of directly using tag sequences, as we discussed their disadvantages above, we represent each of them by a real-valued feature vector.",
        "Suppose we have a collection of n latent syntactic categories C = {ci, ••• ,cn}.",
        "For each tag sequence ts, we compute its distribution of latent syntactic categories Pts(C ) = (pts(ci), ••• ,pts(cn)).",
        "For example, P«NP VP\"(C) = {0.5,0.2, 0.3} means that the latent syntactic categories ci, c2, and c3 are distributed as p(ci) = 0.5, p(c2) = 0.2, and p(c3) = 0.3 for tag sequence \"NP VP\".",
        "We further convert the distribution to a normalized feature vector F (ts) to represent tag sequence ts:",
        "The advantage of using real-valued feature vectors is that the degree of similarity between two tag sequences ts and ts' in the space of the latent syntactic categories C can be simply computed as a dot-product of their feature vectors:",
        "which computes a syntactic similarity score in the range of 0 (totally syntactically different) to 1 (completely syntactically identical).",
        "Similarly, we can represent the syntax of each X nonterminal in a rule with a feature vector F(X), computed as the sum of the feature vectors of tag sequences weighted by the distribution of tag sequences of the nonterminal X:",
        "Now we can impose soft syntactic constraints using these feature vectors when a SCFG rule is used to translate a parsed source sentence.",
        "Given that a X nonterminal in the rule is applied to a span with tag sequence ts as determined by a syntactic parser, we can compute the following syntax similarity feature:",
        "Except that it is computed on the fly, this feature can be used in the same way as the regular features in hierarchical translation systems to determine the best translation, and its feature weight can be tuned in the same way together with the other features on a held-out data set.",
        "In our approach, the set of latent syntactic categories is automatically induced from a source-side parsed, word-aligned parallel corpus based on the hierarchical structure among phrase pairs along with the syntactic parse of the source side.",
        "In what follows, we will explain the two critical aspects of our approach, i.e., how to identify the hierarchical structures among all phrase pairs in a sentence pair, and how to induce the latent syntactic categories from the hierarchy to syntactically explain the phrase pairs."

        "Both dev and test sets contain <~-4.3k sentences, each with two references.",
        "Both corpora are also preprocessed with punctuation removed and words down-cased to make them suitable for speech translation.",
        "The baseline system is our implementation of the hierarchical phrase-based model of Chiang (2007), and it includes basic features such as rule and lexicalized rule translation probabilities, language model scores, rule counts, etc.",
        "We use 4-gram language models in both tasks, and conduct minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003) to optimize feature weights on the dev set.",
        "Our baseline hierarchical model has 8.3M and 9.7M rules for the English-to-German and English-to-Chinese tasks, respectively.",
        "The English side of the parallel data is parsed by our implementation of the Berkeley parser (Huang and Harper, 2009) trained on the combination of Broadcast News treebank from Ontonotes (Weischedel et al., 2008) and a speechified version of the WSJ treebank (Marcus et al., 1999) to achieve higher parsing accuracy (Huang et al., 2010).",
        "Our approach introduces a new syntactic feature and its feature weight is tuned in the same way together with the features in the baseline model.",
        "in this study, we induce 16 latent categories for both X and B nonterminals.",
        "Our approach identifies ~180k unique tag sequences for the English side of phrase pairs in both tasks.",
        "As shown by the examples in Table 2, the syntactic feature vector representation is able to identify similar and dissimilar tag sequences.",
        "For instance, it determines that the sequence of \"DT JJ NN\" is syntactically very similar to \"DT ADJP NN\" while very dissimilar to \"NN CD VP\".",
        "Notice that our latent categories are learned automatically to maximize the likelihood of the training forests extracted based on alignment and are not explicitly instructed to discriminate between syntactically different tag sequences.",
        "Our approach is not guaranteed to always assign similar feature vectors to syntactically similar tag sequences.",

        "The hypothesis space of translating a longer sentence is much larger than that of a shorter sentence.",

        "The incorporation of the syntactic feature into the hierarchical phrase-based translation system also brings in additional memory load and computational cost.",
        "in the worst case, our approach requires storing one feature vector for each tag sequence and one feature vector for each nonterminal of a SCFG rule, with the latter taking the majority of the extra memory storage.",
        "We observed that about 90% of the X nonterminals in the rules only have one tag sequence, and thus the required memory space can be significantly reduced by only storing a pointer to the feature vector of the tag sequence for these nonterminals.",
        "Our approach also requires computing one dot-product of two feature vectors for each nonterminal when a SCFG rule is applied to a source span.",
        "This cost can be reduced, however, by caching the dot-products of the tag sequences that are frequently accessed.",
        "There are other successful investigations to impose soft syntactic constraints to hierarchical phrase-based models by either introducing syntax-based rule features such as the prior derivation model of Zhou et al.",
        "(2008) or by imposing constraints on translation spans at decoding time, e.g., (Marton and Resnik, 2008; Xiong et al., 2009; Xiong et al., 2010).",
        "These approaches are all orthogonal to ours and it is expected that they can be combined with our approach to achieve greater improvement.",
        "This work is an initial effort to investigate latent syntactic categories to enhance hierarchical phrase-based translation models, and there are many directions to continue this line of research.",
        "First, while the current approach imposes soft syntactic constraints between the parse structure of the source sentence and the SCFG rules used to derive the translation, the real-valued syntactic feature vectors can also be used to impose soft constraints between SCFG rules when rule rewrite occurs.",
        "In this case, target side parse trees could also be used alone or together with the source side parse trees to induce the latent syntactic categories.",
        "Second, instead of using single parse trees during both training and decoding, our approach is likely to benefit from exploring parse forests as in (Mi and Huang, 2008).",
        "Third, in addition to the treebank categories obtained by syntactic parsing, lexical cues directly available in sentence pairs could also to explored to guide the learning of latent categories.",
        "Last but not the least, it would be interesting to investigate discriminative training approaches to learn latent categories that directly optimize on translation quality."
