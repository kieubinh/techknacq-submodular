        "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are simple, versatile, and widely-used generative sequence models.",
        "They have been applied to part-of-speech (POS) tagging in supervised (Brants, 2000), semi-supervised (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Ravi and Knight, 2009) and unsupervised (Johnson, 2007) training scenarios.",
        "Though discriminative models achieve better performance in both semi-supervised (Smith and Eisner, 2005) and supervised (Toutanova et al., 2003) learning, there has been only limited work on unsupervised discriminative sequence models (e.g., on synthetic data and protein sequences (Xu et al., 2006)), and none to POS tagging.",
        "The tagging accuracy of purely unsupervised HMMs is far below that of supervised and semi-supervised HMMs; this is unsurprising as it is still not well understood what kind of structure is being found by an unconstrained HMM (Headden III et al., 2008).",
        "However, HMMs are fairly simple directed graphical models, and it is straightforward to extend them to define alternative generative processes.",
        "This also applies to linguistically motivated HMMs for recovering states and sequences that correspond more closely to those implicitly defined by linguists when they label sentences with parts-of-speech.",
        "One way in which a basic HMM's structure is a poor model for POS tagging is that there is no inherent distinction between (open-class) content words and (closed-class) function words.",
        "Here, we propose two extensions to the HMM.",
        "The first, HMM+, is a very simple modification where two different hyperparameters are posited for content states and function states, respectively.",
        "The other is the crouching Dirichlet, hidden Markov model (CDHMM), an extended HMM that captures this dichotomy based on the statistical evidence that comes from context.",
        "Content states display greater variance across local context (e.g. sentences, paragraphs, documents), and we capture this variance by adding a component to the model for content states that is based on latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "This extension is in some ways similar to the LDAHMM of Griffiths et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Both models are composite in that two distributions do not mix with each other.",
        "Unlike the LDAHMM, the generation of content states is folded into the CDHMM process.",
        "We compare the HMM+ and CDHMM against a basic HMM and LDAHMM on POS tagging on a more extensive and diverse set of languages than previous work in monolingual unsupervised POS tagging: four languages from three families (Germanic: English and German; Romance: Portuguese; and Mayan: Uspanteko).",
        "The CDHMM easily outperforms all other models, including HMM+, across three measures (accuracy, F-score, and variation of information) for unsupervised POS tagging on most data sets.",
        "However, the HMM+ is surprisingly competitive, outperforming the basic HMM and LDAHMM, and rivaling or even passing the CDHMM on some measures and data sets."

        "Emissions are generated by Mult(^t ) with a prior ^t generated by Dir({) with a symmetric hyperparameter £.",
        "Hyperparameter values smaller than one encourage posteriors that are peaked, with smaller values increasing this concentration.",
        "It is not necessary that the hyperparameters be symmetric, but this is a common approach when one wants to be naive about the data.",
        "This is particularly appropriate in unsupervised POS tagging with regard to novel data since there won't be a priori grounds for favoring certain distributions over others.",
        "There is considerable work on extensions to HMM-based unsupervised POS tagging (see §6), but here we concentrate on the LDAHMM (Griffiths et al., 2005), which models topics and state sequences jointly.",
        "The model is a composite of a probabilistic topic model and an HMM in which a single state is allocated for words generated from the topic model.",
        "A strength of this model is that it is able to use less supervision than previous topic models since it does not require a stopword list.",
        "While the topic model component still uses the bags-of-words assumption, the joint model infers which words are more likely to carry topical content and which words are more likely to contribute to the local sequence.",

        "(2005) note that the topic model component inevitably loses some finer distinctions with respect to parts-of-speech.",
