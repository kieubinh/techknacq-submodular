        "Weblogs, commonly known as blogs, refer to online personal diaries which generally contain informal writings.",
        "With the rapid growth of blogs, their value as an important source of information is increasing.",
        "A large amount of research work has been devoted to blogs in the natural language processing (NLP) and other communities.",
        "There are also many commercial companies that exploit information in blogs to provide value-added services, e.g., blog search, blog topic tracking, and sentiment analysis of people's opinions on products and services.",
        "Gender classification of blog authors is one such study, which also has many commercial applications.",
        "For example, it can help the user find what topics or products are most talked about by males and females, and what products and services are liked or disliked by men and women.",
        "Knowing this information is crucial for market intelligence because the information can be exploited in targeted advertising and also product development.",
        "In the past few years, several authors have studied the problem of gender classification in the natural language processing and linguistic communities.",
        "However, most existing works deal with formal writings, e.g., essays of people, the Reuters news corpus and the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "Blog posts differ from such text in many ways.",
        "For instance, blog posts are typically short and unstructured, and consist of mostly informal sentences, which can contain spurious information and are full of grammar errors, abbreviations, slang words and phrases, and wrong spellings.",
        "Due to these reasons, gender classification of blog posts is a harder problem than gender classification of traditional formal text.",
        "Recent work has also attempted gender classification of blog authors using features such as content words, dictionary based content analysis results, POS (part-of-speech) tags and feature selection along with a supervised learning algorithm (Schler et al., 2006; Argamon et al., 2007; Yan and Yan, 2006).",
        "This paper improves these existing methods by proposing two novel techniques.",
        "The first technique adds a new class of pattern based features to learning, which are not used in any existing work.",
        "The patterns are frequent sequences of POS tags which can capture complex stylistic characteristics of male and female authors.",
        "We note that these patterns are very different from the traditional n-grams because the patterns are of variable lengths and need to satisfy some criteria in order for them to represent significant regularities.",
        "We will discuss them in detail in Section 3.5.",
        "The second technique is a new feature selection algorithm which uses an ensemble of feature selection criteria and methods.",
        "It is well known that each individual feature selection criterion and method can be biased and tends to favor certain types of features.",
        "A combination of them should be able to capture the most useful or discriminative features.",
        "Our experimental results based on a real life blog data set collected from a large number of blog hosting sites show that the two new techniques enable classification algorithms to significantly improve the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art techniques (Argamon et al., 2007; compare with two publicly available systems, Gender Genie (BookBlog, 2007) and Gender Guesser (Krawetz, 2006).",
        "Both systems implemented variations of the method given in (Arga-mon et al., 2003).",
        "Here, the improvement of our techniques is even greater."

        "These systems use function/content words, POS tag features, word classes (Schler et al., 2006), content word classes (Arga-mon et al., 2007), results of dictionary based content analysis, POS unigram (Yan and Yan, 2006), and personality types (Nowson et al., 2005) to capture stylistic behavior of authors' writings for classifying gender.",
        "(Koppel et al.",
        "2002) also used POS n-grams together with content words on the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "(Houvardas and Stamatatos, 2006) even applied character (rather than word or tag) n-grams to capture stylistic features for authorship classification of news articles in Reuters.",
        "However, these works use only one or a subset of the classes of features.",
        "None of them uses all features for classification learning.",
        "Given the complexity of blog posts, it makes sense to apply all classes of features jointly in order to classify genders.",
        "Moreover, having many feature classes is very useful as they provide features with varied granularities and diversities.",
        "However, this also results in a huge number of features and many of them are redundant and may obscure classification.",
        "Feature selection is thus needed.",
        "Following the idea, this paper proposes a new ensemble feature selection method which is capable of extracting good features from different feature classes using multiple criteria.",
        "We also note some less relevant literature.",
        "For example, (Tannen, 1990) deals with gender differences in \"conversational style\" and in \"formal written essays\", and (Gefen and Straub, 1997) reports differences in perception of males and females in the use of emails.",
        "Our new POS pattern features are related to POS n-grams used in (Koppel et al., 2002; Arga-mon et al., 2007), which considered POS 3-grams, 2-grams and unigrams as features.",
        "As shown in (Baayen et.",
        "al.",
        "1996), POS n-grams are very effective in capturing the fine-grained stylistic and heavier syntactic information.",
        "In this work, we go further by finding POS sequence patterns.",
        "As discussed in the introduction, our patterns are entirely different from POS n-grams.",
        "First of all, they are of variable lengths depending on whatever lengths can catch the regularities.",
        "They also need to satisfy some constraints to ensure that they truly represent some significant regularity of male or female writings.",
        "Furthermore, our POS sequence patterns can take care of n-grams and capture additional sequence regularities.",
        "These automatically mined pattern features are thus more discriminating for classification."
