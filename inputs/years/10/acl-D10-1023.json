        "Automated essay scoring, the task of employing computer technology to evaluate and score written text, is one of the most important educational applications of natural language processing (NLP) (see Shermis and Burstein (2003) and Shermis et al.",
        "(2010) for an overview of the state of the art in this task).",
        "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this and other educational applications in the NLP community, as evidenced by the panel discussion on \"Emerging Application Areas in Computational Linguistics\" at NAACL 2009, as well as increased participation in the series of workshops on \"Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications\".",
        "Besides its potential commercial value, automated essay scoring brings about a number of relatively less-studied but arguably rather challenging discourse-level problems that involve the computational modeling of different facets of text structure, such as content, coherence, and organization.",
        "A major weakness of many existing essay scoring engines such as IntelliMetric (Elliot, 2001) and Intelligent Essay Assessor (Landauer et al., 2003) is that they adopt a holistic scoring scheme, which summarizes the quality of an essay with a single score and thus provides very limited feedback to the writer.",
        "In particular, it is not clear which dimension of an essay (e.g., coherence, relevance) a score should be attributed to.",
        "Recent work addresses this problem by scoring a particular dimension of essay quality such as coherence (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004), technical errors, and relevance to prompt (Higgins et al., 2004).",
        "Automated systems that provide instructional feedback along multiple dimensions of essay quality such as Criterion (Burstein et al., 2004) have also begun to emerge.",
        "Nevertheless, there is an essay scoring dimension for which few computational models have been developed – organization.",
        "Organization refers to the structure of an essay.",
        "A high score on organization means that writers introduce a topic, state their position on that topic, support their position, and conclude, often by restating their position (Silva, 1993).",
        "A well-organized essay is structured in a way that logically develops an argument.",
        "Note that organization is a different facet of text structure than coherence, which is concerned with the transition of ideas at both the global (e.g., paragraph) and local (e.g., sentence) levels.",
        "While organization is an important dimension of essay quality, state-of-the-art essay scoring software such as e-rater V.2 (Attali and Burstein, 2006) employs rather simple heuristic-based methods for computing the score of an essay along this particular dimension.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to develop a computational model for the organization of student essays.",
        "While many models of text coherence have been developed in recent years (e.g., Barzilay and Lee (2004), Barzilay and Lapata (2005), Soricut and Marcu (2006), Elsner et al.",
        "(2007)), the same is not true for text organization.",
        "One reason is the availability of training and test data for coherence modeling.",
        "Coherence models are typically evaluated on the sentence ordering task, and hence training and test data can be generated simply by scrambling the order of the sentences in a text.",
        "On the other hand, it is not particularly easy to find poorly organized texts for training and evaluating organization models.",
        "We believe that student essays are an ideal source of well-and poorly-organized texts.",
        "We evaluate our organization model on a data set of 1003 essays annotated with organization scores.",
        "In sum, our contributions in this paper are twofold.",
        "First, we address a less-studied discourse-level task – predicting the organization score of an essay – by developing a computational model of organization, thus establishing a baseline against which future work on this task can be compared.",
        "Second, we annotate a subset of our student essay corpus with organization scores and make this data set publicly available.",
        "Since progress in organization modeling is hindered in part by the lack of a publicly annotated corpus, we believe that our data set will be a valuable resource to the NLP community."

        "Having applied labels to each paragraph in an essay, how can we use these labels to predict the essay's score?",
        "Recall that the importance of each paragraph label stems not from the label itself, but from the sequence of labels it appears in.",
        "Motivated by this observation, we exploit a technique that is commonly used in bioinformatics – sequence alignment.",
        "While sequence alignment has also been used in text and paraphrase generation (e.g., Barzilay and Lee (2002; 2003)), it has not been extensively applied to other areas of language processing, including essay scoring.",
        "In this section, we will present two heuristic approaches to organization scoring, one based on aligning paragraph sequences and the other on aligning sentence sequences.",
        "As mentioned above, our first approach to heuristic organization scoring involves aligning paragraph sequences.",
        "Specifically, this approach operates in two steps.",
        "Given an essay e in the test set, we (1) find the k essays in the training set that are most similar to e via paragraph sequence alignment, and then (2) predict the organization score of e by aggregating the scores of its k nearest neighbors obtained in the first step.",
        "Below we describe these two steps in detail.",
        "First, to obtain the k nearest neighbors of e, we employ the Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), which computes a similarity score for any pair of essays by finding an optimal alignment between their paragraph sequences.",
        "To illustrate why we believe sequence alignment can help us determine which essays are most similar, consider two example essays.",
        "One essay, which we will call IBBBC, begins with an Introductory paragraph, follows it with three Body paragraphs, and finally ends with a Concluding paragraph.",
        "Another essay CRRRI begins with a paragraph stating its Conclusion, follows it with three Rebuttal paragraphs, and ends with a paragraph Introducing the essay's topic.",
        "We can tell by a casual glance at the sequences that any reasonable similarity function should tell us that they are not",
        "graph and sentence labeling heuristics.",
        "See our website at http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~alan/ICLE/ for the complete list of heuristics.",
        "very similar.",
        "The Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm has this effect since the score of the alignment it produces would be hurt by the facts that (1) there is not much overlap in the sets of paragraph labels each contains, and (2) the paragraph labels they do share (I and C) do not occur in the same order.",
        "The resulting alignment would therefore contain many mismatches or indels.",
        "If we now consider a third essay whose paragraph sequence could be represented as IBRBC, a good similarity function should tell us that IBBBC and IBRBC are very similar.",
        "The Needleman-Wunsch alignment score between the two paragraph sequences has this property, as the alignment algorithm would discover that the two sequences are identical except for the third paragraph label, which could be mismatched for a small penalty.",
        "We would therefore conclude that the IBBBC and IBRBC essays should receive similar organization scores.",
        "To fully specify how to find the k nearest neighbors of an essay, we need to define a similarity function between paragraph labels.",
        "In sequence alignment, similarity function S(i, j) tells us how likely it is that symbol i (in our case, a paragraph label) will be substituted with another symbol j.",
        "While we expect that in an alignment between high-scoring essays, an Introduction paragraph is most likely to be aligned with another Introduction paragraph, how much worse should the alignment score be if an Introduction paragraph needs to be mismatched with a Rebuttal paragraph or replaced with an indel?",
        "We solve this problem by heuristically defining the similarity function as follows: S(i, j) = 1 when i = j, S) = – 1 when i = j, and also S(i, – ) = S( – , i) = – 1, where ' – ' is an indel.",
        "In other words, the similarity function encourages the alignment between two identical function labels and discourages the alignment between two different function labels, regardless of the type of function labels.",
        "After obtaining the k nearest neighbors of e, the next step is to predict the organization score of e by aggregating the scores of its k nearest neighbors into one number.",
        "(Note that we know the organization score of each nearest neighbor, since they are all taken from the training set.)",
        "One natural way to do this would be to take the mean, median, or mode of its k nearest neighboring essays from the training set.",
        "Hence, our first heuristic method Hp for scoring organization has three variants.",
        "An essay's paragraph sequence captures information about its organization at a high level, but ignores much of its lower level structure.",
        "Since we have also heuristically labeled sentences, it now makes sense to examine the sequences of sentence function labels within an essay's paragraphs.",
        "The intuition is that at least some portion of an essay's organization score can be attributed to the organization of the sentence sequences of its component paragraphs.",
        "To address this concern, we propose a second heuristic approach to organization scoring.",
        "Given a test essay e, we first find for each paragraph in e the k paragraphs in the training set that are most similar to it.",
        "Specifically, each paragraph is represented by its sequence of sentence function labels.",
        "Given this paragraph representation, we can find the k nearest neighbors of a paragraph by applying the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm described in the previous subsection to align sentence sequences, using the same similarity function we defined above.",
        "Next, we score each paragraph pi by aggregating the scores of its k nearest neighbors obtained in the first step, assuming the score of a nearest neighbor paragraph is the same as the organization score of the training set essay containing it.",
        "As before, we can employ the mean, median, or mode to aggregate the scores of the nearest neighbors of pi.",
        "Finally, we predict the organization score of e by aggregating the scores of its paragraphs obtained in the second step.",
        "Again, we can employ mean, median, or mode to aggregate the scores.",
        "Since we have three ways ofaggregating the scores ofa paragraph's nearest neighbors and three ways of aggregating the resulting paragraph scores, this second method Hsfor scoring organization has nine variants."

        "To remedy the problem, we introduce three learning-based systems which abstract the additional information we produced in three different ways.",
        "In each system, we use the SVM1ight (Joachims, 1999) implementation of regression support vector machines (SVMs) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) to train a regres-sor because SVMs have been frequently and successfully applied to a variety of NLP problems.",
        "Owing to the different ways we presented of combining the scores of an essay's nearest neighbors, the paragraph label sequence alignment approach has three variants, and its sentence label sequence alignment counterpart has nine.",
        "Unfortunately, these heuristic approaches suffer from two major weaknesses.",
        "First, it is not intuitively clear which of these 12 ways for predicting an essay's organization score is clearly better than the others.",
        "Second, it is not clear that the k nearest neighbors of an essay will always be similar to it with respect to organization score.",
        "While we do expect the alignment scores between good essays with reasonable paragraph sequences to be high, poorly organized essays by their nature have more random paragraph sequences.",
        "Hence, we have no intuition about the k nearest neighbors of a poor essay, as it may have as high an alignment score with another poorly organized essay as with a good essay.",
        "Our solution to these problems is to use the organization scores obtained by the 12 heuristic variants as features in a linear kernel SVM learner.",
        "We believe that using the estimates given by all the 12 variants of the two heuristic approaches rather than only one of them addresses the first weakness mentioned above.",
        "The second weakness, on the other hand, is addressed by treating the organization score predictions obtained by the nearest neighbor methods as features for an SVM learner rather than as estimates of an essay's organization score.",

        "In an attempt to further enhance the prediction capability of the SVM re-gressor, we will provide it with not only the 12 features derived from the heuristic-based approaches, but also with two additional types offeatures.",
        "First, to give our learner more direct access to the information we used to heuristically predict essay scores, we can extract paragraph label subse-quences from each essay and use them as features.",
        "To illustrate the intuition behind these features, consider two paragraph subsequences: Introduction-Body and Rebuttal-Introduction.",
        "It is fairly typical to see the first subsequence, I-B, at the beginning of a good essay, so its occurrence should give us a small amount of evidence that the essay it occurs in is well-organized.",
        "The presence of the second subsequence, R-I, however, should indicate that its essay's organization is poor because, in general, a good essay should not give a Rebuttal before an Introduction.",
        "Because we can envision subsequences of various lengths being useful, we create a binary presence or absence feature in the linear kernel for each paragraph subsequence of length 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 appearing in the training set.",
        "Second, we employ sentence label subsequences as features in the linear kernel.",
        "Recall that when describing our alignment-based nearest neighbor organization score prediction methods, we noted that an essay's organization score may be partially attributable to how well the sentences within its paragraphs are organized.",
        "For example, if one of an essay's paragraphs contains the sentence label subsequence Main Idea-Elaboration-Support-Conclusion this gives us some evidence that the essay is overall well-organized since one of its component paragraphs contains this reasonably-organized subsequence.",
        "An essay with a paragraph containing the subsequence Conclusion-Support-Thesis-Rebuttal, however, is likely to be poorly organized because this is a poorly-organized subsequence.",
        "Since sentence label subsequences of differing lengths may be useful for score prediction, we create a binary presence or absence feature for each sentence label subsequence of length 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 in the training set.",
        "While the number of nearest neighbor features is manageable, the presence of a large number of features can sometimes confuse a learner.",
        "For that reason, we do feature selection on the two types of subsequence features, selecting only 100 features for each type that has the highest information gain (see Yang and Pedersen (1997) for details).",
        "We call the system resulting from the use of these three types of features Rlnps because it uses Regression with linear kernel to predict essay scores, and it uses nearest neighbor, paragraph subsequence, and sentence subsequence features.",
        "In a traditional learning setting, the feature set employed by an off-the-shelf learning algorithm typically consists of flat features (i.e., features whose values are discrete-or real-valued, as the ones described in the Linear Kernel subsection).",
        "Advanced machine learning algorithms such as SVMs, on the other hand, have enabled the use of structured features (i.e., features whose values are structures such as parse trees and sequences), owing to their ability to employ kernels to efficiently compute the similarity between two potentially complex structures.",
        "Perhaps the most obvious advantage of employing structured features is simplicity.",
        "To understand this advantage, consider learning in a traditional setting.",
        "Recall that we can only employ flat features in this setting, as we did with the linear kernel.",
        "Hence, if we want to use information from a parse tree as features, we will need to design heuristics to extract the desired parse-based features from parse trees.",
        "For certain tasks, designing a good set of heuristics can be time-consuming and sometimes difficult.",
        "On the other hand, SVMs enable a parse tree to be employed directly as a structured feature, obviating the need to design heuristics to extract information from potentially complex structures.",
        "However, structured features have only been applied to a handful of NLP tasks such as semantic role labeling (Moschitti, 2004), syntactic parsing and named entity identification (Collins and Duffy, 2002), relation extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), and coref-erence resolution (Versley et al., 2008).",
        "Our goal here is to explore this rarely-exploited capability of SVMs for the task of essay scoring.",
        "While the vast majority of previous NLP work on using structured features have involved tree kernels, we employ a kernel that is rarely investigated in NLP: string kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002).",
        "Informally, a string kernel aims to efficiently compute the similarity between two strings (or sequences) of symbols based on the similarity of their subsequences.",
        "We apply string kernels to essay scoring as follows: we represent each essay using its paragraph function label sequence, and employ a string kernel to compute the similarity between two essays based on this representation.",
        "Typically, a string kernel takes as input two parameters: K (which specifies the length of the subsequences in the two strings to compare) and A (which is a value between 0 and 1 that specifies whether matches between non-contiguous subsequences in the two strings should be considered as important as matches between contiguous subsequences).",
        "In our experiments, we select values for these parameters in a somewhat arbitrary manner.",
        "In particular, since A ranges between 0 and 1, we simply set it to 0.5.",
        "For K, since in the flat features we considered all paragraph label sequences of lengths from 1 to 5, we again take the middle value, setting it to 3.",
        "We call the system using this kernel Rs because it uses a Regression SVM with a string kernel to predict essay scores.",
        "In general, the purpose of a kernel function is to measure the similarity between two examples.",
        "The string kernel we described in the previous subsection is just one way of measuring the similarity of two essays given their paragraph sequences.",
        "While this may be the most obvious way to use paragraph sequence information from a machine learning perspective, our earlier use of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm suggests a more direct way of extracting structured information from paragraph sequences.",
        "More specifically, recall that the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm finds an optimal alignment between two paragraph sequences, where an optimal alignment is defined as an alignment having the highest possible alignment score.",
        "The optimal alignment score can be viewed as another similarity measure between two essays.",
        "As such, with some slight modifications, the alignment score between two paragraph sequences can be used as the kernel value for an Alignment Kernel.",
        "We call the system using this kernel Ra because it uses a Regression SVM with an alignment kernel to predict essay scores.",
        "Recall that the flat features are computed using a linear kernel, while the two types of structured features are computed using string and alignment kernels.",
        "If we want our learner to make use of more than one of these types of features, we need to employ a composite kernel to combine them.",
        "Specifically, we define and employ the following composite kernel:",
        "where F1 and F2 are the full set of features (containing both flat and structured features) that represent the two essays under consideration, Ki is the ith kernel we are combining, and n is the number of kernels we are combining.",
        "To ensure that each kernel under consideration contributes equally to the composite kernel, each kernel value Ki(Fi, F2) is normalized so that its value falls between 0 and 1."

        "Hence, a system that predicts the right score only 25% of the time would receive an S1 score of 0.75.",
        "The S2 metric is slightly less intuitive than S1, but no less reasonable.",
        "It measures the average distance between the system's score and the actual score.",
        "This metric reflects the idea that a system that estimates scores close to the annotator-assigned scores should be preferred over a system whose estimations are further off, even if both systems estimate the correct score at the same frequency.",
        "Finally, the S3 evaluation metric measures the average square of the distance between a system's organization score estimations and the annotator-assigned scores.",
        "The intuition behind this system is that not only should we prefer a system whose estimations are close to the annotator scores, but we should also prefer one whose estimations are not too frequently very far away from the annotator scores.",

        "where Ai and Ei are the annotator assigned and system estimated scores respectively for essay i, and N is the number of essays.",

        "Recall that we have 12 versions of the two heuristic approaches to organization prediction.",

        "It is clear from the results that the Hp systems yielded the best baseline predictions under all three scoring metrics, performing significantly better than both the Avg and Hs systems (p < 0.01) with respect to the S2 and S3 metrics, but its S1 performance is less significant with respect to Avg (p < 0.1) and is indistinguishable at even the p < 0.1 level from Hs.",

        "In fact, only one of these three learning-based systems (Rlnps) performs better than Hp under the three scoring metrics, and in each case, the difference between the two is not significant even at p < 0.1.",
        "This suggests that, even though Rlnps performs slightly better than Hp, the only major benefit we have obtained by using the linear kernel is that it has made it unnecessary for us to choose between the 12 proposed heuristic systems.",
        "Considering that the second best one-kernel system, Rs, does not have access to any of the nearest neighbor features, which have already proven useful, its performance seems reasonably good in that its performance is at least better than the Avg system.",
