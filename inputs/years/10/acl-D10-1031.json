        "Extracting semantic relations from text is an important step towards understanding the meaning of text.",
        "Many applications that use no semantics, or only shallow semantics, could benefit by having available more text semantics.",
        "Recently, there is a growing interest in text semantics (Marquez et al., 2008; Davi-dov and Rappoport, 2008).",
        "An important semantic relation for many applications is the manner relation.",
        "Broadly speaking, MANNER encodes the mode, style, way or fashion in which something is done or happened.",
        "For example, quick delivery encodes a manner relation, since quick is the manner in which the delivery happened.",
        "An application of manner detection is Question Answering, where many how questions refer to this particular relation.",
        "Consider for example the question How did the President communicate his mes sage?, and the text Through his spokesman, Obama sent a strong message [...].",
        "To answer such questions, it is useful to identify first the MANNER relations in text.",
        "MANNER occurs frequently in text and it is expressed by a wide variety of lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "For example, PropBank annotates 8,037 argm-mnr relations (10.7%) out of 74,980 adjunct-like arguments (ARGMs).",
        "There are verbs that state a particular way of doing something, e.g., to limp implicitly states a particular way of walking.",
        "Adverbial phrases and prepositional phrases are the most productive patterns, e.g., The nation's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all and He started the company on his own.",
        "Consider the following example: The company said Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring assisted by Manfred Gingl, .",
        "].",
        "There are two MANNER relations in this sentence: the underlined chunks of text encode the way in which Mr. Stronach will direct the restructuring."

        "manner is a semantic role, and all the works on the extraction of roles (Gildea and Ju-rafsky, 2002; Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006) extracts manner as well.",
        "However, these approaches treat MANNER as any other role and do not use any specific features for its detection.",
        "As we show in this paper, MANNER has its own unique characteristics and identifying them improves the extraction accuracy.",
        "The two most used semantic role annotation resources, FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and Prop-Bank (Palmer et al., 2005), include MANNER.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: (1) empirical study of MANNER and its semantics; (2) analysis of the differences with other relations; (3) lexico-syntactic patterns expressing MANNER; (4) a set of features specialized on the detection of MANNER; and (5) the way MANNER combines with other semantic relations."

        "Traditionally, a semantic relation is defined by stating the kind of connection linking two concepts.",

        ".",
        ". ]",
        "manner should be used when an adverb be an answer to a question starting with 'how?'.",
        "We find this kind of definition weak and prone to confusion (Section 3.2).",
        "Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, semantic relations have been mostly defined stating only a vague definition.",
        "Following (Helbig, 2005), we propose an extended definition for semantic relations, including semantic restrictions for its domain and range.",
        "These restrictions help deciding which relation holds between a given pair of concepts.",
        "A relation shall not hold between two concepts unless they belong to its domain and range.",
        "These restrictions are based on theoretical and empirical grounds.",
        "Formally, MANNER is represented as MNR(x, y), and it should be read x is the manner in which y happened.",
        "In addition, Domain(mnr) and Range(mnr) are the sets of sorts of concepts that can be part of the first and second argument.",
        "Range(mnr), namely y, is restricted to situations, which are defined as anything that happens at a time and place.",
        "Situations include events and states and can be expressed by verbs or nouns, e.g., conference, race, mix and grow.",
        "Domain(mnr), namely x, is restricted to qualities (ql), non temporal abstract objects (ntao) and states (st).",
        "Qualities represent characteristics that can be assigned to other concepts, such as slowly and abruptly.",
        "Non temporal abstract objects are intangible entities.",
        "They are somehow product of human reasoning and are not palpable.",
        "They do not encode periods or points of time, such as week, or yesterday.",
        "For example, odor, disease, and mile are ntao; book and car are not because they are tangible.",
        "Unlike events, states are situations that do not imply a change in the concepts involved.",
        "For example, standing there or holding hands are states; whereas walking to the park and pinching him are events.",
        "For more details about these semantic classes, refer to (Helbig, 2005).",
        "These semantic restrictions on MANNER come after studying previous definitions and manual examination of hundreds of examples.",
        "Their use and benefits are described in Section 4.",
        "MANNER is close in meaning with several other relations, specifically instrument, at-location and",
        "AT-TIME.",
        "Asking how does not identify MANNER in many cases.",
        "For example, given John broke the window [with a hammer], the question how did John break the window?",
        "can be answered by with the hammer, and yet the hammer is not the manner but the instrument of the broke event.",
        "Other relations that may be confused as manner include at-location and at-time, like in [The dog jumped]x [over the fence y and [John used to go x [regularly y.",
        "A way of solving this ambiguity is by prioritizing the semantic relations among the possible candidates for a given pair of concepts.",
        "For example, if both instrument and manner are possible, the former is extracted.",
        "In a similar fashion, at-location and at-time could have higher priority than manner.",
        "This idea has one big disadvantage: the correct detection of manner relies on the detection of several other relations, a problem which has proven difficult and thus would unnecessarily introduce errors.",
        "Using the proposed extended definition one may discard the false manner relations above.",
        "Hammer is not a quality, non temporal abstract object or state (hammers are palpable objects), so by definition a relation of the form mnr( the hammer, y) shall not hold.",
        "Similarly, fence and week do not fulfill the domain restriction, so mnr(over the fence, y) and mnr(every other week, y) are not valid either.",
        "manner also relates to cause.",
        "Again, asking how?",
        "does not resolve the ambiguity.",
        "Given The legislation itselfnoted that it [was introduced]x \"by request,\" [...] (wsj_0041, 47), we believe the underlined PP indicates the cause and not the manner of x because the introduction of the legislation is the effect of the request.",
