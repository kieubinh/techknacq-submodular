        "Semantic relation extraction aims to detect and classify semantic relationships between a pair of named entities occurring in a natural language text.",
        "Many machine learning approaches have been proposed to attack this problem, including supervised (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhao and",
        "Qian et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010), semi-supervised (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004; Chen et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2009), and unsupervised methods (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005).",
        "Current work on relation extraction mainly adopts supervised learning methods, since they achieve much better performance.",
        "However, they normally require a large number of manually labeled relation instances, whose acquisition is both time consuming and labor intensive.",
        "In contrast, unsupervised methods do not need any manually labeled instances.",
        "Nevertheless, it is difficult to assess their performance due to the lack of evaluation criteria.",
        "As something between them, semi-supervised learning has received more and more attention recently.",
        "With the plenitude of unlabeled natural language text at hand, semi-supervised learning can significantly reduce the need for labeled data with only limited sacrifice in performance.",
        "For example, Abney (2002) proposes a bootstrapping algorithm which chooses the unla-beled instances with the highest probability of being correctly labeled and add them in turn into the labeled training data iteratively.",
        "This paper focuses on bootstrapping-based semi-supervised learning in relation extraction.",
        "Since the performance of bootstrapping depends much on the quality and quantity of the seed set and researchers tend to employ as few seeds as possible (e.g. 100 instances) to save time and labor, the quality of the seed set plays a critical role in bootstrapping.",
        "Furthermore, the imbalance of different classes and the inherent structural complexity of instances will severely weaken the strength of bootstrapping and semi-supervised learning as well.",
        "Therefore, it is critical for a bootstrapping procedure to select an appropriate seed set, which should be representative and diverse.",
        "However, most of current semi-supervised relation extraction systems (Zhang, 2004; Chen et al., 2006) use a random seed sampling strategy, which fails to fully exploit the affinity nature in the training data to derive the seed set.",
        "Alternatively, Zhou et al.",
        "(2009) bootstrap a set of weighted support vectors from both labeled and unlabeled data using SVM and feed these instances into semi-supervised relation extraction.",
        "However, their seed set is sequentially generated only to ensure that there are at least 5 instances for each relation class.",
        "Our previous work (Qian et al., 2009) attempts to solve this problem via a simple stratified sampling strategy for selecting the seed set.",
        "Experimentation on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus shows that the stratified sampling strategy achieves promising results for semi-supervised learning.",
        "Nevertheless, the success of the strategy relies on the assumption that the true distribution of all relation types is already known, which is impractical for real NLP applications.",
        "This paper presents a clustering-based stratified seed sampling approach for semi-supervised relation extraction, without the assumption on the true distribution of different relation types.",
        "The motivations behind our approach are that the unlabeled data can be partitioned into a number of strata using a clustering algorithm and that representative and diverse seeds can be derived from such strata in the framework of stratified sampling (Neyman, 1934) for an oracle to annotate.",
        "Particularly, we employ a diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling scheme to pick a center and additional instances as seeds from each stratum.",
        "Experimental results show the effectiveness of the clustering-based stratified seed sampling for semi-supervised relation classification.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "First an overview of the related work is given in Section 2.",
        "Then, Section 3 introduces the stratified bootstrapping framework including an intrastratum sampling scheme while Section 4 describes various clustering algorithms.",

        "(2009) adopt a stratified sampling strategy to select the seed set.",

        "The stratified bootstrapping framework consists of three major components: an underlying supervised learner and a bootstrapping algorithm on top of it as usual, plus a clustering-based stratified seed sampler.",
        "Due to recent success in tree kernel-based relation extraction, this paper adopts a tree kernel-based method in the underlying supervised learner.",
        "Following the previous work in relation extraction (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2008), we use the standard convolution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001) to count the number of common sub-trees as the structural similarity between two parse trees.",
        "Besides, to properly represent a relation instance, this paper adopts the Unified Parse and Semantic Tree (UPST), as proposed in Qian et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "To our knowledge, the USPT has achieved the best performance in relation extraction so far on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus.",
        "In particular, we use the SVM^-TK package as our classifier.",
        "Since the package is a binary classifier, we adapt it to the multi-class tasks of relation extraction by applying the one vs. others strategy, which builds K binary classifiers so as to separate one class from all others.",
        "The final classification decision of an instance is determined by the class that has the maximal SVM output margin.",
        "Following Zhang (2004), we have developed a baseline self-bootstrapping procedure, which keeps augmenting the labeled data by employing the models trained from previously available labeled data, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Since the SVM%ht-TK package doesn't output any probability that it assigns to the class label on an instance, we devise a metric to measure the confidence with regard to the classifier's prediction.",
        "Given a sequence of output margins of all K binary classifiers at some iteration, denoted as {m1,m2,...mK} with mithe margin for the i-th classifier, we compute the margin gap between the largest and the mean of the others, i.e.",
        "Where K denotes the total number of relation classes, and m. denotes the output margin of the .Algorithm self-bootstrapping Require: labeled seed set L Require: unlabeled data set U Require: batch size S Repeat",
        "Train a single classifier on L Run the classifier on U",
        "Find at most S instances in U that the classifier has the highest prediction confidence",
        "Add them into L Until: no data points available or the stoppage condition is reached th classifier.",
        "Intuitively, the bigger the H, the greater the difference between the maximal margin and all others, and thus the more reliably the classifier makes the prediction on the instance.",
        "Stratified sampling is a method of sampling in statistics, in which the members of a population are grouped into relatively homogeneous subgroups (i.e. strata) according to one certain property, and then a sample is selected from each stratum.",
        "This process of grouping is called stratification, and the property on which the stratification is performed is called the stratification variable.",
        "Previous work justifies theoretically and practically that stratified sampling is more appropriate than random sampling for general use (Neyman, 1934) as well as for relation extraction (Qian et al., 2009).",
        "However, the difficulty lies in how to find the appropriate stratification variable for complicated tasks, such as relation extraction.",
        "The idea of clustering-based stratification circumvents this problem by clustering the unlabeled data into a number of strata without the need to explicitly specify a stratification variable.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the clustering-based stratified seed sampling strategy employed in the bootstrapping procedure, where RSET denotes the whole unlabeled data, SeedSET the seed set to be labeled and \\RSET1\\ the number of instances in the i-th clusterRSET .",
        "Here, a relation instance is represented using USPT and the similarity between two instances is computed using the standard convolution tree kernel, as described in Section 3.1 (i.e., both the clustering and the classification adopt the same structural representation, since we want the representative seeds in the clustering space to be also representative in the classification space).",
        "After clustering, a certain number of instances from every stratum are sampled using an intra-stratum scheme (c.f.",
        "Subsection 3.4).",
        "Normally, this number is proportional to the size of that stratum in the whole data set.",
        "However, in case this number is 0 due to the rounding of real numbers, it is set to 1 to ensure the existence of at least one seed from that stratum.",
        "Furthermore, to ensure that the total number of instances being sampled equals the prescribed NS, the number of seeds from dominant strata may be slightly adjusted accordingly.",
        "Finally, these instances form the unlabeled seed set for an oracle to annotate as the input to the underlying supervised learner in the bootstrapping procedure.",
        "Given the distribution of clusters, a simple way to select the most representative instances is to choose the center of each cluster with the cluster prior as the weight of the center (Tang et al., 2002; Nguyen and Smeulders, 2004).",
        "Nevertheless, for the complicated task of relation extraction on the ACE RDC corpora, which is highly skewed across different relation classes, only considering the center of each cluster would severely under-represent the high-density data.",
        "To overcome this problem, we adopt a sampling approach, in particular stratified sampling, which takes the size of each stratum into consideration.",
        "Given the size of the seed set NS and the number of strata K, a natural question will arise as how to select the remaining (NS-K) seeds after we have extracted the K centers from the K strata.",
        "We view this problem as intra-stratum sampling, which is required to choose the remaining number of seeds from inside individual stratum (excluding the centers themselves).",
        "At the first glance, sampling a certain number of seeds from one particular stratum (e.g., RSET1), seems to be the same sampling problem as we have encountered before, which aims to select the most representative and diverse seeds.",
        "This will naturally lead to another application of a clustering algorithm to the stratification of the stratum RSETh Require: RSET ={R2R2,...RN}, the set of unlabeled relation instances and K, the number of strata being clustered Output: SeedSET with the size of NS (100) Procedure Initialize SeedSET = NULL",
        "Cluster RSET into K strata using a clustering algorithm and perform stratum pruning if necessary.",
        "Calculate the number of instances being sampled for each stratum i={1,2,.. .,K}",
        "and adjust this number if necessary.",
        "Perform intra-strata sampling to form SeedSET1 from each stratum RSET1, by selecting the center",
        "C and (N-1) additional instances Generate SeedSET by summating RSET1 from each",
        "Nevertheless, remember the fact that, this time for the stratum RSET1, the center C1 has been chosen, so it may not be reasonable to extract additional centers in this way.",
        "Therefore, in order to avoid recursion and over-complexity, we employ a diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling scheme (Shen et al., 2004), called KDN (K-diverse neighbors), which aims to maximize the training utility of all seeds from a stratum.",
        "The motivation is that we prefer the seeds with high variance to each other, thus avoiding repetitious seeds from a single stratum.",
        "The basic idea is to add a candidate instance to the seed set only if it is sufficiently different from any previously selected seeds, i.e., the similarity between the candidate instance and any of the current seeds is less than a threshold ß.",
        "In this paper, the threshold ß is set to the average pairwise similarity between any two instances in a stratum."

        "This section describes several typical clustering algorithms in the literature, such as K-means, HAC, spectral clustering and affinity propagation, as well as their application in this paper.",
        "As a simple yet effective clustering method, the K-means algorithm assigns each instance to the cluster whose center (also called centroid) is nearest.",
        "In particular, the center is the average of all the instances in the cluster, i.e., with its coordinates the arithmetic means for each dimension separately over all the instances in the cluster.",
        "One problem with K-means is that it does not yield the same result with each run while the other problem is the requirement for the concept of a mean to be definable, which is unfortunately not available in our setting (we employ a parse tree representation for a relation instance).",
        "Hence, we adopt a variant of K-means, namely, K-medoids, where a medoid, rather than a centroid, is defined as a representative of a cluster.",
        "Besides, K-medoids has proved to be more robust to noise and outliers in comparison with K-means.",
        "Different from K-medoids, hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters which can be represented in a tree structure called a dendrogram.",
        "The root of the tree consists of a single cluster containing all objects, and the leaves correspond to individual object.",
        "Typically, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) starts at the leaves and successively merges two clusters together as long as they have the shortest distance among all the pairwise distances between any two clusters.",
        "Given a specified number of clusters, the key problem is to determine where to cut the hierarchical tree into clusters.",
        "In this paper, we generate the final flat cluster structures greedily by maximizing the equal distribution of instances among different clusters.",
        "Spectral clustering has become more and more popular recently.",
        "Taking as input a similarity matrix between any two instances, spectral clustering makes use of the spectrum of the similarity matrix of the data to perform dimensionality reduction for clustering in fewer dimensions.",
        "Compared to the \"traditional algorithms\" such as K-means or HAC, spectral clustering has many fundamental advantages.",
        "Results obtained by spectral clustering often outperform the traditional approaches.",
        "Furthermore, spectral clustering is very simple to implement and can be solved efficiently using standard linear algebra methods (von Luxburg, 2006).",
        "As a new emerging clustering algorithm, affinity propagation (AP) (Frey and Dueck, 2007) is basically an iterative message-passing procedure in which the instances being clustered compete to serve as cluster exemplars by exchanging two types of messages, namely, \"responsibility\" and \"availability\".",
        "After the procedure converges or has repeated a finite number of iterations, each cluster is represented by an exemplar.",
        "AP was reported to find clusters with much lower error than those found by other methods.",
        "For our application, affinity propagation takes as input a similarity matrix, whose elements represent either the similarity between two different instances or the preference (a real number p) for an instance when two instances are the same.",
        "One problem with AP is that the number of clusters cannot be pre-defined, which is indirectly determined by the preference as well as the convergence procedure itself."

        "Our inspection reveals that most of them are severely imbalanced, i.e., some clusters are highly dense while others are extremely sparse.",
        "This indicates that merely selecting the centers from each cluster cannot properly represent the overall distribution.",
        "Moreover, the centers with high density lack the generalization ability due to its solitude in the cluster, leading to less performance enhancement than expected.",
        "The only exception is HAC, which much outperforms RAND by 2.3 in F1-score, although HAC is usually not considered as an effective clustering algorithm.",
        "The reason may be that HAC creates a hierarchy of clusters in the top-down manner by cutting a cluster into two.",
        "Therefore, the centers in the two sibling clusters will be closer to each other than they are to the centers in other clusters.",
        "Besides, the final flat cluster structures given a special number of clusters are generated greedily from the cluster hierarchy by maximizing the equal distribution of instances among different clusters.",
        "In other words, when the cluster number reaches a certain threshold, the dense area will get more seeds represented in the seed set.",
        "As a consequence, the distribution of all the seeds sampled by HAC will approximate the distribution of the whole training data in some degree, while the seeds sampled by other clustering algorithm are kept as far as possible due to the objective of clustering and the lack of intra-stratum sampling.",
        "These observations also justify the application of the stratified seed sampling to the bootstrapping procedure, which enforces the number of seeds sampled from a cluster to be proportional to its density, presumably approximated by its size in this paper.",
        "Comparison of different cluster numbers with intra-stratum sampling on the development data",
        "In order to fine-tune the optimal cluster numbers for seed sampling, we compare the performance of different numbers of clusters for each clustering algorithm on the development data set and report their F-scores in Table 3.",
        "For reference, we also list the F-score for golden clustering (GOLD), in which all instances are grouped in terms of their annotated ground relation major types (7), major types considering relation direction (13), subtypes (23), and subtypes considering direction (38).",
        "Besides, the performance of clustering-based semi-supervised relation classification is also measured over other typical cluster numbers (i.e., 1, 50, 60, 80, 100).",
        "Particularly, when the cluster number equals 1, it means that only diversity other than representativeness is considered in the seed sampling.",
        "Among these clustering algorithms, one of the distinct characteristics with the AP algorithm is that the number of clusters cannot be specified in advance, rather, it is determined by the predefined preference parameter (c.f.",
        "Subsection 4.4).",
        "Therefore, we should tune the preference parameter so as to get the predefined cluster number.",
        "However, sometimes we still couldn't get the exact number of clusters as we expected.",
        "In these cases, we use the approximate cluster numbers for AP instead.",
        "Table 3 shows that 1) The performance for all the clustering algorithms varies in some degree with the number of clusters being grouped.",
        "Interestingly, the performance with only one cluster is better than those of clustering-based strategies with 100 clusters, at most cases.",
        "This implies that the diversity of the seeds is at least as important as their representativeness.",
        "And this could be further explained by our observation that, with the increase of cluster numbers, the clusters get smaller and denser while their centers also come closer to each other.",
        "Therefore, the representativeness and diversity as well as the distribution of the seeds sampled from them may vary accordingly, leading to different performance.",

        "Interestingly, this number coincides with the number of major relation types needed to be classified in our task.",

        "1) Among all the clustering algorithms, HAC achieves the best F1-score of 75.9, significantly higher than RAND and SEQ by 5.1 and 6.6 respectively.",
        "The improvement comes not only from significant precision boost, but also from moderate recall increase.",
        "This further justifies the merits of HAC as a clustering algorithm for stratified seed sampling in semi-supervised relation classification.",
        "2) HAC approaches the best F1-score of 76.0 for golden clustering.",
        "Obviously, this doesn't mean HAC performs as well as golden clustering in terms of clustering quality measures, rather it does imply that HAC achieves the performance improvement by making the seed set better represent the overall distribution over inherent structure of relation instances, while golden clustering accomplishes this using the distribution over relation types.",
        "Since the distribution over relation types doesn't always conform to that over instance structures, and for a statistical discriminative classifier, often the latter is more important than the former, it will be no surprise if HAC outperforms golden clustering in some real applications, e.g. clustering-based stratified sampling."
