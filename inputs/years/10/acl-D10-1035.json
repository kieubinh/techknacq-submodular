        "Automatically acquiring semantic lexicons from text is essential for overcoming the knowledge bottleneck in many NLP tasks, e.g. question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).",
        "Many of the successful methods follow the unsupervised iterative bootstrapping framework (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997).",
        "Bootstrapping has since been effectively applied to extracting general semantic lexicons (Riloff and Jones, 1999), biomedical entities (Yu and Agichtein, 2003) and facts (Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "Bootstrapping is often considered to be minimally supervised, as it is initialised with a small set ofseed terms of the target category to extract.",
        "These seeds are used to identify patterns that can match the target category, which in turn can extract new lexicon terms (Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "Unfortunately, semantic drift often occurs when ambiguous or erroneous terms and/or patterns are introduced into the iterative process (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "In multi-category bootstrapping, semantic drift is often reduced when the target categories compete with each other for terms and/or patterns (Yangarber et al., 2002).",
        "This process is most effective when the categories bound each other's search space.",
        "To ensure this, manually crafted negative categories are introduced (Lin et al., 2003; Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Unfortunately, this makes these algorithms substantially more supervised.",
        "The design of negative categories is a very time consuming task.",
        "It typically requires a domain expert to identify the semantic drift and its cause, followed by a significant amount of trial and error in order to select the most suitable combination of negative categories.",
        "This introduces a substantial amount of supervised information into what was an unsupervised framework, and in turn negates one of the main advantages of bootstrapping – the quick construction of accurate semantic lexicons.",
        "We show that although excellent performance is achieved using negative categories, it varies greatly depending on the negative categories selected.",
        "This highlights the difficulty of crafting negative categories and thus the necessity for tools that can automatically identify them.",
        "Our second contribution is the first fully unsupervised approach, NEG-FINDER, for discovering negative categories automatically.",
        "During bootstrapping, efficient clustering techniques are applied to sets of drifted candidate terms to generate new negative categories.",
        "Once a negative category is identified it is incorporated into the subsequent iterations whereby it provides the necessary semantic boundaries for the target categories.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for extracting biomedical semantic lexicons by incorporating neg-finder within the wmeb-drift bootstrapping algorithm (McIntosh and Cur-ran, 2009).",
        "neg-finder significantly outperforms bootstrapping prior to the domain expert's negative categories.",
        "We show that by using our discovered categories we can reach near expert-guided performance.",

      "text": [
        "Various automated pattern-based bootstrapping algorithms have been proposed to iteratively build semantic lexicons.",
        "In multilevel bootstrapping, a lexicon is iteratively expanded from a small sample of seed terms (Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "The seed terms are used to identify contextual patterns they appear in, which in turn may be used to extract new lexicon entries.",
        "This process is repeated with the new expanded lexicon identifying new patterns.",
        "When bootstrapping semantic lexicons, polyse-mous or erroneous terms and/or patterns that weakly constrain the semantic class are eventually extracted.",
        "This often causes semantic drift – when a lexicon's intended meaning shifts into another category during bootstrapping (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "For example, female names may drift into gemstones when the terms Ruby and Pearl are extracted.",
        "Multi-category bootstrapping algorithms, such as basilisk (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), nomen (Yan-garber et al., 2002), and wmeb (Mcintosh and Curran, 2008), aim to reduce semantic drift by extracting multiple semantic categories simultaneously.",
        "These algorithms utilise information about other semantic categories in order to reduce the categories from drifting towards each other.",
        "This framework has recently been extended to extract different relations from text (Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "In Weighted Mutual Exclusion Bootstrapping (wmeb, McIntosh and Curran, 2008), multiple semantic categories iterate simultaneously between the term and pattern extraction phases, competing with each other for terms and patterns.",
        "Semantic drift is reduced by forcing the categories to be mutually exclusive.",
        "That is, candidate terms can only be extracted by a single category and patterns can only extract terms for a single category.",
        "In wmeb, multiple bootstrapping instances are initiated for each competing target category.",
        "Each category's seed set forms its initial lexicon.",
        "For each term in the category lexicon, wmeb identifies all candidate contextual patterns that can match the term in the text.",
        "To ensure mutual exclusion between the categories, candidate patterns that are identified by multiple categories in an iteration are excluded.",
        "The remaining patterns are then ranked according to the reliability measure and relevance weight.",
        "The reliability of a pattern for a given category is the number of extracted terms in the category's lexicon that match the pattern.",
        "A pattern's relevance weight is defined as the sum of the %-squared values between the pattern (p) and each of the lexicon terms (t): weight(p) = J2teT X(p,t).",
        "These metrics are symmetrical for both candidate terms and patterns.",
        "The top-m patterns are then added to the pool of extracting patterns.",
        "If each of the top-m patterns already exists in the pool, the next unseen pattern is added to the pool.",
        "This ensures at least one new pattern is added to the pool in each iteration.",
        "In the term selection phase, all patterns within the pattern pool are used to identify candidate terms.",
        "Like the candidate patterns, terms that are extracted by multiple categories in the same iteration are also excluded.",
        "The remaining candidate terms are ranked with respect to their reliability and relevance weight, and the top-n terms are added to the lexicon.",
        "In McIntosh and Curran (2009), we showed that multi-category bootstrappers are still prone to semantic drift in the later iterations.",
        "We proposed a drift detection metric based on our hypothesis that semantic drift occurs when a candidate term is more similar to the recently added terms than to the seed and high precision terms extracted in the earlier iterations.",
        "Our metric is based on distributional similarity measurements and can be directly incorporated into wmeb's term selection phase to prevent drifting terms from being extracted (wmeb-drift).",
        "The drift metric is defined as the ratio of the average distributional similarity of the candidate term to the first n terms extracted into the lexicon L, and to the last m terms extracted in the previous iterations:",
        "In multi-category bootstrapping, improvements in precision arise when semantic boundaries between multiple target categories are established.",
        "Thus, it is beneficial to bootstrap categories that share similar semantic spaces, such as female names and flowers.",
        "Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict if a target category will suffer from semantic drift and/or whether it will naturally compete with the other target categories.",
        "Once a domain expert establishes semantic drift and its possible cause, a set of negative/stop categories that may be of no direct interest are manually crafted to prevent semantic drift.",
        "These additional categories are then exploited during another round of bootstrapping to provide further competition for the target categories (Lin et al., 2003; Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Lin et al.",
        "(2003) improved nomen's performance for extracting diseases and locations from the ProMED corpus by incorporating negative categories into the bootstrapping process.",
        "They first used one general negative category, seeded with the 10 most frequent nouns in the corpus that were unrelated to the target categories.",
        "This single negative category resulted in substantial improvements in precision.",
        "In their final experiment, six negative categories that were notable sources of semantic drift were identified, and the inclusion of these lead to further performance improvements (~20%).",
        "In similar experiments, both Curran et al.",
        "(2007) and McIntosh (2010) manually crafted negative categories that were necessary to prevent semantic drift.",
        "In particular, in Mcintosh (2010), abiomedical expert spent considerable time (~15 days) and effort",
        "Figure 1: neg-finder: Local negative discovery",
        "identifying potential negative categories and subsequently optimising their associated seeds in trial and error bootstrapping runs.",
        "By introducing manually crafted negative categories, a significant amount of expert domain knowledge is introduced.",
        "The use of this expert knowledge undermines the principle advantages of unsupervised bootstrapping, by making it difficult to bootstrap lexicons for a large number of categories across diverse domains or languages.",
        "In this paper, we aim to push multi-category bootstrapping back into its original minimally-supervised framework, with as little performance loss as possible."

        "Our approach, Negative Category Finder for Bootstrapping (neg-finder), can be easily incorporated into bootstrapping algorithms that exclude candidate terms or facts based on a selection criteria, including wmeb-drift and Paşca et al.",

        "For simplicity, we describe our approach within the wmeb-drift bootstrapping algorithm.",
        "Figure 1 shows the framework of our approach.",
        "To discover negative categories during bootstrapping, neg-finder must identify a representative cluster of the drifted terms.",
        "In this section, we present the two types of clustering used (maximum and outlier), and our three different levels of negative discovery (local, global and mixture).",
        "We have observed that semantic drift begins to dominate when clusters of incorrect terms with similar meanings are extracted.",
        "In the term selection phase of wmeb-drift, the top-n candidate terms that satisfy the drift detection threshold are added to the expanding lexicon.",
        "Those terms which are considered but do not meet the threshold are excluded.",
        "In neg-finder, these drifted terms are cached as they may provide adequate seed terms for new negative categories.",
        "However, the drifted terms can also include scattered polysemous or correct terms that share little similarity with the other drifted terms.",
        "Therefore, simply using the first set of drifted terms to establish a negative category is likely to introduce noise rather than a cohesive competing category.",
        "To discover negative categories, we exploit hierarchical clustering to group similar terms within the cache of drifted terms.",
        "In agglomerative hierarchical clustering, a single term is assigned to an individual cluster, and these clusters are iteratively merged until a final cluster is formed containing all terms (Kaufmann and Rousseeuw, 1990).",
        "In our approach, the similarity between two clusters is computed as the average distributional similarity between all pairs of terms across the clusters (average-link clustering).",
        "For calculating the similarity between two terms we use the distributional similarity approach described in Curran (2004).",
        "We extracted window-based features from the set of candidate patterns to form context vectors for each term.",
        "We use the standard t-test weight and weighted Jaccard measure functions (Curran, 2004).",
        "To ensure adequate coverage of the possible drifting topics, negative discovery and hence clustering is only performed when the drift cache consists of at least 20 terms.",
        "Although hierarchical clustering is quadratic, we can efficiently exploit the agglomerative process as the most similar terms will merge into clusters first.",
        "Therefore, to identify the k most similar terms, we can exit the clustering process as soon as a cluster of size k is established.",
        "We refer to this approach as maximum clustering.",
        "In our next clustering method, we aim to form a negative category with as little similarity to the target seeds.",
        "We use an outlier clustering strategy, in which the drifted term t with the least average distributional similarity to the first n terms in the lexicon must be contained in the cluster of seeds.",
        "We use average similarity to the first n terms, as it is already precomputed for the drift detection metric.",
        "As with maximum clustering, once a cluster of size k containing the term t is formed, the clustering process can be terminated.",
        "After a cluster of negative seed terms is established, the drift cache is cleared, and a new negative category is created and introduced into the iterative bootstrapping process in the next iteration.",
        "This means that the negative category can only influence the subsequent iterations of bootstrapping.",
        "The negative categories can compete with all other categories, including any previously introduced negative categories, however the negative categories do not contribute to the drift caches.",
        "Before the new category is introduced, its first set of extracting patterns must be identified.",
        "For this, the complete set of extracting patterns matching any of the negative seeds are considered and ranked with respect to the seeds.",
        "The top scoring patterns are considered sequentially until m patterns are assigned to the new negative category.",
        "To ensure mutual exclusion between the new category and the target categories, a candidate pattern that has previously been selected by a target category cannot be used to extract terms for either category in the subsequent iterations.",
        "Negative category discovery can be performed at a local or global level, or as a mixture of both.",
        "In local discovery, each target category has its own drifted term cache and can generate negative categories irrespective of the other target categories.",
        "This is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The drifted terms (shaded) are extracted away from the lexicon into the local drift cache, which is then clustered.",
        "A cluster is then used to initiate a negative category's lexicon.",
        "Target categories can also generate multiple negative categories across different iterations.",
        "In global discovery, all drifted terms are pooled into a global cache, from which a single negative category can be identified in an iteration.",
        "This is based on our intuition that multiple target categories may be drifting into similar semantic categories, and enables these otherwise missed negative categories to be established.",
        "In the mixture discovery method, both global and local negative categories can be formed.",
        "A category's drifted terms are collected into its local cache as well as the global cache.",
        "Negative discovery is then performed on each cache when they contain at least 20 terms.",
        "Once a local negative category is formed, the terms within the local cache are cleared and also removed from the global cache.",

        "In this paper, we have proposed the first completely unsupervised approach to identifying the negative categories that are necessary for bootstrapping large yet precise semantic lexicons.",
        "Prior to this work, negative categories were manually crafted by a domain expert, undermining the advantages of an unsupervised bootstrapping paradigm.",
        "There are numerous avenues for further examination.",
        "We intend to use sophisticated clustering methods, such as cbc (Pantel, 2003), to identify multiple negative categories across the target categories in a single iteration.",
        "We would also like to explore the suitability of neg-finder for relation extraction.",
        "Our initial analysis demonstrated that although excellent performance is achieved using negative categories, large performance variations occur when using categories crafted by different domain experts.",
        "In neg-finder, unsupervised clustering approaches are exploited to automatically discover negative categories during bootstrapping.",
        "neg-finder identifies cohesive negative categories and many of these are semantically similar to those identified by domain experts.",
        "neg-finder significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm wmeb-drift, before negative categories are crafted, by up to 5.4% over the top-1000 terms; and by 10.7% over the last 200 terms extracted, where semantic drift is extensive.",
        "The new discovered categories can also be fully exploited in bootstrapping, where they successfully outperform a domain expert's negative categories and approach that of another expert.",
        "The result is an effective approach that can be incorporated within any bootstrapper.",
        "neg-finder successfully removes the necessity of including manually crafted supervised knowledge to boost a bootstrapper's performance.",
        "In doing so, we revert the multi-category bootstrapping framework back to its originally intended minimally supervised framework, with little performance trade-off."
