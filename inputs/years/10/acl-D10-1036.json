        "Keyphrases are defined as a set of terms in a document that give a brief summary of its content for readers.",
        "Automatic keyphrase extraction is widely used in information retrieval and digital library (Tur-ney, 2000; Nguyen and Kan, 2007).",
        "Keyphrase extraction is also an essential step in various tasks of natural language processing such as document categorization, clustering and summarization (Manning and Schütze, 2000).",
        "There are two principled approaches to extracting keyphrases: supervised and unsupervised.",
        "The supervised approach (Turney, 1999) regards keyphrase extraction as a classification task, in which a model is trained to determine whether a candidate phrase is a keyphrase.",
        "Supervised methods require a document set with human-assigned keyphrases as training set.",
        "In Web era, articles increase exponentially and change dynamically, which demands keyphrase extraction to be efficient and adaptable.",
        "However, since human labeling is time consuming, it is impractical to label training set from time to time.",
        "We thus focus on the unsupervised approach in this study.",
        "In the unsupervised approach, graph-based ranking methods are state-of-the-art (Mihalcea and Ta-rau, 2004).",
        "These methods first build a word graph according to word co-occurrences within the document, and then use random walk techniques (e.g., PageRank) to measure word importance.",
        "After that, top ranked words are selected as keyphrases.",
        "Existing graph-based methods maintain a single importance score for each word.",
        "However, a document (e.g., news article or research article) is usually composed of multiple semantic topics.",
        "Taking this paper for example, it refers to two major topics, \"keyphrase extraction\" and \"random walk\".",
        "As words are used to express various meanings corresponding to different semantic topics, a word will play different importance roles in different topics of the document.",
        "For example, the words \"phrase\" and \"extraction\" will be ranked to be more important in topic \"keyphrase extraction\", while the words \"graph\" and \"PageRank\" will be more important in topic \"random walk\".",
        "Since they do not take topics into account, graph-based methods may suffer from the following two problems:",
        "1.",
        "Good keyphrases should be relevant to the major topics of the given document.",
        "In graph-based methods, the words that are strongly connected with other words tend to be ranked high, which do not necessarily guarantee they are relevant to major topics of the document.",
        "2.",
        "An appropriate set of keyphrases should also have a good coverage of the document's major topics.",
        "In graph-based methods, the extracted keyphrases may fall into a single topic of the document and fail to cover other substantial topics of the document.",
        "To address the problem, it is intuitive to consider the topics of words and document in random walk for keyphrase extraction.",
        "In this paper, we propose to decompose traditional PageRank into multiple PageRanks specific to various topics and obtain the importance scores of words under different topics.",
        "After that, with the help of the document topics, we can further extract keyphrases that are relevant to the document and at the same time have a good coverage of the document's major topics.",
        "We call the topic-decomposed PageRank as Topical PageRank (TPR).",

        "To run TPR on a word graph, we have to acquire topic distributions of words.",
        "There are roughly two approaches that can provide topics of words: (1) Use manually annotated knowledge bases, e.g., WordNet (Miller et al., 1990); (2) Use unsupervised machine learning techniques to obtain word topics from a large-scale document collection.",
        "Since the vocabulary in WordNet cannot cover many words in modern news and research articles, we employ the second approach to build topic interpreters for TPR.",
        "In machine learning, various methods have been proposed to infer latent topics of words and documents.",

        "Compared to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998) and probabilistic LSA (pLSA) (Hofmann, 1999), LDA has more feasibility for inference and can reduce the risk of over-fitting.",
        "In LDA, each word w of a document d is regarded to be generated by first sampling a topic z from d's topic distribution 6(d), and then sampling a word from the distribution over words 0(z) that characterizes topic z.",
        "In LDA, 6(d) and 0(z) are drawn from conjugate Dirichlet priors a and ß, separately.",
        "Therefore, 6 and 0 are integrated out and the probability of word w given document d and priors is represented as follows:",

        "pr(w|z) is thus not a good setting of preference values in TPR.",
        "In the contrast, pr(z| w) prefers those words that are focused on the given topic.",

        "We further select three baseline methods, i.e., TFIDF, PageRank and LDA, to compare with TPR.",
        "The TFIDF computes the ranking scores ofwords based on words' tfidf values in the document, namely R(w) = tfw x log(idfW).",
        "While in PageRank (i.e., TextRank), the ranking scores of words are obtained using Eq.(2).",
        "The two baselines do not use topic information of either words or documents.",
        "The LDA computes the ranking score for each word using the topical similarity between the word and the document.",
        "Given the topics of the document d and a word w, We have used various methods to compute similarity including cosine similarity, predictive likelihood and KL-divergence (Heinrich, 2005), among which cosine similarity performs the best on both datasets.",
        "Therefore, we only show the results of the LDA baseline calculated using cosine similarity.",
        "In Tables 4 and 5 we show the comparing results of the four methods on both NEWS and RESEARCH.",
        "Since the average number of manual-labeled keyphrases on NEWS is larger than RESEARCH, we set M = 10 for NEWS and M = 5 for RESEARCH.",

        "The improvements are all statistically significant tested with bootstrap re-sampling with 95% confidence.",
        "This indicates the robustness and effectiveness of TPR.",
        "Second, LDA performs equal or better than TFIDF and PageRank under precision/recall/F-measure.",
        "However, the performance of LDA under MRR is much worse than TFIDF and PageRank, which indicates LDA fails to correctly extract the first keyphrase earlier than other methods.",
        "The reason is: (1) LDA does not consider the local structure information of document as PageRank, and (2) LDA also does not consider the frequency information of words within the document.",
        "In the contrast, TPR enjoys the advantages of both LDA and TFIDF/PageRank, by using the external topic information like LDA and internal document structure like TFIDF/PageRank.",
        "Moreover, in Figures 3 and 4 we show the precision-recall relations of four methods on NEWS and RESEARCH.",
        "Each point on the precision-recall curve is evaluated on different numbers of extracted keyphrases M. The closer the curve to the upper right, the better the overall performance.",
        "The results again illustrate the superiority of TPR.",
        "At the end, in Table 6 we show an example of extracted keyphrases using TPR from a news article with title \"Arafat Says U.S.",
        "Threatening to Kill PLO Officials\" (The article number in DUC2001 is AP880510-0178).",
        "Here we only show the top 10 keyphrases, and the correctly extracted ones are marked with \"(+)\".",
        "We also mark the number of correctly extracted keyphrases after method name like \"(+7)\" after TPR.",
        "We also illustrate the top 3 topics of the document with their topic-specific keyphrases.",
        "It is obvious that the top topics, on \"Palestine\", \"Israel\" and \"terrorism\" separately, have a good coverage on the discussion objects of this article, which also demonstrate a good diversity with each other.",
        "By integrating these topic-specific keyphrases considering the proportions of these topics, we obtain the best performance of keyphrase extraction using TPR.",
        "In Table 7 we also show the extracted keyphrases of baselines from the same news article.",
        "For TFIDF, it only considered the frequency properties ofwords, and thus highly ranked the phrases with \"PLO\" which appeared about 16 times in this article, and failed to extract the keyphrases on topic \"Israel\".",
        "LDA only measured the importance of words using document topics without considering the frequency information of words and thus missed keyphrases with high-frequency words.",
        "For example, LDA failed to extract keyphrase \"political assassination\", in which the word \"assassination\" occurred 8 times in this article."
