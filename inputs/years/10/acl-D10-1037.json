        "As we can see from even these closely related applications, the content structure representation should be intimately tied to a specific text analysis task.",

        "Since these tasks are inherently tied to document structure, a content model is essential to performing them successfully.",

        "Patwardhan and Riloff (2007) take a similar approach in the context of information extraction.",
        "Rather than applying their extractor to all the sentences in a document, they limit it to eventrelevant sentences.",

        "While our method also incorporates contextual information into existing text analysis applications, our approach is markedly different from the above approaches.",
        "First, our representation of context encodes more than the relevance-based binary distinction considered in the past work.",
        "Our algorithm adjusts the content model dynamically for a given task rather than pre-specifying it.",
        "Second, while previous work is fully supervised, in our case relevance annotations are readily available for only a few applications and are prohibitively expensive to obtain for many others.",
        "To overcome this drawback, our method induces a content model in an unsupervised fashion and connects it via latent variables to the target model.",
        "This design not only eliminates the need for additional annotations, but also allows the algorithm to leverage large quantities of raw data for training the content model.",

        "M-Step We perform separate M-Steps for content and task parameters.",

        "An intuitive explanation of this process is that there are multiple CRF instances, one for each possible hidden topic T. Each utilizes different content features to explain the sentence sequence labeling.",
        "These instances are weighted according to the posterior over T obtained during the E-Step.",
        "While this objective is non-convex due to the summation over T, we can still optimize it using any gradient-based optimization solver; in our experiments, we used the LBFGS algorithm (Liu et al., 1989).",
