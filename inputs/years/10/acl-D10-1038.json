        "With the ever increasing popularity of emails and web technologies, it is very common for people to discuss issues, events, agendas or tasks by email.",
        "Effective processing of the email contents can be of great strategic value.",
        "In this paper, we study the problem of topic segmentation for emails, i.e., grouping the sentences of an email thread into a set of coherent topical clusters.",
        "Adapting the standard definition of topic (Galley et al., 2003) to conversations/emails, we consider a topic is something about which the participant(s) discuss or argue or express their opinions.",
        "For example, in the email thread shown in Figure 1, according to the majority of our annotators, participants discuss three topics (e.g., 'telecon cancellation', 'TAG document', and 'responding to I18N').",
        "Multiple topics seem to occur naturally in social interactions, whether synchronous (e.g., chats, meetings) or asynchronous (e.g., emails, blogs) conversations.",
        "In multi-party chat (Elsner and Charniak, 2008) report an average of 2.75 discussions active at a time.",
        "In our email corpus, we found an average of 2.5 topics per thread.",
        "Topic segmentation is often considered a prerequisite for other higher-level conversation analysis and applications of the extracted structure are broad, encompassing: summarization (Harabagiu and Lacatusu, 2005), information extraction and ordering (Allan, 2002), information retrieval (Dias et al., 2007), and intelligent user interfaces (Dredze et al., 2008).",
        "While extensive research has been conducted in topic segmentation for monologues (e.g., and synchronous dialogs (e.g., (Galley et al., 2003), (Hsueh et al., 2006)), none has studied the problem of segmenting asynchronous multi-party conversations (e.g., email).",
        "Therefore, there is no reliable annotation scheme, no standard corpus, and no agreed-upon metrics available.",
        "Also, it is our key hypothesis that, because of its asynchronous nature, and the use of quotation (Crystal, 2001), topics in an email thread often do not change in a sequential way.",
        "As a result, we do not expect models which have proved successful in monologue or dialog to be as effective when they are applied to email conversations.",
        "Our contributions in this paper aim to remedy these problems.",
        "First, we present an email corpus annotated with topics and evaluate annotator agreement.",
        "Second, we adopt a set of metrics to measure the local and global structural similarity between two annotations from the work on multi-party chat disentanglement (Elsner and Charniak, 2008).",
        "Third, we show how the two state-of-the-art topic segmentation methods (i.e., LCSeg and LDA) which are solely based on lexical information and make strong assumptions on the resulting topic models, can be effectively applied to emails, by having them to consider, in a principled way, a finer level structure of the underlying conversations.",
        "Experimental results show that both LCSeg and LDA benefit when they are extended to consider the conversational structure.",
        "When comparing the two methods, we found that LCSeg is better than LDA and this advantage is preserved when they are extended to incorporate conversational structure."

        "Three research areas are directly related to our study: a) text segmentation models, b) probabilistic topic models, and c) extracting and representing the conversation structure of emails.",
        "Topic segmentation has been extensively studied both for monologues and dialogs.",
        "(Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006) uses the minimum cut model to segment spoken lectures (i.e., monologue).",
        "They form a weighted undirected graph where the vertices represent sentences and the weighted links represent the similarity between sentences.",
        "Then the segmentation problem can be solved as a graph partitioning problem, where the assumption is that the sentences in a segment should be similar, while sentences in different segments should be dissimilar.",
        "They optimize the 'normalized cut' criterion to extract the segments.",
        "In general, the minimization of the normalized cut criterion is NP-complete.",
        "However, the linearity constraint on text segmentation for monologue allows them to find an exact solution in polynomial time.",
        "In our extension of LCSeg, we use a similar method to consolidate different segments; however, in our case the linearity constraint is absent.",
        "Therefore, we approximate the optimal solution by spectral clustering (Shi and Malik, 2000).",
        "Moving to the task of segmenting dialogs, (Galley et al., 2003) first proposed the lexical chain based unsupervised segmenter (LCSeg) and a supervised segmenter for segmenting meeting transcripts.",
        "Their supervised approach uses C4.5 and C4.5 rules binary classifiers with lexical and conversational features (e.g., cue phrase, overlap, speaker, silence, and lexical cohesion function).",
        "Their supervised approach performs significantly better than LCSeg.",
        "(Hsueh et al., 2006) follow the same approaches as (Galley et al., 2003) on both manual transcripts and ASR output of meetings.",
        "They perform segmentation at both coarse (topic) and fine (subtopic) levels.",
        "For the topic level, they achieve similar results as (Galley et al., 2003), with the supervised approach outperforming LCSeg.",
        "However, for the subtopic level, LCSeg performs significantly better than the supervised one.",
        "In our work, we show how LCSeg performs when applied to the temporal ordering of the emails in a thread.",
        "We also propose its extension to leverage the finer conversation structure of emails.",
        "The probabilistic generative topic models, such as LDA and its variants (e.g., (Blei et al., 2003), (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007)), have proven to be successful for topic segmentation in both monologue (e.g., (Chen et al., 2009)) and dialog (e.g., (Georgescul et al., 2008)).",
        "(Purver et al., 2006) uses a variant of LDA for the tasks of segmenting meeting transcripts and extracting the associated topic labels.",
        "However, their approach for segmentation does not perform better than LCSeg.",
        "In our work, we show how the general LDA performs when applied to email conversations and describe how it can be extended to exploit the conversation structure of emails.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed to capture an email conversation .",
        "Email programs (e.g., Gmail, Yahoomail) group emails into threads using headers.",
        "However, our annotations show that topics change at a finer level of granularity than emails.",
        "(Carenini et al., 2007) present a method to capture an email conversation at the finer level by analyzing the embedded quotations in emails.",
        "A fragment quotation graph (FQG) is generated, which is shown to be beneficial for email summarization.",
        "In this paper, we show that topic segmentation models can also benefit significantly from this fine conversation structure of email threads."

        "There are no publicly available email corpora annotated with topics.",
        "Therefore, the first step was to develop our own corpus.",
        "We have annotated the BC3 email corpus (Ulrich et al., 2008) with topics.",
        "The BC3 corpus, previously annotated with sentence level speech acts, meta sentence, subjectivity, extractive and abstractive summaries, is one of a growing number of corpora being used for email research.",
        "The corpus contains 40 email threads from the W3C corpus.",
        "It has 3222 sentences and an average of 5 emails per thread.",
        "Topic segmentation in general is a nontrivial and subjective task (Hsueh et al., 2006).",
        "The conversation phenomenon called 'Schism' makes it even more challenging for conversations.",
        "In schism a new conversation takes birth from an existing one, not necessarily because of a topic shift but because some participants refocus their attention onto each other, and away from whoever held the floor in the parent conversation and the annotators can disagree on the birth of a new topic (Aoki et al., 2006).",
        "In the example email thread shown in Figure 1, a schism takes place when people discuss about 'responding to I18N'.",
        "All the annotators do not agree on the fact that the topic about 'responding to I18N' swerves from the one about 'TAG document'.",
        "The annotators can disagree on the number of topics (i.e., some are specific and some are general), and on the topic assignment of the sentences.",
        "To properly design an effective annotation manual and procedure we performed a two-phase pilot study before carrying out the actual annotation.",
        "For the pilot study we picked five email threads randomly from the corpus.",
        "In the first phase of the pilot study we selected five university graduate students to do the annotation.",
        "We then revised our instruction manual based on their feedback and the source of disagreement found.",
        "In the second phase we tested with a university postdoc doing the annotation.",
        "For the actual annotation we selected three computer science graduates who are also native speakers of English.",
        "They annotated 39 threads of the BC3 corpus.",
        "On an average they took seven hours to annotate the whole dataset.",
        "BC3 contains three human written abstract summaries for each email thread.",
        "With each email thread the annotators were also given an associated human written summary to give a brief overview of the corresponding conversation.",
        "The task of finding topics was carried out in two phases.",
        "In the first phase, the annotators read the conversation and the associated summary and list the topics discussed.",
        "They specify the topics by a short description (e.g., \"meeting agenda\", \"location and schedule\") which provides a high-level overview of the topic.",
        "The target number of topics and the topic labels were not given in advance and they were instructed to find as many topics as needed to convey the overall content structure of the conversation.",
        "In the second phase the annotators identify the most appropriate topic for each sentence.",
        "However, if a sentence covers more than one topic, they were asked to label it with all the relevant topics according to their order of relevance.",
        "If they find any sentence that does not fit into any topic, they are told to label those as the predefined topic 'OFF-TOPIC'.",
        "Wherever appropriate they were also asked to make use of two other predefined topics: 'INTRO' and 'END'.",
        "INTRO (e.g., 'hi', 'hello') signifies the section (usually at the beginning) of an email that people use to begin their email.",
        "Likewise, END (e.g., 'Cheers', 'Best') signifies the section (usually at the end) that people use to end their email.",
        "The annotators carried out the task on paper.",
        "We created the hierarchical thread view ('reply to' relation) using 'TAB's (indentation) and each participant's name is printed in a different color as in Gmail.",
        "average we have 26.3 sentences and 2.5 topics per thread.",
        "A topic contains an average of 12.6 sentences.",
        "The average number of topics active at a time is 1.4.",
        "The average entropy is 0.94 and corresponds (as described in detail in the next section) to the granularity of the annotation.",
        "These statistics (number of topics and topic density) indicate that the dataset is suitable for topic segmentation.",
        "In this section we describe the metrics used to compare different human annotations and system's output.",
        "As different annotations (or system's output) can group sentences in different number of clusters, metrics widely used in classification, such as the k statistic, are not applicable.",
        "Again, our problem of topic segmentation for emails is not sequential in nature.",
        "Therefore, the standard metrics widely used in sequential topic segmentation for monologues and dialogs, such as Pk and WindowDif f (WD), are also not applicable.",
        "We adopt the more appropriate metrics 1-to-1, lock and m-to-1, introduced recently by (Elsner and Charniak, 2008).",
        "The 1-to-1 metric measures the global similarity between two annotations.",
        "It pairs up the clusters from the two annotations in a way that maximizes (globally) the total overlap and then reports the percentage ofover-lap.",
        "lock measures the local agreement within a con-",
        "TRO' and 'END'.",
        "In all our computation (i.e., statistics, agreement, system's input) we excluded the sentences marked as either 'INTRO' or 'END'",
        "text of k sentences.",
        "To compute the loc3 metric for the m-th sentence in the two annotations, we consider the previous 3 sentences: m-1, m-2 and m-3, and mark them as either 'same' or 'different' depending on their topic assignment.",
        "The loc3 score between two annotations is the mean agreement on these 'same' or 'different' judgments, averaged over all sentences.",
        "We report the agreement found in 1-to-1 and lock in Table 2.",
        "In both of the metrics we get high agreement, though the local agreement (average of 83%) is little higher than the global agreement (average of 80%).",
        "If we consider the topic of a randomly picked sentence as a random variable then its entropy measures the level of detail in an annotation.",
        "If the topics are evenly distributed then the uncertainty (i.e., entropy) is higher.",
        "It also increases with the increase of the number of topics.",
        "Therefore, it is a measure of how specific an annotator is and in our dataset it varies from 0 to 2.7.",
        "To measure how much the annotators agree on the general structure we use the m-to-1 metric.",
        "It maps each of the source clusters to the single target cluster with which it gets the highest overlap, then computes the total percentage of overlap.",
        "This metric is asymmetrical and not a measure to be optimized, but it gives us some intuition about specificity (Elsner and Charniak, 2008).",
        "If one annotator divides a cluster into two clusters then, the m-to-1 metric from fine to coarse is 1.",
        "In our corpus by mapping from fine to coarse we get an m-to-1 average of 0.949."

        "In this section, at first we describe how the existing models of topic segmentation can be applied to emails.",
        "We then point out where these methods fail and propose extensions of these basic models for email conversations.",
        "Our first model is the probabilistic LDA model (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).",

        "Where T is the number of topics.",
        "P(wi|zi = j) is the probability of word wi under topic j and P(Zi = j) is the probability that jth topic was sampled for the ith word token.",
        "We refer the multinomial distributions (/>(j) = P(w|zi = j) and 9(d) = P(z) as topic-word distribution and document-topic distribution respectively.",
        "(Blei et al., 2003) refined this basic model by placing a Dirichlet (a) prior on 9.",
        "(Griffiths and Steyvers, 2003) further refined it by placing a Dirichlet (ß) prior on 0.",
        "The inference problem is to find 0 and 9 given a document set.",
        "Variational EM has been applied to estimate these two parameters directly.",
        "Instead of estimating 0 and 9, one can also directly estimate the posterior distribution over z = P(zi = j |wi) (topic assignments for words).",
        "One efficient estimation technique uses Gibbs sampling to estimate this distribution.",
        "This framework can be directly applied to an email thread by considering each email as a document.",
        "Using LDA we get z = P (zi = j |wi) (i.e., topic assignments for words).",
        "By assuming the words in a sentence occur independently we can estimate the topic assignments for sentences as follows:",
        "where, skis the kth sentence for which we can assign the topic by: j * = argmaxj P (zi = j |sk ).",
        "Our second model is the lexical chain based segmenter LCSeg, (Galley et al., 2003).",
        "LCSeg assumes that topic shifts are likely to occur where strong term repetitions start and end.",
        "LCSeg at first computes 'lexical chains' for each non-stop word based on word repetitions.",
        "It then ranks the chains according to two measures: 'number of words in the chain' and 'compactness of the chain'.",
        "The more compact (in terms of number of sentences) and the more populated chains get higher scores.",
        "The algorithm then works with two adjacent analysis windows, each of a fixed size k which is empirically determined.",
        "For each sentence boundary, LCSeg computes the cosine similarity (or lexical cohesion function) at the transition between the two windows.",
        "Low similarity indicates low lexical cohesion, and a sharp change signals a high probability of an actual topic boundary.",
        "This method is similar to TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) except that the similarity is computed based on the scores of the 'lexical chains' instead of 'term counts'.",
        "In order to apply LCSeg on email threads we arrange the emails based on their temporal relation (i.e., arrival time) and apply the LCSeg algorithm to get the topic boundaries.",

        "Each different color/font indicates a different topic.",
        "Right most column specifies the fragments (sec 4.4).",
        "The main limitation of the two models discussed above is that they take the bag-of-words (BOW) assumption without considering the fact that an email thread is a multi-party, asynchronous conversation.",
        "The only information relevant to LDA is term frequency.",
        "LCSeg considers both term frequency and how closely the terms occur in a document.",
        "These models do not consider the word order, syntax and semantics.",
        "However, several improvements of LDA over the BOW approach have been proposed.",
        "(Wallach, 2006) extends the model beyond BOW by considering n-gram sequences.",
        "(Griffiths et al., 2005) presents an extension of the topic model that is sensitive to word-order and automatically learns the syntactic as well as semantic factors that guide word choice.",
        "(Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2010) describes another extension to consider syntax of the text.",
        "As described earlier, one can also incorporate lexical semantics (i.e., synonym, hyper-nym, hyponym) into the LCSeg model.",
        "However, we argue that these models are still inadequate for finding topics in emails especially when topics are closely related (e.g., 'extending the meeting' and 'scheduling the meeting') and distributional variations are subtle.",
        "To better identify the topics in an email thread we need to consider the email specific conversation features (e.g., reply-to relation, usage of quotations).",
        "As can be seen in the example (Figure 1), people often use quotations to talk about the same topic.",
        "In fact in our corpus we found an average quotation usage of 6.44 per thread.",
        "Therefore, we need to leverage this useful information in a principled way to get the best out of our models.",
        "Specifically, we need to capture the conversation structure at the fragment (quotation) level and to incorporate this structure into our models.",
        "In the next section, we describe how one can capture the conversation structure at the fragment level in the form of Fragment Quotation Graph (henceforth, FQG).",
        "In Section 4.5 and 4.6 respectively, we show how the LDA and LCSeg models can be extended so that they take this conversation structure into account for topic segmentation.",

        "For convenience we do not show the real content but abbreviate them as a sequence of fragments.",
        "In the first pass by processing the whole thread we identify the new (i.e., quotation depth 0) and quoted (i.e., quotation depth > 0) fragments based on the usage of quotation (>) marks.",
        "For instance, email E3 contains two new fragments (f,g), and two quoted fragments (d, e) of depth 1.",
        "E2 contains abc and de.",
        "Then in the second step, we compare the fragments with each other and based on the overlap we find the distinct fragments.",
        "If necessary we split the fragments in this step.",
        "For example, de in E2 is divided into d and e distinct fragments when compared with the fragments of E3.",
        "This process gives 15 distinct fragments which constitute the vertices of the FQG.",
        "In the third step, we compute the edges, which represent referential relations between fragments.",
        "For simplicity we assume that any new fragment is a potential reply to its neighboring quoted fragments.",
        "For example, for the fragments of E4 we create two edges from h ((h,a),(h,b)) and one edge from i ((i,b)).",
        "We then remove the redundant edges.",
        "In E6 we found the edges (n,h), (n,a) and (n,m).",
        "As (h,a) is already there we exclude (n,a).",
        "The FQG with all the redundant edges removed is shown at the right in Figure 2.",
        "If an email does not contain quotes then the fragments of that email are connected to the fragments of the source email to which it replies.",
        "The advantage of the FQG is that it captures the conversation at finer granularity level in contrast to the structure found by the 'reply-to' relation at the email level, which would be merely a sequence from",
        "E1 to E7 in this example.",
        "Another advantage of this structure is that it allows us to find the 'hidden fragments'.",
        "Hidden fragments are quoted fragments (shaded fragment m in fig 2 which corresponds to the fragment made bold in fig 1), whose original email is missing in the user's inbox.",
        "(Carenini et al., 2007) study this phenomenon and its impact on email summarization in detail.",
        "The main advantage of the probabilistic (Bayesian) models is that they allow us to incorporate multiple knowledge sources in a coherent way in the form of priors (or regularizer).",
        "We want to regularize LDA in a way that will force two sentences in the same or adjacent fragments to fall in the same topical cluster.",
        "The first step forwards this aim is to regularize the topic-word distribution with a word network such that two connected words get similar topic distributions.",
        "Then we can easily extend it to fragments.",
        "In this section, at first we describe how one can regularize the LDA model with a word network, then we extend this by regularizing LDA with FQG.",
        "Assume we are given a word network as an undirected graph with nodes (V ) representing the words and the edges (E) representing the links between words.",
        "We want to regularize the LDA model such that two connected words u, v have similar topic-word distributions (i.e., k for j = 1... T).",
        "Note that the standard conjugate Dirichlet prior on 0 is limited in that all words share a common variance parameter, and are mutually independent except normalization constraint (Minka, 1999).",
        "Therefore it does not allow us to encode this knowledge.",
        "Very recently, (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) shows how to encode 'must-link' and 'cannot-link' (between words) into the LDA model by using a Dirich-let Forest prior.",
        "We reimplemented this model; however, we only use its capability of encoding 'must-links'.",
        "Therefore, we just illustrate how to encode 'must-links' here.",
        "Interested readers can see (An-drzejewski et al., 2009) for the method of encoding 'cannot-links'.",
        "Must links such as (a, b), (b, c), or (x, y) in Figure 3(A) can be encoded into the LDA model by using a Dirichlet Tree (henceforth, DT) prior.",
        "Like the traditional Dirichlet, DT is also a conjugate to the multinomial but under a different parameterization.",
        "Instead of representing a multinomial sample as the outcome of a K-sided die, in this representation we represent a sample as the outcome of a finite stochastic process.",
        "The probability of a leaf is the product of branch probabilities leading to that leaf.",
        "The words constitute the leaves of the tree.",
        "DT distribution is the distribution over leaf probabilities.",
        "Let uon be the DT edge weight leading into node n, C(n) be the children of node n, L be the leaves of the tree, I the internal nodes, and L(n) be the leaves in the subtree under n. We generate a sample 0k from Dirichlet_Tree(Q) by drawing a multinomial at each internal node i G I from Dirichlet(wC'(i)) (i.e., the edge weights from i to its children).",
        "The probability density function of DT(0k |Q) is given by:",
        "Here A(i) = wi – Zjec^) wj (i.e., the difference between the in-degree and out-degree of internal node i.",
        "Note that if A(i) = 0 for all i G I, then the DT reduces to the typical Dirichlet distribution.",
        "Suppose we have the following (Figure 3(A)) word network.",
        "The network can be decomposed into a collection of chains (e.g., (a,b,c), (p), and (x,y)).",
        "For each chain having number of elements more than one (e.g., (a,b,c), (x,y)), we have a subtree (see Figure 3(B)) in the DT with one internal node (blank in figure) and the words as leaves.",
        "We assign Aß as the weights of these edges where A is the regularization strength and ß is the hyperparameter of the symmetric Dirichlet prior on 0.",
        "The root node of the Dirichlet tree then connects to the internal node i with weight |L(i)|ß.",
        "The other nodes (words) which form single element chains (e.g, (p)) are connected to the root directly with weight ß.",
        "Notice that when A = 1 (i.e., no regularization), A(i) = 0 and our model reduces to the original LDA.",
        "By tuning A we control the strength of regularization.",
        "To regularize LDA with FQG, we form the word network where a word is connected to the words in the same or adjacent fragments.",
        "Specifically, if word wi G f ragx and word wj G f ragy (wi = wj), we create a link (wi, wj) if x = y or (x, y) G E, where E is the set of edges of the FQG.",
        "Implicitly by doing this we want two sentences in the same or adjacent fragments to have similar topic distributions, and fall in the same topical cluster.",
        "If we examine the FQG carefully, different paths (considering the fragments of the first email as root nodes) can be interpreted as subconversations.",
        "As we walk down a path topic shifts may occur along the pathway.",
        "We incorporate FQG into the LCSeg model in three steps.",
        "First, we extract the paths of a FQG.",
        "We then apply LCSeg algorithm on each of the extracted paths separately.",
        "This process gives the segmentation decisions along the paths of the FQG.",
        "Note that a fragment can be in multiple paths (e.g., f, g, in Figure 2) which will cause its sentences to be in multiple segments found by LCSeg.",
        "Therefore, as a final step we need a consolidation method.",
        "Our intuition is that sentences in a consolidated segment should fall in same segments more often when we apply LCSeg in step 2.",
        "To consolidate the segments found, we form a weighted undirected graph where the vertices V represent the sentences and the edge weights w(u, v) represent the number of times sentence u and v fall in the same segment.",
        "The consolidation problem can be formulated as a N-mincut graph partitioning problem where we try to optimize the Normalized Cut criterion:",
        "where cut(A, B) = Y,ueA,veBw(u, v) and assoc(A, V) = SueA,tevw(u, t) is the total connection from nodes in partition A to all nodes in the graph and assoc(B, V) is similarly defined.",
        "However, solving this problem turns out to be NP-hard.",
        "Hence, we approximate the solution following (Shi and Malik, 2000) which has been successfully applied to image segmentation in computer vision.",
        "This approach makes a difference only if FGQ contains more than one path.",
        "In fact in our corpus we found an average paths of 7.",

        "In the local agreement it even fails to beat the baselines.",
        "A likely explanation is that the independence assumption made by LDA when computing the distribution over topics for a sentence from the distribution over topics for the words causes sentences in a local context to be excessively distributed over topics.",
        "Another possible explanation for LDA's disappointing performance is the limited amount of data available for training.",

        "Another reason could be the term weighting scheme employed by LCSeg.",
