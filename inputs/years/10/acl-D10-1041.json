        "For resource-limited language pairs, coverage of the test set by the parallel corpus is an important factor that affects translation quality in two respects: 1) out of vocabulary words; 2) the same information in an input sentence can be expressed in different ways, while current phrase-based SMT systems cannot automatically select an alternative way to transfer the same information.",

        "In recent years, statistical MT systems have been easy to develop due to the rapid explosion in data availability, especially parallel data.",
        "However, in reality there are still many language pairs which lack parallel data, such as Urdu-English, Chinese-Italian, where large amounts of speakers exist for both languages; of course, the problem is far worse for pairs such as Catalan-Irish.",
        "For such resource-limited language pairs, sparse amounts of parallel data would cause the word alignment to be inaccurate, which would in turn lead to an inaccurate phrase alignment, and bad translations would result.",
        "Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) argue that limited amounts of parallel training data can lead to the problem of low coverage in that many phrases encountered at runtime are not observed in the training data and so their translations will not be learned.",
        "Thus, in recent years, research on addressing the problem of unknown words or phrases has become more and more evident for resource-limited language pairs.",
        "Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) proposed a novel method which substitutes a paraphrase for an unknown source word or phrase in the input sentence, and then proceeds to use the translation of that paraphrase in the production of the target-language result.",
        "Their experiments showed that by translating paraphrases a marked improvement was achieved in coverage and translation quality, especially in the case of unknown words which previously had been left untranslated.",
        "However, on a large-scale data set, they did not achieve improvements in terms of automatic evaluation.",
        "Nakov (2008) proposed another way to use paraphrases in SMT.",
        "He generates nearly-equivalent syntactic paraphrases of the source-side training sentences, then pairs each paraphrased sentence with the target translation associated with the original sentence in the training data.",
        "Essentially, this method generates new training data using paraphrases to train a new model and obtain more useful phrase pairs.",
        "However, he reported that this method results in bad system performance.",
        "By contrast, real improvements can be achieved by merging the phrase tables of the paraphrase model and the original model, giving priority to the latter.",
        "Schroeder et al.",
        "(2009) presented the use of word lattices for multi-source translation, in which the multiple source input texts are compiled into a compact lattice, over which a single decoding pass is then performed.",
        "This lattice-based method achieved positive results across all data conditions.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel method using paraphrases to facilitate translation, especially for resource-limited languages.",
        "Our method does not distinguish unknown words in the input sentence, but uses paraphrases of all possible words and phrases in the source input sentence to build a source-side lattice to provide a diverse and flexible list of source-side candidates to the SMT decoder so that it can search for a best path and deliver the translation with the highest probability.",
        "In this case, we neither need to change the phrase table, nor add new features in the log-linear model, nor add new sentences in the training data.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we define the \"translation difficulty\" from the perspective of the source side, and then examine how well the test set is covered by the phrase table and the parallel training data .",
        "Section 3 describes our paraphrase lattice method and discusses how to set the weights for the edges in the lattice network.",
        "In Section 4, we report comparative experiments conducted on small, medium and large-scale English-to-Chinese data sets.",
        "In Section 5, we analyse the influence of our paraphrase lattice method.",
        "Section 6 concludes and gives avenues for future work.",
        "2 What Makes Translation Difficult?",
        "2.1 Translation Difficulty",
        "We use the term \"translation difficulty\" to explain how difficult it is to translate the source-side sentence in three respects:",
        "• The OOV rates of the source sentences in the test set (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "• Translatability of a known phrase in the input",
        "sentence.",
        "Some particular grammatical structures on the source side cannot be directly translated into the corresponding structures on the target side.",
        "Nakov (2008) presents an example showing how hard it is to translate an English construction into Spanish.",
        "Assume that an English-to-Spanish SMT system has an entry in its phrase table for \"inequality of income\", but not for \"income inequality\".",
        "He argues that the latter phrase is hard to translate into Spanish where noun compounds are rare: the correct translation in this case requires a suitable Spanish preposition and a reordering, which are hard for the system to realize properly in the target language (Nakov, 2008).",
        "• Consistency between the reference and the target-side sentence in the training corpus.",
        "Nakov (2008) points out that if the target-side sentence in the parallel corpus is inconsistent with the reference of the test set, then in some cases, a test sentence might contain pieces that are equivalent, but syntactically different from the phrases learned in training, which might result in practice in a missed opportunity for a high-quality translation.",
        "In this case, if we use paraphrases for these pieces of text, then we might improve the opportunity for the translation to approach the reference, especially in the case where only one reference is available.",
        "As to the first aspect - coverage - we argue that the coverage rate of the new words or unknown words are more and more becoming a \"bottleneck\" for resource-limited languages.",
        "Furthermore, current SMT systems, either phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005) or syntax-based (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), use phrases as the fundamental translation unit, so how much the phrase table and training data can cover the test set is an important factor which influences the translation quality.",
        "Table 1 shows the statistics of the coverage of the test set on English-to-Chinese FBIS data, where we can see that the coverage of unigrams is very high, especially when the data is increased to the medium size (200K), where unigram coverage is greater than 90%.",
        "Based on the observations of the unknown un-",
        "Table 1: The coverage of the test set by the phrase table and the parallel corpus based on different amount of the training data.",
        "\"PL\" indicates the Phrase Length N, where {1 <= N <= 10}; \"20K\" and \"200K\" represent the sizes of the parallel data for model training and phrase extraction; \"Cov.\"",
        "indicates the coverage rate; \"Tset\" represents the number of unique phrases with the length N in the Test Set; \"PT\" represents the number of phrases of the Test Set occur in the Phrase Table; \"Corpus\" indicates the number of phrases of the Test Set appearing in the parallel corpus; \"in PT\" indicates the coverage of the phrases in the Test Set by the phrase table and correspondingly \"in Corpus\" represents the coverage of the phrases in the Test Set by the Parallel Corpus.",
        "igrams, we found that most are named entities (NEs) such as person name, location name, etc.",
        "From the bigram phrases, the coverage rates begin to significantly decline.",
        "It can also be seen that phrases containing more than 5 words rarely appear either in the phrase table or in the parallel corpus, which indicates that data sparseness is severe for long phrases.",
        "Even if the size of the corpus is significantly increased (e.g. from 20K to 200K), the coverage of long phrases is still quite low.",
        "With respect to these three aspects of the translation difficulty, especially for data-limited language pairs, we propose a more effective method to make use of the paraphrases to facilitate translation process."
