        "Recently syntax-based methods have achieved very promising results and attracted increasing interests in statistical machine translation (SMT) research community due to their ability to provide informative context structure information and convenience in carrying out word transformation and sub-span reordering.",
        "Fundamentally, syntax-based SMT views translation as a structural transformation process.",
        "Generally speaking, from modeling viewpoint, a syntax-based model tries to convert the source structures into target structures iteratively and recursively while from decoding viewpoint a syntax-based system segments an input tree/forest into many sub-fragments, translates each of them separately, combines the translated sub-fragments and then finds out the best combinations.",
        "Therefore, from bilingual viewpoint, we face two fundamental problems: the mapping between bilingual structures and the way of carrying out the target structures combination.",
        "For the first issue, a number of models have been proposed to model the structure mapping between tree and string (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Yamada and Knight, 2001; DeNeefe and Knight, 2009) and between tree and tree (Eisner, 2003; Zhang et al., 2007 & 2008; Liu et al., 2009).",
        "However, one of the major challenges is that all the current models only allow one-to-one mapping from one source frontier non-terminal node (Galley et al., 2004) to one target frontier non-terminal node in a bilingual translation rule.",
        "Therefore, all those translation equivalents with one-to-many frontier non-terminal node mapping cannot be covered by the current state-of-the-art models.",
        "This may largely compromise the modeling ability of translation rules.",
        "For the second problem, currently, the combination is driven by only the source side (both tree-to-string model and tree-to-tree model only check the source span compatibility when combining different target structures in decoding) or only the target side (string to tree model).",
        "There is no well study in considering both the source side information and the compatibility between different target syntactic structures during combination.",
        "In addition, it is well known that the traditional tree-to-tree models suffer heavily from the data sparseness issue in training and the spurious-ambiguity translation path issue (the same translation with different syntactic structures) in decoding.",
        "In addition, because of the performance limitation of automatic syntactic parser, researchers propose using packed forest (Tomita, 1987; Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang, 2008) instead of 1-best parse tree to carry out training (Mi and Huang, 2008) and decoding (Mi et al., 2008) in order to reduce the side effect caused by parsing errors of the one-best tree.",
        "However, when we apply the tree-to-tree model to the bilingual forest structures, both training and decoding become very complicated.",
        "In this paper, to address the first issue, we propose a framework to model the non-isomorphic translation process from source tree fragment to target tree sequence, allowing any one source frontier non-terminal node to be translated into any number of target frontier non-terminal nodes.",
        "For the second issue, we propose a technology to model the combination task by considering both sides' syntactic structure information.",
        "We evaluate and integrate the two technologies into forest-based tree to tree sequence translation.",
        "Experimental results on the NIST-2003 and NIST-2005 Chinese-English translation tasks show that our methods significantly outperform the forest-based tree to string and previous tree to tree models as well as the phrase-based model.",
        "The remaining of the paper is organized as following.",
        "Section 2 reviews the related work.",
        "In section 3 and section 4, we discuss the proposed forest-based rule extraction (non-isomorphic mapping) and decoding algorithms (target syntax information usage).",

        "One common limitation of the above works is they only allow the one-to-one mapping between each non-terminal frontier node, and thus they suffer from the issue of rule coverage.",
        "On the other hand, due to the data sparseness issue and model coverage issue, previous tree-to-tree (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009) decoder has to rely solely on the span information or source side information to combine the target syntactic structures, without checking the compatibility of the merging nodes, in order not to fail many translation paths.",
        "Thus, this solution fails to effectively utilize the target structure information.",
        "To address this issue, tree sequence (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) and virtual node (Zhang et al., 2009a) are two concepts with promising results reported.",
        "In this paper, with the help of these two concepts, we propose a novel framework to solve the one-to-many non-isomorphic mapping issue.",
        "In addition, our proposed solution of using target syntax information enables our forest-based tree-to-tree sequence translation decoding algorithm to not only capture bilingual forest information but also have almost the same complexity as forest-based tree-to-string translation.",

        "As shown in Fig. 11, the left part is the derivation path formed by a coarse hyper-edge, consisting the newly-generated sub-tree \"X =>X X X\" connecting with three previously-generated sub paths while the right part is the derivation forest formed by newly-generated finer hyper-edges rooted at \"VP\" and \"S\", and previously-generated sub-forests.",
        "In this paper, we use the sum of probabilities of all the derivation paths in the finer forest to measure the quality of the candidate translation suggested by the hypothesis.",
        "From Fig. 11, we can see there may be more than one corresponding finer forests, it is easy to understand that the sum of all the trees' probabilities in these finer forests is equal to the sum of the inside probability of all these root nodes of these finer forests.",
        "We adopt the dynamic programming to compute the probability of the finer forest: whenever we generate a new hypothesis by concatenating a coarse hyper-edge and its sub-path, we find its corresponding finer hyper-edges and sub-forests, do the combination and accumulate probabilities from bottom to up.",
        "For the coarse hyper-edge, because there is only one label \"X\", any sub-path could be easily concatenated with upper structure covering the same sub-span without the need of checking label compatibility.",
        "While for the finer hyper-edges, we only link the root nodes of sub-forests to upper hyper-edges with the same linking node label.",
        "This is to guarantee syntactic goodness.",
        "In case there are some leaf nodes of the upper hyper-edges fail to find corresponding sub-forest roots with the same label (e.g. the \"NP\" in red color in the rightmost of Fig 11), we simply link it into the nodes with the least inside probability (among these sub-forests), and at the same time give a penalty score to this combination.",
        "If some root nodes of some sub-forest still cannot find upper leaf nodes to concatenate (e.g. the \"CP\" in red color in Fig. 11), we simply ignore them.",
        "After the combination process, it is straightforward to accumulate the inside probability dynamically from bottom up."
