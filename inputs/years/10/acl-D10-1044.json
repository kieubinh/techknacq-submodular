        "Domain adaptation is a common concern when optimizing empirical NLP applications.",
        "Even when there is training data available in the domain of interest, there is often additional data from other domains that could in principle be used to improve performance.",
        "Realizing gains in practice can be challenging, however, particularly when the target domain is distant from the background data.",
        "For developers of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, an additional complication is the heterogeneous nature of SMT components (word-alignment model, language model, translation model, etc.",
        "), which precludes a single universal approach to adaptation.",
        "In this paper we study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material – though adequate for reasonable performance – is also available.",
        "This is a standard adaptation problem for SMT.",
        "It is difficult when IN and OUT are dissimilar, as they are in the cases we study.",
        "For simplicity, we assume that OUT is homogeneous.",
        "The techniques we develop can be extended in a relatively straightforward manner to the more general case when OUT consists of multiple sub-domains.",
        "There is a fairly large body of work on SMT adaptation.",
        "We introduce several new ideas.",
        "First, we aim to explicitly characterize examples from OUT as belonging to general language or not.",
        "Previous approaches have tried to find examples that are similar to the target domain.",
        "This is less effective in our setting, where IN and OUT are disparate.",
        "The idea of distinguishing between general and domain-specific examples is due to Daumé and Marcu (2006), who used a maximum-entropy model with latent variables to capture the degree of specificity.",
        "Daumé (2007) applies a related idea in a simpler way, by splitting features into general and domain-specific versions.",
        "This highly effective approach is not directly applicable to the multinomial models used for core SMT components, which have no natural method for combining split features, so we rely on an instance-weighting approach (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) to downweight domain-specific examples in OUT.",
        "Within this framework, we use features intended to capture degree of generality, including the output from an SVM classifier that uses the intersection between IN and OUT as positive examples.",
        "Our second contribution is to apply instance",

        "weighting at the level of phrase pairs.",
        "Sentence pairs are the natural instances for SMT, but sentences often contain a mix of domain-specific and general language.",
        "For instance, the sentence Similar improvements in haemoglobin levels were reported in the scientific literature for other epoetins would likely be considered domain-specific despite the presence of general phrases like were reported in.",
        "Phrase-level granularity distinguishes our work from previous work by Matsoukas et al. (2009), who weight sentences according to sub-corpus and genre membership.",
        "Finally, we make some improvements to baseline approaches.",
        "We train linear mixture models for conditional phrase pair probabilities over IN and OUT so as to maximize the likelihood of an empirical joint phrase-pair distribution extracted from a development set.",
        "This is a simple and effective alternative to setting weights discriminatively to maximize a metric such as BLEU.",
        "A similar maximum-likelihood approach was used by Foster and Kuhn (2007), but for language models only.",
        "For comparison to information-retrieval inspired baselines, eg (Lu et al., 2007), we select sentences from OUT using language model perplexities from IN.",
        "This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries, then pooling the match results.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",

        "Standard SMT systems have a hierarchical parameter structure: top-level log-linear weights are used to combine a small set of complex features, interpreted as log probabilities, many of which have their own internal parameters and objectives.",
        "The toplevel weights are trained to maximize a metric such as BLEU on a small development set of approximately 1000 sentence pairs.",
        "Thus, provided at least this amount of IN data is available – as it is in our setting – adapting these weights is straightforward.",
        "We focus here instead on adapting the two most important features: the language model (LM), which estimates the probability p(w\\h) of a target word w following an ngram h; and the translation models (TM) p(s\\t) and p(t\\s), which give the probability of source phrase s translating to target phrase t, and vice versa.",
        "We do not adapt the alignment procedure for generating the phrase table from which the TM distributions are derived.",
        "The natural baseline approach is to concatenate data from IN and OUT.",
        "Its success depends on the two domains being relatively close, and on the OUT corpus not being so large as to overwhelm the contribution of IN.",
        "When OUT is large and distinct, its contribution can be controlled by training separate IN and OUT models, and weighting their combination.",
        "An easy way to achieve this is to put the domain-specific LMs and TMs into the top-level log-linear model and learn optimal weights with MERT (Och, 2003).",
        "This has the potential drawback of increasing the number of features, which can make MERT less stable (Foster and Kuhn, 2009).",
        "Apart from MERT difficulties, a conceptual problem with log-linear combination is that it multiplies feature probabilities, essentially forcing different features to agree on high-scoring candidates.",
        "This is appropriate in cases where it is sanctioned by Bayes' law, such as multiplying LM and TM probabilities, but for adaptation a more suitable framework is often a mixture model in which each event may be generated from some domain.",
        "This leads to a linear combination of domain-specific probabilities, with weights in [0,1], normalized to sum to 1.",
        "Linear weights are difficult to incorporate into the standard MERT procedure because they are \"hidden\" within a top-level probability that represents the linear combination.",
        "Following previous work (Foster and Kuhn, 2007), we circumvent this problem by choosing weights to optimize corpus log-likelihood, which is roughly speaking the training criterion used by the LM and TM themselves.",
        "For the LM, adaptive weights are set as follows:",
        "where a is a weight vector containing an element aifor each domain (just IN and OUT in our case), piare the corresponding domain-specific models, and p(w, h) is an empirical distribution from a target-language training corpus – we used the IN dev set for this.",
        "It is not immediately obvious how to formulate an equivalent to equation (1) for an adapted TM, because there is no well-defined objective for learning TMs from parallel corpora.",
        "This has led previous workers to adopt ad hoc linear weighting schemes (Finch and Sumita, 2008; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Lu et al., 2007).",
        "However, we note that the final conditional estimates p(s\\t) from a given phrase table maximize the likelihood of joint empirical phrase pair counts over a word-aligned corpus.",
        "This suggests a direct parallel to (1):",
        "where p(s, t) is a joint empirical distribution extracted from the IN dev set using the standard procedure.",
        "An alternative form of linear combination is a maximum a posteriori (MAP) combination (Bacchi-ani et al., 2004).",
        "For the TM, this is:",
        "where cI(s,t) is the count in the IN phrase table of pair (s, t), po(s\\t) is its probability under the OUT TM, and cI(t) = J2s, cI(s',t).",
        "This is motivated by taking ßpo(s\\t) to be the parameters of a Dirich-let prior on phrase probabilities, then maximizing posterior estimates p(s\\t) given the IN corpus.",
        "Intuitively, it places more weight on OUT when less evidence from IN is available.",
        "To set ß, we used the same criterion as for à, over a dev corpus:",
        "ß = argmax",
        "The MAP combination was used for TM probabilities only, in part due to a technical difficulty in formulating coherent counts when using standard LM smoothing techniques (Kneser and Ney, 1995).",
        "Motivated by information retrieval, a number of approaches choose \"relevant\" sentence pairs from OUT by matching individual source sentences from IN (Hildebrand et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2007), or individual target hypotheses (Zhao et al., 2004).",
        "The matching sentence pairs are then added to the IN corpus, and the system is re-trained.",
        "Although matching is done at the sentence level, this information is subsequently discarded when all matches are pooled.",
        "To approximate these baselines, we implemented a very simple sentence selection algorithm in which parallel sentence pairs from OUT are ranked by the perplexity of their target half according to the IN language model.",

        "In this paper we have proposed an approach for instance-weighting phrase pairs in an out-of-domain corpus in order to improve in-domain performance.",
        "Each out-of-domain phrase pair is characterized by a set of simple features intended to reflect how useful it will be.",
        "The features are weighted within a logistic model to give an overall weight that is applied to the phrase pair's frequency prior to making MAP-smoothed relative-frequency estimates (different weights are learned for each conditioning direction).",
        "These estimates are in turn combined linearly with relative-frequency estimates from an in-domain phrase table.",
        "Mixing, smoothing, and instance-feature weights are learned at the same time using an efficient maximum-likelihood procedure that relies on only a small in-domain development corpus.",
        "We obtained positive results using a very simple phrase-based system in two different adaptation settings: using English/French Europarl to improve a performance on a small, specialized medical domain; and using non-news portions of the NIST09 training material to improve performance on the news-related corpora.",
        "In both cases, the instance-weighting approach improved over a wide range of baselines, giving gains of over 2 BLEU points over the best non-adapted baseline, and gains of between 0.6 and 1.8 over an equivalent mixture model (with an identical training procedure but without instance weighting).",
        "In future work we plan to try this approach with more competitive SMT systems, and to extend instance weighting to other standard SMT components such as the LM, lexical phrase weights, and lexical-ized distortion.",
        "We will also directly compare with a baseline similar to the Matsoukas et al. approach in order to measure the benefit from weighting phrase pairs (or ngrams) rather than full sentences.",
        "Finally, we intend to explore more sophisticated instance-weighting features for capturing the degree of generality of phrase pairs."
