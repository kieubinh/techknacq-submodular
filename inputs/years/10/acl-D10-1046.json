        "Given a rapid growth in virtual world applications for tutoring and training, video games and simulations, and assistive technology, enabling situated dialogue in virtual worlds has become increasingly important.",
        "Situated dialogue allows human users to navigate in a spatially rich environment and carry a conversation with artificial agents to achieve specific tasks pertinent to the environment.",
        "Different from traditional telephony-based spoken dialogue systems and multimodal conversational interfaces, situated dialogue supports immersion and mobility in a visually rich environment and encourages social and collaborative language use (Byron et al., 2005; Gorniak et al., 2006).",
        "In situated dialogue, human users often need to make linguistic references, known as exophoric referring expressions (e.g., the book to the right), to extralinguistic entities in the environment.",
        "Reliably resolving these references is critical for dialogue success.",
        "However, reference resolution remains a challenging problem, partly due to limited speech and language processing capabilities caused by poor speech recognition (ASR), ambiguous language, and insufficient pragmatic knowledge.",
        "To address this problem, motivated by psycholinguistic studies demonstrating a close relationship between language production and eye gaze, our previous work has incorporated naturally occurring eye gaze in reference resolution (Prasov and Chai, 2008).",
        "Our findings have shown that eye gaze can partially compensate for limited language processing and domain modeling.",
        "However, this work was conducted in a setting where users only spoke to a static visual interface.",
        "In situated dialogue, human speech and eye gaze patterns are much more complex.",
        "The dynamic nature of the environment and the complexity of spatially rich tasks have a massive influence on what the user will look at and say.",
        "It is not clear to what degree prior findings can generalize to situated dialogue.",
        "Therefore, this paper explores new studies on incorporating eye gaze for exophoric reference resolution in a fully situated virtual environment – a more realistic approximation of real world interaction.",
        "In addition to incorporating eye gaze with the best recognized spoken hypothesis, we developed an algorithm to also handle multiple hypotheses modeled as word confusion networks.",
        "Our empirical results have demonstrated the utility of eye gaze for reference resolution in situated dialogue.",
        "Although eye gaze is much more noisy given the mobility of the user, our results have shown that incorporating eye gaze with recognition hypotheses consistently outperform the results obtained from processing recognition hypotheses alone.",
        "In addition, incorporating eye gaze with word confusion networks further improves performance.",
        "Our analysis also indicates that, although a word confusion network appears to be more complicated, the time complexity of its integration with eye gaze is well within the acceptable range for real-time applications."

        "This attention modeling is subsequently used to resolve references.",
        "In contrast to this line of research, here we explore the use of human eye gaze during real-time interaction to model attention and facilitate reference resolution.",
        "Eye gaze provides a richer medium for attentional information, but requires processing of a potentially noisy signal.",
        "Eye gaze has been used to facilitate human machine conversation and automated language processing.",
        "For example, eye gaze has been studied in embodied conversational discourse as a mechanism to gather visual information, aid in thinking, or facilitate turn taking and engagement (Nakano et al., 2003; Bickmore and Cassell, 2004; Sidner et al., 2004; Morency et al., 2006; Bee et al., 2009).",
        "Recent work has explored incorporating eye gaze into automated language understanding such as automated speech recognition (Qu and Chai, 2007; Cooke and Russell, 2008), automated vocabulary acquisition (Liu et al., 2007; Qu and Chai, 2010), attention prediction (Qvarfordt and Zhai, 2005; Fang et al., 2009).",
        "Motivated by previous psycholinguistic findings that eye gaze is tightly linked with language processing (Just and Carpenter, 1976; Tanenhous et al., 1995; Meyer and Levelt, 1998; Griffin and Bock, 2000), our prior work incorporates eye gaze into reference resolution.",
        "Our results demonstrate that such use of eye gaze can potentially compensate for a conversational systems limited language processing and domain modeling capability (Prasov and Chai, 2008).",
        "However, this work is conducted in a static visual environment and evaluated only on transcribed spoken utterances.",
        "In situated dialogue, eye gaze behavior is much more complex.",
        "Here, gaze fixations may be made for the purpose of navigation or scanning the environment rather than referring to a particular object.",
        "Referring expressions can be made to objects that are not in the user's field of view, but were previously visible on the interface.",
        "Additionally, users may make egocentric spatial references (e.g. \"the chair on the left\") which require contextual knowledge (e.g. the users position in the environment) in order to resolve.",
        "Therefore, the focus of our work here is on exploring these complex user behaviors in situated dialogue and examining how to combine eye gaze with ASR hypotheses for improved reference resolution.",
        "Alternative ASR hypotheses have been used in many different ways in speech driven systems.",
        "Particularly, in (Mangu et al., 2000) multiple lattice alignment is used for construction of word confusion networks and in (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2006) word confusion networks are used for named entity detection.",
        "In the study presented here, we apply word confusion networks (to represent ASR hypotheses) along with eye gaze to the problem of reference resolution."

        "Table 6 and Table 7 show the performance based on closely coupled utterances using lenient and strict evaluation, respectively.",
        "In the lenient evaluation, reference resolution performance is significantly improved for all input configurations when eye gaze information is incorporated (p < 0.0001 for transcription, p < 0.015 for WCN, and p < 0.0022 for 1-best).",
        "In each case the closely coupled utterances achieve higher performance than the entire set of utterances evaluated in Table 5.",
        "Aside from the 1-best case, the same is true when using strict evaluation (p < 0.0006 for transcription and p < 0.046 for WCN optimized for strict evaluation).",
        "This observation indicates that in situated dialogue, some mechanism to predict whether a gaze stream is closely coupled with the corresponding speech content can be beneficial in further improving reference resolution performance.",
        "The effect of incorporating eye gaze with WCNs rather than 1-best recognition hypotheses into reference resolution can also be seen in Tables 4 and 5.",

        "Similarly, Table 5 shows a significant improvement in strict evaluation when using WCNs rather than 1-best hypotheses for both with (p < 0.0001) and without (p < 0.0001) eye gaze configurations.",
        "These results indicate that using word confusion networks improves both lenient and strict reference resolution.",
        "This observation is not surprising since identifying correct linguistic expressions will enable better search for semantically matching referent objects.",
        "Although WCNs lead to better performance, utilizing WCNs is more computationally expensive compared to 1-best recognition hypotheses.",
        "Nevertheless, in practice, WCN depth, which specifies the maximum number of competing word hypotheses in any position of the word confusion network, can be limited to a certain value | d|.",
        "For example, in Figure 2 the depth of the shown WCN is 8 (there are 8 competing word hypotheses in position 17 of the WCN).",
        "The WCN depth can be limited by pruning word alternatives with low probabilities until, at most, the top |d| words remain in each position of the WCN.",
        "It is interesting to observe how limiting WCN depth can affect reference resolution performance.",
        "Figure 3 demonstrates this observation.",
        "In this figure the resolution performance (in terms of lenient evaluation) for WCNs of varying depth is shown as dashed lines for with and without eye gaze configurations.",
        "As a reference point, the performance when utilizing 1-best recognition hypotheses is shown as solid lines.",
        "It can be seen that as the depth increases, the performance also increases until the depth reaches 8.",
        "After that, there is no performance improvement."

        "One potential concern of using word confusion networks rather than 1-best hypotheses is that they are more computationally expensive to process.",

        "Figure 3: Lenient F-measure at each WCN Depth tion of three components: (1) O(|G| • |d| larly helpful for resolving referring expressions that are ambiguous from the perspective of the artificial agent.",
        "Consider a scenario where the user utters a referring expression that has an equivalent semantic compatibility with multiple potential referent objects.",
        "For example, in a room with multiple books, the user utters \"the open book to the right\", but only the phrase \"the book\" is recognized by the ASR.",
        "If a particular book is fixated during interaction, there is a high probability that it is indeed being referred to by the user.",
        "Without eye gaze information, the semantic compatibility alone could be insufficient to resolve this referring expression.",
        "Thus, when eye gaze information is incorporated, the main source of performance improvement comes from better identification of potential referent objects.",
        "In Section 6.3 we have shown that incorporating multiple speech recognition hypotheses in the form of a word confusion network further improves reference resolution performance.",
        "This is especially true when exact referring expression identification is required (F-measure of 0.309 from WCNs compared to F-measure of 0.039 from 1-best hypotheses).",
        "Using a WCN improves identification of low-probability referring expressions.",
        "Consider a scenario where the top recognition hypothesis of an utterance contains no referring expressions or an incorrect referring expression that has no semantically compatible potential referent objects.",
        "If a referring expression with a high compatibility value to some potential referent object is present in a lower probability hypothesis, this referring expression can only be identified when a WCN rather than a 1-best hypothesis is utilized.",
        "Thus, when word confusion netfor confusion network construction and parsing, (2) O(|r|^ |O| •1og(|O|)) for reference resolution, and (3) O(|r|) for selection of (referring expression, referent object set) pairs.",
        "Here, |w| is the number of words in the input speech signal (or, more precisely, the number of words in the longest ASR hypothesis for a given utterance); |G| is the size of the parsing grammar; |d| is the depth of the constructed word confusion network; |O| is the number of potential referent objects for each utterance; and |r| is the number of referring expressions that are extracted from the word confusion network.",
        "The complexity is dominated by the word confusion network construction and parsing.",
        "Also, both the number of words in an input utterance ASR hypothesis | w| and the number ofreferring expressions in a word confusion network |r | are dependent on utterance length.",
        "In our study, interactive dialogue is encouraged and, thus, utterances are typically short; with a mean length of 6.41 words and standard deviation of 4.35 words.",
        "The longest utterances in our data set has 31 words.",
        "WCN depth |d| has a mean of 10.",
        "1, a standard deviation of 8.1, and a maximum 89 words.",
        "In practice, as shown in Section 6.3, limiting |d| to 8 words achieves comparable reference resolution results as using a full word confusion network.",
        "To demonstrate the applicability of our reference resolution algorithm for real-time processing, we applied it on the data corpus presented in Section 3.",
        "This corpus contains utterances with a mean input time of 2927.5 ms and standard deviation of 1903.8 ms. On a 2.4 GHz AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor, the runtimes resulted in a real time factor of 0.0153 on average.",
        "Thus, on average, an utterance from this corpus can be processed in just under 45 ms, which is well within the range of acceptable real-time performance.",
        "7.2 Error Analysis",
        "As can be seen in Section 6, even when using transcribed data, reference resolution performance still has room for improvement (achieving the highest lenient F-measure of 0.700 when eye gaze is utilized for resolving closely coupled utterances).",
        "In this section, we elaborate on the potential error sources.",
        "Specifically, we discuss two types of error: (1) a referring expression is incorrectly recognized or (2) a recognized referring expression is not resolved to a correct referent object set.",
        "Given transcribed data, which simulates perfectly recognized utterances, all referring expression recognition errors arise due to incorrect language processing.",
        "Most of these errors occur because an incorrect part of speech (POS) tag is assigned to a word, or an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word is encountered, or the parsing grammar has insufficient coverage.",
        "A particularly interesting parsing problem occurs due to the nature of spoken language.",
        "Since punctuation is sometimes unavailable, given an utterance with several consecutive nouns, it is unclear which of these nouns should be treated as head nouns and which should be treated as noun modifiers.",
        "For example, in the utterance \"there is a desk lamp table and two chairs\" it is unclear if the italicized expression should be parsed as a single phrase or as a list of (two) phrases a desk and lamp.",
        "Thus, some timing information should be used for disambiguation.",
        "Object set identification errors are more prevalent than referring expression recognition errors.",
        "The majority of these errors occur because a referring expression is ambiguous from the perspective of the conversational system and there is not enough information to choose amongst multiple potential referent objects due to limited speech recognition and domain modeling.",
        "One reason for this is that a referring expression may be resolved to an incorrect number of referent objects.",
        "Another reason is that a pertinent object attribute or a distinguishing spatial relationship between objects specified by the user cannot be established by the system.",
        "For example, during the utterance \"I see a vase left of the table\" there are two vases visible on the screen creating an ambiguity if the phrase left of is not processed correctly.",
        "This is caused by an inadequate representation of spatial relationships and processing of spatial language.",
        "One more reason for potential ambiguity is the lack of pragmatic knowledge that can support adequate inference.",
        "For example, when the user refers to two sofa objects using the phrase \"an armchair and a sofa\", the system lacks pragmatic knowledge to indicate that arm chair refers to the smaller of the two objects.",
        "Some of these errors can be avoided when eye gaze information is available to the system.",
        "However, due to the noisy nature of eye gaze data, many such referring expressions remain ambiguous even when eye gaze information is considered."
