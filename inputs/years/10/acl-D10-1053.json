        "Current practice in hierarchical phrase-based translation extracts regular phrases and hierarchical rules from word-aligned parallel text.",
        "Alignment models estimated over the parallel text are used to generate these alignments, but these models are then typically used no further in rule extraction.",
        "This is less than ideal because these alignment models, even if they are not suitable for direct use in translation, can still provide a great deal of useful information beyond a single best estimate of the alignment of the parallel text.",
        "Our aim is to use alignment models to generate the statistics needed to build translation grammars.",
        "The challenge in doing so is to extend the current procedures, which are geared towards the use of a single alignment, to make more of what can be provided by alignment models.",
        "The goal is to extract a richer and more robust set of translation rules.",
        "There are two aspects to hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars which concern us.",
        "The first is expressive power, which we take as the ability to generate known reference translations from sentences in the source language.",
        "This is determined by the degree of phrase movements and the translations allowed by the rules of the grammar.",
        "For a grammar with given types of rules, larger rule sets will yield greater expressive power.",
        "This motivates studies of grammars based on the rules which are extracted and the movement the grammar allows.",
        "The second aspect is of course translation accuracy.",
        "If the expressive power is adequate, then the desire is that the grammar assigns a high score to a correct translation.",
        "We use posterior probabilities over parallel data to address both ofthese aspects.",
        "These posteriors allow us to build larger rule sets with improved translation accuracy.",
        "Ideally, for a sentence pair we wish to consider all possible alignments between all possible source and target phrases within these sentences.",
        "Given a grammar allowing certain types of movement, we would then extract all possible parses that are consistent with any alignments of these phrases.",
        "To make this approach feasible, we consider only phrase-to-phrase alignments with a high posterior probability under the alignment models.",
        "In this way, the alignment model probabilities guide rule extraction.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews related work on using posteriors to extract phrases, as well as other approaches that tightly integrate word alignment and rule extraction.",
        "Section 3 describes rule extraction based on word and phrase posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignment model.",
        "In Section 4 we define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system, motivating each rule type by the phrase movement it is intended to achieve.",
        "In Section 5 we assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power and the quality of the translations they yield in Chinese-to-English, showing that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements.",

        "For each Y, the probability over translations a is set by relative frequency over the extracted examples from the corpus.",
        "We take a general approach to rule extraction, as described by the following procedure.",

        "Given a sentence pair (fJ, e{), the extraction algorithm traverses the source sentence and, for each sequence of terminals fj., it considers all possible target-side sequences ei2 as translation candidates.",
        "Each target-side sequence that satisfies the alignment constraints Ca is ranked by the function fR.",
        "For practical reasons, a set of selection criteria Cs is then applied to these ranked candidates and defines the set of translations of the source sequence that are extracted as rules.",
        "Each extracted rule is assigned a count fc.",
        "In this section we will explore variations of this rule extraction procedure involving alternative definitions of the ranking and counting functions, fRand fc, based on probabilities over alignment models.",
        "Common practice (Koehn et al., 2003) takes a set of word alignment links L and defines the alignment constraints Ca so that there is a consistency between the links in the (f^, ) phrase pair.",
        "This is expressed by V(j,i) G L : (j G [ji ,32] A i G [ii ,12}) V (j G [j1,j2] A i G [i1,i2]).",
        "If these constraints are met, then alignment probabilities are ignored and fR = fc = 1.",
        "We call this extraction Viterbi-based, as the set of alignment links is generally obtained after applying a symmetrization heuristic to source-to-target and target-to-source Viterbi alignments.",
        "In the following section we depart from this approach and apply novel functions to rank and count target-side translations according to their quality in the context of each parallel sentence, as defined by the word alignment models.",
        "We also depart from common practice in that we do not use a set of links as alignment constraints.",
        "We thus find an increase in the number of extracted rules, and consequently better relative frequency estimates over translations.",
        "We describe two alternative approaches to modify the functions fR and fc so that they incorporate the probabilities provided by the alignment models.",
        "Word-to-word alignment posterior probabilities p(lji\\fi , e[) express how likely it is that the words in source position j and target position i are aligned given a sentence pair.",

        "Therefore it cannot be used as such without further normalization.",
        "Indeed we find that this distribution is too sharp and overemphasises short phrases, so we use fc = 1.",
        "However, it does allow us to rank target phrases as possible translations.",
        "In contrast to the common extraction procedure described in the previous section, the ranking approach described here can lead to a much more exhaustive extraction unless selection criteria are applied.",
        "These we describe in Section 3.2.",

        "With the HMM model, the denominator is computed using the forward algorithm while the numerator can be computed using a modified forward algorithm (Deng, 2005).",
        "These phrase posteriors directly define a probability distribution over the alignments of translation candidates, so we use them both for ranking and scoring extracted rules, that is fR = fc = p. This approach assigns a fractional count to each extracted rule, which allows finer estimation of the forward and backward translation probability distributions.",

        "Table 2 reports the translation results, as well as the number of extracted rules in each case.",
        "It also shows the following decoding statistics as measured on the tune-nw set: decoding time in seconds per input word, and number of instances of search pruning (described in Section 5) per input word.",
        "As a contrast, we extract rules according to the heuristics introduced in (Chiang, 2007) and apply the filters described in (Iglesias et al., 2009) to generate a standard hierarchical phrase-based grammar GH.",
        "This uses rules with up to two nonadjacent nonterminals, but excludes identical rule types such as X-^{w X,w X) or X-^{w X1 w X2,w X1 w X2), which were reported to cause computational difficulties without a clear improvement in translation (Iglesias et al., 2009).",
        "Grammar expressivity.",
        "As expected, for the standard extraction method (see rows entitled V-union), grammar Gi is shown to underperform all other grammars due to its structural limitations.",
        "On the other hand, grammar G2 obtains much better scores, nearly generating the same translation quality as the baseline grammar GH.",
        "Finally, G3 does not prove able to outperform G2, which suggests that the phrase-disjoint rules with one nonterminal are redundant for the translation grammar.",
        "Rule extraction method.",
        "For all grammars, we find that the proposed extraction methods based on alignment posteriors outperform standard Viterbibased extraction, with improvements ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 BLEU points for test-nwl (depending on the grammar) and from 1.0 to 1.5 for test-nw2.",
        "In all cases, the use of phrase posteriors PP is the best option.",
        "Interestingly, we find that G2 extracted with WP and PP methods outperforms the more complex GH grammar as obtained from Viterbi alignments.",
        "Rule set statistics.",
        "For grammar G2 evaluated on the tune-nw set, standard Viterbi-based extraction produces 0.7M rules, whereas the WP and PP extraction methods yield 1.1M and 1.2M rules respectively.",
        "We further analyse the sets of rules X – >{7,a,~) in terms of the number of distinct source and target sequences 7 and a which are extracted.",
        "Viterbi extraction yields 82k distinct source sequences whereas the WP and PP methods yield 116k and 146k sequences, respectively.",
        "In terms of the average number of target sequences for each source sequence, Viterbi extraction yields an average of 8.7 while WP and PP yield 9.7 and 8.4 rules on average.",
        "This shows that method PP yields wider coverage but with sharper forward rule translation probability distributions than method WP, as the average number of translations per rule is determined by the p(a|7) > 0.01 threshold mentioned in Section 3.2.",
        "Decoding time and pruning in search.",
        "In connection to the previous comments, we find an increased need for search pruning, and subsequently slower decoding speed, as the search space grows larger with methods WP and PP.",
        "A larger search space is created by the larger rule sets, which allows the system to generate new hypotheses of better quality.",
        "In Section 4.1 we described a strategy to reduce grammar redundancy by introducing an additional nonterminal M for monotonic concatenation rules.",
        "We find that without this distinction among nonterminals, search pruning and decoding time are increased by a factor of 1.5, and there is a slight degradation in BLEU (~0.2) as more search errors are introduced.",
        "Another relevant aspect of this grammar is the actual rule type selected for monotonic concatenation.",
        "We described using type X-^{w X,w X) (concatenation on the right), but one could also include X-^{X w,X w) (concatenation on the left), or both, for the same purpose.",
        "We evaluated the three alternatives and found that scores are identical when either including right or left concatenation types, but including both is harmful for performance, as the need to prune and decoding time increase by a factor of 5 and 4, respectively, and we observe again a slight degradation in performance.",

        "In this section we investigate extraction from alignments (and posterior distributions) over parallel text which are generated using alignment models trained in the source-to-target (st) and target-to-source (ts) directions.",
        "Our motivation is that symmetrization strategies have been reported to be beneficial for Viterbi extraction methods (Och and Ney, 2003;",
        "Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Results are shown in Table 3 for grammar G2.",
        "We find that rules extracted under the source-to-target alignment models (V-st, WP-st and PP-st) consistently perform better than the V-ts, WP-ts and PP-ts cases.",
        "Also, for Viterbi extraction we find that the source-to-target V-st case performs better than any of the symmetrization strategies, which contradicts previous findings for non-hierarchical phrase-based systems(Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We use the PP rule extraction method to extract two sets of rules, under the stand ts alignment models respectively.",
        "We now investigate two ways of merging these sets into a single grammar for translation.",
        "The first strategy is PP-merge and merges both rule sets by assigning to each rule the maximum count assigned by either alignment model.",
        "We then extend the previous strategy by adding three binary feature functions to the system, indicating whether the rule was extracted under the 'st' model, the 'ts' model or both.",
        "The motivation is that MERT can weight rules differently according to the alignment model they were extracted from.",
        "However, we do not find any improvement with either strategy.",
        "Finally, we use linearised lattice minimum Bayes-risk decoding (Tromble et al., 2008; Blackwood et al., 2010) to combine translation lattices (de Gis-pert et al., 2010) as produced by rules extracted under each alignment direction (see rows named",
        "LMBR(V-st,V-ts) and LMBR(PP-st,PP-ts)).",
        "Gains are consistent when comparing this to applying LMBR to each of the best individual systems (rows named LMBR(V-st) and LMBR(PP-st)).",
        "Overall, the best-performing strategy is to extract two sets of translation rules under the phrase pair posteriors in each translation direction, and then to perform translation twice and merge the results."

        "Rule extraction based on alignment posterior probabilities can generate larger rule sets.",

        "This more exhaustive rule extraction method permits a grammar simplification, as expressed by the phrase movement allowed by its rules.",
        "In particular a simple grammar with rules of only one nonterminal is shown to outperform a more complex grammar built on rules extracted from Viterbi alignments.",
        "Finally, we find that the best way to exploit alignment models trained in each translation direction is to extract two rule sets based on alignment posteriors, translate the input independently with each rule set and combine translation output lattices."
