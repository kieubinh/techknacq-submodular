      "text": [
        "In building surface-realization systems for natural language generation, there is a need for reliable automated metrics to evaluate the output.",
        "Unlike in parsing, where there is usually a single goldstandard parse for a sentence, in surface realization there are usually many grammatically-acceptable ways to express the same concept.",
        "This parallels the task of evaluating machine-translation (MT) systems: for a given segment in the source language, there are usually several acceptable translations into the target language.",
        "As human evaluation of translation quality is time-consuming and expensive, a number of automated metrics have been developed to evaluate the quality of MT outputs.",
        "In this study, we investigate whether the metrics developed for MT evaluation tasks can be used to reliably evaluate the outputs of surface realizers, and which of these metrics are best suited to this task.",
        "A number of surface realizers have been developed using the Penn Treebank (PTB), and BLEU scores are often reported in the evaluations of these systems.",
        "But how useful is BLEU in this context?",
        "The original BLEU study (Papineni et al., 2001) scored MT outputs, which are of generally lower quality than grammar-based surface realizations.",
        "Furthermore, even for MT systems, the usefulness of BLEU has been called into question (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "bleu is designed to work with multiple reference sentences, but in treebank realization, there is only a single reference sentence available for comparison.",
        "A few other studies have investigated the use of such metrics in evaluating the output of NLG systems, notably (Reiter and Belz, 2009) and (Stent et al., 2005).",
        "The former examined the performance of BLEU and ROUGE with computer-generated weather reports, finding a moderate correlation with human fluency judgments.",
        "The latter study applied several MT metrics to paraphrase data from Barzilay and Lee's corpus-based system (Barzilay and Lee, 2003), and found moderate correlations with human adequacy judgments, but little correlation with fluency judgments.",
        "Cahill (2009) examined the performance of six MT metrics (including BLEU) in evaluating the output of a LFG-based surface realizer for",
        "German, also finding only weak correlations with the human judgments.",
        "To study the usefulness of evaluation metrics such as bleu on the output of grammar-based surface realizers used with the PTB, we assembled a corpus of surface realizations from three different realizers operating on Section 00 of the PTB.",
        "Two human judges evaluated the adequacy and fluency of each of the realizations with respect to the reference sentence.",
        "The realizations were then scored with a number of automated evaluation metrics developed for machine translation.",
        "In order to investigate the correlation of targeted metrics with human evaluations, and gather other acceptable realizations for future evaluations, the judges manually repaired each unacceptable realization during the rating task.",
        "In contrast to previous NLG meta-evaluations, we found that several of the metrics correlate moderately well with human judgments of both adequacy and fluency, with the ter family performing best.",
        "However, when looking at statistically significant system-level differences in human judgments, we found that some of the metrics get some of the rankings correct, but none get them all correct, with different metrics making different ranking errors.",
        "This suggests that multiple metrics should be routinely consulted when comparing realizer systems.",
        "Overall, our methodology is similar to that of previous MT meta-evaluations, in that we collected human judgments of system outputs, and compared these scores with those assigned by automatic metrics.",
        "A recent alternative approach to paraphrase evaluation is ParaMetric (Callison-Burch et al., 2008); however, it requires a corpus of annotated (aligned) paraphrases (which does not yet exist for PTB data), and is arguably focused more on paraphrase analysis than paraphrase generation.",
        "The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses the preparation of the corpus of surface realizations.",
        "Section 3 describes the human evaluation task and the automated metrics applied.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 present and discuss the results of these evaluations.",
        "We conclude with some general observations about automatic evaluation of surface realizers, and some directions for further research."

        "Our study suggests that although the task of evaluating the output from realizer systems differs from the task of evaluating machine translations, the automatic metrics used to evaluate MT outputs deliver moderate correlations with combined human fluency and adequacy scores when used on surface realizations.",
        "We also found that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful in evaluating different versions of the same realizer system (e.g., the various OpenCCG realization ranking models), and finding cases where a system is performing poorly.",
        "As in MT-evaluation tasks, human-targeted metrics have the highest correlations with human judgments overall.",
        "These results suggest that the MT-evaluation metrics are useful for developing surface realizers.",
        "However, the correlations are lower than those reported for MT data, suggesting that they should be used with caution, especially for cross-system evaluation, where consulting multiple metrics may yield more reliable comparisons.",
        "In our study, the targeted version of TERP correlated most strongly with human judgments of fluency.",
        "In future work, the performance of the TER family of metrics on this data might be improved by optimizing the edit weights used in computing its scores, so as to avoid over-penalizing punctuation movements or under-penalizing agreement errors, both of which were significant sources of ranking errors.",
        "Multiple reference sentences may also help mitigate these problems, and the corpus of human-repaired realizations that has resulted from our study is a step in this direction, as it provides multiple references for some cases.",
        "We expect the corpus to also prove useful for feature engineering and error analysis in developing better realization models."
