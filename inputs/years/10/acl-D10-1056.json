        "Part-of-speech (POS) induction is one of the most popular tasks in research on unsupervised NLP.",
        "Many different methods have been proposed, yet comparisons are difficult to make since there is little consensus on evaluation framework, and many papers evaluate against only one or two competitor systems.",
        "Here we evaluate seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of work, using a variety of measures.",
        "We show that some of the oldest (and simplest) systems stand up surprisingly well against more recent approaches.",
        "Since most of these systems were developed and tested using data from the WSJ corpus, we compare their generalization abilities by testing on both WSJ and the multilingual Multext-East corpus.",
        "Finally, we introduce the idea of evaluating systems based on their ability to produce cluster prototypes that are useful as input to a prototype-driven learner.",
        "In most cases, the prototype-driven learner outperforms the unsupervised system used to initialize it, yielding state-of-the-art results on WSJ and improvements on non-English corpora."

        "In recent years, unsupervised learning has become a hot area in NLP, in large part due to the use of sophisticated machine learning approaches which promise to deliver better results than more traditional methods.",
        "Often the new approaches are tested using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as an example application, and usually they are shown to perform better than one or another comparison system.",
        "However, it is difficult to draw overall conclusions about the relative performance of unsupervised POS tagging systems because of differences in evaluation measures, and the fact that no paper includes direct comparisons against more than a few other systems.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to remedy that situation by providing a comprehensive evaluation of seven different POS induction systems spanning nearly 20 years of research.",
        "We focus specifically on POS induction systems, where no prior knowledge is available, in contrast to POS disambiguation systems (Merialdo, 1994; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007; Naseem et al., 2009; Ravi and Knight, 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2005), which use a dictionary to provide possible tags for some or all of the words in the corpus, or prototype-driven systems (Haghighi and Klein, 2006), which use a small set of prototypes for each tag class, but no dictionary.",
        "Our motivation stems from another part of our own research, in which we are trying to use NLP systems on over 50 low-density languages (some of them dead) where both tagged corpora and language speakers are mostly unavailable.",
        "We therefore desire to use these systems straight out of the box and to know how well we can expect them to work.",
        "One difficulty in evaluating POS induction systems is that there is no straightforward way to map the clusters found by the algorithm onto the gold standard tags; moreover, some systems are designed to induce the number of clusters as well as their contents, so the number of found clusters may not match either the gold standard or that of another system.",
        "Nevertheless, most recent papers have used mapping-based performance measures (either one-to-one or many-to-one accuracy).",
        "Here, we argue that the entropy-based V-Measure (Rosenberg and",
        "Hirschberg, 2007) is more useful in many cases, being more stable across different numbers of found and true clusters, and avoiding several of the problems with another commonly used entropy-based measure, Variation of Information (Meila, 2003).",
        "Using V-Measure along with several other evaluation measures, we compare the performance of the different induction systems on both WSJ (the data on which most systems were developed and tested) and Multext East, a corpus of parallel texts in eight different languages.",
        "We find that for virtually all measures and datasets, older systems using relatively simple models and algorithms (Brown et al., 1992; Clark, 2003) work as well or better than systems using newer and often far more sophisticated and time-consuming machine learning methods (Gold-water and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Graca et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).",
        "Thus, although these newer methods have introduced potentially useful machine learning techniques, they should not be assumed to provide the best performance for unsupervised POS induction.",
        "In addition to our review and comparison, we introduce a new way to both evaluate and potentially improve a POS induction system.",
        "Our method is based on the prototype-driven learning system of Haghighi and Klein (2006), which achieves very good performance by using a hand-selected list of prototypes for each syntactic cluster.",
        "We instead use the existing POS induction systems to induce prototypes automatically, and evaluate the systems based on the quality of their prototypes.",
        "We find that the oldest system tested (Brown et al., 1992) produces the best prototypes, and that using these prototypes as input to Haghighi and Klein's system yields state-of-the-art performance on WSJ and improvements on seven of the eight non-English corpora."

        "[many-to-1]: Many-to-one mapping accuracy (also known as cluster purity) maps each cluster to the gold standard tag that is most common for the words in that cluster (henceforth, the preferred tag), and then computes the proportion of words tagged correctly.",

        "This is the most commonly used metric across the literature as it is intuitive and creates a meaningful POS sequence out of the cluster identifiers.",

        "[crossval]: Cross-validation accuracy (Gao and Johnson, 2008) is intended to address the problem with many-to-one accuracy which is that assigning each word to its own class yields a perfect score.",
        "In this measure, the first half of the corpus is used to obtain the many-to-one mapping of clusters to tags, and this mapping is used to compute the accuracy of the clustering on the second half of the corpus.",
        "(Haghighi and Klein, 2006) constrains the mapping from clusters to tags, so that at most one cluster can be mapped to any tag.",
        "The mapping is performed greedily.",
        "In general, as the number of clusters increases, fewer clusters will be mapped to their preferred tag and scores will decrease (especially if the number of clusters is larger than the number of tags, so that some clusters are unassigned and receive zero credit).",
        "Again, this makes it difficult to compare solutions with different values of \\C\\.",
        "[vi]: Variation of Information (Meila, 2003) is an information-theoretic measure that regards the system output C and the gold standard tags T as two separate clusterings, and evaluates the amount of information lost in going from C to T and the amount of information gained, i.e., the sum of the conditional entropy of each clustering conditioned on the other.",
        "More formally, VI(C,T) = H(T\\C) + H (C\\T) = H (C ) + H (T) - 2I (C, T), where H (.)",

        "Recently, Frank et al.",
        "(2009) proposed this novel evaluation measure that requires no gold standard, instead using the concept of substitutability to evaluate performance.",

        "well as two other baselines (a supervised taggingand a random clustering with C = 45).",
        "These empirical results confirm that certain measures favor solutions with many clusters, while others prefer fewer clusters.",
        "As expected, many-to-1 correlates positively with \\C\\, rising to almost 85% with \\C\\ = 200 and reaching 100% when the number of clusters is maximal (i.e., single).",
        "Recall that crossval was proposed as a possible solution to this problem, and it does solve the extreme case of single, yielding 0% accuracy rather than 100%.",
        "However, it patterns just like many-to-1 for up to 200 clusters, suggesting that there is very little difference",
        "http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml.",
        "between the two for any reasonable number of clusters, and we should be wary of using either one when C may vary.",
        "In contrast to these measures are 1-to-1 and vi: for the most part, they yield worse performance (lower 1-to-1 , higher vi) as C increases.",
        "However, in this case the trend is not monotonic: there is an initial improvement in performance before the decrease begins.",
        "One might hope that the peak in performance would occur when the number of clusters is approximately equal to the number of gold standard tags; however, the best performance for both 1-to-1 and vi occurs with approximately 25-30 clusters, many fewer than the gold standard 45.",
        "Next we consider vm and vmb.",
        "Interestingly, although vmb was proposed as a way to correct for the supposed tendency of vm to increase with increasing \\C\\, we find that vm is actually more stable than vmb over different values of C .",
        "Thus, if the goal is to compare systems producing different numbers of clusters (especially important for systems that induce the number of clusters), then vm seems more appropriate than any of the above measures, which are more standard in the literature.",
        "Finally, we analyze the behavior of the gold-standard-independent measure, s-fscore.",
        "On the positive side, this measure assigns scores of 0 to the two extreme cases of all and single, and is relatively stable across different values of C after an initial increase.",
        "It assigns a lower score to the supervised system than to brown, indicating that words in the supervised clusters (which are very close to the gold standard) are actually less substitutable than words in the unsupervised clusters.",
        "This is probably due to the fact that the gold standard encodes \"pure\" syntactic classes, while substitutability also depends on semantic characteristics (which tend to be picked up by unsupervised clustering systems as well).",
        "Another potential problem with this measure is that it has a very small dynamic range - while scores as high as 1 are theoretically possible, in practice they will never be achieved, and we see that the actual range of scores observed are all under 20%.",

        "For the WSJ corpora we experimented with two standardly used tagsets: the original PTB 45-tag gold standard and a coarser set of 17 tags previously used by several researchers working on unsupervised POS tagging (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007).",
        "For the Multext-East corpus only a coarse 14-tag tagset was available.",
        "Finally, to facilitate direct comparisons of genre while controlling for the size of both the corpus and the tag set, we also created a further collapsed 13-tag set for WSJ.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates the abilities of the different systems to generalize across different genres of English text.",
        "Comparing the results for the Multext-East English corpus and the small WSJ corpus with 13 tags (i.e., controlling as much as possible for corpus size and number of gold standard tags), we see that despite being developed on WSJ, the systems actually perform better on Multext-East.",
        "This is encouraging, since it suggests that the methods and hyperparameters of the algorithms are not strongly tied to WSJ.",
        "It also suggests that Multext-East is in some sense an easier corpus than WSJ.",
        "Indeed, the distribution of vocabulary items supports this view: the 100 most frequent words account for 48% of the WSJ corpus, but 57% of the 1984 novel.",
        "It is also worth pointing out that, although previous researchers have reduced the 45-tag WSJ set to 17 tags in order to create an easier task for unsupervised learning (and to decrease training time), reducing the tag set further to 13 tags actually decreases performance, since some distinctions found by the systems (e.g., between different types of punctuation) are collapsed in the gold standard.",
        "Figure 4 gives the results of the different systems on the various languages.",
        "Not surprisingly, all the algorithms perform best on English, often by a wide margin, suggesting that they are indeed tuned better towards English syntax and/or morphology.",
        "One might expect that the two systems with morphological features (clark and feat) would show less difference between English and some of the other languages (all of which have complex morphology) than the other systems.",
        "However, although clark and feat (along with Brown) are the best performing systems overall, they don't show any particular benefit for the morphologically complex languages.",
        "One difference between the Multext-East results and the WSJ results is that on Multext-East, clark clearly outperforms all the other systems.",
        "This is true for both the English and non-English corpora, despite the similar performance of clark and feat on (English) WSJ.",
        "This suggests that feat benefits more from the larger corpus size of WSJ.",
        "For the other languages clark may be benefiting from somewhat more general morphological features; feat currently contains suffix features but no prefix features (although these could be added).",
        "Overall, our experiments on multiple languages support our earlier claim that many of the newer POS induction systems are not as successful as the older methods.",
        "Moreover, these experiments underscore the importance of testing unsupervised systems on multiple languages and domains, since both the absolute and relative performance of systems may change on different data sets.",
        "Ideally, some of the corpora should be held out as unseen test data if an effective argument is to be made regarding the language-or domain-generality of the system."

        "We now introduce a final novel method of evaluating POS induction systems and potentially improving their performance as well.",
        "Our idea is based on the prototype-driven learning model of Haghighi and Klein (2006).",
        "This model is unsupervised, but requires as input a handful of prototypes (canonical examples) for each word class.",
        "The system uses a log-linear model with features that include the prototype lists as well as morphological features (the same ones used in feat).",
        "Using the most frequent words in each gold standard class as prototypes, the authors report 80.5% accuracy (both many-to-one and one-to-one) on WSJ, considerably higher than any of the induction systems seen here.",
        "This raises two questions: If we wish to induce prototypes without a tagged corpus or language-specific knowledge, which induction system will provide the best prototypes (i.e., most similar to the gold standard prototypes)?",
        "And, can we use the induced prototypes as input to the prototype-driven model (h&k) to achieve better performance than the system the prototypes were extracted from?",
        "To explore these questions, we implemented a simple heuristic method for inducing prototypes from the output C of a POS induction system by selecting a few frequent words in each cluster that are the most similar to other words in the cluster and also the most dissimilar to the words in other clusters.",
        "For each cluster ci G C, we retain as candidate prototypes the words whose frequency in ci is at least 90% as high as the word with the highest frequency (in ci).",
        "This yields about 20-30 candidates from each cluster.",
        "For each of these, we compute its average similarity S to the other candidates in its cluster, and the average dissimilarity V to the candidates in other clusters.",
        "Similarity is computed using the method described by Haghighi and Klein (2006), which uses SVD on word context vectors and cosine similarity.",
        "Dissimilarity between a pair of words is computed as one minus the similarity.",
        "Finally we compute the average M = 0.5(S + V), sort the words by their M scores, and keep as prototypes the top ten words with M > 0.25 * maxCi (M).",
        "The cutoff threshold results in some clusters having less than ten prototypes, which is appropriate since some gold standard categories have very few members (e.g., punctuation, determiners).",
        "Using this method, we first tested the various base+proto systems on the WSJ corpus.",
        "Results in Table 3 show that the brown system produces the best prototypes.",
        "Although not as good as using prototypes from the gold standard (h&k),",
        "Table 3: Scores on WSJ for our prototype-based POS induction system, with prototypes extracted from each of the existing systems [\\C\\:45,\\T|:45].",
        "Numbers in parentheses are the improvement over the same system without using the prototype step.",
        "Scores in bold indicate the best performance (improvement) in each column.",
        "h&k uses gold standard prototypes.",
        "on all corpora.",
        "Numbers in parentheses indicate improvement over the base systems.",
        "brown+proto yields a large improvement over brown, and the highest performance of any system tested so far.",
        "In fact, the brown+proto scores are, to our knowledge, the best reported results for an unsupervised POS induction system on WSJ.",
        "Next, we evaluated the two best-performing +proto systems on Multext-East, as shown in Table 4.",
        "We see that brown again yields the best prototypes, and again yields improvements when used as brown+proto (although the improvements are not as large as those on WSJ).",
        "Interestingly, clark+proto actually performs worse than clark on the multilingual data, showing that although induced prototypes can in principle improve the performance of a system, not all systems will benefit in all situations.",
        "This suggests a need for additional investigation to determine what properties of an existing induction system allow it to produce useful prototypes with the current method and/or to develop a specialized system specifically targeted towards inducing useful prototypes."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have attempted to provide a more comprehensive review and comparison ofevaluation measures and systems for POS induction than has been done before.",
        "We pointed out that most of the commonly used evaluation measures are sensitive to the number of induced clusters, and suggested that V-measure (which is less sensitive) should be used as an alternative or in conjunction with the standard measures.",
        "With regard to the systems themselves, we found that many of the newer approaches actually perform worse than older methods that are both simpler and faster.",
        "The newer systems have introduced potentially important machine learning tools, but are not necessarily better suited to the POS induction task specifically.",
        "Since portability is a distinguishing feature for unsupervised models, we have stressed the importance of testing the systems on corpora that were not used in their development, and especially on different languages.",
        "We found that on non-English languages, Clark's (2003) system performed best.",
        "Finally, we introduced the idea of evaluating induction systems based on their ability to produce useful cluster prototypes.",
        "We found that the oldest system (Brown et al., 1992) yielded the best prototypes, and that using these prototypes gave state-of-the-art performance on WSJ, as well as improvements on nearly all of the non-English corpora.",
        "These promising results suggest a new direction for future research: improving POS induction by developing methods targeted towards extracting better prototypes, rather than focusing on improving clustering of the entire data set."
