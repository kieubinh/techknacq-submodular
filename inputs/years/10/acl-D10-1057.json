        "Consider a named entity recognition system trained on newswire stories.",
        "Given annotated documents containing sentences like \"Tony Hayward has faced fresh criticism for taking time off to go sailing ...\" we would like to learn a model that will allow us to recognize that \"Obama\" and \"BP\" are named entities in a sentence like \"Obama summoned BP executives .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "\".",
        "When all of the documents come from one data distribution, like newswire articles, this tends to work well.",
        "However, the sentence \"OBAMA SUMMONED BP EXECUTIVES ...\" from transcribed broadcast news, and others like it, will probably lead to poor results because the features it relies on have changed.",
        "For example, capitalization patterns are no longer a good indicator of the presence of a named entity and appositives are not indicated by punctuation.",
        "This problem of domain shift is a pervasive problem in NLP in which any kind of model - a parser, a POS tagger, a sentiment classifier - is tested on data that do not match the training data.",
        "Given a model and a stream of unlabeled instances, we are interested in automatically detecting changes in the feature distribution that negatively impact classification accuracy.",
        "For example, a sentiment classification model trained on book reviews may heavily weight n-grams features like \"uplifting\" and \"page turner\".",
        "Those features may never occur in reviews of kitchen appliances that get mixed in at test time, and useful features in this new domain like \"efficient\" and \"noisy compressor\" will have never been seen during training and therefore not be in the model.",
        "Furthermore, we do not assume labeled instances are available to help detect these harmful changes.",
        "Other tasks related to changes in data distributions, like detecting concept drift in which the labeling function changes, may require labeled instances, but that is not the focus of this paper.",
        "There is significant work on the related problem of adapting a classifier for a known domain shift.",
        "Versions of this problem include adapting using only unlabeled target domain data (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007), adapting using a limited amount of target domain labeled data (Daume, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009), and learning across multiple domains simultaneously in an online setting (Dredze and Crammer, 2008b).",
        "However, in practical settings, we do not know if the data distribution will change, and certainly not when.",
        "Additionally, we will not know to what domain the shift will happen.",
        "A discussion forum devoted to science fiction books may change over time to focus more on fantasy and then narrow to discussions of vampire fiction.",
        "Maybe this shift is harmless and it is possible to identify the sentiment of the discussants with the original model with no loss in accuracy.",
        "If not, we seek methods that detect this shift and trigger the use of an adaptation method.",
        "Our domain shift detection problem can be decomposed into two subproblems: detecting distributional changes in streams of real numbers, and representing a stream of examples as a stream of real numbers informative for distribution change detection.",
        "We select the A-distance metric (Kifer et al., 2004) to solve the first subproblem since it has been previously used in other domain adaptation work (Blitzer et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "Our main contribution is towards the second problem, representing examples as real numbers for this task.",
        "We demonstrate that classification margins, which incorporate information about features that most impact system accuracy, can effectively solve the second subproblem.",
        "Furthermore, we show that the previously proposed Confidence Weighted learning algorithm (Dredze et al., 2008) can provide a more informative measure than a simple margin for this task.",
        "Our experiments include evaluations on commonly used domain adaptation data and false change scenarios, as well as comparisons to supervised detection methods that observe label values, or have knowledge of the target domain.",
        "We begin with a description of our task and previous applications to language data.",
        "After describing the data used in this paper, we discuss the A-distance metric and how it has previously been used for adaptation.",
        "We then show that margin based methods effectively capture information to detect domain shifts, and propose an alternate way of generating informative margin values.",
        "Finally, we compare our results to settings with supervised knowledge, and close with a survey of related work."

        "The study of domain shifts in language data has been the purview of domain adaptation and transfer learning, which seek to adapt or transfer a model learned on one source domain with labeled data to another target domain with few or no labeled examples.",
        "Formally, errors from such transfers have two sources: differences in feature distributions and changes to labeling functions (annotation standards) (Ben-David et al., 2006; Ben-David et al., 2009).",
        "Empirical work on NLP domain shifts has focused on the former.",
        "For example, Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) learned correspondences between features across domains and Jiang and Zhai (2007) weighted source domain examples by their similarity to the target distribution.",
        "We continue in this tradition by making two assumptions about our setting.",
        "First, a change in domain will be signaled by a change in the feature distributions.",
        "That is, new words, phrases, syntactic structures, etc.",
        "signal that the system has shifted to a new domain.",
        "Second, while there may be a change in the labeling function, i.e., features have a different meaning in each domain, this will be a secondary concern.",
        "For example, both Daumé (2007) and Dredze and Crammer (2008b) assume that domains are more similar than different.",
        "A similar problem to the one we consider is that of concept drift, where a stream of examples are labeled with a shifting labeling function (concept) (Nishida and Yamauchi, 2007; Widmer and Kubat, 1996).",
        "While concept drift is similar there are two important differences.",
        "First, concept drift can be measured using a stream of labeled examples, so system accuracy is directly measured.",
        "For example, Klinkenberg and Joachims (2000) detect concept drift with support vector machines, using estimates of leave-one-out performance to adaptively adjust and maintain a training window that minimizes estimated generalization error.",
        "This is possible only because class labels arrive with the examples in the stream.",
        "Another concept drift detection algorithm, STEPD, uses a statistical test to continually monitor the possibly changing stream, measuring system accuracy directly, again using the labels it receives for each example (Nishida, 2008).",
        "Obviously, no such labels are available in our unsupervised setting.",
        "Second, concept drift assumes only changes in the labeling function, whereas domain adaptation relies on feature distribution changes.",
        "Several properties of detecting domain shifts in natural language streams distinguish it from traditional domain adaptation, concept drift, and other related tasks:",
        "• No Target Distribution Examples Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) estimate the loss in accuracy from domain shift by discriminating between two data distributions.",
        "In our setting, we have no knowledge of the target distribution.",
        "• No Labeled Target Data Some approaches to domain adaptation assume a limited number of labeled examples (Daume, 2007; Dredze and Crammer, 2008b; Finkel and Manning, 2009).",
        "We assume no labels in our setting.",
        "• Online Setting Domain adaptation typically assumes a batch transfer between two domains.",
        "We consider a purely stream (online) setting.",
        "• Computationally Constrained Our approach must be fast, as we expect to run our domain shift detector alongside a deployed NLP system.",
        "This limits both computation and storage.",
        "• Unknown Adaptation A critical assumption of previous work is that a domain change has occurred.",
        "We must ascertain this ourselves.",
        "Despite these challenges, we show unsupervised stream-based methods that effectively identify shifts in domain in language data.",
        "Furthermore, our methods are tied directly to the learning task so are sensitive to changes in actual task accuracy.",
        "Our methods have low false positive rates of change detection, which is important since examples within a single domain display a large amount of variance, which could be mistaken for a domain change.",
        "Once a change is detected, any number of actions may be appropriate.",
        "The maintainer of the system may be notified that performance is suffering, labels can be obtained for a sample of instances from the stream for retraining, or large volumes of unla-beled instances can be used for instance reweighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007)."

        "Since the A-distance assumes a stream of single values, we can apply an A-distance detector to each feature (e.g., unigram and bigram count) individually.",
        "However, our extensive experiments with this approach (omitted here) show that it suffers from a number of flaws, such as a high false positive rate if all features are tracked, the difficult problem of identifying an informative subset of features for tracking, and deciding how many such features need to change before a shift has occurred, which turns out to be highly variable between shifts.",
        "Therefore, our goal is to use a single A-distance tracker by collapsing each example to a single value.",
