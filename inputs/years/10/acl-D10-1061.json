        "In light of these constraints, an attractive strategy is to construct the smallest possible parallel training corpus with which a desired performance benchmark may be achieved.",
        "Such a corpus may be constructed by selecting the most informative instances from a large collection of source sentences for translation by a human expert, a technique often referred to as active learning.",

        "The top-ranked sentences are chosen for manual translation.",
        "However, this approach requires that the pool have the same distributional characteristics as the development sets used to train the ranking model.",

        "In the case of error-driven active learning, we attempt to learn an ordering model based on errors observed on the held-out development set D. We achieve this in an innovative fashion by casting the ranking problem as a pairwise sentence comparison problem.",
        "This approach, inspired by Ailon and Mohri (2008), involves the construction of a binary classifier functioning as a relational operator that can be used to order the candidate sentences.",
        "The pairwise comparator is trained on an ordering of D that ranks constituent sentences in decreasing order of the number of translation errors.",
        "The comparator is then used to rank the candidate pool in decreasing order of potential translation error reduction.",
        "Given a pair of source sentences (u, v), we define, adopting the notation of Ailon and Mohri (2008), the pairwise comparator h(u, v) as follows:",
        "In Equation 1, the binary comparator h(u, v) plays the role of the \"less than\" (\"<\") relational operator, returning 1 if u is preferred to v in an ordered list, and 0 otherwise.",
        "As detailed in Ailon and Mohri (2008), the comparator must satisfy the constraint that h(u, v) and h(v, u) be complementary, i.e. h(u, v) + h(v, u) = 1 to avoid ambiguity.",
        "However, it need not satisfy the triangle inequality.",
        "We implement h(u, v) as a combination of discriminative maximum entropy classifiers triggered by feature functions drawn from n-grams ofu and v. We define p(u, v) as the conditional posterior probability of the Bernoulli event u < v given (u, v) as shown in Equation 2.",
        "In our implementation, p(u,v) is the output of a binary maximum-entropy classifier trained on the development set.",
        "However, this implementation poses two problems.",
        "First, if we use constituent n-grams of u and v as feature functions to trigger the classifier, there is no way to distinguish between (u, v) and (v, u) as they will trigger the same feature functions.",
        "This will result in identical values for p(u, v) and p(v, u), a contradiction.",
        "We resolve this issue by introducing a set of \"complementary\" feature functions, which are formed by simply appending a recognizable identifier to the existing n-gram feature funcu: how are you v: i am going tions.",
        "Then, to evaluate p(u,v), for instance, we invoke the classifier with standard feature functions for u and complementary feature functions for v. Similarly, p(v, u) is evaluated by triggering complementary feature functions for u and standard feature functions for v. Table 1 illustrates this with a simple example.",
        "Note that each feature function is associated with a real value, whose magnitude is an indicator of its importance.",
        "In our implementation, an n-gram feature function (standard or complementary) receives a value equal to its length.",
        "This is based on our intuition that longer n-grams play a more important role in dictating SMT performance.",
        "Second, the introduction of complementary triggers implies that evaluation of p(u,v) and p(v,u) now involves disjoint sets offeature functions.",
        "Thus, p( u, v) is not guaranteed to satisfy the complementarity condition imposed on h(u, v), and therefore cannot directly be used as the binary pairwise comparator.",
        "We resolve this by normalizing across the two possible permutations, as follows:",
        "Since h'(u,v) + h'(v,u) = 1, the complementarity constraint is now satisfied, and h(u, v) is just a binarized (thresholded) version of hh(u, v).",
        "Thus, the binary pairwise comparator can be constructed from the permuted classifier outputs.",
        "Training the maximum-entropy classifier for the pairwise comparator requires a set of target labels and input feature functions, both of which are derived from the held-out development set D. We begin by decoding the source sentences in D with the seed SMT system, followed by error analysis using the Translation Edit Rate (TER) measure (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "TER measures translation quality by computing the number of edits (insertions, substitutions, and deletions) and shifts required to transform a translation hypothesis to its corresponding reference.",
        "We then rank D in decreasing order of the number of post-shift edits, i.e. the number of insertions, substitutions, and deletions after the shift operation is completed.",
        "Since shifts are often due to word reordering issues within the SMT decoder (especially for phrase-based systems), we do not consider them as errors for the purpose of ranking D. Sentences at the top of the ordered list D' contain the maximum number of translation errors.",
        "For each pair of sentences (u, v) : u < v in D', we generate two training entries.",
        "The first, signifying that u appears before v in D', assigns the label true to a trigger list consisting of standard feature functions derived from u, and complementary feature functions derived from v. The second, reinforcing this observation, assigns the label false to a trigger list consisting of complementary feature functions from u, and standard feature functions from v. The labeled training set (feature:label pairs) for the comparator can be expressed as follows:",
        "Thus, if there are d sentences in D', we obtain a total of d(d – 1) labeled examples to train the comparator.",
        "We use the standard L-BFGS optimization algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) to estimate the parameters of the maximum entropy model.",
        "The discriminatively-trained pairwise comparator can be used as a relational operator to sort the candidate pool P in decreasing order of potential translation error reduction.",
        "A batch of predetermined size K can then be selected from the top of this list to augment the existing SMT training corpus.",
        "Assuming the pool contains N candidate sentences, and given a fast sorting algorithm such as Quicksort, the complexity of this strategy is O(N log N).",
        "Batches can be selected iteratively until a specified performance threshold is achieved.",
        "A potential downside of this approach reveals itself when there is redundancy in the candidate pool.",
        "Since the batch is selected in a single atomic operation from the sorted candidates, and because similar or identical sentences will typically occupy the same range in the ordered list, it is likely that this approach will result in batches with low diversity.",
        "Whereas we desire diverse batches for better coverage and efficient use of manual translation resources.",
        "This issue was previously addressed in Shen et al.",
        "(2004) in the context of named-entity recognition, where they used a two-step procedure to first select the most informative and representative samples, followed by a diversity filter.",

        "Based on these ideas, we design a greedy selection strategy using the discriminative relational operator.",
        "Rather than perform a full sort on P, we simply invoke the minh(M>v) (• ' • ) function to find the sentence that potentially minimizes translation error.",
        "The subscript indicates that our implementation of this function utilizes the discriminative relational operator trained on the development set D. The best choice sentence s is then added to our batch at the current position (we begin with an empty batch).",
        "We then remove the standard and complementary feature functions f(s) and f'(s) triggered by s from the global pool of feature functions obtained from D, so that they do not play a role in the selection of subsequent sentences for the batch.",
        "Subsequently, a candidate sentence that is similar or identical to Algorithm 1 Greedy Discriminative Selection for k = 1 to K do end for return B s will not be preferred, because the feature functions that previously caused it to rank highly will no longer trigger.",
        "Algorithm 1 summarizes our selection strategy in pseudocode.",
