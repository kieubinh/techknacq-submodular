        "Phrase translation estimation in Statistical Phrase-based Translation (Koehn et al., 2003) is hampered by the availability of both too many and too few training instances.",
        "Recent results on tera-scale SMT (Lopez, 2008) show that access to many training examples can lead to significant improvements in translation quality.",
        "Also, providing indirect training instances via synonyms or paraphrases for previously unseen phrases can result in gains in translation quality, which are more apparent when little training data is originally available (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Marton et al., 2009; Mirkin et al., 2009; Aziz et al., 2010).",
        "Although there is a consensus on the importance of using more parallel data in SMT, it has never been formally shown that all additional training instances are actually useful in predicting contextually appropriate translation hypotheses.",
        "!To be more accurate, works such as that of (Lopez, 2008) have recourse to random sampling to build models of a manageable size in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "Attempts at limiting training parallel sentences to those resembling test data through thematic adaptation (Hildebrand et al., 2005) indeed confirm that large quantities of training data cannot compensate for the requirement for contextually appropriate training instances.",
        "In fact, it is important that phrase translation models adequatly reflect contextual preferences for each phrase occurrence in a text.",
        "A variety of recent works have used dynamically adapted translation models, where each phrase occurrence has its own translation distribution (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Stroppa et al., 2007; Max et al., 2008; Gimpel and Smith, 2008; Haque et al., 2009) derived from local contextual information in the training examples.",
        "These approaches are supported by the study of (Wisniewski et al., 2010) which shows that phrase-based SMT systems are expressive enough to achieve very high translation performance and therefore suggests a better scoring of phrases.",
        "The apparent tradeoff between the number of training examples and their appropriateness in each indivual context naturally asks for means of increasing the number of appropriate examples.",
        "Exploiting comparable corpora for acquiring translation equivalents (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009) offers interesting prospects to this issue, but so far focus has not been so much on context appropriateness as on globally increasing the number of biphrase examples.",
        "The approach we take in this article is motivated by the fact that natural language allows for multiple text views on a given content, and that if two phrases are good paraphrases in context, then considering appropriate training examples of one of the phrases could provide larger quantities of training data for translating the other.",
        "In other words, we hypothesize that there may be more training data to learn a phrase's translations in a bilingual corpus than what SMT approaches typically use.",
        "In contrast to previous attempts at using paraphrases to improve Statistical Machine Translation, which require external data in the form of additional parallel bilingual corpora (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), monolingual corpora (Marton et al., 2009), lexico-semantic resources (Mirkin et al., 2009; Aziz et al., 2010), or sub-sentential (Resnik et al., 2010) or sentential paraphrases of the input (Schroeder et al., 2009), the approach we take here can be endogenous with respect to the original training data.",
        "It also significantly departs from previous work in that paraphrasing is not simply considered as a way of finding alternative wordings that can be translated given the original training data for out-of-vocabulary phrases only (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Marton but as a means to better estimate translations for any possible phrase.",
        "Also, as opposed to the work by (Schroeder et al., 2009; Onishi et al., 2010; Du et al., 2010), we do not encode paraphrases into input lattices to have them compete against each other to belong to the source sentential paraphrase that will lead to the highest scoring output sentence.",
        "Instead, we make use of all contextually appropriate paraphrases of a source phrase, which collectively evaluate the quality of each translation for that phrase.",
        "This work can thus be seen as a contribution towards shifting from global phrase translation distributions to contextual translation distributions for contextually equivalent source units.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as followed.",
        "In section 2 we review relevant previous works and discuss how they differ from our approach.",
        "Section 3 provides a description of the details of our approach.",
        "We describe an experimental setup in section 4 and comment on our results.",
        "Finally, we discuss our future work in section 5."

        "In standard approaches to phrase-based SMT, evidence of a translation is accumulated uniformely every time it is found associated with a source phrase in the training corpus.",
        "In addition to the fact that errors in automatic word alignment and non literal translations often produce useless biphrases, this results in rare but appropriate translations being very unlikely to be considered during decoding.",
        "Some approaches on source context modelling (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Stroppa et al., 2007; Max et al., 2008; Haque et al., 2009) build classifiers offline for the phrases in a test set, so that context similarity can for example reinforce scores associated with rare but appropriate translations.",
        "However, heavy offline computation makes scaling to larger corpora an issue.",
        "Other approaches (Callison-Burch et al., 2005; Lopez, 2008) instead focus on accessing very large corpora.",
        "Indexing by suffix arrays is used to allow fast access to phrase instances in the corpus, and random sampling to avoid collecting the full set of examples has been shown to perform well.",
        "However, these approaches consider all instances of a phrase as equivalent for the estimation of its translations.",
        "These works converge on the need for accessing a sufficient number of examples that are relevant for any source phrase in context, fast enough to permit on-the-fly phrase table building.",
        "This paper proposes an intermediate step: the full set of phrase examples is found efficiently, and a measure of the adequacy of each example with a phrase in context provides evidence for its translation that depends on this value of adequacy.",
        "In this way, the translation associated with an example for a different sense of a polysemous word would in the best scenario only be considered marginally when computing the translation distribution.",
        "As in most previous works, adequacy can be approximated by context similarity between phrase occurrences and training examples.",
        "Ideally, one would stop extracting examples when enough appropriate examples have been found to estimate a reliable translation distribution.",

        "As Table 1 shows, quality (in terms of BLEU scores) almost remains constant for samples of size 100 or more.",
        "This apparent confirmation of the efficiency of random sampling is backed up by the authors with the following possible explanations: 1) the most probable translations remain the same for different sample sizes; 2) misestimated probabilities are ruled out by the target language model; and 3) longer or less frequent phrases, which are not affected by sampling, are preferred.",
        "However, as said previously, random sampling cannot guarantee that contextually-appropriate examples are selected.",
        "In fact, (Lopez, 2008) points out to using discrimi-natively trained models with contextual features of source phrases in conjunction with phrase sampling as an open problem.",
        "This work does not attempt to directly address it, but instead resorts to complete analysis of the training data to guarantee that all contextually-appropriate examples are considered.",
        "For some phrases, not enough examples can be found in the training corpus to estimate reliable translation probabilities in context.",
        "In such cases, one might be interested in finding more appropriate examples, which seems at first impossible using the sole original bilingual corpus.",
        "We can in fact consider the set of source phrases that have similar translations in context.",
        "This set is roughly made up of a subset of what can be referred to as paraphrases.",
        "One possible approach to extract local (i.e. phrasal) paraphrases precisely exploits similarity on the target side in another language by extracting source phrases that share common translations (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), but recent approaches have combined this approach with",

        "Other examples, however, clearly illustrate the need for validation in context: (Dalai Lama's <-> of the Dalai Lama) require different syntactic contexts, and (I don't see <-> I do not believe) are only interchangeable in specific semantic contexts.",
        "Previous attempts at exploiting paraphrases in SMT have first concentrated on obtaining translations for phrases absent from the training corpus",

        "3 Towards better exploitation of training corpora in phrase-based SMT",
        "In typical phrase-based SMT settings (Koehn et al., 2003), words from the source side of the corpus are first aligned to words on the target side and biphrases are extracted from each training sentence using some heuristics on the word alignments.",
        "A source phrase f in a sentence being translated may therefore be aligned to a variety of target phrases.",
        "In the example on Figure 3, f is aligned some number of times in the training corpus to target phrases e1, e2, e3 and e5.",

        "count(f,ei)",
        "This value, together with other estimates of how appropriate a translation pair (f, e^) is, are recorded in a phrase table, which typically discards all contextual information.",
        "Therefore, the translation distribution of some phrase is globally estimated from a training corpus independently of the actual context of that phrase.",
        "On Figure 3, phrase f has at least two distinct senses: one represented by set E, which in our example corresponds to the appropriate sense for a particular occurrence of f in a test sentence; and one which corresponds to translation e5.",
        "A typical problem, due to the lack of context modeling,",

        "Set E represents target phrase types that are acceptable translations given the particular context of f, and set F represents source phrase types that can be in a paraphrasing relation to f depending on the context they appear in.",
        "is that in situations such as Vei G E, count(f, e5) » count(f, ei), it is very unlikely that a correct translation will be selected during decoding against the incorrect but much more frequent one.",
        "Taking an extreme view on this issue, it is in fact desirable that when estimating phrase translation probabilities for a phrase f , translations of incompatible senses be not considered.",
        "Of course, this raises the difficult issue of sense clustering of phrases.",
        "We propose here an intermediary solution, which consists in considering each occurrence in the training corpus as counting a number of times that depends on its contextual similarity with the occurrence of f from the test file, through the following additional translation model :",
        "where f is some source phrase to translate and fk an example of f in the training corpus, (fk, ei) is a biphrase from the training corpus, C(f ) the context of some source phrase, C(fk) the context of a particular example of f in the training corpus, simphra function indicating the contextual similarity between two phrase contexts, and ej is any possible translation of f.",

        "• Contextually-appropriate examples of p2 can reinforce e3.",
        "Translation e6 should correspond to contextually-inappropriate examples of p2, so e6 should not be considered as a new potential translation for f.",

        "Therefore, e4, which was not initially considered as a possible translation of f, could now be considered as such.",
        "• p4 shares a translation with f, e2, but this is due to the polysemous nature of this translation.",
        "Again, all examples of p4 should be found contextually-inappropriate with f, and their translations should not be considered when estimating the translations of f.",
        "• Lastly, the case of the common translation e5between f and p5 illustrates a consequence of the polysemous nature of the source phrase corresponding to word sequence f : translations corresponding to other senses of f should not get reinforced by paraphrase examples such as those of p5 as these examples should be found contextually-inappropriate with f.",

        "Our experiments further showed the promises of our approach when paraphrases of higher quality are available.",
        "In the light of our results and our initial typology of paraphrases presented on Figure 10, as well as previous work on paraphrasing for SMT, the difficult question of what units should be paraphrased for what success should be addressed, taking into account parameters such as language pairs, quantity of training data and availability of external resources.",
        "Our future work includes three main areas: first, we want to improve the modeling of context, by notably working on techniques inspired from Information Retrieval to quickly access contextually-similar examples of source phrases in bilingual corpora.",
        "Such contextual sampling on large bilingual corpora for phrases and their paraphrases, which could integrate more complex linguistic information, will allow us to assess our approach on more challenging conditions.",
        "This would also allow us to build contextual models on-the-fly, and experiment with using lattices to encode contextually estimated paraphrases.",
        "Second, we will combine paraphrases obtained via different techniques and resources, which will allow us to also learn translation distributions for phrases absent from the original corpus.",
        "Lastly, we want to also exploit paraphrases for the additional translations that they propose (such as e4 on Figure 3) and that would be contextually similar in the target language to other existing translations of a given phrase or that could even represent a new sense of the original phrase."
