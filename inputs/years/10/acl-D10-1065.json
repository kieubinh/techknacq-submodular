        "Word alignment plays a central role in training statistical machine translation (SMT) systems since almost all SMT systems extract translation rules from word aligned parallel training data.",
        "Until recently, most SMT systems used GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), an unsupervised algorithm, for aligning parallel training data.",
        "In recent years, with the availability of human aligned training data, supervised methods (e.g. the ITG aligner (Haghighi et al., 2009)) have become increasingly popular.",
        "The main objective of this work is to show the two classes (unsupervised and supervised) of algorithms are complementary and combining them will improve overall system performance.",
        "The use of human aligned training data allows supervised methods such as ITG to more accurately align frequent words, such as the alignments of Chinese particles (e.g. \"bei\", \"de\", etc) to their English equivalents (e.g. \"is/are/was/..\", \"of, etc).",
        "On the other hand, supervised methods can be affected by suboptimal alignments in hand-aligned data.",
        "For example, the hand-aligned data used in our experiments contain some coarse-grained alignments (e.g. \"lian-he guo\" to \"United Nations\") although fine-grained alignments (\"lian-he\" to \"United\" and \"guo\" to \"Nations\") are usually more appropriate for SMT.",
        "Unsupervised methods are less likely to be affected by this problem.",
        "We used two well studied unsupervised aligners, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and HMM (Liang et al., 2006) and one supervised aligner, ITG (Haghighi et al., 2009) as representatives in this work.",
        "We explored two techniques to combine different alignment algorithms.",
        "One is to take the union of the translation rules extracted from alignments produced by different aligners.",
        "This is motivated by studies that showed that the coverage of translation rules is critical to SMT (DeNeefe et al., 2007).",
        "The other method is to combine the outputs of different MT systems trained using different aligners.",
        "Assuming different systems make independent errors, system combination can generate a better translation than those of individual systems through voting (Rosti et al., 2007).",
        "Our work differs from previous work in two ways.",
        "Past studies of combining alternative alignments focused on minimizing alignment errors, usually by merging alternative alignments for a sentence pair into a single alignment with the fewest number of incorrect alignment links (Ayan and Dorr, 2006).",
        "In contrast, our work is based on the assumption that perfect word alignment is impossible due to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem, and it is more effective to resolve translation ambiguities at later stages of the MT pipeline.",
        "A main focus of much previous work on word alignments is on theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithms.",
        "In contrast, the nature of this work is purely empirical.",
        "Our system was trained on a large amount of training data and evaluated on multiple languages (Chinese-to-English and Arabic-to-English) and multiple genres (newswire and weblog).",
        "Furthermore, we used a state of the art string-to-tree decoder (Shen et al., 2008) to establish the strongest possible baseline.",
        "In comparison, experiments in previous studies typically used one language pair and one genre (usually newswire), a reduced amount of training data and a phrase based decoder.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the three alignment algorithms.",
        "Section 3 describes the two methods used to combine these aligners to improve MT.",
        "The experimental setup used to compare these methods is presented in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 shows the results including a discussion.",
        "Section 6 discusses related work.",

        "The TER improvements are mostly explained by the hypothesis alignment algorithm which is closely related to TER scoring (Rosti et al., 2009).",
        "The results are interesting because all three baseline systems (GIZA++, HMM and ITG) are identical except for the word alignments used in rule extraction.",
