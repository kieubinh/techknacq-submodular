        "In the standard process, the parse selection model is trained over a hand-disambiguated treebank, meaning that without a significant investment of effort to produce the treebank, parse selection is not possible.",
        "Furthermore, as treebank-ing is generally streamlined with parse selection models, creating the initial treebank without a model requires more resources than subsequent treebanks.",
        "In this work, we show that, by taking advantage of the constrained nature of these HPSG grammars, we can learn a discriminative parse selection model from raw text in a purely unsupervised fashion.",
        "This allows us to bootstrap the treebanking process and provide better parsers faster, and with less resources."

        "Parsing with precision grammars is generally a two-stage process: (1) the full parse yield of the precision grammar is calculated for a given item, often in the form of a packed forest for efficiency (Oepen and Carroll, 2000; Zhang et al., 2007); and (2) the individual analyses in the parse forest are ranked using a statistical model (\"parse selection\").",
        "In the domain of treebank parsing, the Charniak and Johnson (2005) reranking parser adopts an analogous strategy, except that ranking and pruning are incorporated into the first stage, and the second stage is based on only the top-ranked parses from the first stage.",
        "For both styles of parsing, however, parse selection is based on a statistical model learned from a pre-existing treebank associated with the grammar.",
        "Our interest in this paper is in completely removing this requirement of parse selection on explicitly treebanked data, ie the development of fully unsupervised parse selection models.",
        "The particular style of precision grammar we experiment with in this paper is HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), in the form of the DELPH-IN suite of grammars (http://www.delph- in.net/).",
        "One of the main focuses of the DELPH-IN collaboration effort is multilinguality.",
        "To this end, the Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al., 2002) has been developed which, through a set of questionnaires, allows grammar engineers to quickly produce a core grammar for a language of their choice.",
        "Bender (2008) showed that by using and expanding on this core grammar, she was able to produce a broad-coverage precision grammar of Wambaya in a very short amount of time.",
        "However, the Grammar Matrix can only help with the first stage of parsing.",
        "The statistical model used in the second stage of parsing (ie parse selection) requires a treebank to learn the features, but as we explain in Section 2, the treebanks are created by parsing, preferably with a statistical model.",
        "In this work, we look at methods for bootstrapping the production of these statistical models without having an annotated treebank.",
        "Since many of the languages that people are building new grammars for are under-resourced, we can't depend on having any external information or NLP tools, and so the methods we examine are purely unsupervised, using nothing more than the grammars themselves and raw text.",
        "We find that, not only can we produce models that are suitable for kick-starting the treebanking process, but the accuracy of these models is comparable to parsers trained on gold standard data (Clark and Curran, 2007b; Miyao and Tsujii, 2008), which have been successfully used in applications (Miyao et al., 2008)."

        "The current method of training a parse selection model uses the [incr tsdb()] treebanking mechanism (Oepen, 2001) and works well for updating models for mature grammars, although even for these grammars, building a new model for a different domain requires a time-consuming initial treebanking effort.",
        "The treebanks used with DELPH-IN grammars are dynamic treebanks (Oepen et al., 2004) created by parsing text and having an annotator select the correct analysis (or discard all of them).",
        "The annotation process involves making binary decisions based on so-called parse discriminants (Carter, 1997).",
        "Whenever the grammar is changed, the treebank can be quickly updated by re-parsing and reapplying the old annotation decisions.",
        "This treebanking process not only produces gold standard trees, but also a set of non-gold trees which provides the negative training data necessary for a discriminative maximum entropy model.",

        "There are two issues with this process for new grammars.",
        "Firstly, treebanking takes many person-hours, and is hence both time-consuming and expensive.",
        "Complicating that is the second issue: N-best parsing requires a statistical model.",
        "While it is possible to parse exhaustively with no model, parsing is much slower, since the unpacking of results is time-consuming.",
        "Selective unpacking (Zhang et al., 2007) speeds this up a great deal, but requires a parse selection model.",
        "Treebanking is also much slower when the parser must be run exhaustively, since there are usually many more analyses to manually discard.",
        "This work hopes to alleviate both problems.",
        "By producing a statistical model without requiring human treebanking, we can have a working and efficient parser with less human effort.",
        "Even if the top-1 parses this parser produces are not as accurate as those trained on gold standard data, this model can be used to produce the N-best analyses for the treebanker.",
        "Since our models are much better than random selection, we can afford to reduce N and still have a reasonable likelihood that the correct parse is in that top N, making the job of the treebanker much faster, and potentially leading to even better parse selection accuracy based on semi-supervised or fully-supervised parse selection."

        "That is to say, from the lexicon we could learn that the lemma walk can be tagged as v_pp*_dir_le, but we could not directly extract the fact that therefore walked should also receive that tag.",
        "For this reason, we decided it would be simplest to initialise our probability estimates using the output of the parser, feeding in only those tag sequences which are compatible with analyses in the parse forest for that item.",
        "This method takes advantage of the fact that, because the grammars are heavily constrained, the parse forest only contains viable tag sequences.",
        "Since parsing without a model is slow, we restricted the training set to those sentences shorter than a specific word length (12 for English and 15 for Japanese, since that was the less ambiguous grammar and hence faster).",
        "Table 7 shows how much parsed data this gave us.",
        "From this parsed data we extracted tag-to-word and tag-to-tag frequency counts from all parses for all sentences, and used these frequencies to produce the emission and transition probabilities, respectively.",
        "The emission probabilities were taken directly from the normalised frequency counts, but for the transition probabilities we allow for all possible transitions, and add one to all counts before normalising.",
        "This model we call our initial counts model.",
        "The EM trained model is then produced by starting with this initial model and running the Baum-Welch algorithm using raw text sentences from the training corpus.",
        "We use both the initial counts and EM trained models to tag the training data from Table 1 and then compared this with the extracted tag sequences",
        "Table 7: Training data for the HMM tagger (both the parsed data from which the initial probabilities were derived, and the raw data which was used to estimated the EM trained models).",
        "Table8: Accuracy using tag sequences fromaHMMtag-ger to select the 'correct' parse(s).",
        "The initial counts model was based on using counts from a parse forest to approximate the emission and transition probabilities.",

        "used in the gold tag experiment.",
        "Since we could no longer assume that our tag sequence would be present within the extracted tag sequences, we used the percentage of tokens from a parse whose lextype matched our tagged sequence as the parse score.",
        "Again, we marked as 'gold' any parse that had the best parse score for each sentence, and trained a new parse selection model.",
        "Table 8 shows the results of parsing with these models.",
        "The results are impressive, significantly higher than all our previous unsupervised methods.",
        "Interestingly, we note that there is no significant difference between the initial count and EM trained models for the English data.",
        "To explore why this might be so, we looked at the tagger accuracy for both models over the respective training data sets, shown in Table 9.",
        "The results are not conclusive.",
        "For both languages, the EM trained model is less accurate, though not significantly so for Japanese.",
        "However, this insignificant tagger accuracy decrease for Japanese produced a significant increase in parser accuracy, while a more pronounced tagger accuracy decrease had no significant effect on parser accuracy in English.",
