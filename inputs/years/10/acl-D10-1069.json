        "Parsing accuracies on the popular Section 23 of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank have been steadily improving over the past decade.",
        "At this point, we have many different parsing models that reach and even surpass 90% dependency or constituency accuracy on this test set (McDonald et al., 2006; Nivre et al., 2007; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006; Carreras et al., 2008; Koo and Collins, 2010).",
        "Quite impressively, models based on deterministic shift-reduce parsing algorithms are able to rival the other computationally more expensive models (see Nivre (2008) and references therein for more details).",
        "Their linear running time makes them ideal candidates for large scale text processing, and our model of choice for this paper.",
        "Unfortunately, the parsing accuracies of all models have been reported to drop significantly on out-of-domain test sets, due to shifts in vocabulary and grammar usage (Gildea, 2001; McClosky et al., 2006b; Foster, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we focus our attention on the task of parsing questions.",
        "Questions pose interesting challenges for WSJ-trained parsers because they are heavily underrepresented in the training data (there are only 334 questions among the 39,832 training sentences).",
        "At the same time, questions are of particular interest for user facing applications like question answering or web search, which necessitate parsers that can process questions in a fast and accurate manner.",
        "We start our investigation in Section 3 by training several state-of-the-art (dependency and constituency) parsers on the standard WSJ training set.",
        "When evaluated on a question corpus, we observe dramatic accuracy drops exceeding 20% for the deterministic shift-reduce parsers.",
        "In general, dependency parsers (McDonald et al., 2006; Nivre et al., 2007), seem to suffer more from this domain change than constituency parsers (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "Overall, the latent variable approach of Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) appears to generalize best to this new domain, losing only about 5%.",

        "We therefore propose an uptraining method, in which a deterministic shift-reduce parser is trained on the output of a more accurate, but slower parser (Section 4).",
        "This type of domain adaptation is reminiscent of self-training (McClosky et al., 2006a; Huang and Harper, 2009) and co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Sagae and Lavie, 2006), except that the goal here is not to further improve the performance of the very best model.",
        "Instead, our aim is to train a computationally cheaper model (a linear time dependency parser) to match the performance of the best model (a cubic time constituency parser), resulting in a computationally efficient, yet highly accurate model.",
        "In practice, we parse a large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain with the constituency parser of Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) and then train a deterministic dependency parser on this noisy, automatically parsed data.",
        "The accuracy of the linear time parser on a question test set goes up from 60.06% (LAS) to 76.94% after uptraining, which is comparable to adding 2,000 labeled questions to the training data.",
        "Combining uptraining with 2,000 labeled questions further improves the accuracy to 84.14%, fully recovering the drop between in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy.",
        "We also present a detailed error analysis in Section 5, showing that the errors of the WSJ-trained model are primarily caused by sharp changes in syntactic configurations and only secondarily due to lexical shifts.",

        "The questions in the Ques-tionBank are very different from our training data in terms of grammatical constructions and vocabulary usage, making this a rather extreme case of domainadaptation.",
        "We split the 4,000 questions contained in this corpus in three parts: the first 2,000 questions are reserved as a small target-domain training set; the remaining 2,000 questions are split in two equal parts, the first serving as development set and the second as our final test set.",
        "We report accuracies on the developments sets throughout this paper, and test only at the very end on the final test set.",
        "We convert the trees in both treebanks from constituencies to labeled dependencies (see Figure 1) using the Stanford converter, which produces 46 types of labeled dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "We evaluate on both unlabeled (UAS) and labeled dependency accuracy (LAS).",
        "Additionally, we use a set of 2 million questions collected from Internet search queries as unla-beled target domain data.",

        "), and (ii) the queries have a maximum length of 160 characters.",
        "We use multiple publicly available parsers, as well as our own implementation of a deterministic shift-reduce parser in our experiments.",
        "The dependency parsers that we compare are the deterministic shift-reduce MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) and the second-order minimum spanning tree algorithm based MstParser (McDonald et al., 2006).",
        "Ourshift-reduce parser is a reimplementation of the Malt-Parser, using a standard set of features and a linear kernel SVM for classification.",
        "We also train and evaluate the generative lexicalized parser of Char-niak (2000) on its own, as well as in combination with the discriminative reranker of Charniak and Johnson (2005).",

        "BerkeleyParser) of Petrov etal.",

        "To facilitate comparisons between constituency and dependency parsers, we convert the output of the constituency parsers to labeled dependencies using the same procedure that is applied to the treebanks.",
        "We also report their Fi scores for completeness.",
        "While the constituency parsers used in our experiments view part-of-speech (POS) tagging as an integral part of parsing, the dependency parsers require the input to be tagged with a separate POS tagger.",
        "We use the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) in our experiments, because of its efficiency and ease of use.",

        "Part of the reason for the lower POS tagging accuracy is the higher unknown word ratio (7.3% on the question evaluation set, compared to 3.4% on the WSJ evaluation set).",
        "Another reason is a change in the lexical distribution.",
        "For example, wh-determiners (WDT) are quite rare in the WSJ training data (relative frequency 0.45%), but five times more common in the QuestionBank training data (2.49%).",

        "Not surprisingly the most common POS error involves wh-determiners (typically the word \"what\") being incorrectly labeled as Wh-pronouns (WP), resulting in head and label errors like the one shown in Figure 3(a).",
