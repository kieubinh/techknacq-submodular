        "Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the analysis of linguistic scope in natural language.",
        "The task of scope learning deals with the syntactic analysis of what part of a given sentence is under user's special interest.",
        "For example, of negation assertion concerned, a negation cue (e.g., not, no) usually dominates a fragment of the given sentence, rather than the whole sentence, especially when the sentence is long.",
        "Generally, scope learning involves two subtasks: cue recognition and its scope identification.",
        "The former decides whether a word or phrase in a sentence is a cue of a special interest, where the semantic information of the word or phrase, rather than the syntactic information, plays a critical role.",
        "The latter determines the sequences of words in the sentence which are dominated by the given cue.",
        "Recognizing the scope of a special interest (e.g., negative assertion and speculative assertion) is essential in information extraction (IE), whose aim is to derive factual knowledge from free text.",
        "For example, Vincze et al.",
        "(2008) pointed out that the extracted information within the scope of a negation or speculation cue should either be discarded or presented separately from factual information.",
        "This is especially important in the biomedical and scientific domains, where various linguistic forms are used extensively to express impressions, hypothesized explanations of experimental results or negative findings.",
        "Besides, Vincez et al.",
        "(2008) reported that 13.45% and 17.70% of the sentences in the abstracts subcorpus of the BioScope corpus contain negative and speculative assertions, respectively, while 12.70% and 19.44% of the sentences in the full papers subcorpus contain negative and speculative assertions, respectively.",
        "In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002).",
        "For example, in the sentence \"The chair is not comfortable but cheap\", although both the polarities of the words \"comfortable\" and \"cheap\" are positive, the polarity of \"the chair\" regarding the attribute \"cheap\" keeps positive while the polarity of \"the chair\" regarding the attribute \"comfortable\" is reversed due to the negation cue \"not\".",
        "Similarly, seeing the increasing interest in speculation scope learning, the CoNLL'2010 shared task (Farkas et al., 2010) aims to detect uncertain information in resolving the scopes of speculation cues.",
        "Most of the initial research in this literature focused on either recognizing negated terms or identifying speculative sentences, using some heuristic",

        "(2008) and Morante and Daelemans (2009a & 2009b) pioneered the research on scope learning by formulating it as a chunking problem, which classifies the words of a sentence as being inside or outside the scope of a cue.",
        "Alternatively, Özgür and Radev (2009) and 0vrelid et al.",
        "(2010) defined heuristic rules for speculation scope learning from constituency and dependency parse tree perspectives, respectively.",
        "Although the chunking approach has been evaluated on negation and speculation scope learning and can be easily ported to other scope learning tasks, it ignores syntactic information and suffers from low performance.",
        "Alternatively, even if the rule-based methods may be effective for a special scope learning task (e.g., speculation scope learning), it is not readily adoptable to other scope learning tasks (e.g., negation scope learning).",
        "Instead, this paper explores scope learning from parse tree perspective and formulates it as a simplified shallow semantic parsing problem, which has been extensively studied in the past few years (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005).",
        "In particular, the cue is recast as the predicate and the scope is recast as the arguments of the cue.",
        "The motivation behind is that the structured syntactic information plays a critical role in scope learning and should be paid much more attention, as indicated by previous studies in shallow semantic parsing (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2005).",

        "The GTB1.0 corpus contains 18,541 sentences in which 11,850 of them (63.91%) overlap with the sentences in the abstracts subcorpus.",
        "In order to get automatic parse trees, we train the Berkeley parser with the remaining 6,691 sentences in GTB1.0, which achieves the performance of 85.22 in F1-measure on the remaining 11,850 sentences in GTB1.0.",
        "Table 6 shows the performance of scope identification on automatic parse trees and golden cues.",
        "In addition, we also report an oracle performance to explore the best possible performance of our system by assuming that our scope finder can always correctly determine whether a candidate is an argument or not.",
        "That is, if an argument candidate falls within the golden scope, then it is a argument.",
        "This is to measure the impact of automatic syntactic parsing itself.",
        "Table 6 shows that:",
        "1) For both negation and speculaiton scope identification, automatic syntactic parsing lowers the performance on the abstracts subcorpus (e.g., from 83.10% to 81.84% in accuracy for negation scope identification and from 86.41% to 83.74% in accuracy for speculaiton scope identification).",
        "However, the performance drop shows that both negation and speculation scope identification are not as senstive to automatic syntactic parsing as common shallow semantic parsing, whose performance might decrease by about ~10 in F1-measure (Toutanova et al., 2005).",
        "This indicates that scope identification via simplified shallow semantic parsing is robust to some variations in the parse trees.",
        "2) Although speculation scope identification consistently achieves higher performance than negaiton scope identification when golden parse trees are availabe, speculation scope identification achieves comparable performance with negation scope identification on the abstracts subcorpus and the full papers",
        "subcorpus while speculation scope identification even performs ~20% lower in accuracy than negation scope identification on the clinical report subcorpus.",
        "This is largely due to that specuaiton scope identification is more sensitive to syntactic parsing errors than negation scope identification due to the wider scope of a speculation cue while the sentences of the clinical reports come from a different genre, which indicates low performance in syntactic parsing.",
        "3) Given the performance gap between the performance of our scope finder and the oracle performance, there is still much room for further performance improvement.",
        "Table 7: Performance comparison of our system with the state-of-the-art ones in accuracy (%).",
        "Note that all the performances achieved on the full papers subcorpus and the clinical subcorpus are achieved using the whole GTB1.0 corpus of 18,541 sentences while all the performances achieved on the abstract subcorpus are achieved using 6,691 sentences from GTB1.0 due to overlap of the abstract subcorpus with GTB1.0.",
        "Table 7 compares our performance with related ones.",
        "It shows that even our baseline system with the four basic features presented in Table 1 achieves comparable performance with Morante et 2009b).",
        "This further indicates the appropriateness of our simplified shallow semantic parsing approach and the effectiveness of structured syntactic information on scope identification.",
        "It also shows that our final system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ones using a chunking approach, especially on the abstracts and full papers subcor-pora.",
        "However, the improvement on the clinical reports subcorpora for negation scope identification is much less apparent, partly due to the fact that the sentences in this subcorpus are much simpler (with average length of 6.6 words per sentence) and thus a chunking approach can achieve high performance.",
        "Table 7 also shows that our parsing approach to speculation scope identification outperforms the rule-based method in Özgür and Radev (2009), where 10-fold cross-validation is performed on both the abstracts and the full papers subcorpora.",

        "1) The performance gap of cue recognition between golden parse trees and automatic parse trees on the abstracts subcorpus is not salient (e.g., 95.61 vs. 94.67 in F1-measure for negation cues and 88.49 vs. 88.19 for speculation cues), largely due to the features defined for cue recognition are local and insenstive to syntactic variations.",
        "2) The performance of negation cue recognition is higher than that of speculation cue recognition on all the three subcorpora.",
        "This is prabably due to the fact that the collection of negation cue words or phrases is limitted while speculation cue words or phrases are more open.",
        "This is illustrated by our statistics that about only 1% and 1% of negation cues in the full papers and the clinical reports subcorpora are absent from the abstracts subcorpus, compared to about 6% and 20% for speculation cues.",
        "3) Unexpected, the recall of speculation cue recognition on the clinical reports subcorpus is very low (i.e., 33.33% in recall measure).",
        "This is probably due to the absence of about 20% speculation cues from the training data of the abstracts subcorpus.",
        "Moreover, the speculation cue \"or\", which accounts for about 24% of specuaiton cues in the clinical reports subcorpus, only acheives about 2% in recall largely due to the errors caused by the classifier trained on the abstracts subcorpus, where only about 11% of words \"or\" are annotated as speculation cues.",
        "Scope Identification with Automatic Cue Recognition",
        "Table 10 lists the performance of both negation and speculation scope identification with automatic cues and automatic parse trees.",
        "It shows that automatic cue recognition lowers the performance by 3.34, 6.80, and 8.38 in F1-measure for negation scope identification on the abstracts, the full papers and the clinical reports subcorpora, respectively, while it lowers the performance by 6.50, 13.14 and 31.23 in F1-measures for speculation scope identification on the three subcorpora, respectively, suggesting the big challenge of cue recognition in the two scope learning tasks.",
