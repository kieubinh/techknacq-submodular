        "In this paper, we build a system that allows information to flow in both directions.",
        "We make use of semantic role predictions in choosing a single-best parse.",
        "This process relies on an averaged perceptron model to distinguish likely semantic roles from erroneous ones.",
        "Our system penalizes parses that give rise to low-scoring semantic roles.",
        "To explore the consequences of this we perform two experiments.",
        "First, we use a baseline generative model to produce n-best parses, which are then reordered by our semantic model.",
        "Second, we use a modified version of our semantic role labeler to predict semantic roles at parse time.",
        "The performance of this modified labeler is weaker than that of our best full SRL, because it is restricted to features that can be computed directly from the parser's packed chart.",
        "For both experiments, the resulting semantic predictions are then used to select parses.",
        "Finally, we feed the selected parses produced by each experiment to the full version of our semantic role labeler.",
        "We find that SRL performance can be improved over this baseline by selecting parses with likely semantic roles."

        "In the semantic role labeling task, words or groups of words are described in terms of their relations to a predicate.",

        "These semantic relations are distinct from syntactic relations like subject and object - the proper nouns in the sentence Leslie is admired by Robin have the same semantic relationships as Robin admires Leslie, even though the syntax differs.",
        "Although syntax and semantics do not always align with each other, they are correlated.",
        "Almost all automatic semantic role labeling systems take a syntactic representation of a sentence (taken from an automatic parser or a human annotator), and use the syntactic information to predict semantic roles.",
        "When a semantic role labeler predicts an incorrect role, it is often due to an error in the parse tree.",
        "Consider the erroneously annotated sentence from the Penn Treebank corpus shown in Figure 1.",
        "If a semantic role labeling system relies heavily upon syntactic attachment decisions, then it will likely predict that in 1956 describes the time that asbestos was used, rather than when it ceased to be used.",
        "Errors of this kind are common in treebanks and in automatic parses.",
        "It is telling, though, that while the handannotated Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), the Char-niak parser (Charniak, 2001), and the C&C parser (Clark and Curran, 2004) all produce the erroneous parse from Figure 1, the hand-annotated Propbank corpus of verbal semantic roles (Palmer et al., 2005) correctly identifies in 1956 as a temporal modifier of stopped, rather than using.",
        "This demonstrates that while syntactic attachment decisions like these are difficult for humans and for automatic parsers, a human reader has little difficulty identifying the correct semantic relationship between the temporal modifier and the verbs.",
        "This is likely due to the fact that the meaning suggested by the parse in Figure 1 is unlikely the reader instinctively feels that a temporal modifier fits better with the verb stop than with the verb use.",
        "In this paper, we will use the idea that semantic roles predicted by correct parses are more natural than semantic roles predicted by erroneous parses.",
        "By modifying a state-of-the-art CCG semantic role labeler to predict semantic roles at parse time, or by using it to select from an n-best list, we can prefer analyses that yield likely semantic roles.",

        "The only other widely used option for wide-coverage parsing is to use beam search with a narrow beam, which runs the risk of search errors.",
        "On methodological grounds we prefer an exhaustive search, since systems that rely heavily on heuristics for their efficiency are difficult to understand, debug or improve.",
        "It is straightforward to read off the highest scoring parse from a packed chart, and similarly routine to generate an n-best list containing a highly-ranked subset of the parses.",
        "However, a packed chart built on an atomic CFG does not make available all of the features that are important to many CFG-based SRL systems.",
        "In particular, the very useful treepath feature, which lists the categories touched by walking the tree from the predicate to the target word, only makes sense when you have a complete tree, so cannot easily be computed from the chart (Figure 2).",

        "The results on the test set (WSJ Section 23, <40 words) are shown in Table 5.",
        "There are many areas for potential improvement for the system.",
        "The test set scores of both of our experimental models are lower than their development set scores,where the n-best model outperforms even the Clark and Curran parser in the SRL task.",
        "This may be due to vocabulary issues (we are of course unable to evaluate if the vocabulary of the training set more closely resembles the development set or the test set).",
        "If there are vocabulary issues, they could be alleviated by experimenting with POS based lexical features, or perhaps even generalizing a latent semantics over heads of semantic roles (essentially identifying broad categories of words that appear with particular semantic roles, rather than counting on having encountered that particular word in training).",
        "Alternately, this drop in performance could be caused by a mismatch in the average length of sentences, which would cause our a factor and the size of our n-best lists (which were tuned on the development set) to be suboptimal.",
        "We anticipate the opportunity to further explore better ways of determining n-best list size.",
        "We also anticipate the possibility of integrating the semantic model with a state-of-the-art CCG parser, potentially freeing the ranker from the limitations of a simple PCFG baseline.",
        "It is also worth noting that the chart-based model seems heavily skewed towards precision.",
        "Because the parser can dig deeply into the chart, it is capable of choosing a parse that predicts only semantic roles that it is highly confident about.",
        "By choosing these parses (and not parses with less attractive semantic roles), the model can maximize the average score of the semantic roles it predicts.",
        "This tendency towards identifying only the most certain roles is consistent with high-precision low-recall results.",
        "The n-best parser has a much more restricted set of semantic roles from parses more closely resembling the single-best parse, and therefore is less likely to be presented with the opportunity to choose parses that do away with less likely (but still reasonable) roles."

        "In this paper, we discuss the procedure for identifying semantic roles at parse time, and using these roles to guide the parse.",
        "We demonstrate that using semantic roles to guide parsing can improve overall SRL performance, but that these same benefits can be realized by re-ranking an n-best list with the same model.",
        "Regardless, there are several reasons why it is useful to have the ability to predict semantic roles inside the chart.",
        "Predicting semantic roles inside the chart could be used to perform SRL on very long or unstructured passages.",
        "Neither Lorillard nor the researchers",
        "Table 5: The full system results on the test set of the WSJ corpus (Section 23).",
        "Included are the baseline parser, the n-best reranking model from Section 7, the single-best chart-unpacking model from Section 8, and the state-of-the-art C&C parser.",
        "The final row shows the SRL performance obtained by Punyakanok et al.",
        "(2008) using the Charniak parser.",
        "Unfortunately, their results are evaluated based on spans of words (rather than headword labels), which interferes with direct comparison.",
        "The Charniak parser is a CFG-style parser, making labeled dependency non-applicable.",
        "Most parsing research on the Penn Treebank (the present work included) focuses on sentences of 40 words or less, because parsing longer sentences requires an unacceptably large amount of computing resources.",
        "In practice, however, semantic roles are rarely very distant from their predicates - generally they are only a few words away; often they are adjacent.",
        "In long sentences, the prediction of an entire parse may be unnecessary for the purposes of",
        "SRL.",
        "The CKY parsing algorithm works by first predicting all constituents spanning two words, then all constituents spanning three words, then four, and so on until it predicts constituents covering the whole sentence.",
        "By setting a maximum constituent size (say, ten or fifteen), we could abandon the goal of completing a spanning analysis in favor of identifying semantic roles in the neighborhood of their predicates, eliminating the need to unpack the chart at all.",
        "This could be used to efficiently perform SRL on poorly structured text or even spoken language transcriptions that are not organized into discrete sentences.",
        "Doing so would also eliminate the potentially noisy step of automatically separating out individual sentences in a larger text.",
        "Alternately, roles predicted in the chart could even be incorporated into a low-precision-high-recall information retrieval system seeking a particular semantic relationship by scanning the chart for a particular semantic role.",
        "Another use for the packed forest of semantic roles could be to predict complete sets of roles for a given sentence using a constraint based method like integer linear programming.",
        "Integer linear programming takes a large number of candidate results (like semantic roles), and applies a set of constraints over them (like \"roles may not overlap\" or \"no more than one of each role is allowed in each sentence\") to find the optimal set.",
        "Doing so could eliminate the need to unpack the chart at all, effectively producing semantic roles without committing to a single syntactic analysis."
