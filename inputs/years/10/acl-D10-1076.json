        "Statistical language models play an important role in many practical applications, such as machine translation and automatic speech recognition.",
        "Let V be a finite vocabulary, statistical language models define distributions over sequences of words wf in V* usually factorized as:",
        "Modeling the joint distribution of several discrete random variables (such as words in a sentence) is difficult, especially in real-world Natural Language Processing applications where V typically contains dozens of thousands words.",
        "Many approaches to this problem have been proposed over the last decades, the most widely used being back-off n-gram language models.",
        "n-gram models rely on a Markovian assumption, and despite this simplification, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) remains unreliable and tends to underestimate the probability of very rare n-grams, which are hardly observed even in huge corpora.",
        "Conventional smoothing techniques, such as Kneser-Ney and Witten-Bell back-off schemes (see (Chen and Goodman, 1996) for an empirical overview, and (Teh, 2006) for a Bayesian interpretation), perform back-off on lower order distributions to provide an estimate for the probability of these unseen events.",
        "n-gram language models rely on a discrete space representation of the vocabulary, where each word is associated with a discrete index.",
        "In this model, the morphological, syntactic and semantic relationships which structure the lexicon are completely ignored, which negatively impact the generalization performance of the model.",
        "Various approaches have proposed to overcome this limitation, notably the use of word-classes (Brown et al., 1992; Niesler, 1997), of generalized back-off strategies (Bilmes et al., 1997) or the explicit integration of morphological information in the random-forest model (Xu and Jelinek, 2004; Oparin et al., 2008).",
        "One of the most successful alternative to date is to use distributed word representations (Bengio et al., 2003), where distributionally similar words are represented as neighbors in a continuous space.",
        "This turns n-grams distributions into smooth functions of the word representations.",
        "These representations and the associated probability estimates are jointly computed in a multilayer neural network architecture.",
        "This approach has showed significant and consistent improvements when applied to automatic speech recognition (Schwenk, 2007; Emami and Mangu, 2007; Kuo et al., 2010) and machine translation tasks (Schwenk et al., 2006).",
        "Hence, continuous space language models are becoming increasingly used.",
        "These successes have revitalized the research on neuronal architectures for language models, and given rise to several new proposals (see, for instance, (Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mnih and Hinton, 2008; Collobert and Weston, 2008)).",
        "A major difficulty with these approaches remains the complexity of training, which does not scale well to the massive corpora that are nowadays available.",
        "Practical solutions to this problem are discussed in (Schwenk, 2007), which introduces a number of optimization and tricks to make training doable.",
        "Even then, training a neuronal language model typically takes days.",
        "In this paper, we empirically study the convergence behavior of two multilayer neural networks for statistical language modeling, comparing the standard model of (Bengio et al., 2003) with the logbilinear (LBL) model of (Mnih and Hinton, 2007).",
        "Our contributions are the following: we first propose a reformulation of Mnih and Hinton's model, which reveals its similarity with extant models, and allows a direct and fair comparison with the standard model.",
        "For the standard model, these results highlight the impact of parameter initialization.",
        "We first investigate a reinitialization method which allows to escape from the local extremum the standard model converges to.",
        "While this method yields a significative improvement, the underlying assumption about the structure of the model does not meet the requirement of very large-scale tasks.",
        "We therefore introduce a different initialization strategy, called one vector initialization.",
        "Experimental results show that these novel training strategies drastically reduce the total training time, while delivering significant improvements both in terms of perplexity and in a large-scale translation task.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first describe, in Section 2, the standard and the LBL language models.",
        "By reformulating the latter, we show that both models are very similar and emphasize the remaining differences.",
        "Section 2.4 discusses complexity issues and possible solutions to reduce the training time.",
        "We then report, in Section 3, preliminary experimental results that enlighten some caveats of the standard approach.",
        "Based on these observations, we introduce in Section 4 novel and more efficient training schemes, yielding improved performance and a reduced training time both on small and large scale experiments."

        "Learning a language model amounts to estimate the parameters of the discrete conditional distribution over words given each possible history, where the history corresponds to some function of the preceding words.",
        "For an n-gram model, the history contains the n – 1 preceding words, and the model parameters correspond to P(wi\\wl^-ll+1).",
        "Continuous space language models aim at computing these estimates based on a distributed representation of words (Bengio et al., 2003), thereby reducing the sparsity issues that plague conventional maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "In this approach, each word in the vocabulary is mapped into a real-valued vector and the conditional probability distributions are then expressed as a (parameterized) smooth function of these feature vectors.",
        "The formalism of neural networks allows to express these two steps in a well-known framework, where, crucially, the mapping and the model parameters can be learned in conjunction.",
        "In the next paragraphs, we describe the two continuous space language models considered in our study and present the various issues associated with the training of such models, as well as their most common remedies.",
        "In the following, we will consider words as indices in a finite dictionary of size V ; depending on the context, w will either refer to the word or to its index in the dictionary.",
        "A word w can also be represented by a 1-of-V coding vector v of RV in which all elements are null except the wth.",
        "In the standard approach of (Bengio et al., 2003), the feed-forward network takes as input the n – 1 word history and delivers an estimate of the probability P(w^w^-m) as its output.",
        "It consists of three layers.",
        "The first layer builds a continuous representation of the history by mapping each word into its real-valued representation.",
        "This mapping is defined by RTv, where R G RVxm is a projection matrix and m is the dimension of the continuous projection word space.",
        "The output of this layer is a vector i of (n – 1)m real numbers obtained by concatenating the representations of the context words.",
        "The projection matrix R is shared along all positions in the history vector and is learned automatically.",
        "The second layer introduces a non-linear transform, where the output layer activation values are defined by h = tanh (Wihi + bih), where i is the input vector, Wm G RHx(n-1)m and bm G RH are the parameters of this layer.",
        "The vector h G RH can be considered as an higher (more abstract) representation of the context than i.",
        "The third layer is an output layer that estimates the desired probability, thanks to the softmax function:",
        "where Who G RV xH and bho G RV are respectively the projection matrix and the bias term associated with this layer.",
        "The wth component in P corresponds to the estimated probability of the wth word of the vocabulary given the input history vector.",
        "The standard model has two hyper-parameters (the dimension of projection space m and the size of hidden layer, H) that define the architecture of the neural network and a set of free parameters 0 that need to be learned from data: the projection matrix R, the weight matrix Wih, the bias vector bih, the weight matrix Who and the bias vector bho.",
        "In this model, the projection matrices R and Who play similar roles as they define maps between the vocabulary and the hidden representation.",
        "The fact that R assigns similar representations to history words w1 and w2 implies that these words can be exchanged with little impact on the resulting probability distribution.",
        "Likewise, the similarity of two lines in Who is an indication that the corresponding words tend to have a similar behavior, i.e. tend to have a similar probabilities of occurrence in all contexts.",
        "In the remainder, we will therefore refer to R as the matrix representing the context space, and to Who as the matrix for the prediction space.",
        "The work reported (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) describes another parameterization of the architecture introduced in the previous section.",
        "This parameterization is based on Factored Restricted Boltzmann Machine.",
        "According to (Mnih and Hinton, 2007), this model, termed the log-bilinear language model (LBL), achieves, for large vocabulary tasks, better results in terms of perplexity than the standard model, even if the reasons beyond this improvement remain unclear.",
        "In this section, we will describe this model and show how it relates to the standard model.",
        "The LBL model estimates the n-gram parameters by:",
        "Ew exp( – E(w; wi",
        "In this equation, E is an energy function defined as:",
        " – brT RT Vi – bv T Vi = – VT R E Ck RT Vk + br where R is the projection matrix introduced above, (Vk)i-n+1<k<i-1 are the 1-of-V coding vectors for the history words and Vi is the coding vector for wi ; Ck G Rmxm is a combination matrix and brand bvdenote bias vectors.",
        "All these parameters need to be learned during training.",
        "Equation (4) can be rewritten using the notations introduced for the standard model.",
        "We then rename brand bv respectively bih and bho.",
        "We also denote i the concatenation of the (n – 1) vectors RTVk; likewise Wih denotes the H x (n – 1)m matrix obtained by concatenating row-wise the (n – 1) matrices Ck.",
        "With these new notations, equations (4) and (3) can be rewritten as:",
        "h = Wihi + bih o = Rh + bho",
        "This formulation allows to highlight the similarity of the LBL model and the standard model.",
        "These two models differ only by the activation function of their hidden layer (linear for the LBL model and tangent hyperbolic for the standard model) and by their definition of the prediction space: for the LBL model, the context space and the prediction space are the same (R = Who, and thus H = m), while in the standard model, the prediction space is defined independently from the context space.",
        "This restriction drastically reduces the number of free parameters of the LBL model.",
        "It is finally noteworthy to outline the similarity of this model with standard maximum entropy language models (Lau et al., 1993; Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "Let x denote the binary vector formed by stacking the (n-1) 1-of-V encodings of the history words; then the conditional probability distributions estimated in the model are proportional to exp F(x), where F is an affine transform of x.",
        "The main difference with MaxEnt language models are thus the restricted form of the feature functions, which only test one history word, and the particular representation of F, which is defined as:",
        "F (x) = RWihR/T V + Rbih + bho where, as before, R' is formed by concatenating (n – 1) copies of the projection matrix R.",
        "Training the two models introduced above can be achieved by maximizing the log-likelihood L of the parameters 6.",
        "This optimization is usually performed by stochastic back-propagation as in (Ben-gio et al., 2003).",
        "For all our experiments, the learning rate is fixed at 5 x 10-3.",
        "The learning weight decay and the the weight decay (respectively 1 x 10-9and 0) seem to have a minor impact on the results.",
        "Learning starts with a random initialization of the parameters under the uniform distribution and converges to a local maximum of the log-likelihood function.",
        "Moreover, to prevent overfitting, an early stopping strategy is adopted: after each epoch, training is stopped when the likelihood of a validation set stops increasing.",
        "The main problem with neural language models is their computational complexity.",
        "For the two models presented in this section, the number of floating point operations needed to predict the label of a single example is:",
        "where the first term of the sum corresponds to the computation of the hidden layer and the second one to the computation of the output layer.",
        "The projection of the context words amounts to select one row of the projection matrix R, as the words are represented with a 1-of-V coding vector.",
        "We can therefore assume that the computation complexity of the first layer is negligible.",
        "Most of the computation time is thus spent in the output layer, which implies that the computing time grows linearly with the vocabulary size.",
        "Training these models for large scale tasks is therefore challenging, and a number oftricks have been introduced to make training and inference tractable (Schwenk and Gauvain, 2002; Schwenk, 2007).",
        "Short list A simple method to reduce the complexity in inference and in learning is to reduce the size of the output vocabulary (Schwenk, 2007): rather than estimating the probability P(w = w\\wi-,n+1) for all words in the vocabulary, we only estimate it for the N most frequent words of the training set (the so-called short-list).",
        "In this case, two vocabularies need to be considered, corresponding respectively to the context vocabulary Vc used to define the history; and the prediction vocabulary Vp.",
        "However, this method fails to deliver any probability estimate for words outside of the prediction vocabulary, meaning that a fall-back strategy needs to be defined for those words.",
        "In practice, neural network language models are combined with a conventional n-gram model as described in (Schwenk, 2007).",
        "Batch mode and resampling Additional speedups can be obtained by propagating several examples at once through the network (Bilmes et al., 1997).",
        "This \"batch mode\" allows to factorize the matrix operations and cut down both inference and training time.",
        "In all our experiments, we used a batch size of 64.",
        "Moreover, the training time is linear in the number of examples in the training data.",
        "Training on very large corpora, which, nowadays, comprise billions of word tokens, cannot be performed exhaustively and requires to adopt resampling strategies, whereby, at each epoch, the system is trained with only a small random subset of the training data.",
        "This approach enables to effectively estimate neural language models on very large corpora; it has also been observed empirically that sampling the training data can increase the generalization performance (Schwenk, 2007)."

        "The convergence perplexities after the combination with the standard back-off model are also provided for all the models in table 2 (see section 4.3).",
        "We can observe that the LBL model converges faster than the standard model: the latter needs 13 epochs to reach the stopping criteria, while the former only needs 6 epochs.",
        "However, upon convergence, the standard model reaches a lower perplexity than the LBL model.",
        "Figure 1: Convergence rate of the standard and the LBL models evaluated by the evolution of the perplexity on a development set",
        "As described in Section 2.2, the main difference between the standard and the LBL model is the way the context and the prediction spaces are defined: in the standard model, the two spaces are distinct; in the LBL model, they are bound to be the same.",
        "With a smaller number of parameters, the LBL model can not capture as many characteristics of the data as the standard model, but it converges faster.",
        "This difference in convergence can be explained by the scarcity of the updates in the projection matrix R in the standard model: during backpropagation, only those weights that are associated with words in the history are updated.",
        "By contrast, each training sample updates all the weights in the prediction matrix Who.",
        "To deepen our understanding, we propose to further analyze the induced word embeddings by finding, for some randomly selected words, the five nearest neighbors (according to the Euclidian distance) in the context space and in the prediction space of the two models.",
        "Results are presented in Table 1.",
        "If we look first at the standard model, the global picture is that for frequent words (is, are, and, to a lesser extend, have), both spaces seem to define meaningful neighborhood, corresponding to semantic and syntactic similarities; this is less true for rarer words, where we see a greater discrepancy between the context and prediction spaces.",
        "For instance, the date 1947 seems to be randomly associated in the context space, while the 5 nearest words in the prediction space form a consistent set of dates.",
        "The same trend is also observed for the word Castro.",
        "Our interpretation is that for less frequent words, the projection vectors are hardly ever updated and remain close to their original random initialization.",
        "By contrast, the similarities in the (unique) projection space of the LBL remain consistent for all frequency ranges, and are very similar to the prediction space of the standard model.",
        "This seems to validate our hypothesis that in the standard model, the prediction space is learned much faster than the context space and corroborates our interpretation of the impact of the scarce updates of rare words.",
        "Another possible explanation is that there is no clear relation between the context space and the target function: the context space is learned only indirectly by back-propagation.",
        "As a result, due to the random initialization of the parameters and to data sparsity, many vectors of R might be blocked in some local maxima, meaning that similar vectors cannot be grouped in a consistent way and that the induced similarity is more \"loose\"."

        "This regimes yields a model that is somewhat in-between the standard and LBL models as it adds a relationship between the two representation spaces, which lacks in the former model.",
        "This relationship is however not expressed through the tying of the corresponding parameters; instead we let the prediction space guide the convergence of the context space.",
        "As a consequence, we hope that it can achieve a convergence speed as fast as the one of the LBL model without degrading its prediction capacity.",
        "The result plotted on Figure 2 shows that this indeed the case: using this training regime, we obtained a perplexity similar to the one of the standard model, while at the same time reducing the total training time by more than a half, which is of great practical interest (each epoch lasts approximately 8 hours on a 3GHz Xeon processor).",
        "Figure 3 displays the perplexity convergence curve measured on the training data for the standard learning regime as well as for the reinitialization and iterative re-initialization.",
        "These results show the same trend as for the perplexity measured on the development data, and suggest a regularization effect of the reinitialization schemes rather than allowing the models to escape local optima.",
        "Principle The new training regimes introduced above outperform the standard training regime both in terms of perplexity and of training time.",
        "However, exchanging information between the context and prediction spaces is only possible when the same vocabulary is used in both spaces.",
        "As discussed in Section 2.4, this configuration is not realistic for very large-scale tasks.",
        "This is because increasing the number of predicted word types is much more computationally demanding than increasing the number of types in the context vocabulary.",
        "Thus, the former vocabulary is typically order of magnitudes larger than the latter, which means that the reinitialization strategies can no longer be directly used.",
        "It is nonetheless possible to continue drawing inspirations from the observations made in Section 3, and, crucially, to question the random initialization strategy.",
        "As discussed above, this strategy may explain why the neighborhoods in the induced context space for the less frequent types were difficult to interpret.",
        "As a straightforward alternative, we consider a different initialization strategy where all the words in the context vocabulary are initially projected onto the same (random) point in the context space.",
        "The intuition is that it will be easier to build meaningful neighborhoods, especially for rare types, if all words are initially considered similar and only diverge if there is sufficient evidence in the training data to suggest that they should.",
        "This model is termed the one vector initialization model.",
        "Experimental evaluation To validate this approach, we compare the convergence of a standard model trained (with the standard learning regime) with the one vector initialization regime.",
        "The context vocabulary is defined by the 532, 557 words occurring in the training data and the prediction vocabulary by the 10, 000 most frequent words.",
        "All other parameters are the same as in the previous experiments.",
        "Based on the curves displayed on Figure 4, we can observe that the model obtained with the one vector initialization regime outperforms the model trained with a completely random initialization.",
        "Moreover, the latter reaches convergence in only 14 epochs, while the learning regime we propose only needs 9 epochs.",
        "Convergence is even faster than when we used the standard training regime and a small context vocabulary.",
        "Table 2: Summary of the perplexity (PPX) results measured on the same development set with the different continuous space language models.",
        "For all of them, the probabilities are combined with the back-off n-gram model",
        "To illustrate the impact of our initialization scheme, we also used a principal component analysis to represent the induced word representations in a two dimensional space.",
        "Figure 5 represents the vectors associated with numbers in red, while all other words are represented in blue.",
        "Two different models are used: the standard model on the left, and the one vector initialization model on the right.",
        "We can observe that, for the standard model, most of the red points are scattered all over a large portion of the representation space.",
        "On the opposite, for the one vector initialization model, points associated with numbers are much more concentrated: this is simply because all the points are originally identical, and the training aim to spread the point around this starting point.",
        "We also created the closest word list reported in Table 3, in a manner similar to Table 1.",
        "Clearly, the new method seems to yield more meaningful neighborhoods in the context space.",
        "It is finally noteworthy to mention that when used with a small context vocabulary (as in the experimental setting of Section 4.1) this initialization strategy underperforms the standard initialization.",
        "This is simply due to the much greater data sparsity in the large context vocabulary experiments, where the rarer word types are really rare (they typically occur once or twice).",
        "By contrast, the rarer words in the small vocabulary tasks occurred more than several hundreds times in the training corpus, which was more than sufficient to guide the model towards satisfactory projection matrices.",
        "This finally suggests that there still exists room for improvement if we can find more efficient initialization strategies than starting from one or several random points.",
        "As a last experiment, we compare the various models on a large scale machine translation task.",
        "Statistical language models are key component of current statistical machine translation systems (Koehn, 2010), where they both help disambiguate lexical choices in the target language and influence the choice of the right word ordering.",
        "The integration of a neural network language model in such a system is far from easy, given the computational cost of computing word probabilities, a task that is performed repeatedly during the search of the best translation.",
        "We then had to resort to a two pass decoding approach: the first pass uses a conventional back-off language model to produce a n-best list (the n most likely translations and their associated scores); in the second pass, the probability of the neural language model is computed for each hypothesis and the n-",
