        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental natural-language-processing problem, and POS tags are used as input to many important applications.",
        "While state-of-the-art supervised POS taggers are more than 97% accurate (Toutanova et al., 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005), unsupervised POS taggers continue to lag far behind.",
        "Several authors addressed this gap using limited supervision, such as a dictionary of tags for each word (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Ravi and Knight, 2009), or a list of word prototypes for each tag (Haghighi and Klein, 2006).",
        "Even in light of all these advancements, there is still interest in a completely unsupervised method for POS induction for several reasons.",
        "First, most languages do not have a tag dictionary.",
        "Second, the preparation of such resources is error-prone.",
        "Third, while several widely used tag sets do exist, researchers do not agree upon any specific set of tags across languages or even within one language.",
        "Since tags are used as basic features for many important NLP applications (e.g. Headden et al.",
        "2008), exploring new, statistically motivated, tag sets may also be useful.",
        "For these reasons, a fully unsupervised induction algorithm has both a practical and a theoretical value.",
        "In the past decade, there has been a steady improvement on the completely unsupervised version of POS induction (Schütze, 1995; Clark, gram statistics.",
        "Two recent papers advocate non-disambiguating models (Abend et al., 2010; Lamar et al., 2010): these assign the same tag to all tokens of a word type, rather than attempting to disambiguate words in context.",
        "Lamar et al.",
        "(2010) motivate this choice by showing how removing the disambiguation ability from a state-of-the-art disambiguating model results in increasing its accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel approach to non-disambiguating, distributional-only, fully unsupervised, POS tagging.",
        "As in all non-disambiguating distributional approaches, the goal, loosely stated, is to assign the same tag to words whose contexts in the corpus are similar.",
        "Our approach, which we call Latent-Descriptor Clustering, or LDC, is an iterative algorithm, in the spirit of the K-means clustering algorithm and of the EM algorithm for the estimation of a mixture of Gaussians.",
        "In conventional K-means clustering, one is given a collection of N objects described as N data points in an r-dimensional Euclidean space, and one seeks a clustering that minimizes the sum of intra-cluster squared distances, i.e., the sum, over all data points, of the squared distance between that point and the centroid of its assigned cluster.",
        "In LDC, we similarly state our goal as one of finding a tagging, i.e., cluster assignment, A, that minimizes the sum of intra-cluster squared distances.",
        "However, unlike in conventional K-means, the N objects to be clustered are themselves described by vectors – in a suitable manifold – that depend on the clustering A.",
        "We call these vectors latent descriptors.",
        "Specifically, each object to be clustered, i.e., each word type w, is described in terms of its left-tag context and right-tag context.",
        "These context vectors are the counts of the K different tags occurring, under tagging A, to the left and right of tokens of word type w in the corpus.",
        "We normalize each of these context vectors to unit length, producing, for each word type w, two points LA(w) and RA(w) on the (K-1)-dimensional unit sphere.",
        "The latent descriptor for w consists of the pair (LA(w), RA(w)) – more details in Section 2.",
        "A straightforward approach to this latent-descriptor K-means problem is to adapt the classical iterative K-means algorithm so as to handle the latent descriptors.",
        "Specifically, in each iteration, given the assignment A obtained from the previous iteration, one first computes the latent descriptors for all word types as defined above, and then proceeds in the usual way to update cluster centroids and to find a new assignment A to be used in the next iteration.",
        "For reasons to be discussed in Section 5, we instead prefer a soft-assignment strategy, inspired from the EM algorithm for the estimation of a mixture of Gaussians.",
        "Thus, rather than the hard assignment A, we use a soft-assignment matrix P. Pwk, interpreted as the probability of assigning word w to cluster k, is, essentially, proportional to exp{- dwk/2a}, where dwk is the distance between the latent descriptor for w and the centroid, i.e., Gaussian mean, for k. Unlike the Gaussian-mixture model however, we use the same mixture coefficient and the same Gaussian width for all k. Further, we let the Gaussian width a decrease gradually during the iterative process.",
        "As is well-known, the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures reduces in the limit of small a to the simpler K-means clustering algorithm.",
        "As a result, the last few iterations of LDC effectively implement the hard-assignment K-means-style algorithm outlined in the previous paragraph.",
        "The soft assignment used earlier in the process lends robustness to the algorithm.",
        "The LDC approach is shown to yield substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods for the problem of fully unsupervised, distributional only, POS tagging.",
        "The algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement, requiring less than 30 lines of Matlab code.",
        "It runs in a few seconds of computation time, as opposed to hours or days for the training of HMMs."

Similarly, we define the right-word context of w1, R(w1), as the N-dimensional vector whose nth component is the number of bigrams (ti, ti+1) such that w(ti) = w1 and w(ti+1) = n. We let L (resp.",

        "The E phase consists of computing, based on the current 9, a probabilistic assignment of each of the N observations to the K Gaussian distributions.",
        "These probabilistic assignments form an NxK stochastic matrix P, i.e., a matrix of non-negative numbers in which each row sums to 1.",
        "The M phase consists of updating the model parameters 6, based on the current assignments P. For more details, see, e.g., Bishop (2006).",

        "Thus, each iteration of LDC consists of an E phase and an M phase.",
        "As observations are replaced by latent descriptors, an iteration of LDC is best viewed as starting with the M phase.",
        "The M phase first starts by building a pair of latent-descriptor matrices Lp and Rp, from the soft assignments obtained in the previous iteration.",
        "Note that these descriptors are now indexed by P, the matrix of probabilistic assignments, rather than by hard assignments A as in the previous section.",
        "Lp and Rp are obtained by a straightforward adaptation of the definition given in the previous section to the case of probabilistic assignments.",
        "Thus, the latent descriptors consist of the left-word and right-word contexts (recall that these are given by matrices L and R), mapped into left-label and right-label contexts through multiplication by the assignment matrix P, and scaled to unit length:",
        "Lp = 1(LP) Rp = X(RP).",
        "With these latent descriptors in hand, we proceed with the M phase of the algorithm as usual.",

        "The weight used in this weighted average is Pwkxf(w) (remember that f(w) is the frequency of word type w in the corpus).",
        "Note that the definition of the Gaussian mean piLk parallels the definition of the cluster centroid CL(k) given in the previous section; if the assignment P happens to be a hard assignment, /xLk is actually identical to CL(k).",

        "To initialize the algorithm, i.e., create a set of left and right descriptor vectors in the M phase of the first iteration, we use the left-word and right-word contexts L and R. These matrices however are of very high dimension (NxN), and thus sparse and noisy.",

        "This completes the description of the LDC algorithm.",
        "While this algorithm is intuitive and simple, it does not easily lend itself to mathematical analysis; indeed there is no a priori guarantee that it will behave as desired.",
        "Even for the simpler, hard-assignment, K-means-style version of LDC outlined in the previous section, there is no equivalent to the statement – valid for the conventional K-means algorithm – that each iteration lowers the intra-cluster sum of squared distances F(A); this is a mere consequence of the fact that the descriptors themselves are updated on each iteration.",
        "The soft-assignment version of LDC does not directly attempt to minimize F(A), nor can it be viewed as likelihood maximization – as is EM for a Gaussian mixture – since the use of latent descriptors precludes the definition of a generative model for the data.",

        "The first tool is an objective function G(P) that parallels the definition of F(A) for hard assignments.",

        "Clearly, G is identical to F on any P that happens to be a hard assignment.",
        "Thus, G is actually an extension of the objective function F to soft assignments.",
        "The second tool will allow us to compute a tagging accuracy for soft assignments.",

        "When devising a model for unsupervised POS induction, one challenge is to choose a model of adequate complexity, this choice being related to the bias-variance dilemma ubiquitous in statistical estimation problems.",
        "While large datasets are available, they are typically not large enough to allow efficient unsupervised learnability in models that are powerful enough to capture complex features of natural languages.",
        "Ambiguity is one of these features.",
        "Here we propose a new approach to this set of issues: start with a model that explicitly entertains ambiguity, and gradually constrain it so that it eventually converges to an unambiguous tagger.",
        "Thus, although the algorithm uses probabilistic assignments, of Gaussian-mixture type, the goal is the construction of hard assignments.",
        "By requiring the Gaussians to be isotropic with uniform width and by allowing that width to shrink to zero, the algorithm forces the soft assignments to converge to a set of hard assignments.",
        "Based on its performance, this simulated-annealing-like approach appears to provide a good compromise in the choice of model complexity.",
        "LDC bears some similarities with the algorithm of Ney, Essen and Kneser (1994), further implemented, with extensions, by Clark (2003).",
        "Both models use an iterative approach to minimize an objective function, and both initialize with frequent words.",
        "However, the model of Ney et al.",
        "is, in essence, an HMM where each word type is constrained to belong to a single class (i.e., in HMM terminology, be emitted by a single hidden state).",
        "Accordingly, the objective function is the data likelihood under this constrained HMM.",
        "This takes into account only the rightward transition probabilities.",
        "Our approach is conceptually rather different from an HMM.",
        "It is more similar to the approach of Schütze (1995) and Lamar et al.",
        "(2010), where each word type is mapped into a descriptor vector derived from its left and right tag contexts.",
        "Accordingly, the objective function is that of the K-means clustering problem, namely a sum of in-tra-cluster squared distances.",
        "This objective function, unlike the likelihood under an HMM, takes into account both left and right contexts.",
        "It also makes use in a crucial way of cluster centroids (or Gaussian means), a notion that has no counterpart in the HMM approach.",
        "We note that LDC achieves much better results (by about 10%) than a recent implementation of the Ney et al.",
        "approach (Reichart et al.",
        "2010).",
        "The only parameters in LDC are the two parameters used to define the a schedule, and r1 used in the first iteration.",
        "Performance was generally found to degrade gracefully with changes in these parameters away from their optimal values.",
        "When a was made too large in the first few iterations, it was found that the algorithm converges to the trivial minimum of the objective function F(A), which maps all word types to a unique label (see section 2).",
        "An alternative would be to estimate the variance for each Gaussian separately, as is usually done in EM for",
        "Gaussian mixtures.",
        "This would not necessarily preclude the use of an iteration-dependent scaling factor, which would achieve the goal of gradually forcing the tagging to become deterministic.",
        "Investigating this and related options is left for future work.",
        "Reduced-rank SVD is used in the initialization of the descriptor vectors, for the optimization to get off the ground.",
        "The details of this initialization step do not seem to be too critical, as witnessed by robustness against many parameter changes.",
        "For instance, using only the 400 most frequent words in the corpus – instead of all words – in the construction of the left-word and right-word context vectors in iteration 1 causes no appreciable change in performance.",
        "The probabilistic-assignment algorithm was found to be much more robust against parameter changes than the hard-assignment version of LDC, which parallels the classical K-means clustering algorithm (see Section 1).",
        "We experimented with this hard-assignment latent-descriptor clustering algorithm (data not shown), and found that a number of additional devices were necessary in order to make it work properly.",
        "In particular, we found it necessary to use reduced-rank SVD on each iteration of the algorithm – as opposed to just the first iteration in the version presented here – and to gradually increase the rank r. Further, we found it necessary to include only the most frequent words at the beginning, and only gradually incorporate rare words in the algorithm.",
        "Both of these devices require fine tuning.",
        "Provided they are indeed appropriately tuned, the same level of performance as in the probabilistic-assignment version could be achieved.",
        "However, as mentioned, the behavior is much less robust with hard clustering.",
        "Central to the success of LDC is the dynamic interplay between the progressively harder cluster assignments and the updated latent descriptor vectors.",
        "We operate under the assumption that if all word types were labeled optimally, words that share a label should have similar descriptor vectors arising from this optimal labeling.",
        "These similar vectors would continue to be clustered together, producing a stable equilibrium in the dynamic process.",
        "The LDC algorithm demonstrates that, despite starting far from this optimal labeling, the alternation between vector updates and assignment updates is able to produce steadily improving clusters, as seen by the steady increase of tagging accuracy.",
        "We envision the possibility of extending this approach in several ways.",
        "It is a relatively simple matter to extend the descriptor vectors to include context outside the nearest neighbors, which may well improve performance.",
        "In view of the computational efficiency of LDC, which runs in under one minute on a desktop PC, the added computational burden of working with the extended context is not likely to be prohibitive.",
        "LDC could also be extended to include morphological or other features, rather than relying exclusively on context.",
        "Again, we would anticipate a corresponding increase in accuracy from this additional linguistic information."
