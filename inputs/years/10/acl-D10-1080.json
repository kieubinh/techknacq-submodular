        "This paper examines tagging models for spontaneous English speech transcripts.",
        "We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art tagging models, either generative or discriminative, left-to-right or bidirectional, with or without latent annotations, together with the use of ToBI break indexes and several methods for segmenting the speech transcripts (i.e., conversation side, speaker turn, or human-annotated sentence).",
        "Based on these studies, we observe that: (1) bidirectional models tend to achieve better accuracy levels than left-to-right models, (2) generative models seem to perform somewhat better than discriminative models on this task, and (3) prosody improves tagging performance of models on conversation sides, but has much less impact on smaller segments.",
        "We conclude that, although the use of break indexes can indeed significantly improve performance over baseline models without them on conversation sides, tagging accuracy improves more by using smaller segments, for which the impact of the break indexes is marginal."

        "Natural language processing technologies, such as parsing and tagging, often require reconfiguration when they are applied to challenging domains that differ significantly from newswire, e.g., blogs, twitter text (Foster, 2010), or speech.",
        "In contrast to text, conversational speech represents a significant challenge because the transcripts are not segmented into sentences.",
        "Furthermore, the transcripts are often disfluent and lack punctuation and case information.",
        "On the other hand, speech provides additional information, beyond simply the sequence of words, which could be exploited to more accurately assign each word in the transcript a part-of-speech (POS) tag.",
        "One potentially beneficial type of information is prosody (Cutler et al., 1997).",
        "Prosody provides cues for lexical disambiguation, sentence segmentation and classification, phrase structure and attachment, discourse structure, speaker affect, etc.",
        "Prosody has been found to play an important role in speech synthesis systems (Batliner et al., 2001; Taylor and Black, 1998), as well as in speech recognition (Gallwitz et al., 2002; Hasegawa-Johnson et al., 2005; Ostendorf et al., 2003).",
        "Additionally, prosodic features such as pause length, duration of words and phones, pitch contours, energy contours, and their normalized values have been used for speech processing tasks like sentence boundary detection (Liu et al., 2005).",
        "Linguistic encoding schemes like ToBI (Silver-man et al., 1992) have also been used for sentence boundary detection (Roark et al., 2006; Harper et al., 2005), as well as for parsing (Dreyer and Shafran, 2007; Gregory et al., 2004; Kahn et al., 2005).",
        "In the ToBI scheme, aspects of prosody such as tone, prominence, and degree of juncture between words are represented symbolically.",
        "For instance, Dreyer and Shafran (2007) use three classes of automatically detected ToBI break indexes, indicating major intonational breaks with a 4, hesitation with a p, and all other breaks with a 1.",
        "Recently, Huang and Harper (2010) found that they could effectively integrate prosodic information in the form of this simplified three class ToBI encoding when parsing spontaneous speech by using a prosodically enriched PCFG model with latent annotations (PCFG-LA) (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov and Klein, 2007) to rescore n-best parses produced by a baseline PCFG-LA model without prosodic enrichment.",
        "However, the prosodically enriched models by themselves did not perform significantly better than the baseline PCFG-LA model without enrichment, due to the negative effect that misalignments between automatic prosodic breaks and true phrase boundaries have on the model.",
        "This paper investigates methods for using state-of-the-art taggers on conversational speech transcriptions and the effect that prosody has on tagging accuracy.",
        "Improving POS tagging performance of speech transcriptions has implications for improving downstream applications that rely on accurate POS tags, including sentence boundary detection (Liu et al., 2005), automatic punctuation (Hillard et al., 2006), information extraction from speech, parsing, and syntactic language modeling (Heeman, 1999; Filimonov and Harper, 2009).",
        "While there have been several attempts to integrate prosodic information to improve parse accuracy of speech transcripts, to the best of our knowledge there has been little work on using this type of information for POS tagging.",
        "Furthermore, most of the parsing work has involved generative models and rescoring/reranking of hypotheses from the generative models.",
        "In this work, we will analyze several factors related to effective POS tagging of conversational speech:",
        "• discriminative versus generative POS tagging models (Section 2)",
        "• prosodic features in the form of simplified ToBI break indexes (Section 4)",
        "• type of speech segmentation (Section 5) 2 Models",
        "In order to fully evaluate the dificulties inherent in tagging conversational speech, as well as the possible beneits of prosodic information, we conducted experiments with six different POS tagging models.",
        "The models can be broadly separated into two classes: generative and discriminative.",
        "As the irst of our generative models, we used a Hidden Markov",
        "Model (HMM) trigram tagger (Thede and Harper, 1999), which serves to establish a baseline and to gauge the dificulty of the task at hand.",
        "Our second model, HMM-LA, was the latent variable bigram HMM tagger of Huang et al.",
        "(2009), which achieved state-of-the-art tagging performance by introducing latent tags to weaken the stringent Markov independence assumptions that generally hinder tagging performance in generative models.",
        "For the third model, we implemented a bidirectional variant of the HMM-LA (HMM-LA-Bidir) that combines evidence from two HMM-LA taggers, one trained left-to-right and the other right-to-left.",
        "For decoding, we use a product model (Petrov, 2010).",
        "The intuition is that the context information from the left and the right of the current position is complementary for predicting the current tag and thus, the combination should serve to improve performance over the HMM-LA tagger.",
        "Since prior work on parsing speech with prosody has relied on generative models, it was necessary to modify equations of the model in order to incorporate the prosodic information, and then perform rescoring in order to achieve gains.",
        "However, it is far simpler to directly integrate prosody as features into the model by using a discriminative approach.",
        "Hence, we also investigate several log-linear models, which allow us to easily include an arbitrary number and varying kinds of possibly overlapping and non-independent features.",
        "First, we implemented a Conditional Random Field (CRF) tagger, which is an attractive choice due to its ability to learn the globally optimal labeling for a sequence and proven excellent performance on sequence labeling tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "In contrast to an HMM which optimizes the joint likelihood of the word sequence and tags, a CRF optimizes the conditional likelihood, given by:",
        "where the A's are the parameters of the model to estimate and F indicates the feature functions used.",
        "The denominator in (1) is Z\\(x), the normalization factor, with:",
        "The objective we need to maximize then becomes :",
        "wn) - log ZA(x",
        "where we use a spherical Gaussian prior to prevent overitting of the model (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999) and the widespread quasi-Newtonian L-BFGS method to optimize the model parameters (Liu and Nocedal, 1989).",
        "Decoding is performed with the Viterbi algorithm.",
        "We also evaluate state-of-the-art Maximum Entropy taggers: the Stanford Left5 tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000) and the Stanford bidirectional tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), with the former using only left context and the latter bidirectional dependencies.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the major differences between the models along several dimensions: (1) generative versus discriminative, (2) directionality of decoding, (3) the presence or absence of latent annotations, (4) the availability of n-best extraction, and (5) the model order.",
        "In order to assess the quality of our models, we evaluate them on the section 23 test set of the standard newswire WSJ tagging task after training all models on sections 0-22.",
        "Results appear in Table 2.",
        "Clearly, all the models have high accuracy on newswire data, but the Stanford bidirectional tagger signiicantly outperforms the other models with the exception of the HMM-LA-Bidir model on this"

        "We utilized the Fisher dev1 and dev2 sets containing 16,519 sentences (112,717 words) as the primary training data and the entire Penn Switchboard treebank containing 110,504 sentences (837,863 words) as an additional training source.",
        "The treebanks were preprocessed as follows: the tags of auxiliary verbs were replaced with the AUX tag, empty nodes and function tags were removed, words were down-cased, punctuation was deleted, and the words and their tags were extracted.",

Consider the following speech transcription example, which is enriched with ToBI break indexes in parentheses and tags: i(1)/PRP did(1)/VBD n't(1)/RB you(1)/PRP know(4)/VBP i(1)/PRP did(1)/AUX n't(1)/RB...",

        "To integrate prosody into our generative models, we utilize the method from (Dreyer and Shafran, 2007) to add prosodic breaks.",
        "As Figure 1 shows, ToBI breaks provide a secondary sequence of observations that is parallel to the sequence of words that comprise the sentence.",

        "As we believe one of the major roles that prosodic cues serve for tagging conversation sides is as a proxy for sentence boundaries, perhaps the efficacy of the prosodic breaks can, at least partially, be attributed to errors in the automatically induced break indexes themselves, as they can misalign with syntactic phrase boundaries, as discussed in Huang and Harper (2010).",
        "This may degrade the performance of our models more than the improvement achieved from correctly placed breaks.",
        "Hence, we conduct a series of experiments in which we systematically eliminate noisy phrase and disfluency breaks and show that under these improved conditions, prosodi-cally enriched models can indeed be more effective.",
        "To investigate to what extent noisy breaks are impeding the possible improvements from prosodically enriched models, we replaced all 4 and p breaks in the training and evaluation sets that did not align to the correct phrase boundaries as indicated by the treebank with break 1 for both the conversation sides and human-annotated sentences.",

        "Figure 6: Oracle comparison: solid lines for sentences, dashed lines for speaker turns, and dotted lines for conversation sides creases rapidly to 99%; whereas, the oracle accuracy of models on conversation sides grow slowly to between 94% and 95%.",
        "The speaker turn trained models, however, behave closely to those using sentences, climbing rapidly to accuracies of around 98%.",
        "This difference is directly attributable to the length of the segments.",
        "As can be seen in Table 6, the speaker turn segments are more comparable in length to sentences.",
        "Next, we return to the large performance degradation when tagging speech rather than newswire text to examine the major differences among the models.",
        "Using two of our best performing models, the Stanford bidirectional and HMM-LA, in Figure 7 we present the categories for which performance degradation was the greatest when comparing performance of a tagger trained on WSJ to a tagger trained on spoken sentences and conversation sides.",
        "The performance decrease is quite similar across both models, with the greatest degradation on the NNP, RP, VBN, and RBS categories.",
        "Unsurprisingly, both the discriminative and generative bidirectional models achieve the most impressive results.",
        "However, the generative HMM-LA and HMM-LA-Bidir models achieved the best results across all three segmentations, and the best overall result, of 94.35%, on prosodically enriched sentence-segmented data.",
        "Since the Stanford bidirectional model incorporates all of the features that produced its state-of-the-art performance on WSJ, we believe the fact that the HMM-LA outperforms it, despite the discriminative model's more expressive feature set, is indicative of the HMM-LA's ability to more effectively adapt to novel domains during training.",
        "Another challenge for the discriminative models is the need for regularization tuning, requiring additional time and effort to train several models and select the most appropriate parameter each time the domain changes.",
        "Whereas for the HMM-LA models, although we also train several models, they can be combined into a product model, such as that described by Petrov (2010), in order to further improve performance.",
        "Since the prosodic breaks are noisier features than the others incorporated in the discriminative models, it may be useful to set their regularization parameter separately from the rest of the features, however, we have not explored this alternative.",
        "Our experiments used human transcriptions of the conversational speech; however, realistically our models would be applied to speech recognition transcripts.",
        "In such a case, word error will introduce noise in addition to the prosodic breaks.",
        "In future work, we will evaluate the use of break indexes for tagging when there is lexical error.",
        "We would also apply the n-best rescoring method to exploit break indexes in the HMM-LA bidirectional model, as this would likely produce further improvements."

        "Figure 7: Comparison of error rates between the Standford Bidir and HMM-LA models trained on WSJ, sentences, and conversation sides ings suggest that generative models with latent annotations achieve the best performance in this challenging domain.",
        "In terms of transcript segmentation, if sentences are available, it is preferable to use them.",
        "In the case that no such annotation is available, then using automatic sentence boundary detection does not serve as an appropriate replacement, but if automatic speaker turn segments can be obtained, then this is a good alternative, despite the fact that prosodic enrichment is less effective.",
        "Our investigation also shows that in the event that conversation sides must be used, prosodic enrichment of the discriminative and generative models produces significant improvements in tagging accuracy (by direct integration of prosody features for the former and by restricting the search space and rescoring with the latter).",
        "For tagging, the most important role of the break indexes appears to be as a stand in for sentence boundaries.",
        "The oracle break experiments suggest that if the accuracy of the automatically induced break indexes can be improved, then the prosodically enriched models will perform as well, or even better, than their human-annotated sentence counterparts."
