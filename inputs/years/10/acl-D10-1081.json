        "As an inherent preprocessing step to nearly all NLP tasks for writing systems without orthographical marking of word boundaries, such as Japanese and Chinese, the importance of word segmentation has lead to the emergence of a micro-genre in NLP focused exclusively on this problem.",
        "Supervised probabilistic models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) have a wide application to the morphological analysis of these languages.",
        "However, the development of the annotated training corpora necessary for their functioning is a labor-intensive task, which involves multiple stages of manual tagging.",
        "Because of the scarcity of labeled data, the domain adaptation of morphological analyzers is also problematic, and semi-supervised algorithms that address this issue have also been proposed (e.g. Liang, 2005; Tsuboi et al., 2008).",
        "Recent advances in unsupervised word segmentation have been promoted by human cognition research, where it is involved in the modeling of the mechanisms that underlie language acquisition.",
        "Another motivation to study unsupervised approaches is their potential to support the domain adaptation of morphological analyzers through the incorporation of unannotated training data, thus reducing the dependency on costly manual work.",
        "Apart from the considerable difficulties in discovering reliable criteria for word induction, the practical application of such approaches is impeded by their prohibitive computational cost.",
        "In this paper, we address the issue of achieving high accuracy in a practical computational time through an efficient method that relies on a combination of evidences: the local predictability of character patterns, and the reduction of effort achieved by a given representation of the language data.",
        "Both of these criteria are assumed to play a key role in native language acquisition.",
        "The proposed model allows experimentation in a more realistic setting, where the learner is able to apply them simultaneously.",
        "The method shows a high performance in terms of accuracy and speed, can be applied to language samples of substantial length, and generalizes well to corpora in different languages."

        "We first introduce the general two-part code, which consists of:",
        "• the source text D, obtained through encoding the corpus using the lexicon.",
        "The total description length amounts to the number of bits necessary for simultaneous transmission of the codebook and the source text.",
        "Therefore, our objective is to minimize the combined description length of both terms:",
        "L(D, M) = L(M) + L(D|M).",
        "The description length of the data given M is calculated using the Shannon-Fano code:",
        "where #Wj stands for the frequency of the word Wj in the text.",
        "Different strategies have been proposed in the literature for the calculation of the codebook cost.",
        "A common technique in segmentation and morphology induction models is to calculate the product of the total length in characters of the lexicon and an estimate of the per-character entropy.",
        "In this way, both the probabilities and lengths of words are taken into consideration.",
        "The use of a constant value is an effective and easily computable approach, but it is far from precise.",
        "For instance, in Yu (2000) the average entropy per character is measured against the original corpus, but this model does not capture the effects of the word distributions on the observed character probabilities.",
        "For this reason, we propose a different method: the codebook is modeled as a separate Markov chain of characters.",
        "A lexicon of characters M' is defined.",
        "The description length of the lexicon data D given M' is then calculated as:",
        "where #a denotes the frequency of a character a in the lexicon of hypothesis M. The term L(M') is constant for any choice of hypothesis, as is represents the character set of a corpus.",
        "The total description length under the proposed model is thus calculated as:",
        " – ]T #Ci log2 P (Ci) – ]T #Wj log2 P (Wj ) + O(1).",
        "A rigorous definition should include two additional terms, L(0|M) and L(0'|M'), which give the representation cost of the parameters of both models.",
        "The L(0|M) can be calculated as:",
        "where |M | – 1 gives the number of parameters (degrees of freedom), and S is the size of the dataset (the total length of the text in characters).",
        "The parametric complexity term is calculated in the same way for the lexicon.",
        "For a derivation of the above formula, refer to e.g. Li (1998).",
        "MDL is closely related to Bayesian inference.",
        "Depending on the choice of a universal code, the two approaches can overlap, as is the case with the two-part code discussed in this paper.",
        "It can be shown that the model selection in our method is equivalent to a MAP inference, conducted under the assumption that the prior probability of a model decreases exponentially with its length (Goldwater, 2006).",
        "Thus, the task that we are trying to accomplish is to conduct a focused search through the hypothesis space that will allow us to obtain an approximation of the MAP solution in a reasonable time.",
        "The MDL framework does not provide standard search algorithms for obtaining the hypotheses that minimize the description length.",
        "In the rest of this section, we will describe an efficient technique suitable for the word segmentation task.",
        "First, a rough initial hypothesis is built by an algorithm that combines the branching entropy and MDL criteria.",
        "Given a set X, comprising all the characters found in a text, the entropy of branching at position k of the text is defined as:",
        "where xk represents the character found at position k, and n is the order of the Markov model over characters.",
        "For brevity, hereafter we shall denote the observed sequence |xfc_i, ...,xfc_n} as |xfc_i:fc_n} .",
        "The above definition is extended to combine the entropy estimates in the left-to-right and right-to-left directions, as this factor has reportedly improved performance figures for models based on branching entropy (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii, 2006).",
        "The estimates in both directions are summed up, yielding a single value per position:",
        " – P(x|xk:k+n_1) log2 P(x|xk:k+n – 1).",
        "Suffix arrays are employed during the collection of frequency statistics.",
        "For a character model of order n over a testing corpus of size t and a training corpus of size m, suffix arrays allow these to be acquired in O(tn log m) time.",
        "Faster implementations reduce the complexity to O(t(n+log m)).",
        "For further discussion, see Manber and Myers (1991).",
        "During the experiments, we did not use the caching functionality provided by the suffix array library, but instead kept the statistics for the current iterative pass (n-gram order and direction) in a local table.",
        "The chunking technique we adopt is to insert a boundary when the branching entropy measured in sequences of length n exceeds a certain threshold value (H(X|xk – 1:k – n) > ß).",
        "Both n and ß are fixed.",
        "Within the described framework, the increase in context length n promotes precision and recall at first, but causes a performance degradation when the entropy estimates become unreliable due to the reduced frequencies of long strings.",
        "High threshold values produce a combination of high precision and low recall, while low values result in low precision and high recall.",
        "Since the F-score curve obtained as decreasing values are assigned to the threshold is typically unimodal as in many applications of MDL, we employ a bisection search routine for the estimation of the threshold (Algorithm 1).",
        "All positions of the dataset are sorted by their entropy values.",
        "At each iteration, at most two new hypotheses are built, and their description lengths are calculated in time linear to the data size.",
        "The computational complexity of the described routine is O(t log t), where t is the corpus length in characters.",
        "The order of the Markov chain n used during the entropy calculation is the only input variable of the proposed model.",

        "These properties of the method would lead to complications if we tried to employ it in the first phase of our method (i.e. a step parameter for iterative adjustment of the threshold value, rules for combining the boundaries, etc.",

        "However, we found out that our approach achieves approximately 1% higher score when the best performing threshold value is selected from the candidate list.",
        "There are two observations that account for the suboptimal threshold choice by our algorithm.",
        "On one hand, the correspondence between description length and F-score is not absolutely perfect, and this may pose an obstacle to the optimization process for relatively small language samples.",
        "Another issue lies in the bisection search routine, which suggests approximations of the description length minima.",
