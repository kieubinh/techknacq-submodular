        "Since the early days of statistical NLP, researchers have observed that a part-of-speech tag distribution exhibits \"one tag per discourse\" sparsity – words are likely to select a single predominant tag in a corpus, even when several tags are possible.",
        "Simply assigning to each word its most frequent associated tag in a corpus achieves 94.6% accuracy on the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank.",
        "This distributional sparsity of syntactic tags is not unique to English – similar results have been observed across multiple languages.",
        "Clearly, explicitly modeling such a powerful constraint on tagging assignment has a potential to significantly improve the accuracy of an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger learned without a tagging dictionary.",
        "In practice, this sparsity constraint is difficult to incorporate in a traditional POS induction system (Merialdo, 1994; Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; Graca et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).",
        "These sequence models-based approaches commonly treat token-level tag assignment as the primary latent variable.",
        "By design, they readily capture regularities at the token-level.",
        "However, these approaches are ill-equipped to directly represent type-based constraints such as sparsity.",
        "Previous work has attempted to incorporate such constraints into token-level models via heavy-handed modifications to inference procedure and objective function (e.g., posterior regularization and ILP decoding) (Graca et al., 2009; Ravi and Knight, 2009).",
        "In most cases, however, these expansions come with a steep increase in model complexity, with respect to training procedure and inference time.",
        "In this work, we take a more direct approach and treat a word type and its allowed POS tags as a primary element of the model.",
        "The model starts by generating a tag assignment for each word type in a vocabulary, assuming one tag per word.",
        "Then, token-level HMM emission parameters are drawn conditioned on these assignments such that each word is only allowed probability mass on a single assigned tag.",
        "In this way we restrict the parameterization of a",
        "Table 1: Upper bound on tagging accuracy assuming each word type is assigned to majority POS tag.",
        "Across all languages, high performance can be attained by selecting a single tag per word type.",
        "token-level HMM to reflect lexicon sparsity.",
        "This model admits a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm where the number of latent variables is proportional to the number of word types, rather than the size of a corpus as for a standard HMM sampler (Johnson, 2007).",
        "There are two key benefits of this model architecture.",
        "First, it directly encodes linguistic intuitions about POS tag assignments: the model structure reflects the one-tag-per-word property, and a typelevel tag prior captures the skew on tag assignments (e.g., there are fewer unique determiners than unique nouns).",
        "Second, the reduced number of hidden variables and parameters dramatically speeds up learning and inference.",
        "We evaluate our model on seven languages exhibiting substantial syntactic variation.",
        "On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of state-of-the art systems.",
        "Our analysis identifies three key factors driving our performance gain: 1) selecting a model structure which directly encodes tag sparsity, 2) a type-level prior on tag assignments, and 3) a straightforward naive-Bayes approach to incorporate features.",
        "The observed performance gains, coupled with the simplicity of model implementation, makes it a compelling alternative to existing more complex counterparts."

        "Recent work has made significant progress on unsupervised POS tagging (Merialdo, 1994; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; Ravi and Knight, 2009).",
        "Our work is closely related to recent approaches that incorporate the sparsity constraint into the POS induction process.",
        "This line of work has been motivated by empirical findings that the standard EM-learned unsupervised HMM does not exhibit sufficient word tag sparsity.",
        "The extent to which this constraint is enforced varies greatly across existing methods.",
        "On one end of the spectrum are clustering approaches that assign a single POS tag to each word type (Schütze, 1995; Lamar et al., 2010).",
        "These clusters are computed using an SVD variant without relying on transitional structure.",
        "While our method also enforces a singe tag per word constraint, it leverages the transition distribution encoded in an HMM, thereby benefiting from a richer representation of context.",
        "Other approaches encode sparsity as a soft constraint.",
        "For instance, by altering the emission distribution parameters, Johnson (2007) encourages the model to put most of the probability mass on few tags.",
        "This design does not guarantee \"structural zeros,\" but biases towards sparsity.",
        "A more forceful approach for encoding sparsity is posterior regularization, which constrains the posterior to have a small number of expected tag assignments (Graca et al., 2009).",
        "This approach makes the training objective more complex by adding linear constraints proportional to the number of word types, which is rather prohibitive.",
        "A more rigid mechanism for modeling sparsity is proposed by Ravi and Knight (2009), who minimize the size of tagging grammar as measured by the number of transition types.",
        "The use of ILP in learning the desired grammar significantly increases the computational complexity of this method.",
        "In contrast to these approaches, our method directly incorporates these constraints into the structure of the model.",
        "This design leads to a significant reduction in the computational complexity of training and inference.",
        "Another thread of relevant research has explored the use of features in unsupervised POS induction (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Hasan and Ng, 2009).",
        "These methods demonstrated the benefits of incorporating linguistic features using a log-linear parameterization, but requires elaborate machinery for training.",
        "In our work, we demonstrate that using a simple nai've-Bayes approach also yields substantial performance gains, without the associated training complexity.",

        "Conditioned on T, features of word types W are drawn.",
        "We refer to (T, W) as the lexicon of a language and tp for the parameters for their generation; tp depends on a single hyperparameter ß.",
        "Once the lexicon has been drawn, the model proceeds similarly to the standard token-level HMM: Emission parameters 9 are generated conditioned on tag assignments T. We also draw transition parameters (f).",
        "Both parameters depend on a single hyperparameter a.",

Specifically, let St = {i\\Ti = t} denote the indices of the word types which have been assigned tag t according to the tag assignments T. Then Qt is drawn from DlRICHLET(a:, St), a symmetric Dirichlet which only places mass on word types indicated by St.",
