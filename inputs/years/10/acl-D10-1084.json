        "Recently, live chats have received attention due to the growing popularity of chat services and the increasing body of applications.",
        "For example, large organizations are increasingly providing support or information services through live chat.",
        "One advantage of chat-based customer service over conventional telephone-based customer service is that it becomes possible to semi-automate aspects of the interaction (e.g. conventional openings or canned responses to standard questions) without the customer being aware of it taking place, something that is not possible with speech-based dialogue systems (as synthesised speech is still easily distinguishable from natural speech).",
        "Potentially huge savings can be made by organisations providing customer help services if we can increase the degree of automation of live chat.",
        "Given the increasing impact of live chat services, there is surprisingly little published computational linguistic research on the topic.",
        "There has been substantially more work done on dialogue and dialogue corpora, mostly in spoken dialogue (e.g. Stolcke et al.",
        "(2000)) but also multimodal dialogue systems in application areas such as telephone support service (Bangalore et al., 2006) and tutoring systems (Lit-man and Silliman, 2004).",
        "Spoken dialogue analysis introduces many complications related to the error inherent in current speech recognition technologies.",
        "As an instance of written dialogue, an advantage of live chats is that recognition errors are not such an issue, although the nature of language used in chat is typically ill-formed and turn-taking is complicated by the semi-asynchronous nature of the interaction (e.g. Werry (1996)).",
        "In this paper, we investigate the task of automatic classification of dialogue acts in 1-on-1 live chats, focusing on \"information delivery\" chats since these are proving increasingly popular as part of enterprise customer-service solutions.",
        "Our main challenge is to develop effective features and classifiers for classifying aspects of 1-on-1 live chat.",
        "Much of the work on analysing dialogue acts in spoken dialogues has relied on non-lexical features, such as prosody and acoustic features (Stolcke et al., 2000; Julia and Iftekharuddin, 2008; Sridhar et al., 2009), which are not available for written dialogues.",
        "Previous dialogue-act detection for chat systems has used bags-of-words (hereafter, BoW) as features for dialogue-act detection; this simple approach has shown some promise (e.g. Bangalore et al.",
        "(2006), Louwerse and Crossley (2006) and Ivanovic (2008)).",
        "Other features such as keywords/ontologies (Purver et al., 2005; Forsyth, 2007) and lexical cues (Ang et al., 2005) have also been used for dialogue act classification.",
        "In this paper, we first re-examine BoW features for dialogue act classification.",
        "As a baseline, we use the work of Ivanovic (2008), which explored 1-grams and 2-grams with Boolean values in 1-on-1 live chats in the MSN Online Shopping domain (this dataset is described in Section 5).",
        "Although this work achieved reasonably high performance (up to a micro-averaged F-score of around 80%), we believe that there is still room for improvement using BoW only.",
        "We extend this work by using ideas from related research such as text categorization (Debole and Sebastiani, 2003), and explore variants of BoW based on analysis of live chats, along with feature weighting.",
        "Finally, our main aim is to explore new features based on dialogue structure and dependencies between utterances that can enhance the use of BoW for dialogue act classification.",
        "Our hypothesis is that, for task-oriented 1-on-1 live chats, the structure and interactions among utterances are useful in predicting future dialogue acts: for example, conversations typically start with a greeting, and questions and answers typically appear as adjacency pairs in a conversation.",
        "Therefore, we propose new features based on structural and dependency information derived from utterances (Sections 4.2 and 4.3)."

        "While there has been significant work on classifying dialogue acts, the bulk of this has been for spoken dialogue.",

        "We focus here on (2) and (3); we return to (1) in Section 3.",
        "For classifying dialogue acts in spoken dialogue, various features such as dialogue cues, speech characteristics, and n-grams have been proposed.",

        "(2002) also used transformation-and rule-based approaches plus HMMs for written dialogues.",
        "Other researchers have used Bayesian based approaches, such as naive Bayes (e.g. (Grau et al., 2004; Forsyth, 2007; Ivanovic, 2008)) and Bayesian networks (e.g. (Keizer, 2001; Forsyth, 2007)).",
        "Maximum entropy (e.g. (Ivanovic, 2008)), support vector machines (e.g. (Ivanovic, 2008)), and hidden Markov models (e.g. (Bui, 2003)) have also all been applied to automatic dialogue act classification."

        "In this section, we describe our initial dialogue-act classification experiments using simple BoW features, and then introduce two groups of new features based on structural information and dependencies between utterances.",
        "n-gram-based BoW features are simple yet effective for identifying similarities between two utterances, and have been used widely in previous work on dialogue act classification for online chat dialogues (Louwerse and Crossley, 2006; Ivanovic, 2008).",
        "However, chats containing large amounts of noise such as typos and emoticons pose a greater challenge for simple BoW approaches.",
        "On the other hand, keyword-based features (Forsyth, 2007) have achieved high performance; however, keyword-based approaches are more domain-dependent.",
        "In this work, we chose to start with a BoW approach based on our observation that commercial live chat services contain relatively less noise; in particular, the commercial agent tends to use well-formed, formulaic prose.",
        "Previously, Ivanovic (2008) explored Boolean 1-",
        "gram and 2-gram features to classify MSN Online Shopping live chats, where a user requests assistance in purchasing an item, in response to whichthe commercial agent asks the customer questions and makes suggestions.",
        "Ivanovic (2008) achieved solid performance over this data (around 80% F-score).",
        "While 1-grams performed well (as live chat utterances are generally shorter than, e.g., sentences in news articles), we expect 2 and 3-grams are needed to detect formulaic expressions, such as No problem and You are welcome.",
        "We would also expect a positive effect from combining n-grams due to increasing the coverage of feature words.",
        "We thus test 1-, 2 and 3-grams individually, as well as the combination of 1 and 2-grams together (i.e. 1+2-grams) and 1-, 2 and 3-grams (i.e. 1+2+3-grams); this results in five BoW sets.",
        "Also, unlike Ivanovic (2008), we test both raw words and lemmas; we expect the use of lemmas to perform better than raw words as our data is less noisy.",
        "As the feature weight, in addition to simple Boolean, we also experiment with TF, TFIDF and Information Gain (IG).",
        "Our motivation for using structural information as a feature is that the location of an utterance can be a strong predictor of the dialogue act.",
        "That is, dialogues are sequenced, comprising turns (i.e. a given user is sending text), each of which is made up of one or more messages (i.e. strings sent by the user).",
        "Structured classification methods which make use of this sequential information have been applied to related tasks such as tagging semantic labels of key sentences in biomedical domains (Chung, 2009) and post labels in web forums (Kim et al., 2010).",
        "Based on the nature of live chats, we observed that the utterance position in the chat, as well as in a turn, plays an important role when identifying its dialogue act.",
        "For example, an utterance such as Hello will occur at the beginning of a chat while an utterance such as Have a nice day will typically appear at the end.",
        "The position of utterances in a turn can also help identify the dialogue act; i.e. when there are several utterances in a turn, utterances are related to each other, and thus examining the previous utterances in the same turn can help correctly predict the target utterance.",

        "They used relative position, author information and automatically predicted labels from previous post(s) as dependency features for assigning a semantic label to the current target post.",
        "Similarly, by examining our chat corpus, we observed significant dependencies between utterances.",
        "First, 1-on-1 (i.e. agent-to-user) dialogues often contain dependencies between adjacent utterances by different authors.",

        "Another example is that when the agent makes a greeting, such as Have a nice day, then the customer will typically respond with a greeting or closing remark, and not a Yes or No.",
        "Second, the flow of dialogues is in general cohesive, unless the topic of utterances changes dramatically (e.g. U5: Are you still there?, U22: brb in 1 min in Table 2).",

        "Overall, using CRFs with Author and Position information produced better performance than using BoW alone.",
        "Clearly, the ability of CRFs to natively optimise over structural dependencies provides an advantage over other learners.",
        "Relative position cannot of course be measured directly in an actual online application; hence Table 6 also includes the use of \"absolute position\" as a feature.",
        "We see that, for CRF, the absolute position feature shows an insignificant drop in accuracy as compared to the use of relative position.",
        "(However, we do see a significant drop in performance when using this feature with SVM and NB.)",
        "We next combined the inter-utterance dependency features with the BoW features.",
        "Since we use the dialogue acts directly in utterance dependency, we first experimented using gold-standard dialogue act labels.",
        "We also tested using the dialogue acts which were automatically learned in previous steps.",
        "Table 7 shows performance using both the goldstandard and learned dialogue acts.",
        "The different features listed are as follows: LabelList/L indicates those corresponding to all utterances in a dialogue preceding the target utterance; Label-Prev/P indicates a dialogue act from a previous utterance; LabelAuthor/A indicates a dialogue act from a previous utterance by the same author; and LabelPrevt/LabelAuthort indicates the previous utterance(s) and previously same-authored ut-terance(s) in a turn, respectively.",
        "Since the accuracy for SVM and NB using learned labels is similar to that using gold standard labels, for brevity we report the performance for CRF using learned labels only.",
        "Results that exceed the BoW accuracy at a level of statistical significance (p < 0.05) are boldfaced.",
        "Utterance dependency features worked well in combination with CRF only.",
        "Individually, Prev and Prevt (i.e. BoW+P+Pt) helped to achieve higher accuracies, and the Author feature was also beneficial.",
        "However, List decreased the performance, as the flow of dialogues can change, and when a larger history of dialogue acts is included, it tends to introduce noise.",
        "Comparing use of gold-standard and learned dialogue acts, the reduction in accuracy was not statistically significant, indicating that we can",
