        "The reliable processing of temporal information is an important step in many NLP applications, such as information extraction, question answering, and document summarisation.",
        "Consequently, the tasks of identifying and assigning values to temporal expressions have recently received significant attention, resulting in the creation of mature corpus annotation guidelines (e.g. TIMEX2 and TimeML), publicly available annotated corpora (ACE, TimeBank) and a number of automatic taggers (see, for example, (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Schilder, 2004; Hacioglu et al., 2005; Negri and Marseglia, 2005; Saquete, 2005; Han et al., 2006; Ahn et al., 2007)).",
        "However, existing corpora have their limitations.",
        "In particular, the documents in these corpora tend to be limited in length and, in consequence, discourse structure.",
        "This impacts on the number, range and variety of temporal expressions they contain.",
        "Existing research carried out on the interpretation of temporal expressions, e.g. by (Baldwin, 2002; Ahn et al., 2005; Mazur and Dale, 2008), suggests that many temporal expressions in documents, especially news stories, can be interpreted fairly simply as being relative to a reference date that is typically the document creation date.",
        "This phenomenon does not carry over to longer, more narrative-style documents that describe extended sequences of events, as found, for example, in biographies or descriptions of protracted geopolitical events.",
        "Consequently, existing corpora are not ideal as development data for systems intended to work on such historical narrations.",
        "In this paper we introduce a new annotated corpus of temporal expressions that is intended to address this shortfall.",
        "The corpus, which we call WikiWars, consists of 22 documents from English Wikipedia that describe the historical course of wars.",
        "Despite the small number of documents, their length means that the corpus yields a large number of temporal expressions, and poses new challenges for tracking temporal focus through extended texts.",
        "The corpus has been made available for others to use; to give an indication of the difficulty of processing the temporal phenomena in the texts, we also report on the performance of DANTE, our temporal expression tagger, on detecting and interpreting the temporal expressions in the corpus.",
        "The rest of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe related work, focusing on the TIMEX2 annotation scheme, and existing corpora that contain annotations of temporal expressions using this scheme.",
        "Section 3 describes the process of creation of the WikiWars corpus.",
        "In Section 4 we comment on some artefacts of Wikipedia articles that impact on the annotation process and the use of this corpus.",
        "Then, in Section 5 we analyse the differences between the WikiWars corpus and the widely-used ACE corpora.",
        "In Section 6 we report on the performance of our temporal expression tagger on this data set.",
        "Finally, in Section 7, we conclude."

        "At the time of writing, there are two mature, wide-coverage schemes for the annotation of temporal information in texts: TIMEX2 (Ferro et al., 2005) and TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Boguraev et al., 2005), which is soon to become an ISO standard (Pustejovsky et al., 2010).",
        "These schemes were used to annotate corpora that are often used in research on temporal expression recognition and normalisation: the series of corpora used for training and evaluation in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program run in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and the TimeBank Corpus.",
        "The ACE corpora were prepared for the development and evaluation of systems participating in the ACE program.",
        "However, the evaluation corpora have never been publicly released, and thus are currently, for all practical purposes, unavailable.",
        "The ACE 2004 corpus contains news data only (broadcast news, newspaper and newswire), while the ACE 2005 and 2007 corpora contain news (broadcast and newswire), conversations (broadcast and telephone), UseNet discussions and web blogs.",
        "The 2005 and 2007 ACE corpora are annotated with the latest verannotated with the older 2003 version of TIMEX2; however, the differences are not very significant.",
        "Apart from the unavailability of the evaluation data, there are two issues with the ACE corpora.",
        "One is that most of the documents are relatively short, so that the average number of temporal expressions per document is low (typically between seven and nine per document, including the document time stamp as a metadata element).",
        "This results in very limited temporal discourse structure, and relatively few underspecified and relative temporal expressions.",
        "Unfortunately, these are the more difficult temporal expressions to handle, and so the ACE corpora may not serve as a good baseline for performance more generally.",
        "A second problem is that the ACE corpora appear to contain a significant number of errors in the gold standard annotations, with respect to both the annotated extents and the semantic values assigned, which do not always follow the TIMEX2 guidelines.",
        "TimeBank v1.2 is a revised and improved version of TimeBank 1.1 resulting in a number of errors fixed and inconsistencies removed (see (Boguraev et al., 2007)).",
        "Unfortunely, this corpus has the same limitations as the ACE corpora in regard to document length and complexity of discourse structure.",
        "Further, TimeBank is annotated with TimeML, a scheme more complex than TIMEX2 since it also encompasses the tagging of events and temporal relations.",
        "However, TIMEX2 is sufficiently sophisticated for the annotation of most types of temporal expressions, and our review of the literature reveals that the majority of existing temporal taggers output TIMEX2 annotations.",
        "Since automatic conversion between TIMEX2 and TimeML annotations is not straightforward, TimeBank is of limited use for those who work specifically with TIMEX2."

        "Given the above concerns, we were particularly interested in developing a corpus that would allow more rigorous testing of techniques for tracking time across extended narratives, since these give rise to more complex temporal phenomena than are found in simpler documents.",
        "To avoid copyright issues that might arise in the development and distribution of such a corpus, we decided to use Wikipedia as a source.",
        "After considering various types of historical narrative, we settled on descriptions of the course of wars and conflicts as being particularly rich in the kinds of phenomena we wanted to explore.",
        "We queried Google with two phrases, 'most famous wars in history' and 'the biggest wars', and in each case chose the top-ranked result.",
        "One of the pages found proposed a list of the 10 most famous wars in history, and the other listed the names of the 20 biggest wars that happened in the 20th century, measured in terms of the number of military deaths.",
        "We combined the two lists, eliminated duplicates, and searched Wikipedia for articles describing these wars.",
        "Wikipedia did not contain an article for one war, and we considered two articles as inappropriate for our purposes since they did not describe the course of the wars, but rather some general information about the conflicts.",
        "This resulted in a final set of 22 articles.",
        "More details of the selection process and the URLs of the chosen Wikipedia articles are provided in the documentation distributed with the corpus.",
        "To prepare the corpus, we first manually copied text from those sections of the webpages that described the course of the wars.",
        "This involved manual removal of picture captions and cross-page links.",
        "We then ran a script over the results of this extraction process to convert some Unicode characters into ASCII (ligatures, spaces, apostrophes, hyphens and other punctuation marks), and to remove citation links and a variety of other Wikipedia annotations.",
        "Finally, we converted each of the text files into an SGML file: each document was wrapped in one doc tag, inside which there are docid, doctype and DATETIME tags.",
        "The document time stamp is the date and time at which we downloaded the page from Wikipedia to our local repository.",
        "The proper content of the article is wrapped in a text tag.",
        "This document structure intentionally follows that of the ACE 2005 and 2007 documents, so as to make the processing and evaluation of the WikiWars data highly compatible with the tools used to process the ACE corpora.",
        "Having prepared the input SGML documents, we then processed them with the DANTE temporal expression tagger (see Mazur and Dale (2007)).",
        "DANTE outputs the original SGML documents augmented with an inline TIMEX2 annotation for each temporal expression found.",
        "These output files can be imported to Callisto, an annotation tool that supports TIMEX2 annotations.",
        "Using a temporal expression tagger as a first-pass annotation tool not only significantly reduces the amount of human annotation effort required (creating a tag from scratch requires a number of clicks in the annotation tool), but also helps to minimize the number of errors that arise from overlooking markable expressions through 'annotator blindness'.",
        "The annotations produced by DANTE were then manually corrected in Callisto via the following process.",
        "First, Annotator 1 (the first author) corrected all the annotations produced by DANTE, both in terms of extent and the values provided for TIMEX2 attributes.",
        "This process also included the annotation of any temporal expression missed by the automatic tagger, and the removal of spurious matches.",
        "Then, Annotator 2 (the second author) checked all the revised annotations and prepared a list of errors found and doubts or queries in regard to potentially problematic annotations.",
        "Annotator 1 then verified and fixed the errors, after discussion in the case of disagreements.",
        "The final SGML files containing inline annotations were then transformed into ACE APF XML annotation files, this being the stand-off markup format developed for ACE evaluations.",
        "This transformation was carried out using the tern2apf tool developed by NIST for the ACE 2004 evaluations, with some modifications introduced by us to adjust the tool to support ACE 2005 documents and to add a document ID as part of the ID of a TIMEX2 annotation (so that all annotations would have corpus-wide unique IDs).",
        "The resulting corpus is thus available in two formats: one contains the original documents enriched with inline annotations, and the other consists of stand-off annotations in the ACE APF format.",
        "The annotation process described above revealed some issues with the use of TIMEX2 in practice.",
        "First, the flexibility of the TIMEX2 scheme, which can be at first seen as an advantage, actually makes it ambiguous.",
        "One instance of this phenomenon relates to the fact that the TIMEX2 guidelines state that the provision of some attribute values for what are called event-based expressions (such as three weeks after the siege of Boston began or the first year of the American invasion) is optional.",
        "Since our corpus has a significant number of such expressions, the decision as to whether or not to provide semantic values in such cases has a potentially large impact on the perceived performance of a tagger.",
        "In such cases, we decided only to provide the value when it is very clear from the article itself what the value should be.",
        "Another area where TIMEX2 is not ideal is in regard to the annotation of time zones.",
        "First, only whole-hour time differences are supported, which eliminates some time zones (e.g. Afghanistan lies in UTC+04:30).",
        "Second, time zone information is supposed to be marked only for expressions which have it explicitly stated.",
        "However, it can often be inferred from the context that subsequent unadorned time references should inherit the same time zone as an earlier time reference.",
        "We also found that, in a not insignificant number of cases, it is impossible to provide a precise and correct value for a temporal expression.",
        "For example, the TIMEX2 guidelines stipulate that the anchors of durations cannot have a MOD attribute, so if the anchor is mid-August, the value of the anchor must refer to August, which is not entirely correct as the semantics of midis lost.",
        "TIMEX2 only supports nonspecific expressions which have explicit information about granularity.",
        "Expressions such as a very short time or a short period of time therefore cannot be provided with any value, since the context does not indicate whether the period involved should be measured in days, weeks, or months.",
        "One might consider using the typical durations of events of the corresponding types in such cases, but this solution also has problems (see (Pan et al., 2006)).",
        "As is acknowledged in the TIMEX2 guidelines, the treatment of set expressions (i.e. recurring times and durations and frequencies, e.g. twice a month) is underdeveloped.",
        "One rule states that set expressions should not be anchored (Ferro et al., 2005, p. 42); this has the consequence that the full semantics of the expression annually since 1955 cannot be provided, and the expression is therefore treated as two separate expressions, annually and 1955.",
        "Finally, alternative calendars are not supported, so an expression like February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar cannot receive a value unless it appears in an appositive construction which provides an alternative description.",
        "Similarly, consider Example (1):",
        "(1) On 9 November 1799 (18 Brumaire of the Year VIII) Napoleon Bonaparte staged the coup of 18 Brumaire which installed the Consulate.",
        "Here, 18 Brumaire of the Year VIII is a date in an alternative calendar used in France, but we annotated only the Year VIII based on the trigger year.",
        "Note that 18 Brumaire also occurs later in the sentence, but is not annotated.",
        "The corpus contains 22 documents with a total of almost 120,000 tokens and 2,671 temporal expressions annotated in TIMEX2 format.",
        "In Table 1 we compare the WikiWars corpus with the other existing corpora.",
        "While the ACE 2005 Training corpus remains the largest corpus, WikiWars is larger than the ACE 2005 and 2007 evaluation corpora and the TimeBank v1.2 corpus, both in terms of number of tokens and TIMEX2 annotations.",
        "WikiWars has an order of magnitude more temporal expressions in each document, and a slightly higher density of temporal expressions than the other corpora.",
        "Table 2 presents statistics on the individual documents that make up the corpus.",
        "The documents vary considerably in size, the smallest consisting of only 1,455 tokens, and the largest being eight times larger at 11,640 tokens.",
        "The density of TIMEX2 annotations varies from 1 in 23.1 tokens to 1 in 72.1 tokens, but for the majority of documents the ratio lies between 30 and 60."

        "Wikipedia articles may be edited by a large number of people over a significant number of revisions.",
        "We checked how often the articles constituting WikiWars were modified in the period from January 2008 to February 2010.",
        "On average, each article was changed almost 52 times per month, with the monthly number of changes for a single article ranging from 1 to 372.The minimum average for an individual document was 13.08 (17_AlgerianWar), and the maximum was 171.77 (07JraqWar).",
        "The nature of the revision process in Wikipedia leads to some artefacts that may be not typical of other document sources, such as news, where the text is usually carefully prepared by its author and checked by an editor.",
        "This is not to say that Wikipedia content is necessarily of low quality; this is an encyclopedia with many people and bots controlling its quality, and there exist manuals of style for authors to help them avoid errors and ambiguity and to ensure maximum consistency.",
        "However, given the large number of editors with various degrees of fluency and experience in writing and editing, it would not be surprising if some parts of the texts are not perfect.",
        "In the process of preparing the gold standard annotations for the WikiWars corpus, we have made the following observations.",
        "In some articles we have found situations where a sentence does not appear to cohere with those on either side of it.",
        "This may be the result of a number of modifications made by different authors, or it may be due to a lack of writing skill on the part of the person who wrote the paragraph in question.",
        "Example (2) below provides an example of this phenomenon: the sentence about de Gaulle being elected president contains a temporal expression which progresses the temporal focus in the narrative to 1959, but the later context of the article strongly suggests that the subsequent reference to October is in fact October 1958.",
        "(2) ALN commandos committed numerous acts of sabotage in France in August[1958], and the FLN mounted a desperate campaign of terror in Algeria to intimidate Muslims into boycotting the referendum.",
        "Despite threats of reprisal, however, 80 percent of the Muslim electorate turned out to vote in September[1958], and of these 96 percent approved the constitution.",

        "Usually a narrative progresses forwards in time, not backwards, so the month must start either on 14th April or 16th June: if the second sentence elaborates the first one, then it is a month from 16th June; if it just mentions one of the requests for larger units, then it is probably a month from 14th April.",
        "It is also unclear whether the second paragraph talks about the same request for airborne forces which was mentioned in the first paragraph: both these events are dated July.",
        "The phrase In response to this request is in fact placed very oddly, as its preceding sentence does not mention any request, but rather talks about the Soviets' response to requests.",
        "This may suggest that what at first looks just like a careless and ambiguous use of the expression after a month is in fact a larger problem of lack of coherency in these two paragraphs.",
        "One of the articles, 07_iraqWar, contained a number of deictic temporal expressions, indicative of the fact that the events described were happening contemporaneously to the time of writing (as is often the case in news stories); for example:",
        "(4) a. Democrats plan to push legislation this spring that would force the Iraqi government to spend its own surplus to rebuild.",
        "b.",
        "A protester said that despite the approval of the Interim Security pact, the Iraqi people would break it in a referendum next year.",
        "Obviously, after some time these expressions will no longer make sense, since there is no 'at-the-time-of-writing' time stamp associated with these sentences: for the reader of a Wikipedia article, the reference date is the time of reading.",
        "In the case of the above example, these sentences were written in April and December 2008, respectively.",
        "Arguably, these sentences should be corrected, making the temporal expressions fully-specified (e.g. in spring of2009 and in 2009), or context-dependent (e.g. in spring of that year and the following year) if there is a context in the article which supports their correct interpretation.",
        "Of course, not only the temporal expressions need to be revised, but also the tense and aspect of the verbs used in the sentences.",
        "In the gold standard annotations, however, we provided the values by interpreting these expressions with respect to the document time stamp (i.e. 2 010-SP and 2 010), as the text itself does not provide any evidence that other dates were intended.",
        "Consider the following example, which comes from the article 01_ww2:",
        "(5) On December 7 (December 8 in Asian time zones), 1941, Japan attacked British and American holdings with near simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific.",
        "The italicized temporal expression is difficult to detect, and it is not clear how it should be annotated.",
        "But it is also imprecise with respect to which time zone is intended: Asia encompasses 10 time zones.",
        "Therefore it is impossible to fully interpret the expression.",
        "Note also that the expression combines a time zone with a date, rather than with a time.",
        "While uncommon, this is not incorrect; but the TIMEX2 guidelines do not explicitly allow for this circumstance.",
        "Occasionally it happens that an article contains a quoted utterance, but there is no indication of when the utterance was made.",
        "For example, in the document 05_VietnamWar we find the following:",
        "(6) Nixon said in an announcement, \"I am tonight announcing plans for the withdrawal of an additional 150,000 American troops to be completed during the spring of next year.",
        "This will bring a total reduction of 265,500 men in our armed forces in Vietnam below the level that existed when we took office 15 months ago\"",

        "A comparison of WikiWars with the ACE corpora reveals some interesting differences.",
        "First, we found differences on the level of the lexical triggers that signal the presence of temporal expressions.",
        "Because of space limitations, we provide here only the main findings.",
        "Tables 3 and 4 present the 51 most frequent tokens, including punctuation, in the ACE 2005 Training and WikiWars corpus, respectively.",
        "Some tokens are combined into what we call trigger classes; for example, all weekday names belong to the class",
        "WEEKDAYNAME.",
        "We can see that there are many classes that fall into the top 51 positions for both corpora, e.g. the names of temporal units (such as month and year).",
        "But there are also clear differences.",
        "Month names are the most frequent class in WikiWars, while they are not so frequent in ACE.",
        "Similarly, year seasons ranked very highly in WikiWars, but do not figure in the rankings shown for ACE.",
        "On the other hand, weekday names are quite frequent in the ACE corpus, but do not occur in the table for WikiWars.",
        "This suggests that these corpora make different use of temporal expressions: in WikiWars we find many references to the more distant past, thus the high use of month names, but ACE documents tend to discuss temporally local issues, so they are more likely to refer to days in the weeks preceding and following the reference date.",
        "Looking at individual tokens, we can see that deictic expressions such as today, tonight, yesterday and tomorrow are in the top 51 positions for ACE, but almost never occur in WikiWars: there are only three instances of today, two of tomorrow and one of tonight in the corpus, and all of these appear only in quoted speech.",
        "Similarly, ago occurred 113 times in ACE, but only twice in WikiWars: once in quoted speech, and once used incorrectly instead of earlier in a context-dependent expression.",
        "Other tokens which are frequent in ACE but rare in WikiWars are recent, recently, current and currently.",
        "A more interesting property that WikiWars exhibits, and which is noticeably absent from the simpler ACE data, is what we might think of as a discourse mechanism for resetting the temporal focus.",
        "This is a feature of complex texts in general, rather than something that is specific to Wikipedia as a source.",
        "In these cases, the discourse does not follow a single global timeline from the beginning to the end of the document, but is rather divided into subdiscourses which describe separate chains of events that often have common temporal starting points.",
        "This is typical in the description of big, often international, conflicts, where one can distinguish several theaters of the war, i.e. the eastern and western theaters.",
        "In most cases the switch to a different 'part of the story' can be determined not only by analysing the events and their geographic locations, but by recognizing that the first date appearing in the new subdis-course is generally fully specified.",
        "This is, however, not always the case, as shown in the following example extracted from the article 01_ww2:",
        "(7) In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on October 20[1944].",
        "A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945.",
        "By the start of July [1944], Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the Chindwin River while the Chinese captured Myitkyina.",
        "In China, the Japanese were having greater successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June[1944] and the city of Hengyang by early August[1944].",
        "Soon after, they [... ] by the end ofNovember[\\944] and successfully linking up their forces in China and Indochina by the middle of December[1944].",

        "Performance at finding temporal expressions in text is traditionally reported, for example by (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Negri and Marseglia, 2005; Teissedre et al., 2010), in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.",
        "These can, however, be calculated in two ways, lenient and strict, corresponding to two tasks: detection (where a single character overlap between the gold standard and system annotation counts as a correct answer) and recognition (where an exact overlap is required).",
        "Table 5 shows our tagger's initial performance on the data.",
        "While the lenient F-measure for extent recognition was comparable to that obtained for the ACE 2005 Training corpus (0.82 vs 0.78), the recall was much lower: 0.75 vs 0.87.",
        "The difference in strict results was even larger, where both precision and recall were lower for WikiWars than for ACE, resulting in an F-measure of 0.38.",
        "When evaluating also the VAL attribute, the strict F-measure was quite low for both corpora, but significantly lower for WikiWars: 0.17 vs 0.33.",
        "This illustrates how illusive it may be to trust the performance of a tagger measured on a single, possibly biased, data set.",
        "In the light of the results of our comparison in Section 5, it is clear that at some of the performance loss here is simply due to domain differences with respect to lexical triggers.",
        "So, we extended DANTE's coverage with approximately 20 temporal triggers and modifiers to include the more common vocabulary that appeared in the WikiWars data; we also modified the recognition grammar to reduce the number of spurious matches and extent errors.",
        "These changes resulted in the improvements shown in Table 6.",
        "The performance on extent recognition improves significantly for both sets of data, but the gap between extent recognition and evaluation of the VAL attribute is much larger on WikiWars.",
        "This is most likely because the strategy of using the document time stamp for the interpretation of context-dependent expressions does not work at all for WikiWars documents, whereas it works well for ACE documents, in line with our earlier comments in regard to the genres of the documents.",
        "This emphasises the need to develop sophisticated methods for temporal focus tracking if we are to extend current time-stamping technologies beyond the relatively simplistic temporal structures found in currently available corpora."
