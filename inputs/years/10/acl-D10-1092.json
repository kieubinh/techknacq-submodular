        "In these studies, Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation p with human evaluation scores are used to measure how closely an automatic evaluation method correlates with human evaluation.",
        "This evaluation of automatic evaluation methods is called meta-evaluation.",
        "In human evaluation, people judge the adequacy and the fluency of each translation.",

        "Why does this happen?",
        "The former half of (J0) means \"He read the book,\" and the latter half means \" (he) was",
        "interested in world history.\"",
        "The middle word \"node\" between them corresponds to \"because.\"",
        "Therefore, SMT systems output sentences like (H0).",
        "On the other hand, Rule-based Machine Translation (RBMT) systems correctly give (R0).",
        "In order to find (R0), SMT systems have to search a very large space because we cannot restrict its search space with a small distortion limit.",
        "Most SMT systems thus fail to find (R0).",
        "Consequently, the global word order is essential for translation between distant language pairs, and wrong word order can easily lead to misunderstanding or incomprehensibility.",
        "Perhaps, some readers do not understand why we emphasize word order from this example alone.",
        "A few more examples will clarify what happens when SMT is applied to Japanese-to-English translation.",

        "Even Japanese people cannot solve this word order problem easily: It is well known that Japanese people are not good at speaking English.",
        "From this point of view, conventional automatic evaluation metrics of translation quality disregard word order mistakes too much.",
        "Single-reference BLEU is defined by a geometrical mean of n-gram precisions pn and is modified by Brevity Penalty (BP) min(1, exp(1 – r/h)), where r is the length of the reference and h is the length of the hypothesis.",

        "Therefore, BLEU gives a very good score to this inadequate translation because it checks only n-grams and does not regard global word order.",
        "Since (R0) and (H0) look similar in terms of fluency, adequacy is more important than fluency in the translation between distant language pairs.",
        "Similarly, other popular scores such as NIST, PER, and TER (Snover et al., 2006) also give relatively good scores to this translation.",
        "NIST also considers only local word orders (n-grams).",
        "PER (Position-Independent Word Error Rate) was designed to disregard word order completely.",
        "TER (Snover et al., 2006) was designed to allow phrase movements without large penalties.",
        "Therefore, these standard metrics are not optimal for evaluating translation between distant language pairs.",
        "In this paper, we propose an alternative automatic evaluation metric appropriate for distant language pairs.",
        "Our method is based on rank correlation coefficients.",
        "We use them to compare the word ranks in the reference with those in the hypothesis.",

        "(2010), we used Kendall's t to measure the effectiveness of our Head Finalization rule as a preprocessor for English-to-Japanese translation, but we measured the quality of translation by using conventional metrics.",
        "It is not clear how well t works as an automatic evaluation metric of translation quality.",
        "Moreover, Spearman's p might work better than Kendall's t. As we discuss later, t considers only the direction of the rank change, whereas p considers the distance of the change.",
        "The first objective of this paper is to examine which is the better metric for distant language pairs.",
        "The second objective is to find improvements of these rank correlation-metrics.",

        "x' = [1, 3, 2, 4] and y' = [4, 2,1, 3].",
        "Then, Spearman's p between x and y is given by Pearson's coefficients between x' and y'.",

        "Here, dj indicates the difference in the ranks of the i-th element.",
        "Rank distances are squared in this formula.",
        "Because of this square, we expect that p decreases drastically when there is an element that significantly changes in rank.",
        "But we are also afraid that p may be too severe for alternative good translations.",
        "Since Pearson's correlation metric assumes linearity, nonlinear monotonic functions can change its score.",
        "On the other hand, Spearman's p and Kendall's t uses ranks instead of raw evaluation scores, and simple application of monotonic functions cannot change them (use of other operations such as averaging sentence scores can change them)."

        "It has come to our attention that Birch et al.",
        "(2010) has independently proposed an automatic evaluation method based on Kendall's t. First, they started with Kendall's t distance, which can be written as \"1 – NKT\" in our terminology, and then subtracted it from one.",
        "Thus, their metric is nothing but NKT.",
        "Then, they proposed application of the square root to get better Pearson by improving \"the sensitivity to small reorderings.\"",
        "Since they used \"Kendall's t\" and \"Kendall's t distance\" interchangeably, it is not clear what they mean by \"v/~Kendall's t,\" but perhaps they mean 1 – yj 1 – NKT because VNKT is more insensitive to small reorderings.",
        "Table 3 shows the performance of these metrics for NTCIR-7 data.",
        "Pearson's correlation coefficient with adequacy was improved by 1 – V1 – NKT, but other scores were degraded in this experiment.",
        "The difference between our method and Birch et al.",
        "(2010)'s method comes from the fact that we used Japanese-English translation data and Spearman's correlation for meta-evaluation, whereas they used Chinese-English translation data and only Pearson's correlation for meta-evaluation.",
        "Chinese word order is different from English, but Chinese is a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language and thus is much closer to English word order than Japanese, a typical SOV language.",
        "We preferred NSR because it penalizes global word order mistakes much more than does NKT, and as discussed above, global word order mistakes often lead to incomprehensibility and misunderstanding.",
        "On the other hand, they also tried Hamming distance, and summarized their experiments as follows:",
        "However, the Hamming distance seems to be more informative than Kendall's tau for small amounts of reordering.",
        "This sentence and the introduction of the square root to NKT imply that Chinese word order is close to that of English, and they have to measure subtle word order mistakes.",
        "In spite of these differences, the two groups independently recognized the usefulness of rank correlations for automatic evaluation of translation quality for distant language pairs.",
        "In their WMT-2010 paper (Birch and Osborne, 2010), they multiplied NKT with the brevity penalty and interpolated it with BLEU for the WMT-2010 shared task.",
        "This fact implies that incomprehensible or misleading word order mistakes are rare in translation among European languages."

      "heading": "6. Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "When Statistical Machine Translation is applied to distant language pairs such as Japanese and English, word order becomes an important problem.",
        "SMT systems often fail to find an appropriate translation because of a large search space.",
        "Therefore, they often output misleading or incomprehensible sentences such as \"A because B\" vs. \"B because A.\"",
        "To penalize such inadequate translations, we presented an automatic evaluation method based on rank correlation.",
        "There were two questions for this approach.",
        "First, which correlation coefficient should we use: Spearman's p or Kendall's t?",
        "Second, how should we solve the overestimation problem caused by the nature of one-to-one correspondence?",
        "We answered these questions through our experiments using the NTCIR-7 PATMT JE translation data.",
        "For the first question, t was slightly better than p, but p was improved by precision.",
        "For the second question, it turned out that BLEU's Brevity Penalty was counter-productive.",
        "A precision-based penalty gave a better solution.",
        "With this precision-based penalty, both p and t worked well and they outperformed conventional methods for NTCIR-7 data.",
        "For similar language pairs, our method was comparable to conventional evaluation methods.",
        "Future work includes extension of the method so that it can outperform conventional methods even for similar language pairs.",
