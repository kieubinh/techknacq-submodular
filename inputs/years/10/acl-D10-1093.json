        "Electronic dictionaries are very useful in nowadays society, with the globalization and the increase of world communication and exchanges.",
        "There are clearly identified needs of dictionaries for human use as well as for automatic processing use.",
        "Given the importance of having recourse to standards when constructing such lexical resources in order to promote the reuse and the fusion, the standardization committee ISO TC37/SC4 has recently validated the Lexical Markup Framework norm (LMF) project under the standard ISO 24 613 (Francopoulo and George 2008).",
        "LMF provides a common and shared representation of lexical objects that allows for the encoding of rich linguistic information, including among others morphological, syntactic, and semantic aspects.",
        "The LMF proposal is distinguished by the separate management of the hierarchical data structure (meta-model) and elementary linguistic descriptors (data categories) which promotes to cover several languages.",
        "A normalized dictionary covers wide areas that include all lexical information of a given language and which are useful both for human use and for Natural Language Processing use in accordance with the kind of the user (linguist, lexicographer, developer, etc.",
        "), the level of the user (learner, expert, etc.)",
        "and the domain of the use (linguistic, medicine, biology, etc.).",
        "These dictionaries are characterized by a complex structure that supports the richness of natural languages.",
        "Therefore, dealing with a unique and complete dictionary is well for the manage task.",
        "However, such dictionaries are large and can be time consuming when querying their contents especially on the web.",
        "Moreover, displaying all details when some of which are not useful for the field of the query research is a nuisance for the user.",
        "So, it will be interesting to reduce the displayed details according to the domain or to the expertise level of the user by generating personalized views (virtual or materialized) in order to appropriate the use of such dictionaries to the user needs.",
        "The idea of creating document views is not a new concept but applying it on LMF normalized dictionaries is a new one.",
        "Indeed, it has been some attempts for dictionary creating in accordance to the TEI consortium (Véronis and Ide 1996) but the problem was the fact that created textual views (corresponding to the surface structure) or data base views (corresponding to the deep structure) were not customized.",
        "Others propositions are very interesting but they concern the ontology domain when dealing with the concept of point of view (Corby and al 2005).",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach that favors the use of normalized dictionaries by generating virtual/materialized personalized views.",
        "This approach is based on the profiles information associated to user's community which helps to retrieve already defined views stored in a library of views.",
        "For the illustration, we use an Arabic LMF normalized dictionary (Baccar and al.",
        "2008, Khemak-hem and al., 2009) developed in the framework of an Arabic project supervised by the ALECSO (The Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization) and founded by the University of King Abdul-Aziz in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia1 .",
