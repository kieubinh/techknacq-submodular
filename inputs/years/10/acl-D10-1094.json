        "We address the problem of generating candidate corrections for the task of correcting context-dependent mistakes in text, mistakes that involve confusing valid words in a language.",
        "A well-studied instance of this problem - context-sensitive spelling errors has received a lot of attention in natural language research (Golding and Roth, 1999; Carlson et al., 2001; Carlson and Fette, 2007; Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "The context-sensitive spelling correction task addresses the problem of correcting spelling mistakes that result in legitimate words, such as confusing their and there or your and you're.",
        "In this task, a candidate set or a confusion set is defined that specifies a list of confusable words, e.g., {their, there} or {cite, site, sight}.",
        "Each occurrence of a confusable word in text is represented as a vector of features derived from a small context window around the target.",
        "A classifier is trained on text assumed to be error-free, replacing each target word occurrence (e.g. their) with a confusion set consisting of {their, there}, thus generating both positive and negative examples, respectively, from the same context.",
        "Given a text to correct, for each word in text that belongs to the confusion set the classifier predicts the most likely candidate in the confusion set.",
        "More recently, work in error correction has taken an interesting turn and focused on correcting errors made by English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, with a special interest given to errors in article and preposition usage.",
        "These mistakes are some of the most common mistakes for non-native English speakers of all proficiency levels (Dalgish, 1985; Bitchener et al., 2005; Leacock et al., 2010).",
        "Approaches to correcting these mistakes have adopted the methods of the context-sensitive spelling correction task.",
        "A system is usually trained on well-formed native English text (Izumi et al., 2003; Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003; Han et al., 2006; Felice and Pulman, 2008; Gamon et al., 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Elghaari et al., 2010; Tetreault et al., 2010), but several works incorporate into training error-tagged data (Gamon, 2010; Han et al., 2010) or error statistics (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b).",
        "The classifier is then applied to non-native text to predict the correct article/preposition in context.",
        "The possible candidate selections include the set of all articles or all prepositions.",
        "While in the article correction task the candidate set is small (a, the, no article), systems for correcting preposition errors, even when they consider the most common prepositions, may include between 9 to 34 preposition classes.",
        "For each preposition in the non-native text, every other candidate in the confusion set is viewed as a potential correction.",
        "This approach, however, does not take into account that writers do not make mistakes randomly: Not all candidates are equally likely given the preposition chosen by the author and errors may depend on the first language (L1) of the writer.",
        "In this paper, we define Ll-dependent candidate sets for the preposition correction task (Section 4.1).",
        "L1-dependent candidate sets reflect preposition confusions observed with the speakers of the first language L1.",
        "We propose methods of enforcing L1-dependent candidate sets in training and testing.",
        "We consider mistakes involving the top ten English prepositions.",
        "As our baseline system, we train a multi-class classifier in one-vs-all approach, which is a standard approach to multi-class classification.",
        "In this approach, a separate binary classifier for each preposition pi, 1 < i < 10, is trained, s.t.",
        "all pi examples are positive examples for the classifier and all other nine classes act as negative examples.",
        "Thus, for each preposition pi in non-native text there are ten possible prepositions that the classifier can propose as corrections for pi.",
        "We contrast this baseline method to two methods that enforce L1-dependent candidate sets in training.",
        "First, we train a separate classifier for each preposition pi on the prepositions that belong to Ll-dependent candidate set of pi.",
        "In this setting, the negative examples for pi are those that belong to Ll-dependent candidate set of pi.",
        "The second method of enforcing Ll-dependent candidate sets in training is to train on native data with artificial preposition errors in the spirit of Ro-zovskaya and Roth (2010b), where the errors mimic the error rates and error patterns of the non-native text.",
        "This method requires more knowledge, since it uses a distribution of errors from an error-tagged corpus.",
        "We also propose a method of enforcing Ll-dependent candidate sets in testing, through the use of a confidence threshold.",
        "We consider two ways of applying a threshold: (1) the standard way, when a correction is proposed only if the classifier's confidence is sufficiently high and (2) L1-dependent threshold, when a correction is proposed only if it belongs to Ll-dependent candidate set.",
        "We show that the methods ofrestricting candidate sets to L1-dependent confusions improve the preposition correction system.",
        "We demonstrate that restricting candidate sets to those prepositions that are confusable in the data by L1 writers is beneficial, when compared to a system that assumes an unrestricted candidate set by considering as valid corrections all prepositions participating in the task.",
        "Furthermore, we find that the most effective method is the one that uses knowledge about the likelihoods of preposition confusions in the non-native text introduced through artificial errors in training.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we describe related work on error correction.",
        "Section 3 presents the ESL data and statistics on preposition errors.",
        "Section 4 describes the methods of restricting candidate sets in training and testing.",
        "Section 5 describes the experimental setup.",
        "We present and discuss the results in Section 6.",
