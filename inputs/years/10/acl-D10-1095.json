        "For example the passive-aggressive algorithm was adapted to chunking (Shimizu and Haas, 2006), parsing (McDonald et al., 2005b), learning preferences (Wick et al., 2009) and text segmentation (McDonald et al., 2005a).",
        "These new online algorithms are fast to train and simple to implement, yet they generate models that output merely a prediction with no additional information, as opposed to probabilistic models like CRFs or HMMs.",
        "In this work we fill this gap proposing few alternatives to compute confidence in the output of discriminative non-probabilistic algorithms.",
        "As before, our algorithms output the highest-scoring labeling.",
        "However, they also compute additional la-belings, that are used to compute the per word confidence in its labelings.",
        "We build on the recently introduced confidence-weighted learning (Dredze et al., 2008; Crammer et al., 2009b) and induce a distribution over labelings from the distribution maintained over weight-vectors.",
        "We show how to compute confidence estimates in the label predicted per word, such that the confidence reflects the probability that the label is not correct.",
        "We then use this confidence information to rank all labeled words (in all sentences).",
        "This can be thought of as a retrieval of the erroneous words, which can than be passed to human annotator for an examination, either to correct these mistakes or as a quality control component.",
        "Next, we show how to apply our techniques to active learning over sequences.",
        "We evaluate our methods on four NP chunking and NER datasets and demonstrate the usefulness of our methods.",
        "Finally, we report the performance of obtained by CW-like adapted to sequence prediction, which are comparable with current state-of-the-art algorithms."
