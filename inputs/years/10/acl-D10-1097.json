        "The task of identifying and classifying entity textual references in open-domain texts, i.e. the Mention Detection (MD) task, has become one of the most important subtasks of Information Extraction (IE).",
        "It might intervene both as one step to structure natural language texts or as a text enrichment preprocessing step to help other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications reach higher accuracy.",
        "Similarly to the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) nomenclature, we consider that a mention can be either named (e.g., John, Chicago), nominal (e.g., president, activist) or pronominal (e.g., he, she).",
        "It has also a specific class which describes the type of the entity it refers to.",
        "For instance, in the sentence:",
        "Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of NYC, declared his war on tobacco and sugary drinks in the city.",
        "we find the mentions 'Michael Bloomberg', 'Mayor' and 'his' of the same person entity.",
        "Their types are named, nominal and pronominal, respectively.",
        "'NYC' and 'city', on the other hand, are mentions of the same geopolitical (GPE) entity of type named and nominal, respectively.",
        "Consequently, MD is a more general and complex task than the well known Named Entity Recognition (NER) task which aims solely at the identification and classification of the named mentions.",
        "The difficulty of the MD task is directly related to the nature of the language and the linguistic resources available, i.e. it is easier to build accurate MD systems for languages with a simple morphology and a high amount of linguistic resources.",
        "For this reason, we explore the idea of using an MD system, which has been designed and built for a resource-rich language (RRL), to help enhance the performance of an MD system in a target language (TL).",
        "More specifically, the goal of the research work we present in this paper is to employ the richness of English, in terms of natural language resources, to raise the accuracy of MD systems in other languages.",
        "For instance, an English MD system might achieve a performance of F/?=i-measure=82.7 (Zitouni and Florian, 2009) when it resorts to a rich set of features extracted from diverse resources, namely: part-of-speech, chunk information, syntactic parse trees, word sense information, WordNet information and information from the output of other mention detection classifiers.",
        "In this paper, our research question revolves around investigating an adequate approach to use such a system to the benefit of other languages such as Arabic, Chinese, French or Spanish MD systems, which also have annotated resources but not of the same quantity and/or quality as English.",

        "To test this hypothesis, we have projected MD tags from RRL to TL via a parallel corpus, and then extracted several linguistic features about the automatically tagged words.",

        "Similarly to classical NLP tasks, such as Base Phrase Chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999) (BPC) or NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate the MD task as a sequence classification problem, i.e. the classifier assigns to each token in the text a label indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions.",
        "It also assigns to every non outside mention a class to specify its type: e.g., person, organization, location, etc.",

        "In order to achieve this goal, we propose an approach that uses an RRL-to-TL parallel corpus to bridge between these two languages.",
        "This approach performs in three main steps, namely: annotation, projection and feature extraction.",
        "In this section, we describe in details each of these steps.",
        "This first step consists of MD tagging of the RRL side of the parallel corpus.",

        "Once the RRL side of the parallel corpus is accurately augmented with MD tags, the projection step comes to transfer those tags to the TL side, Arabic in our case study, using the word alignment information.",
        "We illustrate the projection step with a relevant example.",
        "Let consider the following MD tagged English sentence:",
        "Bill/B-PER-NAM Clinton/I-PER-NAM is visiting North/B-GPE-NAM Korea/I-GPE-NAM today where \"Bill Clinton\" is a named person mention and \"North Korea\" is a named geopolitical entity (GPE) one.",

        "This tagged version of the Arabic text is provided to the third module of the process responsible on feature extraction (see Subsection 3.3).",
        "It is, however, pertinent to point out that the example we have used for illustration is relatively simple in the sense that almost all English and Arabic words have a 1-to-1 mapping.",
        "In real world translation (both human and automatic), one should expect to see 1-to-n, n-to-1 mappings as well as unmapped words on both sides of the parallel corpus rather frequently.",
        "As stated by (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), the projection of NER tags is easier in comparison to projecting other types of annotations such as POS-tags and BPC, mainly because:",
        "1.",
        "Not all the words are mentions: once we have projected the tags of the mentions from the RRL to TL side, the rest of tokens are simply considered as outside any mentions.",
        "This is different from the POStag and BPC where all the words are assigned a tag and thus when a word is unmapped, further processing is required (Yarowsky et al., 2001); 2.",
        "In case of a 1-to-n mapping, the target n words are assigned the same class: for instance, let consider the English GPE named mention \"North-Korea\".",
        "The segmented version of its Arabic translation would be\" ïJlr JI Ijjy?'",
        "(kwrya Al $mAlyp).",
        "The projection process consists in simply assigning the same class, i.e. GPE, to all Arabic tokens.",
        "The problem takes another dimension, however, in the case of propagating the POS-tags, because \"North\" is a NNP aligned with the determinant (DET) \"Al\" and the NNP \"$mAlyp\".",

        "3.",
        "In case ofn-to-1 mapping, the TL side word is simply assigned the class propagated from the RRL side.",
        "For instance, if on the English side we have the named person multi-word mention \"Ben Moussa\", translated into the one-word mention (bn-mwsY) on the Arabic side, then projection consists of simply assigning the person named tag to the Arabic word.",
        "However, in our research study, new challenges arose because our RRL data are automatically annotated, which is different from what has been reported in the research works we have mentioned before, i.e. (Yarowsky et al., 2001) and (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), where gold annotated data were used.",
        "In order to relax the impact of the noise introduced by the English MD system, we :",
        "1. use mention \"splits\" to filter annotation errors: We assume that when a sequence oftokens is tagged as a mention on the RRL side, its TL counterpart should be an uninterrupted sequence of tokens as well.",
        "When the RRL MD system captures incorrectly the span of a mention, e.g. in the sentence \"Dona Karan international reputation of...\", the RRL MD system might mistakenly tag \"Dona Karan international\" as an organization mention instead of tagging \"Dona Karan\" as a person mention.",
        "It is possible to detect this type of errors on the TL side because \"dwnA kArAn\" (Dona Karan) is distant from \"Al EAlmyp\" (international), i.e. they do not form an uninterrupted token sequence.",
        "We use this \"split\" in the mentions as information in order to not use these mentions in the feature extraction step (see Subsection 3.3).",
        "2. do not use the projected mentions directly for training: Instead, we use these tags as additional features to our TL baseline model and allow our MEMM classifier to weigh them according to their relevance to each mention type.",
        "At this point, the parallel corpus should be annotated with mentions on both of its sides.",
        "Where the RRL side is tagged using the English MD system during the annotation step (c.f section 3.1) while the TL side is annotated by the propagation of these MD tags via the parallel corpus in the projection step (c.f.",

        "Gazetteers: we group mentions by class in different dictionaries.",
