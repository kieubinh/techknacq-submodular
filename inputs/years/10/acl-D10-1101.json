        "The automatic extraction and analysis of opinions has been approached on several levels of granularity throughout the last years.",
        "As opinion mining is typically an enabling technology for another task, this overlaying system defines requirements regarding the level of granularity.",
        "Some tasks only require an analysis of the opinions on a document or sentence level, while others require an extraction and analysis on a term or phrase level.",
        "Amongst the tasks which require the finest level of granularity are: a) Opinion question answering - i.e. with questions regarding an entity as in \"What do the people like / dislike about X?\".",
        "b) Recommender systems - i.e. if the system shall only recommend entities which have received good reviews regarding a certain aspect.",
        "c) Opinion summarization - i.e. if one wants to create an overview of all positive / negative opinions regarding aspect Y of entity X and cluster them accordingly.",
        "All of these tasks have in common that in order to fulfill them, the opinion mining system must be capable of identifying what the opinions in the individual sentences are about, hence extract the opinion targets.",
        "Our goal in this work is to extract opinion targets from user-generated discourse, a discourse type which is quite frequently encountered today, due to the explosive growth of Web 2.0 community websites.",
        "Typical sentences which we encounter in this discourse type are shown in the following examples.",
        "The opinion targets which we aim to extract are underlined in the sentences, the corresponding opinion expressions are shown in italics.",
        "(1) While none of the features are earth-shattering, eCircles does provide a great place to keep in touch.",
        "(2) Hyundai's more-than-modest refresh has largely addressed all the original car's weaknesses while maintaining its price competitiveness.",
        "The extraction of opinion targets can be considered as an instance of an information extraction (IE) task (Cowie and Lehnert, 1996).",
        "Conditional",
        "Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) have been successfully applied to several IE tasks in the past (Peng and McCallum, 2006).",
        "A recurring problem, which arises when working with supervised approaches, concerns the domain portability.",
        "In the opinion mining context this question has been prominently investigated with respect to opinion polarity analysis (sentiment analysis) in previous research (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "Terms as \"unpredictable\" can express a positive opinion when uttered about the storyline of a movie but a negative opinion when the handling of a car is described.",
        "Hence the effects of training and testing a machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis on data from different domains have been analyzed in previous research.",
        "However to the best of our knowledge, these effects have not been investigated regarding the extraction of opinion targets.",
        "The contribution of this paper is a CRF-based approach for opinion targets extraction which tackles the problem of domain portability.",
        "We first evaluate our approach in three different domains against a state-of-the art baseline system and then evaluate the performance of both systems in a cross-domain setting.",
        "We show that our CRF-based approach outperforms the baseline in both settings, and how the diffrerent combinations of features we introduce influence the results of our CRF-based approach.",

        "Although the CRF-based approach clearly outperforms the baseline system on all four datasets, we also observe the same general trend regarding the individual results: The CRF yields the best results on the movies dataset and the worst results on the cars & cameras dataset.",
        "As shown in the first row, the results when using just the token string and part-of-speech tags as features are very low, especially regarding recall.",
        "We observe that the higher the lexical variability of the opinion targets is in a dataset, the lower the results are.",

        "Adding the information regarding opinion sentences to the basic features of the token string and the part-of-speech tag (row 4) yields the biggest improvements regarding F-Measure on the movies and web-services dataset (+0.433 / +0.383).",
        "On the cars & cameras dataset the recall is relatively low again.",
        "We assume that this is again due to the high lexical variability, so that the CRF algorithm will encounter many actual opinion targets in the testing data which have not occurred in the training data and will hence not be extracted.",

        "We performed a quantitative error analysis on the results of the CRF-based approach in the singledomain setting.",
        "In doing so, we focused on misclas-sifications of B-Target and I-Target instances, as the recall is consistently lower than the precision across all datasets.",
        "We observe that most of the recall errors result from one-word opinion targets or the beginning of opinion targets (B-Targets) being missclassi-fied as non-targets (movies 83%, web-services 73%, cars 68%, cameras 64%).",
        "For the majority of these missclassifications neither the dLn nor the wDs features were present (movies 82%, web-services 56%, cars 64%, cameras 61%).",
        "We assume that our features cannot capture the structure of more complex sentences very well.",
        "Our results indicate that the dLn and wDs features are complementary, but apparently there are quite a few cases in which the opinion target is neither directly related to the opinion expression in the dependency graph nor close to it in the sentence.",

        "Effects of Features",
        "Interestingly with the best performing feature combination from the single-domain extraction, the results regarding recall in the cross-domain extraction are very low .",
        "This is due to the fact that the CRF attributed a relatively large weight to the token string feature.",
        "As we also observed in the analysis of the baseline results, the overlap of the opinion target vocabularies between domains is low, which resulted in a very small number of targets extracted by the CRF.",

        "Effects of Training Data",

        "This is particularly interesting since the cameras dataset is the smallest of the four (see Table 1).",
        "We investigated whether the CRF algorithm was overfitting to the training datasets by reducing their size to the size of the cameras dataset.",
        "However, the reduction of the training data sizes never improved the extraction results regarding F-Measure for the movies, web-serviecs and cars datasets.",
        "The good results when training on the cameras dataset are in line with our observations from Section 5.1.2.",
        "We noticed that on the cameras dataset the results regarding F-Measure remained stable if the token feature is not used in the training.",
        "In isolation, training only on the cars data yields the second highest results on the movies and webservices datasets and the highest results regarding F-Measure on the cameras data.",
        "However, the results of the cars + cameras training data combination indicate that the cameras data does not contribute any additional information during the learning, since the results on both the movies and the web-services datasets are lower than when training only on the cameras data.",
        "Our results also confirm the insights gained by Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007), who observed that in cross-domain polarity analysis adding more training data is not always beneficial.",
        "Apparently even the smallest training dataset (cameras) contain enough feature instances to learn a model which performs well on the testing data.",
        "We observe that the results of the cross-domain extraction regarding F-Measure come relatively close to the results of the single-domain setting, especially if the token string feature is removed there (see Table 3 row 9).",
        "On the cars and the cameras dataset the cross-domain results are even closer to the single-domain results.",
