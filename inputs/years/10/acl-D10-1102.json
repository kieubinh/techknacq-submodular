        "Sentiment classification is a well-studied and active research area (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "One of the main challenges for document-level sentiment categorization is that not every part of the document is equally informative for inferring the sentiment of the whole document.",
        "Objective statements interleaved with the subjective statements can be confusing for learning methods, and subjective statements with conflicting sentiment further complicate the document categorization task.",
        "For example, authors ofmovie reviews often devote large sections to (largely objective) descriptions of the plot (Pang and Lee, 2004).",
        "In addition, an overall positive review might still include some negative opinions about an actor or the plot.",
        "Early research on document-level sentiment classification employed conventional machine learning techniques for text categorization (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "These methods, however, assume that documents are represented via a flat feature vector (e.g., a bag-of-words).",
        "As a result, their ability to identify and exploit subjectivity (or other useful) information at the sentence-level is limited.",
        "And although researchers subsequently proposed methods for incorporating sentence-level subjectivity information, existing techniques have some undesirable properties.",
        "First, they typically require gold standard sentence-level annotations (McDonald et al.",
        "(2007), Mao and Lebanon (2006)).",
        "But the cost of acquiring such labels can be prohibitive.",
        "Second, some solutions for incorporating sentence-level information lack mechanisms for controlling how errors propagate from the subjective sentence identification subtask to the main document classification task (Pang and Lee, 2004).",
        "Finally, solutions that attempt to handle the error propagation problem have done so by explicitly optimizing for the best combination of document-and sentence-level classification accuracy (McDonald et al., 2007).",
        "Optimizing for this compromise, when the real goal is to maximize only the document-level accuracy, can potentially hurt document-level performance.",
        "In this paper, we propose a joint two-level model to address the aforementioned concerns.",
        "We formulate our training objective to directly optimize for document-level accuracy.",
        "Further, we do not require gold standard sentence-level labels for training.",
        "Instead, our training method treats sentence-level labels as hidden variables and jointly learns to predict the document label and those (subjective) sentences that best \"explain\" it, thus controlling the propagation of incorrect sentence labels.",
        "And by directly optimizing for document-level accuracy, our model learns to solve the sentence extraction subtask only to the extent required for accurately classifying document sentiment.",
        "A software implementation of our method is also publicly available.",
        "For the rest of the paper, we will discuss related work, motivate and describe our model, present an empirical evaluation on movie reviews and U.S. Congressional floor debates datasets and close with discussion and conclusions."

        "Pang and Lee (2004) first showed that sentence-level extraction can improve document-level performance.",
        "They used a cascaded approach by first filtering out objective sentences and performing subjectivity extractions using a global min-cut inference.",
        "Afterward, the subjective extracts were converted into inputs for the document-level sentiment classifier.",
        "One advantage of their approach is that it avoids the need for explicit subjectivity annotations.",
        "However, like other cascaded approaches (e.g., Thomas et al.",
        "(2006), Mao and Lebanon (2006)), it can be difficult to control how errors propagate from the sentence-level subtask to the main document classification task.",
        "Instead of taking a cascaded approach, one can directly modify the training of flat document classifiers using lower level information.",
        "For instance, Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007) used human annotators to mark the \"annotator rationales\", which are text spans that support the document's sentiment label.",
        "These annotator rationales are then used to formulate additional constraints during SVM training to ensure that the resulting document classifier is less confident in classifying a document that does not contain the rationale versus the original document.",
        "Yessenalina et al.",
        "(2010) extended this approach to use automatically generated rationales.",
        "A natural approach to avoid the pitfalls associated with cascaded methods is to use joint two-level models that simultaneously solve the sentence-level and document-level tasks (e.g., McDonald et al.",
        "(2007), Zaidan and Eisner (2008)).",
        "Since these models are trained jointly, the sentence-level predictions affect the document-level predictions and vice-versa.",
        "However, such approaches typically require sentence-level annotations during training, which can be expensive to acquire.",
        "Furthermore, the training objectives are usually formulated as a compromise between sentence-level and document-level performance.",
        "If the goal is to predict well at the document-level, then these approaches are solving a much harder problem that is not exactly aligned with maximizing document-level accuracy.",
        "Recently, researchers within both Natural Language Processing (e.g., Petrov and Klein (2007), other fields (e.g., Felzenszwalb et al.",
        "(2008), Yu and Joachims (2009)) have analyzed joint multilevel models (i.e., models that simultaneously solve the main prediction task along with important sub-tasks) that are trained using limited or no explicit lower level annotations.",
        "Similar to our approach, the lower level labels are treated as hidden or latent variables during training.",
        "Although the training process is non-trivial (and in particular requires a good initialization of the hidden variables), it avoids the need for human annotations for the lower level subtasks.",
        "Some researchers have also recently applied hidden variable models to sentiment analysis, but they were focused on classifying either phrase-level (Choi and Cardie, 2008) or sentence-level polarity (Nakagawa et al., 2010)."

        "Each rationale is a text span that was identified to support (or explain) its parent document's sentiment.",
        "Thus, these rationales can be interpreted as (something close to) a ground truth labeling of the explanatory segments.",
        "Using a dataset where each document contains only its rationales, Algorithm 1 Inference Algorithm for (2) cross validation experiments using an SVM classifier yields 97.44% accuracy - as opposed to 86.33% accuracy when using the full text ofthe original documents.",
        "Clearly, extracting the best supporting segments can offer a tremendous performance boost.",
        "We are interested in settings where human-extracted explanations such as annotator rationales might not be readily available, or are imperfect.",
        "As such, we will formulate the set of extracted sentences as latent or hidden variables in our model.",
        "Viewing the extracted sentences as latent variables will pose no new challenges during prediction, since the model is expected to predict all labels at test time.",

        "Sentence properties.",
        "We can incorporate many useful features to describe sentence subjectivity.",
        "For example, subjective sentences might densely populate the end of a document, or exhibit spatial coherence (so features describing previous sentences might be useful for classifying the current sentence).",
        "Such features cannot be compactly incorporated into flat models that ignore the document structure.",
        "For our experiments, we normalize each Vsubj and Vpol to have unit 2-norm.",

        "In our experiments we tried both and found the square root normalization to work better in practice; therefore all the experimental results are reported using N (x) = \\J f (|x|).",
        "The appendix contains an analysis that sheds light on when square root normalization can be useful.",
        "As mentioned in Section 4.3, it is possible (and likely) for subjective sentences to exhibit spatial coherence (e.g., they might tend to group together).",

        "By adding these features, we are essentially assuming that the words of the previous sentence are predictive of the subjectivity of the current sentence.",
        "Alternative approaches include explicitly accounting for this structure by treating subjective sentence extraction as a sequence-labeling problem, such as in McDonald et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Such structure formulations can be naturally encoded in the joint feature map.",
        "Note that the inference procedure in Algorthm 1 is still tractable, since it reduces to comparing the best sequence of subjective/objective sentences that explains a positive sentiment versus the best sequence that explains a negative sentiment.",
        "For this study, we chose not to examine this more expressive yet more complex structure.",
        "Though our initial model (3) is simple and intuitive, performance can depend heavily on the quality of latent variable initialization and the quality of the feature structure design.",
        "Consider the case where the initialization contains only objective sentences that do not convey any sentiment.",
        "Then all the features initially available during training are generated from these objective sentences and are thus useless for sentiment classification.",
        "In other words, too much useful information has been suppressed for the model to make effective decisions.",
        "To hedge against learning poor models due to using a poor initialization and/or a suboptimal feature structure, we now propose extensions that incorporate information from the entire document.",
        "We identify the following desirable properties that any such extended model should satisfy:",

        "Making good structural assumptions simplifies the development process.",
        "Compared to methods that modify the training of flat document classifiers (e.g., Zaidan et al.",
        "(2007)), our approach uses fewer parameters, leading to a more compact and faster training stage.",
        "Compared to methods that use a cascaded approach (e.g., Pang and Lee (2004)), our approach is more robust to errors in the lower-level subtask due to being a joint model.",
        "Introducing latent variables makes the training procedure more flexible by not requiring lower-level labels, but does require a good initialization (i.e., a reasonable substitute for the lower-level labels).",
        "We believe that the widespread availability of off-the-shelf sentiment lexicons and software, despite being developed for a different domain, makes this issue less of a concern, and in fact creates an opportunity for approaches like ours to have real impact.",
        "One can incorporate many types of sentence-level information that cannot be directly incorporated into a flat model.",
        "Examples include scores from another sentence-level classifier (e.g., from Nakagawa et.",
        "al (2010)) or combining phrase-level polarity scores (e.g., from Choi and Cardie (2008)) for each sentence, or features that describe the position of the sentence in the document.",
        "Most prior work on the U.S. Congressional Floor Debates dataset focused on using relationships between speakers such as agreement (Thomas et al., 2006; Bansal et al., 2008), and used a global mincut inference procedure.",
        "However, they require all test instances to be known in advance (i.e., their formulations are transductive).",
        "Our method is not limited to the transductive setting, and instead exploits a different and complementary structure: the latent explanation (i.e., only some sentences in the speech are indicative of the speaker's vote).",
        "In a sense, the joint feature structure used in our model is the simplest that could be used.",
        "Our model makes no explicit structural dependencies between sentences, so the choice of whether to extract each sentence is essentially made independently of other sentences in the document.",
        "More sophisticated structures can be used if appropriate.",
        "For instance, one can formulate the sentence extraction task as a sequence labeling problem similar to (McDonald et al., 2007), or use a more expressive graphical model such as in (Pang and Lee, 2004; Thomas et al., 2006).",
        "So long as the global inference procedure is tractable or has a good approximation algorithm, then the training procedure is guaranteed to converge with rigorous generalization guarantees (Finley and Joachims, 2008).",
        "Since any formulation of the extraction subtask will suppress information for the main document-level task, one must take care to properly incorporate smoothing if necessary.",
        "Another interesting direction is training models to predict not only sentiment polarity, but also whether a document is objective.",
        "For example, one can pose a three class problem (\"positive\", \"negative\", \"objective\"), where objective documents might not necessarily have a good set of (subjective) explanatory sentences, similar to (Chang et al., 2010).",
        "planations, as well as ways to mitigate the risk of the extraction subtask suppressing too much information (such as via feature smoothing)."
