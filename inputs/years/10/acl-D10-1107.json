        "Determining whether two terms in text have an ancestor relation (e.g. Toyota and car) or a sibling relation (e.g. Toyota and Honda) is an essential component of textual inference in NLP applications such as Question Answering, Summarization, and Recognizing Textual Entailment.",
        "Significant work has been done on developing stationary knowledge sources that could potentially support these tasks, but these resources often suffer from low coverage, noise, and are inflexible when needed to support terms that are not identical to those placed in them, making their use as general purpose background knowledge resources difficult.",
        "In this paper, rather than building a stationary hierarchical structure of terms and relations, we describe a system that, given two terms, determines the taxonomic relation between them using a machine learning-based approach that makes use of existing resources.",
        "Moreover, we develop a global constraint optimization inference process and use it to leverage an existing knowledge base also to enforce relational constraints among terms and thus improve the classifier predictions.",
        "Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms other systems built upon existing well-known knowledge sources."

        "Taxonomic relations that are read off of structured ontological knowledge bases have been shown to play important roles in many computational linguistics tasks, such as document clustering (Hotho et al., 2003), navigating text databases (Chakrabarti et al., 1997), Question Answering (QA) (Saxena et al., 2007) and summarization (Vikas et al., 2008).",
        "It is clear that the recognition of taxonomic relation between terms in sentences is essential to support textual inference tasks such as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "For example, it may be important to know that a blue Toyota is neither a red Toyota nor a blue Honda, but that all are cars, and even Japanese cars.",
        "Work in Textual Entailment has argued quite convincingly (MacCartney and Manning, 2008; MacCartney and Manning, 2009) that many such textual inferences are largely compositional and depend on the ability to recognize some basic taxonomic relations such as the ancestor or sibling relations between terms.",
        "To date, these taxonomic relations can be read off manually generated ontologies such as Wordnet that explicitly represent these, and there has also been some work trying to extend the manually built resources using automatic acquisition methods resulting in structured knowledge bases such as the Extended WordNet (Snow et al., 2006) and the YAGO ontology (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "However, identifying when these relations hold using fixed stationary hierarchical structures may be impaired by noise in the resource and by uncertainty in mapping targeted terms to concepts in the structures.",
        "In addition, for knowledge sources derived using bootstrapping algorithms and distributional semantic models such as (Pantel and Pen-nacchiotti, 2006; Kozareva et al., 2008; Baroni and Lenci, 2010), there is typically a trade-off between precision and recall, resulting either in a relatively accurate resource with low coverage or a noisy resource with broader coverage.",
        "In the current work, we take a different approach, identifying directly whether a pair of terms hold a taxonomic relation.",
        "Fixed resources, as we observe, are inflexible when dealing with targeted terms not being covered.",
        "This often happens when targeted terms have the same meaning, but different surface forms, than the terms used in the resources (e.g. Toyota Camry and Camry).",
        "We argue that it is essential to have a classifier that, given two terms, can build a semantic representation of the terms and determines the taxonomic relations between them.",
        "This classifier will make use of existing knowledge bases in multiple ways, but will provide significantly larger coverage and more precise results.",
        "We make use of a dynamic resource such as Wikipedia to guarantee increased coverage without changing our model and also perform normalization-to-Wikipedia to find appropriate Wikipedia replacements for outside-Wikipedia terms.",
        "Moreover, stationary resources are usually brittle because of the way most of them are built: using local relational patterns (e.g. (Hearst, 1992; Snow et al., 2005)).",
        "Infrequent terms are less likely to be covered, and some relations may not be supported well by these methods because their corresponding terms rarely appear in close proximity (e.g., an Israeli tennis player Dudi Sela and Roger Federrer).",
        "Our approach uses search techniques to gather relevant Wikipedia pages of input terms and performs a learning-based classification w.r.t.",
        "to the features extracted from these pages as a way to get around this brittleness.",
        "Motivated by the needs of NLP applications such as RTE, QA, Summarization, and the composition-ality argument alluded to above, we focus on identifying two fundamental types of taxonomic relations - ancestor and sibling.",
        "An ancestor relation and its directionality can help us infer that a statement with respect to the child (e.g. cannabis) holds for an ancestor (e.g. drugs) as in the following example, taken from a textual entailment challenge dataset:",
        "T: Nigeria's NDLEA has seized 80 metric tonnes of cannabis in one of its largest ever hauls, officials say.",
        "H: Nigeria seizes 80 tonnes of drugs.",
        "Similarly, it is important to know of a sibling relation to infer that a statement about Taiwan may (without additional information) contradict a similar statement with respect to Japan since these are different countries, as in the following:",
        "T: A strong earthquake struck off the southern tip of Taiwan at 12:26 UTC, triggering a warning from Japan's Meteorological Agency that a 3.3 foot tsunami could be heading towards Basco, in the Philippines.",
        "H: An earthquake strikes Japan.",
        "Several recent TE studies (Abad etal., 2010; Sam-mons et al., 2010) suggest to isolate TE phenomena, such as recognizing taxonomic relations, and study them separately; they discuss some of characteristics of phenomena such as contradiction from a similar perspective to ours, but do not provide a solution.",
        "In this paper, we present TAxonomic RElation Classifier (TAREC), a system that classifies taxonomic relations between a given pair of terms using a machine learning based classifier.",
        "An integral part of TAREC is also our inference model that makes use of relational constraints to enforce coherency among several related predictions.",
        "TAREC does not aim at building or extracting a hierarchical structure of concepts and relations, but rather to directly recognize taxonomic relations given a pair of terms.",
        "Target terms are represented using vector of features that are extracted from retrieved corresponding Wikipedia pages.",
        "In addition, we make use of existing stationary ontologies to find related terms to the target terms, and classify those too.",
        "This allows us to make use of a constraint-based inference model (following (Roth and Yih, 2004; Roth and Yih, 2007) that enforces coherency of decisions across related pairs (e.g., if x is-a y and y is-a z, it cannot be that x is a sibling of z).",
        "In the rest of the paper, after discussing related work in Section 2, we present an overview of TAREC in Section 3.",

        "A natural way to use these hierarchical structures to support taxonomic relation classification is to map targeted terms onto the hierarchies and check if they subsume each other or share a common sub-sumer.",
        "However, this approach is limited because constructed hierarchies may suffer from noise and require exact mapping (Section 6).",
        "TAREC overcomes these limitations by searching and selecting the top relevant articles in Wikipedia for each input term; taxonomic relations are then recognized based on the features extracted from these articles.",
        "On the other hand, information extraction bootstrapping algorithms, such as (Pantel and Pennac-chiotti, 2006; Kozareva et al., 2008), automatically harvest related terms on large corpora by starting with a few seeds of pre-specified relations (e.g. isa, part-of).",
        "Bootstrapping algorithms rely on some scoring function to assess the quality of terms and additional patterns extracted during bootstrapping iterations.",
        "Similarly, but with a different focus, Open IE, (Banko and Etzioni, 2008; Davidov and Rap-poport, 2008), deals with a large number of relations which are not pre-specified.",
        "Either way, the output of these algorithms is usually limited to a small number of high-quality terms while sacrificing coverage (or vice versa).",
        "Moreover, an Open IE system cannot control the extracted relations and this is essential when identifying taxonomic relations.",
        "Recently, (Baroni and Lenci, 2010) described a general framework of distributional semantic models that extracts significant contexts of given terms from large corpora.",
        "Consequently, a term can be represented by a vector of contexts in which it frequently appears.",
        "Any vector space model could then use the terms' vectors to cluster terms into categories.",
        "Sibling terms (e.g. Honda, Toyota), therefore, have very high chance to be clustered together.",
        "Nevertheless, this approach cannot recognize ancestor relations.",

        "We do this by giving a list of semantic classes using the following procedure: (1) For each semantic class, use some seeds to compute a centroid vector from the seeds' vectors in TypeDM, (2) each term in an input pair is classified into its best semantic class based on the cosine similarity between its vector and the centroid vector of the category, (3) two terms are siblings if they are classified into the same category; and have no relation, otherwise.",
        "out of 20,410 noun terms in TypeDM, there are only 345 terms overlapping with the instances in OrgData-I and belonging to 10 significant semantic classes.",
        "For each semantic class, we randomly pick 5 instances as its seeds to make a centroid vector.",
        "The rest of the overlapping instances are randomly paired to make a dataset of 4,000 pairs of terms balanced in the number of sibling and no relation pairs.",

        "This local classifier has an accuracy of 81.08%.",
        "These results show that although the full TAREC system gives better performance, TypeDM is very competitive in recognizing sibling vs. no relation.",
        "However, TypeDM can only work in a limited setting where semantic classes are given in advance, which is not practical in real-world applications; and of course, TypeDM does not help to recognize ancestor relations between two terms.",
