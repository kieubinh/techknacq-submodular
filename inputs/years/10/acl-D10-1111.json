        "With the avalanche of user-generated articles over the web, it is quite important to develop models that can recognize the ideological bias behind a given document, summarize where this bias is manifested on a topical level, and provide the user with alternate views that would help him/her staying informed about different perspectives.",
        "In this paper, we follow the notion of ideology as defines by Van Dijk in (Dijk, 1998) as \"a set of general abstract beliefs commonly shared by a group of people.\"",
        "In other words, an ideology is a set of ideas that directs one's goals, expectations, and actions.",
        "For instance, freedom of choice is a general aim that directs the actions of'liberals\", whereas conservation of values is the parallel for \"conservatives\".",
        "We can attribute the lexical variations of the word content of a document to three factors:",
        "• Writer Ideological Belief.",
        "A liberal writer might use words like freedom and choice regardless of the topical content of the document.",
        "These words define the abstract notion of belief held by the writer and its frequency in the document largely depends on the writer's style.",
        "• Topical Content.",
        "This constitutes the main source of the lexical variations in a given document.",
        "For instance, a document about abortion is more likely to have facts related to abortion, health, marriage and relationships.",
        "• Topic-Ideology Interaction.",
        "When a liberal thinker writes about abortion, his/her abstract beliefs are materialized into a set of concrete opinions and stances, therefore, we might find words like: pro-choice and feminism.",
        "On the contrary, a conservative writer might stress issues like pro-life, God and faith.",
        "Given a collection of ideologically-labeled documents, our goal is to develop a computer model that factors the document collection into a representation that reflects the aforementioned three sources of lexical variations.",
        "This representation can then be used for:",
        "• Visualization.",
        "By visualizing the abstract notion of belief in each ideology, and the way each ideology approaches and views mainstream topics, the user can view and contrast each ideology side-by-side and build the right mental landscape that acts as the basis for his/her future decision making.",
        "• Classification or Ideology Identification.",
        "Given a document, we would like to tell the user from which side it was written, and explain the ideological bias in the document at a topical level.",
        "• Staying Informed: Getting alternative",
        "views.",
        "Given a document written from perspective A, we would like the model to provide the user with other documents that represent alternative views about the same topic addressed in the original document.",
        "In this paper, we approach this problem using Topic Models (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "We introduce a factored topic model that we call multi-view Latent Dirichlet Allocation or mview-LDA for short.",
        "Our model views the word content of each document as the result of the interaction between the document's idealogical and topical dimensions.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, in Section 2, we review related work, and then present our model in Section 3.",
        "Then in Section 4, we detail a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 give details about the dataset used in the evaluation and illustrate the capabilities of our model using both qualitative and quantitative measures.",
        "Section 7 describes and evaluates the efficacy of a semi-supervised extension, and finally in Section 8 we conclude and list several directions for future research."

        "The goal of this area of research is to learn to discriminate between subjective and objective text.",
        "In contrast,in modeling ideology, we aim toward contrasting two or more ideological perspectives each of which is subjective in nature.",
        "Further more, subjective text can be classified into sentiments which gave rise to a surge of work in automatic opinion mining (Wiebe et al., 2004; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) as well as sentiment analysis and product review mining (Nasukawa and et al., 2008).",
        "The research goal of sentiment analysis and classification is to identify language used to convey positive and negative opinions, which differs from contrasting two ideological perspectives.",
        "While ideology can be expressed in the form of a sentiment toward a given topic,like abortion, ideological perspectives are reflected in many ways other than sentiments as we will illustrate later in the paper.",
        "Perhaps more related to this paper is the work goal is to detect bias in news articles via discriminative and generative approaches, respectively.",

        "In the next section we will explain how our new model mview-LDA can capture other sources of lexical variabilities beyond topical content.",
        "As we noted earlier, LDA captures lexical variabilities due to topical content via 0d and the set of topics ß1:K.

        "The first being the larger size of each document (740 words per document as compared to 200 words per post in blog-2) and the second being the more formal writing style in the bitterlemons dataset.",

        "From this figure, it is clear that our model outperforms this baseline over all measures.",

        "Note that the probability of the indicators (x1jd, x2jd, zd) do not depend on the view of the document and thus got absorbed in the normalization constant, and thus one only needs to measures the likelihood of generating the words in the document under the view v. We divide the words into three groups: Ad = {wn\\xnj1 = 1} is the set of words generated from the view-background 1} is the set of words generated from ßk, and set of words generated from 0k v. The probability of Bd k does not depend on the value of v and thus can be absorbed into the normalization factor.",
