        "Written language ID has been a popular research object in the last few decades, and relatively simple algorithms have proved to be very successful.",
        "The central question of language ID is the following: given a segment of text, which one of a predefined set of languages is this segment written in?",
        "Language identification is thus a classification problem.",
        "Dialect identification comes in two flavors: spoken dialect ID and written dialect ID.",
        "These two tasks are rather different.",
        "Spoken dialect ID relies on speech recognition techniques which may not cope well with dialectal diversity.",
        "However, the acoustic signal is also available as input.",
        "Written dialect ID has to deal with non-standardized spellings that may occult real dialectal differences.",
        "Moreover, some phonetic distinctions cannot be expressed in orthographic writing systems and limit the input cues in comparison with spoken dialect ID.",
        "This paper deals with written dialect ID, applied to the Swiss German dialect area.",
        "An important aspect of our model is its conception of the dialect area as a continuum without clear-cut borders.",
        "Our dialect ID model follows a bag-of-words approach based on the assumption that every dialectal word form is defined by a probability with which it may occur in each geographic area.",
        "By combining the cues of all words of a sentence, it should be possible to obtain a fairly reliable geographic localization of that sentence.",
        "The main challenge is to create a lexicon of dialect word forms and their associated probability maps.",
        "We start with a Standard German word list and use a set of phonetic, morphological and lexical rules to obtain the Swiss German forms.",
        "These rules are manually extracted from a linguistic atlas.",
        "This linguistic atlas of Swiss German dialects is the result of decades-long empirical fieldwork.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "We start with an overview of relevant research (Section 2) and present the characteristics of the Swiss German dialect area (Section 3).",
        "Section 4 deals with the implementation of word transformation rules and the corresponding extraction of probability maps from the linguistic atlas of German-speaking Switzerland.",

        "Our system generates written dialect words according to the Dieth spelling conventions without diacritics (Dieth, 1986).",
        "These are characterized by a transparent grapheme-phone correspondence and are widely used by dialect writers.",
        "However, they are by no means enforced or even taught.",
        "This lack of standardization is problematic for dialect ID.",
        "We have noted two major types of deviations from the Dieth spelling conventions in our data.",
        "First, Standard German orthography may unduly influence dialect spelling.",
        "For example, spiele is modelled after Standard German spielen 'to play', although the vowel is a short monophthong in Swiss German and should thus be written spile (ie represents a diphthong in Dieth spelling).",
        "Second, dialect writers do not always distinguish short and long vowels, while the Dieth conventions always use letter doubling to indicate vowel lengthening.",
        "Future work will incorporate these fluctuations directly into the dialect ID model.",
        "Because of our focus on written dialect, the following discussion will be based on written representations, but IPA equivalents are added for convenience.",
        "Our work is based on the assumption that many words show predictable phonetic differences between Standard German and the different Swiss German dialects.",
        "Hence, in many cases, it is not necessary to explicitly model word-to-word correspondences, but a set of phonetic rules suffices to correctly transform words.",
        "For example, the word-final sequence nd [nd] (as in Standard German Hund 'dog') is maintained in most Swiss German dialects.",
        "However, it has to be transformed tong [g] in Berne dialect, to nn [n] in Fribourg dialect, and to nt [nt] in Valais and Uri dialects.",
        "This phenomenon is captured in our system by four transformation rules nd – nd, nd – ng, nd – nn and nd – nt.",
        "Each rule is georeferenced, i.e. linked to a probability map that specifies its validity in every geographic point.",
        "These four rules capture one single linguistic phenomenon: their left-hand side is the same, and they are geographically complementary.",
        "Some rules apply uniformly to all Swiss German dialects (e.g. the transformation st [st] – scht [ft]).",
        "These rules do not immediately contribute to the dialect identification task, but they help to obtain correct Swiss German forms that contain other phonemes with better localization potential.",
        "More information about the creation of the probability maps is given in Sections 4.5 and 4.6.",
        "Some differences at the word level cannot be accounted for by pure phonetic alternations.",
        "One reason are idiosyncrasies in the phonetic evolution of high frequency words (e.g. Standard German und 'and' is reduced to u in Bern dialect, where the phonetic rules would rather suggest *ung).",
        "Another reason is the use of different lexemes altogether (e.g. Standard German immer 'always' corresponds to geng, immer, or all, depending on the dialect).",
        "We currently use lexical rules mainly for function words and irregular verb stems.",
        "The transformation process from inflected Standard German word forms to inflected Swiss German word forms is done in two steps.",
        "First, the word stem is adapted with phonetic or lexical rules, and then, the affixes are generated according to the morphological features of the word.",
        "Inflection markers also provide dialect discrimination potential.",
        "For example, the verbal plural suffixes offer a surprisingly rich (and diachronically stable) interdialectal variation pattern.",
        "One of the largest research projects in Swiss German dialectology has been the elaboration of the Sprachatlas der deutschen Schweiz (SDS), a linguistic atlas that covers phonetic, morphological and lexical differences of Swiss German dialects.",
        "Data collection and publication were carried out between 1939 and 1997 (Hotzenköcherle et al., 1962-1997).",
        "Linguistic data were collected in about 600 villages (inquiry points) of German-speaking Switzerland, and resulted in about 1500 published maps (see Figure 1 for an example).",
        "Each map represents a linguistic phenomenon that potentially yields a set of transformation rules.",
        "For our experiments, we selected a subset of the maps according to the perceived importance of the described phenomena.",
        "There is no one-to-one correspondence between maps and implemented phenomena, for several reasons.",
        "First, some SDS maps represent information that is best analyzed as several distinct phenomena.",
        "Second, a set of maps may illustrate the same phenomenon with different words and slightly different geographic distributions.",
        "Third, some maps describe (especially lexical) phenomena that are becoming obsolete and that we chose to omit.",
        "As a result, our rule base contains about 300 phonetic rules covering 130 phenomena, 540 lexical rules covering 250 phenomena and 130 morphological rules covering 60 phenomena.",
        "We believe this coverage to be sufficient for the dialect ID task.",
        "Recall the nd example used to illustrate the phonetic rules above.",
        "Figure 1 shows a reproduction of the original, hand-drawn SDS map related to this phenomenon.",

        "The SDS maps, hand-drawn or digitized, are point maps.",
        "They only cover the inquiry points, but do not provide information about the variants used in other locations.",

        "The Swiss German word form lexicon is created with the help of the georeferenced transfer rules presented above.",
        "These rules require a lemmatized, POS-tagged and morphologically disambiguated Standard German word as an input and generate a set of dialect word/map tuples: each resulting dialect word is associated with a probability map that specifies its likelihood in each geographic point.",

        "The Standard German word list extracted from TIGER contains about 36,000 entries.",
        "The derived Swiss German word list contains 560,000 word forms, each of which is associated with a map that specifies its regional distribution.",
        "Note that proper nouns and words tagged as \"foreign material\" were not transformed.",
        "Derivations that did not obtain a probability higher than 0.1 anywhere (because of geographically incompatible transformations) were discarded.",
        "At test time, the goal is to compute a probability map for a text segment of unknown origin.",

        "For instance, most ZH articles are about Swiss politicians, while many OS articles deal with religion and mysticism.",
        "Our hypothesis is thus that the n-gram model learns to recognize a specific author and/or topic rather than a dialect.",
        "This hypothesis is confirmed on the Web data set: the performances drop by 15 percentage points or more (same table, rightmost columns; the performance drops are similar for n = [2..6]).",
        "In all our evaluations, the average F-measures for the different dialects are weighted according to the relative population sizes of the dialect regions because the size of the test corpus is proportional to population size (see Section 6.1).",
        "We acknowledge that a training corpus of only 100 sentences per dialect provides limited insight into the performance of the n-gram approach.",
        "We were able to double the training corpus size with additional Wikipedia sentences.",
        "With this extended corpus, the 4-gram model performed better than the 5-gram model.",

        "The additional increase on Wikipedia data (+17% absolute with respect to the small training set), together with the decrease on Web data (-3% absolute) confirms our hypothesis of overfitting.",
        "An ideal training corpus should thus contain data from several sources per dialect.",
        "To sum up, n-gram models can yield good performance even with similar dialects, but require large amounts of training data from different sources to achieve robust results.",
        "For many small-scale dialects, such data may not be available.",
        "The n-gram system presented above has no geographic knowledge whatsoever; it just consists of six distinct language models that could be located anywhere.",
        "In contrast, our model yields probability maps of German-speaking Switzerland.",
        "In order to evaluate its performance, we thus had to determine the geographic localization of the six dialect regions defined by the Wikipedia authors (see Table 1).",
        "We defined the regions according to the respective canton boundaries and to the German-French language border in the case of bilingual cantons.",
        "The result of this mapping is shown in Figure 4.",

        "Results are displayed in Tables 3 to 6.",
        "The majority of FR sentences were misclassified as BE, which reflects the geographic and linguistic proximity of these regions.",
        "The tables show that frequency weighting helps on both corpora: the discriminative potential only slightly improves performance on the web corpus.",
        "Crucially, the two techniques are additive, so in combination, they yield the best overall results.",
        "In comparison with the baseline model, there is a performance drop of about 16 percent absolute on Wikipedia data.",
        "In contrast, our model is very robust and outperforms the baseline model on the Web test set by about 7 percent absolute.",
        "These results seem to confirm what we suggested above: that the n-gram model overfitted on the small Wikipedia training corpus.",
        "Nevertheless, it is still surprising that our model has a lower performance on Wikipedia than on Web data.",
        "The reason for this discrepancy probably lies in the spelling conventions assumed in the transformation rules: it seems that Web writers are closer to these (implicit) spelling conventions than Wikipedia authors.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that many Wikipedia articles are translations of existing Standard German articles, and that some words are not completely adapted to their dialectal form.",

        "Table 6: Performances using derivation maps weighted by word frequency and discriminative potential.",

        "However, one should note that the word-based dialect ID model is not limited on the six dialect regions used for evaluation here.",
        "It can be used with any size and number of dialect regions of German-speaking Switzerland.",
        "This contrasts with the n-gram model which has to be trained specifically on every dialect region; in this case, the Swiss German Wikipedia only contains two additional dialect regions with an equivalent amount of data.",
        "In the previous section, we have defined the predicted dialect region as the one in which the most probable point (maximum) has a higher probability than the most probable point of any other region.",
        "The results suggest that this metric penalizes small regions (BA, FR, ZH).",
        "In these cases, it is likely that the most probable point is slightly outside the region, but that the largest part of the probability mass is still inside the correct region.",
        "Therefore, we tested another approach: we defined the predicted dialect region as the one in which the average probability is higher than the average probability in any other region:",
        "Region(s) = arg max",
        "/EteRegionp(s | t) \\ V Region J",
        "This metric effectively boosts the performance on the smaller regions, but comes at a cost for larger regions (Table 7).",
        "We also combined the two metrics by using the maximum metric for the three larger regions and the average metric for the three smaller ones (the cutoff lies at 5% of the Swiss territory).",
        "This combined metric further improves the performance of our system while relying on an objective measure of region surface.",
        "We believe that region surface as such is not so crucial for the metrics discussed above, but rather serves as a proxy for linguistic heterogeneity.",
        "Geographically large regions like BE tend to have internal dialect variation, and averaging over all dialects in the region leads to low figures.",
        "In contrast, small regions show a quite homogeneous dialect landscape that may protrude over adjacent regions.",
        "In this case, the probability peak is less relevant than the average probability in the entire region.",

        "The empirical component consists in a collection of data (the SDS atlas) which is not of the type we want to process, but rather embodies some features of the data we ultimately want to process.",
        "We therefore analyze this data in order to extract empirically grounded knowledge for more general use (the creation of the georeferenced rules), and then use this knowledge to perform the dialect ID task in conjunction with an unrelated data source (the Standard German corpus).",
        "Our choice of method was of course related to the fact that few corpora, annotated or not, were available for our task.",
