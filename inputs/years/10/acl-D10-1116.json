        "Steganography is concerned with hiding information in a cover medium, in order to facilitate covert communication, such that the presence of the information is imperceptible to a user (human or computer).",
        "Much of the existing research in steganog-raphy has used images as cover media; however, given the ubiquitous nature of electronic text, interest is growing in using natural language as the cover medium.",
        "Linguistic Steganography – lying at the intersection of Computational Linguistics and Computer Security – is concerned with making changes to a cover text in order to embed information, in such a way that the changes do not result in ungrammatical or unnatural text.",
        "A related area is natural language watermarking, in which changes are made to a text in order to identify it, for example for copyright purposes.",
        "An interesting watermarking application is \"traitor tracing\", in which documents are changed in order to embed individual watermarks.",
        "These marks can then be used to later identify particular documents, for example if a set of documents – identical except for the changes used to embed the watermarks – have been sent to a group of individuals, and one of the documents has been leaked to a newspaper.",
        "In terms of security, a linguistic stegosystem should impose minimum embedding distortion to the cover text so that the resulting stegotext in which a message is camouflaged is inconspicuous, resulting in high imperceptibility.",
        "In addition, since steganography aims at covert communication, a linguistic stegosystem should allow sufficient embedding capacity, known as the payload.",
        "There is a fundamental tradeoff between imperceptibility and pay-load, since any attempt to embed more information via changes to the cover text increases the chance of introducing anomalies into the text and therefore raising the suspicion of an observer.",
        "A linguistic transformation is required to embed information.",
        "Transformations studied in previous work include lexical substitution (Chapman and Davida, 1997; Bolshakov, 2004; Taskiran et al., 2006; Topkara et al., 2006b), phrase paraphrasing (Chang and Clark, 2010), sentence structure manipulations (Atallah et al., 2001a; Atallah et al., 2001b;",
        "Liu et al., 2005; Meral et al., 2007; Murphy, 2001; Murphy and Vogel, 2007; Topkara et al., 2006a) and semantic transformations (Atallah et al., 2002; Vy-bornova and Macq, 2007).",
        "Many of these transformations require some sophisticated NLP tools; for example, in order to perform semantic transformations on text, word sense disambiguation, semantic role parsing and anaphora resolution tools may be required.",
        "However, the current state-of-the-art in language technology is arguably not good enough for secure linguistic steganography based on sophisticated semantic transformations, and the level of robustness required to perform practical experiments has only just become available.",
        "Hence many existing linguistic stegosystems are proof-of-concept implementations with little practical evaluation of the imperceptibility or payload.",
        "Synonym substitution is a relatively straightforward linguistic steganography method.",
        "It substitutes selected words with the same part of speech (PoS) synonyms, and does not involve operating on the sentence structure so the modification can be guaranteed to be grammatical.",
        "Another advantage of this method is that many languages are profuse in synonyms, and so there is a rich source of information carriers compared with other text transformations.",
        "There are two practical difficulties associated with hiding bits using synonym subsitution.",
        "The first is that words can have more than one sense.",
        "In terms of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which is the electronic dictionary we use, words can appear in more than one synset.",
        "This is a problem because a word may be assigned different bit strings in the different synsets, and the receiver does not know which of the senses to use, and hence does not know which hidden bit string to recover.",
        "Our solution to this problem is a novel vertex colouring method which ensures that words are always assigned the same bit string, even when they appear in different synsets.",
        "The second problem is that many synonyms are only applicable in certain contexts.",
        "For example, the words in the WordNet synset {bridge, span} share the meaning of \"a structure that allows people or vehicles to cross an obstacle such as a river or canal or railway etc.\".",
        "However, bridge and span cannot be substutited for each other in the sentence \"sus-",

        "We evaluate the method using the data from the English Lexical Substitution task for SemEval-2007.",
        "The resulting precision of our lexical substitution system can be seen as an indirect measure of the imperceptibility of the stegosystem, whereas the recall can be seen as an indirect measure of the payload.",
        "The paper is organised so that the contextual check is described first, and this is evaluated independently of the steganographic application.",

        "In the original work on linguistic steganography in the late 1990s, Winstein proposed an information hiding algorithm using a block coding method to encode synonyms, so that the selection of a word from a synset directly associates with part of the secret bitstring (Bergmair, 2007).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the embedding procedure of this approach.",
        "In this example, the bitstring to be embedded is 010, which",

        "can be divided into two codewords, 0 and 10, and the information carriers in the cover text are the words finished and project.",
        "According to the encoding dictionary, complete represents 0, and task represents 10; hence these words are chosen and replace the original words in the cover text (with suitable suffixation).",
        "The stego sentence \"He completed the task\" is then sent to the receiver.",
        "In order to recover the message, the receiver only needs a copy of the encoding dictionary, and the decoding algorithm simply reverses the process used to encode the hidden bits.",
        "Note that the receiver does not need the original cover text to recover the information.",
        "This algorithm requires synonym sets to be disjoint; i.e. no word may appear in more than one synonym set, since overlapping synsets may cause ambiguities during the decoding stage.",
        "Figure 2 shows what happens when the basic algorithm is applied to two overlapping synonym sets.",
        "As can be seen from the example, composition is represented by two different codewords and thus the secret bitstring cannot be reliably recovered, since the receiver does not know the original cover word or the sense of the word.",
        "In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel coding method based on vertex colouring, described in Section 4.",
        "In addition to the basic algorithm, Winstein proposed the T-Lex system using synonym substitution as the text transformation.",
        "In order to solve the problem of words appearing in more than one synonym set, Winstein defines interchangeable words as words that belong to the same synsets, and only uses these words for substitution.",
        "Any words that are not interchangeable are discarded and not available for carrying information.",
        "The advantage in this approach is that interchangeable words always receive the same codeword.",
        "The disadvantage is that many synonyms need to be discarded in order to achieve this property.",
        "Winstein calculates that only 30% of WordNet can be used in such a system.",
        "Another stegosystem based on synonym substitution was proposed by Bolshakov (2004).",
        "In order to ensure both sender and receiver use the same synsets, Bolshakov applied transitive closure to overlapping synsets to avoid the decoding ambiguity.",
        "Applying transitive closure leads to a merger of all the overlapping synsets into one set which is then seen as the synset of a target word.",
        "Consider the overlapping synsets in Figure 2 as an example.",
        "After applying transitive closure, the resulting set is {'authorship', 'composition', 'paper', 'penning', 'report', 'theme', 'writing'}.",
        "Bolshakov (2004) also uses a method to determine whether a substitution is applicable in context, using a collocation-based test.",
        "Finally, the colloca-tionally verified synonyms are encoded by using the block coding method.",
        "This is similar to our use of the Google n-gram data to check for contextual applicability.",
        "The disadvantage of Bolshakov's system is that all words in a synonym transitive closure chain need to be considered, which can lead to very large sets of synonyms, and many which are not synonymous with the original target word.",
        "In contrast, our proposed method operates on the original synonym sets without extending them unnecessarily."

        "The smallest number of colours required to colour a graph G is called its chromatic number x(G), and a graph G having chromatic number x(G) = k is called a k-chromatic graph.",
        "The main idea of the proposed coding method is to represent overlapping synsets as an undirected k-chromatic graph called a synonym graph which has a vertex for each word and an edge for every pair of words that share the same meaning.",
        "A synonym is then encoded by a codeword that represents the colour assigned by the vertex colouring of the synonym graph.",
        "Figure 6 shows the use of four different colours, represented by '00', '01', '10' and '11', to colour the 4-chromatic synonym graph of the two overlapping synsets in Figure 2.",
        "Now, the overlapped word 'composition' receives a unique codeword no matter which synset is considered, which means the replacement of 'paper' to 'composition' in Figure 2 will not cause an ambiguity since the receiver can apply the same coding method to derive identical codewords used by the sender.",
        "99.6% of synsets in WordNet have size less than 8, which means most of the synsets cannot exhaust more than a 2-bit coding space (i.e. we can only encode at most 2 bits using a typical synset).",
        "Therefore, we restrict the chromatic number of a synonym graph G to 1 < x(G) < 4, which implies the maximum size of a synset is 4.",
        "When x(G) = 2, each vertex is assigned a single-bit codeword either '0' or '1' as shown in Figure 7(a).",
        "When x(G) = 3, the overlapping set's size is either 2 or 3, which cannot exhaust the 2-bit coding space although codewords '00', '01' and '10' are initially assigned to each vertex.",
        "Therefore, only the most significant bits are used to represent the synonyms, which we call codeword reduction.",
        "After the codeword reduction, if a vertex has the same codeword, say '0', as all of its neighbors, the vertex's codeword must be changed to '1' so that the vertex would be able to accommodate either secret bit '0' or '1', which we call codeword correction.",
        "Figure 7(b) shows an example of the process of codeword reduction and codeword correction for x(G) = 3.",
        "For the case of x(G) = 4, codeword reduction is applied to those vertices that themselves or their neighboring vertices have no access to all the codewords '00', '01', '10' and '11'.",
        "For example, vertices a, b, c, e and f in Figure 7(c) meet the requirement of needing codeword reduction.",
        "The codeword correction process is then further applied to vertex f to rectify its accessibility.",
        "Figure 8 describes a greedy algorithm for constructing a coded synonym graph using at most 4 colours, given n synonyms wi, w2,..., wn in the overlapping synsets.",
        "Let us define a function E(wi,wj) which returns an edge between wi and wj if wi and wj are in the same synset; otherwise returns false.",
        "Another function C(wi) returns the colour of the synonym wi.",
        "The procedure loops through all the input synonyms.",
        "For each iteration, the procedure first finds available colours for the target synonym wi.",
        "If there is no colour available, namely all the four colours have already been given to wi's neighbors, wi is randomly assigned one of the four colours; otherwise, wi is assigned one of the available colours.",
        "After adding wi to the graph G, the procedure checks whether adding an edge of wi to graph G would violate the vertex colouring.",
        "After constructing the coloured graph, codeword reduction and codeword correction as previously described are applied to revise improper codewords.",
        "Figure 9 illustrates the framework of our lexical stegosystem.",
        "Note that we have preprocessed WordNet by excluding multi-word synonyms and single-entry synsets.",
        "A possible information carrier is first found in the cover sentence.",
        "We define a possible information carrier as a word in the cover sentence that belongs to at least one synset in WordNet.",
        "The synsets containing the target word, and all other synsets which can be reached via the synonym relation, are then extracted from WordNet (i.e. we build the connected component of WordNet which contains the target word according to the synonym relation).",
        "Words in these sets are then examined by the Google n-gram contextual checking method to eliminate inappropriate substitutions.",
        "If there is more than one word left and if words which pass the filter all belong to the same synset, the block coding method is used to encode the words; otherwise the vertex colouring coding is applied.",
        "Finally, according to the secret bitstring, the system selects the synonym that shares an edge with the target word and has as its codeword the longest potential match with the secret bitstring.",
        "We use the connected component of WordNet containing the target word as a simple method to ensure that both sender and receiver colour-code the INPUT: a synonym list wi , w2,.",

        ".",
        ", wn and an empty graph G OUTPUT: a coded synonym graph G using at most four colours FOR every synonym wi in the input list initialize four colours as available for wi FOR every wj in graph G IF E(wi,wj) THEN set C(wj) as unavailable",
        "END IF END FOR",
        "IF there is a colour available THEN assign one of the available colours to wi assign one of the four colours to wi ADD wi to graph G FOR every wj in graph G IF E(wi, wj) and C(wi) is not equal to C(wj) THEN ADD edge E(wi, wj) to G",
        "END IF END FOR END FOR codeword reduction codeword correction OUTPUT graph G_ same graph.",
        "It is important to note, however, that the senderonly considers the synonyms ofthe target word as potential substitutes; the connected component is only used to consistently assign the codes.",
        "For the decoding process, the receiver does not need the original text for extracting secret data.",
        "An information carrier can be found in the stegotext by referring to WordNet in which related synonyms are extracted.",
        "Those words in the related sets undergo the synonym checking method and then are encoded by either block coding or vertex colouring coding scheme depending on whether the remaining words are in the same synset.",
        "Finally, the secret bitstring is implicit in the codeword of the information carrier and therefore can be extracted.",
        "We demonstrate how to embed secret bit 1 in the cover sentence:",
        "It is a shame that we could not reach the next stage sentence \"it is a shame that we could not reach the next stage.\"",

        "The score of each word calculated by the synonym checking method using the Web 1T Corpus is given as a subscript.",
        "Assume the threshold score is 0.27.",
        "The output of the synonym checking method is shown at the right side of Table 5.",
        "Since the remaining words do not belong to the same synset, the vertex colouring coding method is then used to encode the words.",
        "Figure 10(a) is the original synset graph in which each vertex is assigned one of the four colours; Figure 10(b) is the graph after applying codeword reduction.",
        "Although both 'disgrace' and 'pity' are encoded by '1', 'pity' is chosen to replace the cover word since it has a higher score.",
        "Finally, the stego-text is generated, \"it is a pity that we could not reach the next stage.\"",
        "As a rough guide to the potential payload with this approach, we estimate that, with a threshold of 0.5 for the contextual check, the payload would be slightly higher than 1 bit per newspaper sentence."

        "The vertex colouring coding method represents synonym substitution as a synonym graph so the relations between words can be clearly observed.",
        "In addition, an automatic system for checking synonym acceptability in context is integrated in our stegosystem to ensure information security.",
        "For future work, we would like to explore more linguistic transformations that can meet the requirements of linguistic steganography – retaining the meaning, grammaticality and style of the original text.",
        "In addition, it is crucial to have a full evaluation of the linguistic stegosystem in terms of imperceptibility and payload capacity so we can know how much data can be embedded before the cover text reaches its maximum distortion which is tolerated by a human judge."
