        "Grammar induction is a central problem in Computational Linguistics, the aim of which is to induce linguistic structures from an unannotated text corpus.",
        "Despite considerable research effort this unsupervised problem remains largely unsolved, particularly for traditional phrase-structure parsing approaches (Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002).",
        "Phrase-structure parser induction is made difficult due to two types of ambiguity: the constituent structure and the constituent labels.",
        "In particular the constituent labels are highly ambiguous, firstly we don't know a priori how many there are, and secondly labels that appear high in a tree (e.g., an S category for a clause) rely on the correct inference of all the latent labels below them.",
        "However recent work on the induction of dependency grammars has proved more fruitful (Klein and Manning, 2004).",
        "Dependency grammars (Mel'aik, 1988) should be easier to induce from text compared to phrase-structure grammars because the set of labels (heads) are directly observed as the words in the sentence.",
        "Approaches to unsupervised grammar induction, both for phrase-structure and dependency grammars, have typically used very simplistic models (Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2004), especially in comparison to supervised parsing models (Collins, 2003; Clark and Curran, 2004; McDonald, 2006).",
        "Simple models are attractive for grammar induction because they have a limited capacity to overfit, however they are incapable of modelling many known linguistic phenomena.",
        "We posit that more complex grammars could be used to better model the unsupervised task, provided that active measures are taken to prevent overfitting.",
        "In this paper we present an approach to dependency grammar induction using a tree-substitution grammar (TSG) with a Bayesian non-parametric prior.",
        "This allows the model to learn large dependency fragments to best describe the text, with the prior biasing the model towards fewer and smaller grammar productions.",
        "We adopt the split-head construction (Eisner, 2000; Johnson, 2007) to map dependency parses to context free grammar (CFG) derivations, over which we apply a model of TSG induction (Cohn et al., 2009).",
        "The model uses a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process to encode a backoff path from TSG to CFG rules, and from lexicalised to unlexicalised rules.",
        "Our best lexicalised model achieves a head attachment accuracy of of 55.7% on Section 23 of the WSJ data set, which significantly improves over state-of-the-art and far exceeds an EM baseline (Klein and Manning, 2004) which obtains 35.9%.",

        "Note that the actual CFG is created by instantiating these templates with part-of-speech tags observed in the data for the variables H and C. Valency (vat) can take the value 0 (no attachment in the direction (dir) d) and 1 (one or more attachment).",
        "L and R indicates child dependents left or right of the parent; superscripts encode the stopping and valency distributions, X indicates that the head will continue to attach more children and X* that it has already attached a child."

        "The most successful framework for unsupervised dependency induction is the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) (Klein and Manning, 2004).",
        "This model has been adapted and extended by a number of authors and currently represents the state-of-the-art for dependency induction (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Headden III et al., 2009).",
        "Eisner (2000) introduced the split-head algorithm which permits efficient O(|w|) parsing complexity by replicating (splitting) each terminal and processing left and right dependents separately.",
        "We employ the related fold-unfold representation of Johnson (2007) that defines a CFG equivalent of the split-head parsing algorithm, allowing us to easily adapt CFG-based grammar models to dependency grammar.",
        "Table 1 shows the equivalent CFG grammar for the DMV model (CFG-DMV) using the unfold-fold transformation.",
        "The key insight to understanding the non-terminals in this grammar is that the subscripts encode the terminals at the boundaries of the span of that non-terminal.",
        "For example the non-terminal Lh encodes that the right most terminal spanned by this constituent is H (and the reverse for HR), while aMb encodes that A and B are the leftmost and rightmost terminals of the span.",
        "The * and superscripts are used to encode the valency of the head, both indicate that the head has at least one attached dependent in the specified direction.",
        "This grammar allows O(|w|) parsing complexity which follows from the terminals of the dependency tree being observed, such that each span of the parse chart uniquely specifies its possible heads (either the leftmost, rightmost or both) and therefore the number of possible non-terminals for each span is constant.",
        "The transform is illustrated in figures 1a and 1c which show the CFG tree for an example sentence and the equivalent dependency tree.",
        "Normally DMV based models have been trained on part-of-speech tags of the words in a sentence, rather than the words themselves.",

        "In this paper we have made two signiicant contributions to probabilistic modelling and grammar induction.",
        "We have shown that it is possible to successfully learn hierarchical Pitman-Yor models that encode deep and complex backoff paths over highly structured latent spaces.",
        "By applying these models to the induction of dependency grammars we have also been able to advance the state-of-the-art, increasing the head attachment accuracy on section 23 of the Wall Street Journal Corpus by more than 5%.",
        "Further gains in performance may come from an exploration of the backoff paths employed within the model.",
        "In particular more extensive experimentation with alternate priors and larger training data may allow the removal of the lexicalisation cutoff which is currently in place to counter sparsity.",
        "We envisage that in future many grammar formalisms that have been shown to be effective in supervised parsing, such as categorial, uniication and tree adjoining grammars, will prove amenable to unsupervised induction using the hierarchical non-parametric modelling approaches we have demonstrated in this paper.",
