        "Both statistical machine translation (SMT) and unsupervised dependency parsing have seen a surge of interest in recent years, as the need for large scale data processing has increased.",
        "The problems addressed by each of the fields seem quite different at first glance.",
        "However, in this paper, we reveal a strong connection between them and show that the problem of dependency parsing can be formulated as one of word alignment within the sentence.",
        "Furthermore, we show that the two models that are arguably the most influential in their respective fields, the IBM models 1-3 (Brown et al., 1993) and Klein and Manning's (2004) Dependency Model with Valence (DMV), share a common set of modeling assumptions.",
        "Based on this connection, we develop a framework which uses an alignment-based approach for unsupervised dependency parsing.",
        "The framework is flexible and modular, and allows us to explore different modeling assumptions.",
        "We demonstrate these properties and the merit of the alignment-based parsing approach by implementing several dependency parsing algorithms based on the IBM alignment models and evaluating their performance on the task.",
        "Although the algorithms are not competitive with state-of-the-art systems, they outperform the right-branching baseline and approach the performance of DMV.",
        "This is especially surprising when we consider that the IBM models were not originally designed for the task.",
        "These results are encouraging and indicate that the alignment-based approach could serve as the basis for competitive dependency parsing systems, much as DMV did.",
        "This paper offers two main contributions.",
        "First, by revealing the connection between the two tasks, we introduce a new approach to dependency parsing, and open the way for use of SMT alignment resources and tools for parsing.",
        "Our experiments with the IBM models demonstrate the potential of this approach and provide a strong motivation for further development.",
        "The second contribution is a publicly-available framework for exploring new alignment models.",
        "The framework uses Gibbs sampling techniques and includes our sampling-based implementations of the IBM models (see Section 3.4).",
        "The sampling approach makes it easy to modify the existing models and add new ones.",
        "The framework can be used both for dependency parsing and for bilingual word alignment.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present a brief overview of those works in the fields of dependency parsing and alignment for statistical machine translation which are directly relevant to this paper.",
        "Section 3 describes the connection between the two problems, examines the shared assumptions of the DMV and IBM models, and describes our framework and algorithms.",

        "In recent years, the field of supervised parsing has advanced tremendously, to the point where highly accurate parsers are available for many languages.",
        "However, supervised methods require the manual annotation of training data with parse trees, a process which is expensive and time consuming.",
        "Therefore, for domains and languages with minimal resources, unsupervised parsing is of great importance.",
        "Early work in the field focused on models that made use primarily of the co-occurrence information of the head and its argument (Yuret, 1998; Paskin, 2001).",
        "The introduction of DMV by Klein and Manning (2004) represented a shift in the direction of research in the field.",
        "DMV is based on a linguistically motivated generative model, which follows common practice in supervised parsing and takes into consideration the distance between head and argument, as well as the valence (the capacity of a head word to attach arguments).",
        "Klein and Manning (2004) also shifted from a lexical representation of the sentences to representing them as part-of-speech sequences.",
        "DMV strongly outperformed previous models and was the first unsupervised dependency induction system to achieve accuracy above the right-branching baseline.",
        "Much subsequent work in the field has focused on modifications and extensions of DMV, and it is the basis for today's state-of-the-art systems (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Headden III et al., 2009).",

        "The same assumption is made in all the dependency models mentioned in Section 2 regarding a head and its dependent (although DMV uses word classes instead of the actual words).",
        "Location IBM Model 2 adds the consideration of difference in location between the English and French words when considering the likelihood of alignment.",
        "One of the improvements contributing to the success of DMV was the notion of distance, which was absent from previous models (see Section 3 in Klein and Manning 2004).",
        "Fertility IBM Model 3 adds the notion of fertility, or the idea that different words in the source language tend to generate different numbers ofwords in the target language.",
        "This corresponds to the notion of valence, used by Klein and Manning (2004), and the other major contributor to the success of DMV (ibid.",
        ").",
        "Null Source The IBM models all make use of an additional \"null\" word in every sentence, which has special status.",
        "It is attached to words in the translation that do not correspond to a word in the source.",
        "It is treated separately when calculating distance (since it has no location) and fertility.",
        "In these characteristics, it is very similar to the \"root\" node, which is artificially added to parse trees and used to represent the head of words which are not dependents of any other word in the sentence.",
        "In examining the core assumptions of the IBM models, we note that there is a strong resemblance to those of DMV.",
        "The similarity is at an abstract level since the nature of the relationship that each model attempts to detect is quite different.",
        "The IBM models look for an equivalence relationship between lexical items in two languages, whereas DMV addresses functional relationships between two elements with distinct meanings.",
        "However, both attempt to model a similar set of factors, which they posit will be important to their respective tasks.",
        "This similarity motivates the work presented in the rest of the paper, i.e, exploring the use of the IBM alignment models for dependency parsing.",
        "It is important to note that the IBM models do not address many important factors relevant to the parsing task.",
        "For instance, they have no notion of a parse tree, a deficit which may lead to degenerate solutions and malformed parses.",
        "However, they serve as a good starting point for exploring the alignment approach to parsing, as well as discovering additional factors that need to be addressed under this approach.",
        "We developed a Gibbs sampling framework for alignment-based dependency parsing.",

        "The sampling method, on the other hand, only considers a small change in each step - that of realigning a previously aligned target word to a new source.",
        "The reason for our choice is the ease of modification of such sampling models.",
        "They allow for easy introduction of further parameters and more complex probabilistic functions, as well as Bayesian priors, all of which are likely to be helpful in development .",
        "Under the sampling framework, the model provides the probability of changing the alignment A[i] of a target word i from a previously aligned source word j to a new one j.",
        "In all the models we consider, this probability is proportional to the ratio between the scores of the old sentence alignment A and the new one A, which differs from the old only in the realignment of i to j .",

        "As a starting point for our dependency parsing model, we reimplemented the first three IBM models in the sampling framework.",
        "IBM Model 1 According to this model, the probability of an alignment between target word i and source word j depends only on the lexical identities of the two words wi and w j respectively.",
        "This gives us equation 3.",
        "In our implementation we assume the alignment follows a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), where the probability of wi aligning to wj is proportional to the number of times they have been aligned in the past (the rest of the data), as follows:",
        "Here, #(wi, wj) represents the number of times the target word wi was observed to be aligned to wj in the rest of the data, and * stands for any word, V is the size of the vocabulary, and a1 is a hyperparameter of the CRP, which can also be viewed as a smoothing factor.",
        "IBM Model 2 The original IBM model 2 is a distortion model that assumes that the probability of an alignment between target word i and source word j depends only on the locations of the words, i.e., the values i and j, taking into account the different lengths l and m of the source and target sentences, respectively.",
        "For dependency parsing, where we align sentences to themselves, l = m. This gives us equation 5.",
        "Again, we assume a CRP when choosing a distortion value, where D is the expected number of distance values (set to 10 in our experiments), a2is the CRP hyperparameter, #(i, j, l) is the number of times a target word in position i was aligned to a source word in position j in sentences of length l, and *, l) is the number of times word in position i was aligned (to any source position) in sentences of length l.",
        "Even without the need for handling different lengths for source and target sentences, this model is complex and requires estimating a separate probability for each triplet (i, j, l).",
        "In addition, the assumption that the distance distribution depends only on the sentence length and is similar for all tokens seems unreasonable, especially when dealing with part-of-speech tokens and dependency relations.",
        "Such concerns have been mentioned in the SMT literature and were shown to be justified in our experiments (see Sec. 4).",
        "For this reason, we also implemented an alternate distance model, based loosely on Liang et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Under the alternate model, the probability of an alignment between target word i and source word j depends on the distance between them, their order, the sentence length, and the word type of the head, according to equation 6.",
        "IBM Model 3 This model handles the notion of fertility (or valence).",
        "Under this model, the probability of an alignment depends on how many target words are aligned to each of the source words.",
        "Each source word type wj , has a distribution specifying the probabilityofhaving nalignedtargetwords.",
        "The probability of an alignment is proportional to the product of the probabilities of the fertilities in the alignment and takes into account the special status of the null word (represented by the index j= 0).",
        "This probability is given in Equation 7, which is based on Equation 32 in Brown et al.",
        "(1993).",
        "Here, ^j denotes the number of target words aligned to the j-th source word in alignment A. p1 and p0 sum to 1 and are used to derive the probability that there will be ^0 null-aligned words in a sentence containing l words.",
        "#(wj, <|)j) represents the number of times source word wj was observed to have | j dependent target words, #(wj, *) is the number of times w j appeared in the data, F is the expected number of fertility values (5 in our experiments), and a4 is the CRP hyperparameter.",
        "Combining the Models The original IBM models work in an incremental fashion, with each model using the output of the previous one as a starting point and adding a new component to the probability distribution.",
        "The dependency parsing framework employs a similar approach.",
        "It uses the alignments learned by the previous model as the starting point of the next and combines the probability distributions of each component via a product model.",
        "This allows for the easy introduction of new models which consider different aspects of the alignment and complement each other.",
        "Preventing Self-Alignment When adapting the alignment approach to dependency parsing, we view the task as that of aligning a sentence to itself.",
        "One issue we must address is preventing the degenerate solution of aligning each word to itself.",

        "Our experiments showed that the IBM models are surprisingly effective at the dependency parsing task, outperforming the right-branching baseline and approaching the accuracy of DMV.",
        "Our results demonstrate that the alignment approach can be used as a foundation for dependency parsing algorithms and motivates further research in this area.",
        "There are many interesting avenues for further research.",
        "These include improving and extending the existing IBM models, as well as introducing new models that are specifically designed for the parsing task and represent relevant linguistic considerations (e.g., enforcing tree structure, handling crossing dependencies, learning left-or right-branching tendencies).",
        "In Spitkovsky et al.",
        "(2010), the authors show that a gradual increase in the complexity of the data can aid the learning process.",
        "The IBM approach demonstrated the benefit of a gradual increase of model complexity.",
        "It would be interesting to see if the two approaches could be successfully combined.",
        "Finally, although we use our framework for dependency parsing, the sampling approach and the framework we developed can be used to explore new models for bilingual word alignment.",
        "Furthermore, an alignment-based parsing method is expected to integrate well with SMT bilingual alignment models and may, therefore, be suitable for combined models which use parse trees to improve word alignment (e.g., Burkett et al.",
        "2010)."
