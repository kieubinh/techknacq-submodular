        "Despite surface differences, human languages exhibit striking similarities in many fundamental aspects of syntactic structure.",
        "These structural correspondences, referred to as syntactic universals, have been extensively studied in linguistics (Baker, 2001; Carnie, 2002; White, 2003; Newmeyer, 2005) and underlie many approaches in multilingual parsing.",
        "In fact, much recent work has demonstrated that learning cross-lingual correspondences from corpus data greatly reduces the ambiguity inherent in syntactic analysis (Kuhn, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Cohen and Smith, 2009a; Snyder et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).",
        "Table 1: The manually-specified universal dependency rules used in our experiments.",
        "These rules specify head-dependent relationships between coarse (i.e., unsplit) syntactic categories.",
        "An explanation of the ruleset is provided in Section 5.",
        "In this paper, we present an alternative grammar induction approach that exploits these structural correspondences by declaratively encoding a small set of universal dependency rules.",
        "As input to the model, we assume a corpus annotated with coarse syntactic categories (i.e., high-level part-of-speech tags) and a set of universal rules defined over these categories, such as those in Table 1.",
        "These rules incorporate the definitional properties of syntactic categories in terms of their interdependencies and thus are universal across languages.",
        "They can potentially help disambiguate structural ambiguities that are difficult to learn from data alone – for example, our rules prefer analyses in which verbs are dependents of auxiliaries, even though analyzing auxiliaries as dependents of verbs is also consistent with the data.",
        "Leveraging these universal rules has the potential to improve parsing performance for a large number of human languages; this is particularly relevant to the processing of low-resource languages.",
        "Furthermore, these universal rules are compact and well-understood, making them easy to manually construct.",

        "Adjective – Adverb",
        "Auxiliary – Verb",
        "In addition to these universal dependencies, each specific language typically possesses its own idiosyncratic set of dependencies.",
        "We address this challenge by requiring the universal constraints to only hold in expectation rather than absolutely, i.e., we permit a certain number of violations of the constraints.",
        "We formulate a generative Bayesian model that explains the observed data while accounting for declarative linguistic rules during inference.",
        "These rules are used as expectation constraints on the posterior distribution over dependency structures.",
        "This approach is based on the posterior regularization technique (Graca et al., 2009), which we apply to a variational inference algorithm for our parsing model.",
        "Our model can also optionally refine common high-level syntactic categories into per-language categories by inducing a clustering of words using Dirichlet Processes (Ferguson, 1973).",
        "Since the universals guide induction toward linguistically plausible structures, automatic refinement becomes feasible even in the absence of manually annotated syntactic trees.",
        "We test the effectiveness of our grammar induction model on six Indo-European languages from three language groups: English, Danish, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.",
        "Though these languages share a high-level Indo-European ancestry, they cover a diverse range of syntactic phenomenon.",
        "Our results demonstrate that universal rules greatly improve the accuracy of dependency parsing across all of these languages, outperforming current state-of-the-art unsupervised grammar induction methods (Headden III et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Learning with Linguistic Constraints Our work is situated within a broader class of unsupervised approaches that employ declarative knowledge to improve learning of linguistic structure (Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Chang et al., 2007; Graca et al., 2007; est to the latter two approaches of posterior regularization and generalized expectation criteria.",
        "In the posterior regularization framework, constraints are expressed in the form of expectations on posteriors (Graca et al., 2007; Ganchev et al., 2009; Graca et al., 2009; Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "This design enables the model to reflect constraints that are difficult to encode via the model structure or as priors on its parameters.",
        "In their approach, parameters are estimated using a modified EM algorithm, where the E-step minimizes the KL-divergence between the model posterior and the set of distributions that satisfies the constraints.",
        "Our approach also expresses constraints as expectations on the posterior; we utilize the machinery of their framework within a variational inference algorithm with a mean field approximation.",
        "Generalized expectation criteria, another technique for declaratively specifying expectation constraints, has previously been successfully applied to the task of dependency parsing (Druck et al., 2009).",
        "This objective expresses constraints in the form of preferences over model expectations.",
        "The objective is penalized by the square distance between model expectations and the prespecified values of the expectation.",
        "This approach yields significant gains compared to a fully unsupervised counterpart.",
        "The constraints they studied are corpus-and language-specific.",
        "Our work demonstrates that a small set of language-independent universals can also serve as effective constraints.",
