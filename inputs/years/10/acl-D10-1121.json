        "Mining sentiment from text has a wide range of applications from mining product reviews on the Web (Morinaga et al., 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003) to analyzing political speeches (Thomas et al., 2006).",
        "Automatic methods for sentiment mining are very important because manual extraction of them is very costly, and inefficient.",
        "A new application of sentiment mining is to automatically identify attitudes between participants in an online discussion.",
        "An automatic tool to identify attitudes will enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction in which the interaction between two participants is represented using a positive or a negative edge.",
        "Even though using signed edges in social network studies is clearly important, most of the social networks research has focused only on positive links between entities.",
        "Some work has recently investigated signed networks (Leskovec et al., 2010; Kunegis et al., 2009), however this work was limited to a few number of datasets in which users were allowed to explicitly add negative, as well as positive, relations.",
        "This work will pave the way for research efforts to examine signed social networks in more detail.",
        "It will also allow us to study the relation between explicit relations and the text underlying those relation.",
        "Although similar, identifying sentences that display an attitude in discussions is different from identifying opinionated sentences.",
        "A sentence in a discussion may bear opinions about a definite target (e.g., price of a camera) and yet have no attitude toward the other participants in the discussion.",
        "For instance, in the following discussion Alice's sentence has her opinion against something, yet no attitude toward the recipient of the sentence, Bob.",
        "Alice: \"You know what, he turned out to be a great disappointment\" Bob: \"You are completely unqualified to judge this great person\"",
        "However, Bob shows strong attitude toward Alice.",
        "In this work, we look at ways to predict whether a sentence displays an attitude toward the text recipient.",
        "An attitude is the mental position of one participant with regard to another participant.",
        "it could be either positive or negative.",
        "We consider features which takes into account the entire structure of sentences at different levels or generalization.",
        "Those features include lexical items, part-of-speech tags, and dependency relations.",
        "We use all those patterns to build several pairs of models that represent sentences with and without attitude.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review some of the related prior work on identifying polarized words and subjectivity analysis.",
        "We explain the problem definition and discuss our approach in Sections 3 & 4.",

        "Identifying the polarity of individual words is a well studied problem.",
        "In previous work, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) propose a method to identify the polarity of adjectives.",
        "They use a manually labeled corpus to classify each conjunction of an adjective as \"the same orientation\" as the adjective or \"different orientation\".",
        "Their method can label simple in \"simple and well-received\" as the same orientation and simplistic in \"simplistic but well-received\" as the opposite orientation of well-received.",
        "Although the results look promising, the method would only be applicable to adjectives since noun conjunctions may collocate regardless of their semantic orientations (e.g., \"rise and fall\").",
        "In other work, Turney and Littman (2003) use statistical measures to find the association between a given word and a set of positive/negative seed words.",
        "In order to get word co-occurrence statistics they use the \"near\" operator from a commercial search engine on a given word and a seed word.",
        "In more recent work, Takamura et al.",
        "(2005) used the spin model to extract word semantic orientation.",
        "First, they construct a network of words using definitions, thesaurus, and co-occurrence statistics.",
        "In this network, each word is regarded as an electron, which has a spin and each spin has a direction taking one of two values: up or down.",
        "Then, they use the energy point of view to propose that neighboring electrons tend to have the same spin direction, and therefore neighboring words tend to have the same polarity orientations.",
        "Finally, they use the mean field method to find the optimal solution for electron spin directions.",
        "Previous work has also used WordNet, a lexical database of English, to identify word polarity.",
        "Specifically, Hu and Liu (2004) use WordNet synonyms and antonyms to predict the polarity of any given word with unknown polarity.",
        "They label each word with the polarity of its synonyms and the opposite polarity of its antonyms.",
        "They continue in a bootstrapping manner to label all unlabeled instances.",
        "This work is very similar to (Kamps et al., 2004) in which a network of WordNet synonyms is used to find the shortest path between any given word, and the words \"good\" and \"bad\".",
        "Kim and Hovy (Kim and Hovy, 2004) used WordNet synonyms and antonyms to expand two lists of positive and negative seed words.",
        "Similarly, Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) used WordNet to expand seed lists with fuzzy sentiment categories, in which words could be more central to one category than the other.",
        "Finally, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) used syntactic features and context coherency, defined as the tendency for same polarities to appear successively, to acquire polar atoms.",
        "All the work mentioned above focus on the task of identifying the polarity of individual words.",
        "Our proposed work is identifying attitudes in sentences that appear in online discussions.",
        "Perhaps the most similar work to ours is the prior work on subjectivity analysis, which is to identify text that present opinions as opposed to objective text that present factual information (Wiebe, 2000).",
        "Prior work on subjectivity analysis mainly consists of two main categories: The first category is concerned with identifying the subjectivity of individual phrases and words regardless of the sentence and context they appear in (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Banea et al., 2008).",
        "In the second category, subjectivity of a phrase or word is analyzed within its context (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Yu and Hatzivas-siloglou, 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, ).",
        "A good study of the applications of subjectivity analysis from review mining to email classification is given in (Wiebe, 2000).",
        "Somasun-daran et al.",
        "(2007) develop genre-speci.c lexicons using interesting function word combinations for detecting opinions in meetings.",
        "Despite similarities, our work is different from subjectivity analysis because the later only discriminates between opinions and facts.",
        "A discussion sentence may display an opinion about some topic yet no attitude.",
        "The language constituents considered in opinion detection may be different from those used to detect attitude.",
        "Moreover, extracting attitudes from online discussions is different from targeting subjective expressions (Josef Ruppenhofer and Wiebe, 2008; Kim and Hovy, 2004).",
        "The later usually has a limited set of targets that compete for the subjective expressions (for example in movie review, targets could be: director, actors, plot, and so forth).",
        "We cannot use similar methods because we are working on an open domain where anything could be a target.",
        "A very detailed survey that covers techniques and approaches in sentiment analysis and opinion mining could be found in (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "There is also some related work on mining online discussions.",
        "Lin et al. (2009) proposes a sparse coding-based model simultaneously model semantics and structure of threaded discussions.",
        "Shen et al. (2006) proposes three clustering methods for exploiting the temporal information in the streams, as well as an algorithm based on linguistic features to analyze the discourse structure information.",

        "In this section, we describe a model which, given a sentence, predicts whether it carries an attitude from the text writer toward the text recipient or not.",
        "Any given piece of text exchanged between two participants in a discussion could carry an attitude toward the text recipient, an attitude towards the topic, or no attitude at all.",
        "As we are only interested in attitudes between participants, we limit our study to sentences that use second person pronouns.",
        "Second person pronouns are usually used in conversational genre to indicate that the text writer is addressing the text recipient.",
        "After identifying those sentences, we do some preprocessing to extract the most relevant fragments.",
        "We examine these fragments to to identify the polarity of every word in the sentence.",
        "Every word could be assigned a semantic orientation.",
        "The semantic orientation could be either positive, negative, or neutral.",
        "The existence of polarized words in any sentence is an important indicator of whether it carries an attitude or not.",
        "The next step is to extract several patterns at different levels of generalization representing any given sentence.",
        "We use those patterns to build two Markov models for every kind of patterns.",
        "The first model characterizes the relation between different tokens for all patterns that correspond to sentences that have an attitude.",
        "The second model is similar to the first one, but it uses all patterns that correspond to sentences that do not have an attitude.",
        "Given a new sentence, we extract the corresponding patterns and estimate the likelihood of every pattern being generated from the two corresponding models.",
        "We then compare the likelihood of the sentence under the two models and use this as a feature to predict the existence of an attitude.",
        "A pair of models will be built for every kind of patterns.",
        "If we have n different patterns, we will have n different likelihood ratios that come from n pairs of models.",
        "Identifying the polarity of words is an important step for our method.",
        "Our word identification module is similar to the work in (Annon, 2010).",
        "We construct a graph where each node represent a word/part-of-speech pair.",
        "Two nodes are linked if the words are related.",
        "We use WordNet (Miller, 1995) to link related words based on synonyms, hypernyms, and similar to relations.",
        "For words that do not appear in Wordnet, we used Wiktionary, a collaboratively constructed dictionary.",
        "We also add some links based on co-occurrence statistics between words as from a large corpus.",
        "The resulting graph is a graph G(W, E) where W is a set of word/part-of-speech pairs, and E is the set of edges connecting related words.",

        "The mean hitting time h(i|k) is defined as the average number of steps a random walker, starting in state i = k, will take to enter state k for the first time (Norris, 1997).",
        "If h(w|S+) is greater than h(w|S â€“ ), the word is classified as negative, otherwise it is classified as positive.",
        "We also use the method described in (Wilson et al., 2005) to determine the contextual polarity of the identified words.",

        "Once, we reach a sentence clause, we extract the corresponding text if it is grammatical, otherwise we go up one more level to the closest sentence clause.",
        "We used the Stanford parser to generate the grammatical structure of sentences (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "The fragments we extracted earlier are more relevant to our task and are more suitable for further analysis.",
        "However, these fragments are completely lexicalized and consequently the performance of any analysis based on them will be limited by data sparsity.",

        "Those general representations can be used a long with words to generate a set of patterns that represent each fragment.",
        "Each pattern consists of a sequence of tokens.",
        "Examples of such patterns could use lexical items, part-of-speech (POS) tags, word polarity tags, and dependency relations.",

        "Unfortunately, that is not always correct.",
        "For example, the sentence \"You are completely unqualified to judge this great person\" has a positive word \"great\" and a negative word \"unqualified\".",
        "The first method will not be able to predict whether the sentence is positive or negative.",
        "To solve this problem, we use another method that is based on the paths that connect polarized words to second person pronouns in a dependency parse tree.",
        "For every positive word w , we identify the shortest path connecting it to every second person pronoun in the sentence then we compute the average length of the shortest path connecting every positive word to the closest second person pronoun.",
        "We repeat for negative words and compare the two values.",
        "The sentence is classified as positive if the average length of the shortest path connecting positive words to the closest second person pronoun is smaller than the corresponding value for negative words.",
        "Otherwise, we classify the sentence as negative.",
        "Our data was randomly collected from a set of discussion groups.",
        "We collected a large number of threads from the first quarter of 2009 from a set of Usenet discussion groups.",
        "All threads were in English, and had 5 posts or more.",
        "We parsed the downloaded threads to identify the posts and senders.",
        "We kept posts that have quoted text and discarded all other posts.",
        "The reason behind that is that participants usually quote other participants text when they reply to them.",
        "This restriction allows us to identify the target of every post, and raises the probability that the post will display an attitude from its writer to its target.",
        "We plan to use more sophsticated methods for reconstructing the reply structure like the one in (Lin et al., 2009).",
        "From those posts, we randomly selected approximately 10,000 sentences that use second person pronouns.",
        "We explained earlier how second person pronouns are used in discussions genres to indicate the writer is targeting the text recipient.",
        "Given a random sentence selected from some random discussion thread, the probability that the sentence does not have an attitude is significantly larger than the probability that it will have an attitude.",
        "Hence, restricting our dataset to posts with quoted text and sentences with second person pronouns is very important to make sure that we will have a considerable amount of attitudinal sentences.",
        "The data was tokenized, sentence-split, part-of-speech tagged with the OpenNLP toolkit.",
        "It was parsed with the Stanford dependency parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "The goals of the annotation scheme are to distinguish sentences that display an attitude from those that do not.",
        "Sentences could display either a negative or a positive attitude.",
        "Disagreement, insults, and negative slang are indicators of negative attitude.",
        "Agreement, and praise are indicators of positive attitude.",

        "The existence of an attitude was judged on a three point scale: attitude, unsure, and no-attitude.",
        "The second is the sign of the attitude.",
        "If an attitude exists, annotators were asked to specify whether the attitude is positive or negative.",
        "To evaluate inter-annotator agreement, we use the agr operator presented in (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "This metric measures the precision and recall of one annotator using the annotations of another annotator as a gold standard.",
        "The process is repeated for all pairs of annotators, and then the harmonic mean of all values is reported.",
        "Formally:",

        "The reasons behind incorrect word polarity predictions is ambiguity in word senses and infrequent words that have very few connection in thesaurus.",
        "A possible solution to this type of errors is to improve the word polarity identification module by including word sense disambiguation and adding more links to the words graph using glosses or co-occurrence statistics.",
        "The second reason is that some sentences are sarcastic in nature.",
        "It is so difficult to identify such sentences.",
