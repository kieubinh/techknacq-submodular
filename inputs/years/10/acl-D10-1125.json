        "We have described dual decomposition algorithms for non-projective parsing, which leverage existing dynamic programming and MST algorithms.",
        "There are a number of possible areas for future work.",
        "As described in section 7.7, the algorithms can be easily modified to consider projective structures by replacing y with the set of projective trees, and then using first-order dependency parsing algorithms in place of MST decoding.",
        "This method could be used to derive parsing algorithms that include higher-order features, as an alternative to specialized dynamic programming algorithms.",
        "Eisner (2000) describes extensions of head automata to include word senses; we have not discussed this issue in the current paper, but it is simple to develop dual decomposition algorithms for this case, using similar methods to those used for the grandparent models.",
        "The general approach should be applicable to other lexical-ized syntactic formalisms, and potentially also to decoding in syntax-driven translation.",
        "In addition, our dual decomposition approach is well-suited to paral-lelization.",
        "For example, each of the head-automata could be optimized independently in a multi-core or GPU architecture.",
        "Finally, our approach could be used with other structured learning algorithms, e.g.",
        "Meshi et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "A Implementation Details",
        "This appendix describes details of the algorithm, specifically choice of the step sizes ak, and use of the y(i, j) parameters.",
        "A.1 Choice of Step Sizes",
        "We have found the following method to be effective.",
        "First, define b = f (z(1)) – f (y(1)), where (z(1), y(1)) is the output of the algorithm on the first iteration (note that we always have b > 0 since f (z(1)) = L(u(1))).",
        "Then define ak = b/(1 + r?k), where r?k is the number of times that L(u(k )) > L(u(k for k' < k. Hence the learning rate drops at a rate of 1/(1 +t), where t is the number of times that the dual increases from one iteration to the next.",
        "A.2 Use of the y(i, j) Parameters",
        "The parsing algorithms both consider a generalized problem that includes y (i, j) parameters.",
        "We now describe how these can be useful.",
        "Recall that the optimization problem is to solve argmaxzeZ y€y f (z) + h(y), subject to a set of agreement constraints.",
        "In our models, f(z) can be written as f '(z) + J2 ijj )z(i,j) where f'(z) includes only terms depending on higher-order (non arc-factored features), and ) are weights that consider the dependency between i and j alone.",
        "For any value of 0 < ß < 1, the problem argmaxz€Zyey f2(z) + h2(y) is equivalent to the original problem, if f2(z) = f'(z) + (1 – ß)£j;j a(i,j)z(i,j) and /^(y) = ßJ2ij a(i,j)y(i,j).",
        "We have simply shifted the j) weights from one model to the other.",
        "While the optimization problem remains the same, the algorithms in Figure 1 and 2 will converge at different rates depending on the value for ß.",
        "In our experiments we set ß = 0.001, which puts almost all the weight in the head-automata models, but allows weights on spanning tree edges to break ties in MST inference in a sensible way.",
        "We suspect this is important in early iterations of the algorithm, when many values for u(i, j) or j) will be zero, and where with ß = 0 many spanning tree solutions y(k)would be essentially random, leading to very noisy updates to the u(i, j) and j) values.",
        "We have not tested other values for ß.",
