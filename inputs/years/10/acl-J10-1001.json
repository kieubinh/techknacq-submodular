        "It is an interesting possibility that human syntactic processing may occur entirely within a general-purpose short-term memory.",
        "Like other short-term memory processes, syntactic processing is susceptible to degradation if short-term memory capacity is loaded, for example, when readers are asked to retain lists of words while reading (Just and Carpenter 1992); and memory of words and syntax degrades over time within and across sentences (Sachs 1967; Jarvella 1971), unlike semantics and discourse information about referents from other sentences (Ericsson and Kintsch 1995).",
        "But short-term memory is known to have severe capacity limitations of perhaps no more than three to four distinct elements (Miller 1956; Cowan 2001).",
        "These limits may seem too austere to process the rich treelike phrase structure commonly invoked to explain word-order regularities in natural language.",
        "This article aims to show that they are not.",
        "The article describes a comprehension model, based on a right-corner transform – a reversible tree transform related to the left-corner transform of Johnson (1998a) – that associates familiar phrase structure trees with the contents of a memory store of three to four partially completed constituents over time.",
        "Coverage results on the large syntactically annotated Penn Treebank corpus show a vast majority of naturally occurring sentences can be recognized using a memory store containing a maximum of only three incomplete constituents, and nearly all sentences can be recognized using four, consistent with estimates of human short-term memory capacity.",
        "This transform reduces memory usage in incremental (left to right) processing by transforming right-branching constituent structures into left-branching structures, allowing child constituents to be composed with parent constituents before either have been completely recognized.",
        "But because this composition identifies an incomplete child as the awaited portion of an incomplete parent, it implicitly predicts that this child constituent will be the rightmost (i.e., last) child of the parent, before this child has been completely recognized.",
        "Parsing accuracy results on the Penn Treebank using a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (Murphy and Paskin 2001) – essentially a probabilistic pushdown automaton with a bounded pushdown store – show that this prediction can be reliably learned from training data.",
        "The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes some related models of human syntactic processing using a bounded memory store; Section 3 describes a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) framework for statistical parsing using this bounded store of incomplete constituents; Section 4 describes the right-corner transform and how it relates conventional phrase structure to incomplete constituents in a bounded memory store; Section 5 describes an experiment to estimate the level of coverage of the Penn Treebank corpus that can be achieved using this transform with various memory limits, given a linguistically motivated binarization of this corpus; and Section 6 gives accuracy results of this bounded-memory model trained on this corpus, given that some amount of incremental prediction (as described earlier) must be involved."

        "One of the earliest bounded-memory parsing models is that of Marcus (1980).",
        "This model maintains a bounded store of complete but unattached constituents as a buffer, and operates on them using a variety of specialized memory manipulation operations, deferring certain attachment decisions until the contents of this buffer indicate it is safe to do so.",
        "(In contrast, the model described in this article maintains a store of incomplete constituents using ordinary stack-like push and pop operations, defined to allow constituents to be composed before being completely recognized.)",
        "The Marcus parser provides a bounded-memory explanation for human difficulties in processing garden path sentences: for example, the horse raced past the barn fell, with intended interpretation [NP the horse [RC (which was)raced past the barn]] fell (Bever 1970), in which raced seems like the main verb of the sentence until the word fell is encountered.",
        "But this explanation due to memory exhaustion is not compatible with observations of unproblematic parsing of sentences such as these when contextual information is provided in advance: for example, two men on horseback had a race; one went by the meadow, and the other went by the barn (Crain and Steedman 1985).",
        "Ades and Steedman (1982) introduce the idea of composing incomplete constituents to reduce storage demands in incremental processing using Combinatorial Catego-rial Grammar (CCG), avoiding the need to maintain large buffers of complete but unattached constituents.",
        "The right-corner transform described in this article composes incomplete constituents in very much the same way, but CCG is essentially a competence model, in that it seeks to unify lexical category representations used in processing with learned generalizations about argument structure, whereas the model described herein is exclusively a performance model, allowing generalizations about lexical argument structures to be learned in some other representation, then combined with probabilistic information about parsing strategies to yield a set of derived incomplete constituents.",
        "As a result, the model described in this article has a freer hand to satisfy strict working memory bounds, which may not permit some of the alternative composition operations proposed in the CCG account, thought to be associated with available prosody and quantifier scope analyses.",
        "Johnson-Laird (1983) and Abney and Johnson (1991) propose a pure processing account of memory capacity limits in parsing ordinary phrase structure trees.",
        "The Johnson-Laird and Abney and Johnson models adopt a left-corner parsing strategy, of which the right-corner transform introduced in this article is a variant, in order to bring memory usage for most parsable sentences to within seven or so active or awaited phrase structure constituents.",
        "This account may be used to explain human processing difficulties in processing triply center-embedded sentences like the rat that the cat that the dog chased killed ate the malt, with intended interpretation [NP the rat that [NP the cat that [NPthe dog] chased] killed] ate the malt (Chomsky and Miller 1963).",
        "But this explanation does not account for examples of triply center-embedded sentences that typically do not cause processing problems: [NP that [NP the food that [NP John] ordered] tasted good] pleased him (Gibson 1991).",
        "Moreover, the apparent competition between comprehension of center-embedded object relatives and retention of unrelated words in general-purpose memory (Just and Carpenter 1992) suggests that general-purpose memory is (or at least, can be) used to store incomplete constituents during comprehension.",
        "This would predict three or four elements of reliable storage, rather than seven (Cowan 2001).",
        "The transform-based model described in this article exploits a conception of chunking (Miller 1956) to combine pairs of active and awaited constituents from the Abney and Johnson analysis, connected by recognized structure, in order to operate within estimates of human short-term memory bounds.",
        "Because of these counterexamples to the memory-exhaustion explanation of garden path and center-embedding difficulties, recent work has turned to explanations other than memory exhaustion for these phenomena.",
        "Lewis and Vasishth (2005) attribute processing errors to activation interference among stored constituents that have similar syntactic and semantic roles.",
        "Hale's surprisal (2001) and entropic model (2006) link human processing difficulties to significant changes in the relative probability of competing hypotheses in incremental parsing, such that if activation is taken to be a mechanism for probability estimation, processing difficulties may be ascribed to the relatively slow speed of activation change within the brain (or to collapsing activation when probabilities grow too small, as in the case of garden path sentences).",
        "These models explain many processing difficulties without invoking memory limits, and are",
        "1 The lack of support for some of these available scope analyses may not necessarily be problematic for the present model.",
        "The complexity of interpreting nested raised quantifiers may place them beyond the capability of human interactive incremental interpretation, but not beyond the capability of post hoc interpretation (understood after the listener has had time to think about it).",
        "compatible with brain imaging evidence of increased cortical activity and recruitment of auxiliary brain areas during periods of increased uncertainty in sentence processing (Just and Varma 2007).",
        "But if interference or changing activation is posited as the source of processing difficulty, and delays are not linked to memory exhaustion per se, then these theories do not explain how (or whether) syntactic processing operates within general-purpose short-term memory.",
        "Toward this end, this article will specifically evaluate the claim that syntactic processing can be performed entirely within general-purpose short-term memory by using this memory to store unassimilated incomplete syntactic constituents, derived through a right-corner transform from basic properties of phrase structure trees.",
        "As a probabilistic incremental parser, the model described in this article is compatible with surprisal-based explanations of processing difficulties; it is, however, in some sense orthogonal, because it models a different dimension of resource allocation.",
        "The surprisal framework models allocation of processing resources (in this case, activation) among disjunctions of competing hypotheses, which are maintained for some amount of time in parallel, whereas the framework described here can be taken to model the allocation of processing resources (in this case, memory elements) among conjunctions of incompletely recognized constituents within each competing hypothesis.",
        "Thus, in this view, there are two ways to simultaneously activate multiple concepts: disjunctively (sharing activation among competing hypotheses) and conjunctively (sharing activation among unassimilated constituents within a hypothesis).",
        "But only the inner conjunctive allocation corresponds to the familiar discretely bounded store of short-term memory as described by Miller (1956); the outer disjunctive allocation treats activation as a continuous resource in which like-valued pockets expand and contract as they are reinforced or contradicted by incoming observations.",
        "Indeed, it would be surprising if these two dimensions of resource allocation did not exist: the former, because it would contradict years of observations about the behavior of short-term memory; and the latter, because it would require neural activation spreading to be instantaneous and uniform, contradicting most neuropsychological evidence.",
        "Levy (2008) compares the allocation of activation in this kind of framework to the distributed allocation of resources in a particle filter (Gordon, Salmond, and Smith 1993), an approximate inference technique for probabilistic time-series models in which particles in a (typically fixed) reservoir are assigned randomly sampled hypotheses from learned transition probabilities, essentially functioning as units of activation.",
        "The model described in this paper qualifies this analogy by positing that each individual particle in this reservoir endorses a coherent hypothesis about the contents of a three-to four-element memory store at any given time, rather than about an entire unbounded phrase structure tree.",
        "2 Probability distributions in entropy-based models like Hale's are typically assumed to be defined over sets of hypotheses pursued in parallel, but other interpretations (for example, lookahead-based deterministic models) are possible.",
        "The model described in this article is also compatible with deterministic parsing frameworks, in which case it models allocation of processing resources among incompletely-recognized constituents within a single non-competing hypothesis.",
        "3 Pure connectionist models of syntactic processing (Elman 1991; Berg 1992; Rohde 2002) attempt to unify storage of constituent structure with that of ambiguous alternative analyses, but the memory demands of systems based on this approach typically do not scale well to broad-coverage parsing.",
        "Recent results for using self-organizing maps as a unified memory resource are encouraging (Mayberry and Miikkulainen 2003) , but are still limited to parsing relatively short travel planning queries with limited syntactic complexity.",
        "Hybrid systems that generate explicit alternative hypotheses with explicit stacked-up constituents, and use connectionist models for probability estimation over these hypotheses (Henderson 2004) typically achieve better performance in practice.",
        "Previous memory-based explanations of problematic sentences (explaining garden path effects as exceeding a bound of four complete but unattached constituents, or explaining center embedding difficulties as exceeding a bound of seven active or awaited constituents) have been shown to underestimate human sentence processing capacity when equally complex but unproblematic sentences were examined.",
        "The hypothesis advanced in this article, that human sentence processing uses general-purpose short-term memory to store incomplete constituents as defined by a right-corner transform, leaves the explanation of several negative examples of unparsable garden path and center embedding sentences to orthogonal models of surprisal or interference.",
        "But in order to determine whether this right-corner memory hypothesis still underestimates human sentence processing capacity, a corpus study was performed on two complementary corpora of transcribed spontaneous speech and newspaper text, manually annotated with phrase structure trees (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",
        "These spontaneous speech and newspaper text corpora contain only attested positive examples of parsable sentences, but they may be considered complementary for this purpose because the complexity of spontaneous speech may somewhat understate human recognition capacity (potentially limiting it to the cost of spontaneously generating sentences in an unusual social context), and the complexity of newspaper text may somewhat overstate human recognition capacity (though it is composed and edited to be readable, it is still composed and edited off-line), so results from these corpora may be taken together to suggest generous and conservative upper bounds on human processing capacity."

        "This right-corner transform is a variant of the left-corner transform described by Johnson (1998a), but whereas the left-corner transform changes left-branching structure into right-branching structure, the right-corner transform changes right-branching structure into",

        "left-branching structure.",
        "Recognition using this transformed grammar, extracted from a transformed corpus, is similar to recognition using a left-corner parsing strategy (Aho and Ullman 1972).",
        "This kind of strategy was shown to reduce memory requirements for parsing sentences with mainly left-or right-recursive phrase structure to fewer than seven active or awaited constituent categories (Abney and Johnson 1991).",
        "This is within Miller's (1956) estimate of human short-term memory capacity (if memory elements store individual categories), whereas parsing heavily center-embedded sentences (known to be difficult for human readers) would require seven or more elements at the frontier of this capacity.",
        "But recent research suggests that human memory capacity may be limited to as few as three or four distinct items (Cowan 2001), with longer estimates of seven or more possibly due to the human capacity to chunk remembered items into associated groups (Miller 1956).",
        "The right-corner strategy described in this paper therefore assumes constituent categories can similarly be chunked into incomplete constituents A/B formed by pairing an active category A with an awaited category B somewhere along the active category's right progeny (so, for example, a transitive verb may become an incomplete constituent VP/NP consisting of an active verb phrase lacking an awaited noun phrase yet to come).",
        "These chunked incomplete constituent categories A and B are naturally related through fixed contiguous phrase structure between them, established during the course of parsing prior to the beginning of B, and these incomplete constituents can be composed with other incomplete constituents B/C to form similarly related category pairs A/C.",
        "These chunks are not only contiguous sections of phrase structure trees, they also have contiguous string yields, so they correspond to the familiar notion of text chunks used in shallow parsing approaches (Hobbs et al.",
        "1996).",
        "For example, a hypothesized memory store may contain incomplete constituents S/NP (a sentence without a noun phrase), followed by NP/NN (a noun phrase lacking a common noun), with corresponding string yields demand for bonds propped up and the municipal, respectively, forming a complete contiguous segmentation of a sentence at any point in processing.",
        "Although these two chunks could be composed into an incomplete constituent S/NN, doing so at this point would close off the possibility of introducing another constituent between these two, containing the recognized noun phrase as a left child (e.g., demand for bonds propped up [NP [NP the municipal bonds]'s prices]).",
        "This conception of chunking applied to right-branching progeny in phrase structure trees does not have the power to eliminate the bounds of a memory store, however.",
        "In a larger cognitive model, syntactic processing is assumed to occur as part of an interactive semantic interpretation process, in which referents of constituents are calculated as these constituents are recognized, and are used to constrain subsequent processing decisions (Tanenhaus et al.",
        "1995; Brown-Schmidt, Campana, and Tanenhaus 2002).The chunked category pairs A and B in these incomplete constituents A/B result from successful compositions of other such constituents earlier in the recognition process, which means that the relationshipbetween the referents of A and B is known and fixed",
        "7 Incomplete constituents may also be defined through a left-corner transform, but left-corner transformed categories are incomplete in the other direction – a goal category yet to come lacking an already-recognized constituent – so stored incomplete constituent categories resulting from a left-corner transform would have the character of future goal events, rather than remembered past events.",
        "This is discussed in greater detail in Section 4.4.",
        "8 This can be implemented in a time-series model by factoring the model to include additional random variables over referents, as described in Schuler, Wu, and Schwartz (2009).",
        "in any hypothesized incomplete constituent.",
        "But syntactic and semantic relationships between chunks in a hypothesized memory store are unspecified.",
        "Chunking beyond the level of incomplete constituents would therefore involve grouping referents whose interrelations have not necessarily been established by the parser.",
        "Because the set of referents is presumably much larger than the set of syntactic categories, one may assume there are real barriers to reliably chunking them in the absence of these fixed relationships.",
        "There certainly may be cases where syntactically unconnected referents (belonging to different incomplete constituents) could be grouped together as chunks.",
        "But for simplicity, this article will assume a very strict condition that only a single incomplete constituent can be stored in each short-term memory element.",
        "Experimental results described in Section 5 suggest that a vast majority of English sentences can be recognized within these human-like memory bounds, even with this strict condition on chunking.",
        "If parsing can be performed in bounded memory under such strict conditions, it can reasonably be assumed to operate at least as well under more permissive circumstances, where some amount of syntactically-unrelated referential chunking is allowed.",
        "Several existing incremental systems are organized around a left-corner parsing strategy (Roark 2001; Henderson 2004).",
        "But these systems generally keeplarge numbers of constituents open for modifier attachment in each hypothesis.",
        "This allows modifiers to be attached as right children of any such open constituent.",
        "But if any number of open constituents are allowed, then either the assumption that stored elements have fixed syntactic (and semantic) internal structure will be violated, or the assumption that syntax operates within a bounded memory store will be violated, both of which are psy-cholinguistically attractive as simplifying assumptions.",
        "The HHMM model described in this article upholds both the fixed-element and bounded-memory assumptions by hypothesizing fixed reductions of right child constituents into incomplete parents in the same memory element, to make room for new constituents that may be introduced at a later time.",
        "These in-element reductions are defined naturally on phrase structure trees as the result of aligning right-corner transformed constituent structures to sequences of random variables in a factored time-series model.",
        "The success of this predictive strategy in corpus-based coverage and accuracy results described in Sections 5 and 6 suggests that it may be plausible as a cognitive model.",
        "Other accounts may model reductions in bounded memory as occurring as soon as possible, by maintaining the option of undoing them when necessary (Stevenson 1998).",
        "This seems unattractive in the context of an interactive semantic model, however, where syntactic constituents and semantic referents are composed in tandem, because potentially very rich referential constraints introduced by composing a child constituent into a parent would have to be systematically undone.",
        "An interesting possibility might be that the appearance of syntactic restructuring may arise from a collection of hypothesized stores of syntactically fixed incomplete constituents, pursued in parallel.",
        "The results presented in this article suggest that this mechanism is possible, but these two possibilities might be very difficult to distinguish empirically.",
        "There is also a tradition of defining incomplete constituents as head-driven – introduced in parsing only at the point in incremental recognition at which they can be associated with a head word (Gibson 1991: Pritcher 1991: Gorrell 1995).",
        "In typically head-initial languages such as English, incomplete constituents derived from these head-driven models resemble those derived from a right-corner transform.",
        "But head-driven incomplete constituents do not appear to obey general-purpose memory bounds in head-final languages such as Japanese, and do not appear to obey attachment preferences predicted by a head-driven account (Kamide and Mitchell 1999), favoring a pre-head attachment account, as a right-corner transform would predict."

      "heading": "7. Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "This article has described a model of human syntactic processing that recognizes complete phrase structure trees using only a small store of memory elements of limited complexity.",
        "Sequences of hypothesized contents of this memory store can be mapped to and from conventional phrase structure trees using a reversible right-corner transform.",
        "If this syntactic processing model is combined with a bounded-memory interpreter (Schuler, Wu, and Schwartz 2009), however, allowing the contents of this store to be incrementally interpreted within the same bounded memory, it stands to reason that complete, explicit phrase structure trees would not need to be constructed at any time in processing, in keeping with experimental results showing similar lack of retention of words and syntactic structure during human processing (Sachs 1967; Jarvella 1971).",
        "Initial results show the use of a memory store consisting of only three to four memory elements within this framework provides nearly complete coverage of the Penn Treebank Switchboard and WSJ corpora, consistent with recent estimates of generalpurpose short-term memory capacity.",
        "This suggests that, unlike some earlier models, the hypothesis that human sentence processing uses general-purpose short-term",
        "15 Although, if most competing analyses are unconscious, they would be difficult to detect.",
        "Formally, the competing pockets of activation hypothesized in a parallel-processing version of this model could be arbitrarily small and numerous, but it seems unlikely that very small pockets of activation would persist for very long (just as low probability analyses would be unlikely to remain on the HHMM beam).",
        "This possibility is discussed in the particle filter account of Levy (2008).",
        "memory to store incomplete constituents, as defined by a right-corner transform, does not seem to substantially underestimate human processing capacity.",
        "Moreover, despite additional predictions that must take place within this model to manage parsing in such close quarters, preliminary accuracy results for an unlexicalized, un-smoothed version of this model, using only a four-element memory store, show close to 84% recall and precision on the standard parsing evaluation.",
        "This result is comparable to that reported for state-of-the-art cubic-time parsers (with no constant bounds on processing storage) using similar configurations of conditioning information, namely, without lexicalization or smoothing.",
        "This model does not attempt to derive processing difficulties from memory bounds, following evidence that garden path and center-embedding processing difficulties are caused by interference or local probability estimates rather than encounters with memory capacity limits.",
        "But this does not mean that memory store capacity and probabilistic explanations of processing difficulty are completely independent.",
        "Probability estimation seems likely to be dependent on structural information from the memory store (for example, incomplete object relative clauses seem to be very improbable in the context of other incomplete object relative clauses).",
        "As hypotheses use more elements in the memory store, the distribution over these hypotheses will tend to become broader, taxing the reservoir of activation capacity, and making it more likely for low probability hypotheses to disappear, increasing the incidence of garden path errors.",
        "Further investigations into how the memory store elements are allocated in various syntactic contexts may allow these apparently disparate dimensions of processing capacity to be unified.",
        "The model described here may be promising as an engineering tool as well.",
        "But to achieve competitive performance with unconstrained state-of-the-art parsers will require the development of additional approximation algorithms beyond the scope of this article.",
        "This is because most modern parsers are lexicalized, incorporating headword dependencies into parsing decisions, and employing finely tuned smoothing and backoff techniques to integrate these potentially sparse headword dependencies with denser unlexicalized models.",
        "The bounded-memory right-corner HHMM described in this article can also be lexicalized in this way, but because head word dependencies are most straightforwardly defined in terms of top-down PCFG-like dependency structures, this lexicalization requires the introduction of additional formal machinery to transform PCFG probabilities into right-corner form (Schuler 2009).",
        "In other words, rather than transforming a training set of trees and mapping them to a time series model, it is necessary to transform a consistent probabilistically weighted grammar (in some sense, an infinite set of trees) into appropriately weighted and consistent right-corner PCFG and HHMM models.",
        "This requires the introduction of an approximate inference algorithm, similar to that used in value iteration (Bellman 1957), which estimates probabilities of infinite left-recursive or right-recursive chains by exploiting the fact that increasingly longer chains of events contribute exponentially decreasing probability mass.",
        "On top of this, preserving headword dependencies in incremental processing also requires the introduction of a framework for storing head words of modifier constituents that precede the head word of a parent constituent; including some mechanism to ensure that probability assignments are fairly distributed among competing hypotheses (e.g., by marginalizing over possible head words) in cases where the calculation of accurate dependency probabilities must be deferred until the head word of the parent constituent is encountered.",
        "For these reasons, a complete lexicalized model is considered beyond the scope of this article, and is left for future work.",
