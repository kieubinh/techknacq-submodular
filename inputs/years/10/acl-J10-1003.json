        "In the last decade, automatic text summarization has become a popular research topic with a curiously restricted scope of applications.A few innovative research directions have emerged, including headline generation (Soricut and Marcu 2007), summarization of books (Mihalcea and Ceylan 2007), personalized summarization (Diaz and Gervas 2007), generation of tables-of-contents (Branavan, Deshpande, and Barzilay 2007), summarization of speech (Fuentes et al.2005), dialogues (Zechner 2002), evaluative text (Carenini, Ng, and Pauls 2006), and biomedical documents (Reeve, Han, and Brooks 2007).In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive summarization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; Nomoto 2007; McDonald 2006).By and large, however, most research in text summarization still revolves around texts characterized by rigid structure.The better explored among such texts are news articles (Barzilay and McKeown 2005), medical documents (Elhadad et al.2005), legal documents (Moens 2007), and papers in the area of computer science (Teufel and Moens 2002; Mei and Zhai 2008).Although summarizing these genres is a formidable challenge in itself, it excludes a continually increasing number of informal documents available electronically.",
        "Such documents, ranging from novels to personal Web pages, offer a wealth of information that merits the attention of the text summarization community.",

        "Submission received: 3 April 2007; revised submission received: 20 January 2009; accepted for publication: 29 July 2009.",
        "We attempt to make a step in this direction by devising an approach to summarizing a relatively unexplored genre: literary short stories.",
        "Well-structured documents, such as news articles, exhibit a number of characteristics that help identify some of the important passages without performing in-depth semantic analysis.These characteristics include predictable location of typical items in a document and in its well-delineated parts, cue words, and template-like structure that often characterizes a genre (e.g., scientific papers).",
        "This is not the case in literature.",
        "Quite the contrary â€“ to write fiction in accordance with a template is a sure way to write poor prose.One also cannot expect to find portions of text that summarize the main idea behind a story, and even less so to find them in the same location.In addition, the variety of literary devices (the widespread use of metaphor and figurative language, leaving things unsaid and relying on the reader's skill of reading between the lines, frequent use of dialogue, etc.)",
        "makes summarizing fiction a very distinct task.",
        "It is a contribution of this work to demonstrate that summarizing short fiction is feasible using state-of-the-art tools in natural language technology.In the case of our corpus, this is also done without deep semantic resources or knowledge bases, although such resources would be of great help.We leverage syntactic information and shallow semantics (provided by a gazetteer) to produce indicative summaries of short stories that people find helpful and that outperform naive baselines and two state-of-the-art generic summarizers.",
        "We have restricted the scope of this potentially vast project in several ways.In the course of this work we concentrate on producing summaries of short stories suitable for a particular purpose: to help a reader form adequate expectations about the complete story and decide whether she would be interested in reading it.To this end, the summary includes important elements of the setting of a story, such as the place and the main characters, presented as excerpts from the complete story.The assumption behind this definition is this: If a reader knows when and where the story takes place and who its main characters are, she should be able to make informed decisions about it.",
        "With such a definition of short story summaries, retelling the plot in the summary is not among the objectives of this work; in fact, doing so is undesirable.We have introduced this limitation for two reasons.There is an \"ideological\" side of the decision: Not many people want to know what happens in a story before reading it, even if this may help them decide that the story is worth reading.There also is a practical side, namely the complexity of the problem: Summarizing the plot would be considerably more difficult (see Section 2 for a review of related work).We hope to tackle this issue in the future.For now, creating indicative summaries of short stories is challenge enough.",
        "The summaries in Figures 1-3 illustrate our approach in the context of a naive lead baseline and a ceiling.Figure 1 shows an example of an automatically produced summary that meets the aforementioned criteria.A reader can see that the story is set in a restaurant where the customers are tended to by two waitresses: the fair Aileen who \"wins hearts\" and \"the-bag-o'-meal\" plain-faced Tildy.",
        "If the reader chooses to pursue the story, she will find the description of an accident of paramount importance to Tildy: One day she is kissed by a customer in public!",
        "The event is more than flattering to usually under-appreciated Tildy.It causes a complete change in how she views herself.",
        "The story then unfolds to reveal that the customer was drunk on the day in question and that he returned to apologize several days later.This apology is a severe blow to Tildy and an abrupt end of many a dream that the incident had spurred in her head.The story ends with Aileen trying to comfort her crying friend by saying \"He ain't anything",

        "During the second evaluative experiment, the machine-made summaries are compared against extracts created by people using sentence co-selection measures (precision, recall, and F-score).By sentence co-selection we mean measuring how many sentences found in manually created extracts are selected for inclusion in automatically produced summaries.The results suggest that our system outperforms all baselines, including state-of-the-art summarizers.",

        "Summarization of literary prose is a relatively unexplored topic.There exists, however, a substantial body of research tackling the problem of story comprehension.During the 1970s and 1980s, a number of researchers in artificial intelligence built story-understanding systems that relied in one way or another on contemporary research in psychology and discourse processing.",
        "Much of that line of research relied on an assumption that stories exhibit global cognitive structure (known as macrostructure [van Dijk 1980] or schema [Bartlett 1932]) and that they can be decomposed into a finite number of cognitive units.According to this view, diversity in stories is not due to an infinite number of plots, but to an infinite number of combinations of a (relatively) small number of cognitive units.This direction was pioneered in 1928 by Vladimir Propp (1968) with his detailed analysis of 100 Russian folk tales.After a period of oblivion, these ideas regained popularity: van Dijk and Kintsch (1978) demonstrated the existence of macrostructures and their role in story comprehension and recall; Rumelhart (1975), Thorndyke (1975), and Mandler",
        "2 These systems are GISTexter (Harabagiu, Hickl, and Lacatusu 2007) and CLASSY (Schlesinger, O'Leary, and Conroy 2008; Conroy, Schlesinger, and O'Leary 2007).See Section 6 for details.",
        "(1987) developed sets of cognitive schemas (story grammars) that could be applied to certain types of stories; and Lehnert (1982) proposed to represent action-based stories in terms of a finite number of plot units â€“ configurations of affect (or emotional) states of its characters.",
        "The developments in psychology and discourse processing had gone hand in hand with those in artificial intelligence and resulted in a score of story-understanding and question-answering systems.Many of these relied on a set of manually encoded schemas and chose the most appropriate one for a given story (Cullingford 1978; Dyer 1983; Leake 1989).For example, a system called BORIS (Dyer 1983) processed stories word-by-word to create a very rich semantic representation of them using Memory Organization Packets (MOPs) and Thematic Affect Units (TAUs).These knowledge structures were activated by means of a very detailed lexicon where each lexeme was associated with MOPs and TAUs it could invoke.",
        "Systems such as BORIS could not process stories that did not conform to schemas already at their disposal.Charniak and Goldman (1988) and Norvig (1989) attempted to circumvent this problem by learning to recognize more general structures.",
        "FAUSTUS (Norvig 1989) recognized six general classes of inferences by finding patterns of connectivity in a semantic network.It could be adapted to new kinds of documents by extending its knowledge base and not the underlying algorithm or patterns.Research in automatic story comprehension offered a number of important solutions for subsequent developments in artificial intelligence.No less important, it pointed out a number of challenges.All these systems required a formidable amount of semantic knowledge and a robust and efficient way of building a semantic representation of texts.In addition, systems such as BORIS or SAM (Cullingford 1978) also needed a set of schemas or schema-like scenarios.With such labor intensity, these requirements prohibit using schema-based approaches for real-life stories (e.g., fiction) and only allow the processing of artificially created examples.",
        "In this historical context, our current approach to summarization of short fiction appears rather modest: Our system does not \"understand\" stories, nor does it retell their plot.Instead, it offers the reader hints â€“ important information about the story's setting â€“ which should help her guess what type of story is to come.This assumption appears reasonable because it has been shown that comprehension and recall of discourse are strongly influenced by the reader's familiarity with the type of schema (van Dijk and Kintsch 1978).Because our system is tailored to work with classics of the genre, it was our expectation that the gist of the story's setting offered to the reader in the wording of the original would give her an idea about the story's themes and likely plot developments.The results of our experiments appear to back this assumption.",
        "In addition, given the original objective, it seems reasonable that elements other than the plot would have a strong influence on the reader's decision to read or not to read the story.The setting of the story, its characters, and style are some of the important factors.Many outstanding literary works differ not so much in plot as in their setting or moral.",
        "Our system attempts to capture important elements of the setting explicitly and we expect that some elements of style may be captured implicitly due to the extractive nature of the summaries.",
        "3 Consider, for example, Goethe's Faust and Bulgakov's Master and Margarita.Although they both revolve around the protagonist entering into a pact with the devil â€“ albeit for different reasons â€“ the latter takes place in Moscow around 1930s and the two works are dramatically different."

        "We employed the GATE Gazetteer (Cunningham et al.2002), and only considered entities it recognized automatically.",

        "Each annotator is asked to read 10 short stories and to select 6% of sentences that, in their opinion, constitute a good indicative summary.In this manner three people annotate each story of the test set for summary-worthy sentences.We used their annotations as a gold standard and compared the machine-made summaries against them.In addition, we used the same gold standard and metrics to evaluate the quality of two baseline summaries and of two summaries produced by state-of-the art summarization systems.",
        "Conditions to be tested.",
        "The purpose of the experiment is defined as measuring how many sentences found in our system's summaries and the baseline summaries occur in the extractive summaries created by the human annotators.We are also interested in finding out whether our summarizer outperforms the trivial baseline algorithms and the existing state-of-the-art summarizers fine-tuned to summarizing newswire.",
        "Baselines.",
        "In order to evaluate our summarizer comparatively, we defined two naive baselines and a ceiling.Intuitively, when a person wishes to decide whether to read a book, she opens it and flips through several pages at the beginning.Imitating this process, we computed a simple lead baseline consisting of the first 6% of the sentences in a story.The second baseline consists of 6% of sentences of the story selected at random.",

        "It is also necessary to see whether our genre-specific approach shows any improvements over the existing generic state-of-the-art systems put to work on fiction.To this end, we compared our summarizer with two systems that were top performers in the Document Understanding Conference (henceforth DUC) 2007, the annual \"competition\" for automatic summarizers.In DUC competitions the summarization systems are evaluated on a variety of metrics: manually assigned scores (ranking readability, grammaticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity, focus, and coherence), the pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau 2004), and ROUGE scores (Lin 2004).There is no unified ranking of the systems' performance, and selecting the best summarizer is not straightforward.We chose two systems among the top performers in DUC 2007 â€“ GISTexter (Harabagiu, Hickl, and Lacatusu 2007) and CLASSY (Schlesinger, O'Leary, and Conroy 2008; Conroy, Schlesinger, and O'Leary 2007).GISTexter appears to be the best summarizer according to the scores assigned by the human judges.Apart from baselines, it is consistently ranked as the best or the second-best system on most characteristics evaluated by the judges (the only exception is non-redundancy where GISTexter is ranked eighth).CLASSY, on the other hand, is one of the four top systems according to ROUGE scores.The scores it received from the human judges are also quite good.",

        "No adjustments were made to either system to make them more suitable for summarizing stories.Therefore, the comparison is not wholly fair, but â€“ in the absence of systems similar to ours â€“ it was the only possibility to compare our summarizer with the state-of-the-art in the community and to verify whether genre-specific methods are useful in summarizing fiction.",

        "Recall measured on the basis of the intersection gold standard says how many of the most important sentences are included in summaries produced by the system (sentences selected by all three judges are likely to be the most important ones).All summaries are compared against each gold-standard summary using precision (P), recall (R), and equally-weighted F-score (F).",

        "We presented an approach to summarizing literary short stories.The text summarization community has not yet seriously explored this genre, except for early seminal work on story understanding.In contrast with the story-understanding systems proposed in the 1970s and 1980s, our system does not require labor-intensive semantic resources â€“ knowledge-bases and schemas â€“ and it works on real-life stories, namely, short fiction.",
        "The summaries that the system produces, limited in scope, are intended to help readers form adequate expectations about the original story.We have demonstrated that such summaries can be produced without deep semantic resources, only relying on syntax and the information about important entities in the story.According to the judges who evaluated the summaries, our summaries are somewhat useful for their original purpose, even if their quality falls far short of the quality of manual abstracts.",
        "Our summaries appear better than the naive baselines and than two state-of-the-art summarizers fine-tuned for working with newswire.",
        "In the course of this work we have made a number of observations about automatic summarization of short stories.First of all, we confirmed informally that characters tend to be a central element of short fiction.Character mentions provide a wealth of information that can be leveraged in automatic summarization.This finding was also reflected in the approach proposed by Lehnert (1982).In addition, it appears that position in text is important, as can be seen from the analysis of the usefulness of features in Section 5.3.",
        "Besides, relatively high performance of the lead baselines also suggests that position in text is a good indicator of salience, even though it plays a lesserrolethaninmorestructureddocuments.",
        "We view this work as a small step towards creating tools for searching, summarizing, and otherwise processing fiction available electronically.",
        "The current system accomplishes with some success a limited task of producing indicative summaries or short stories, but much more work is needed to create high-quality flexible summaries of literary works suitable for more than one purpose.Perhaps the most obvious extension to the current system would be summarizing the plot of short stories.Although this is not useful given our original criterion (forming adequate expectations about the story, without \"spoilers\"), the ability to handle plot would allow the creation of different types of summaries.We also hope to explore the possibility of establishing structure within stories: Knowing that certain portions of a story lay out the setting while others describe events or the culmination would be a significant step towards better summarization.",
        "Evaluation of summaries of literary work is yet another dimension of the task that needs to be considered.We have concentrated thus far on summary production rather than on establishing the criteria that define the quality of the summary.",
        "Evaluation of summaries remains an issue even where well-structured factual documents are concerned.In fiction, it is far less clear what contributes towards the quality of the summary: The facts, for instance, are likely to be less important than in scientific papers or news items.Other candidate qualities may include closeness to the language or the tone of the original story, the information about the author, the time period, or ideology behind a certain work of fiction.This remains an open question, the answer to which may well lie outside the field of computational linguistics.",
