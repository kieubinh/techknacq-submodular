        "The noisy channel model has been the foundation of standard models in speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983) and machine translation (Brown et al.",

        "In this article we explore its application to WSD.",
        "The noisy channel model can be used whenever a signal received does not uniquely identify the message being sent.",
        "Bayes' Law is used to interpret the ambiguous signal and identify the most probable intended message.",
        "In WSD, we model each context as a distinct channel where the intended message is a word sense (or semantic class) S, and the signal received is an ambiguous word W. In this section we will describe how to model a given context C as a noisy channel, and in particular how to estimate the context-specific sense distribution without using any sense-tagged data.",
        "Equation (1) expresses the probability ofa sense S ofword W in a given context C. This is the well-known Bayes' formula with an extra P(.|C) in each term indicating the dependence on the context.",
        "To perform WSD we need to find the sense S that maximizes the probability P(S| W, C).",
        "This is equivalent to the maximization ofthe product P(W|S, C)P(S|C) because the denominator P(W| C) does not depend on S. To perform the maximization, the two distributions P(W| S, C)andP(S| C) need to be estimated for each context C.",
        "The main challenge is to estimate P(S| C), the distribution ofword senses that can be expressed in the given context.",
        "In unsupervised WSD we do not have access to any sense-tagged data, thus we do not know what senses are likely to be expressed in any given context.",
        "Therefore it is not possible to estimate P(S| C)directly.",
        "What we do have is the word frequencies for each sense P(W| S), and the word frequencies for the given context P(W|C).",
        "We use the WordNet sense frequencies to estimate P(W| S) and a statistical language model to estimate P(W| C) as detailed in Section 2.3.",
        "We make the independence assumption P(W|S, C) = P(W|S), that is, the distribution ofwords used to express a particular sense is the same for all contexts.",

        "We focus on the disambiguation of nouns for several reasons.",

        "As we suspected, the relationship is not simple or monotonic.",
        "However, one can identify distinct peaks at 3, 25, and 100-150 semantic classes.",
        "One hypothesis is that these peaks correspond to \"natural classes\" at different levels of granularity.",

        "To test the out-of-sample effect of tuning the semantic classes based on the peaks ofFigure 3, we used the SemEval-2007 data set as our test sample.",
        "When the 135 semantic classes from the highest peak are used for the disambiguation of the nouns in the SemEval-2007 data set, an accuracy of69.8% was achieved.",

        "Discussion",
        "In this section we will address several questions raised by the results ofthe experiments.",
        "Why do we get different results from different data sets?",
        "Are the best results significantly different than the first-sense baseline?",
        "Can we improve our results using better semantic classes?",
        "5.1 Why Do We Get Different Results from Different Data Sets?",
        "Table 5 summarizes our results from the three experiments of Section 4.",
        "There are some significant differences between the data sets.",
        "Result summary for the three data sets.",
        "The columns give the data set, the results of the three experiments, best reported result, the first-sense baseline, and the number ofinstances.",
        "The SemEval-2007 data set appears to be significantly different from the other two with its generally lower baseline and scores.",
        "The difference in accuracy is probably due to the difference in data preparation.",
        "In the two Senseval data sets all content words were targeted for disambiguation.",
        "In the SemEval-2007 data set only verbs and their noun arguments were selected, targeting only about 465 lemmas from about 3,500 words oftext.",
        "For the Senseval-3 data set none ofour results, or any published result we know of, is significantly above the baseline for noun disambiguation.",
        "This may be due to extra noise in the data – the inter-annotator agreement for nouns in this data set was 74.9%.",
        "5.2 Are the Best Results Significantly Different Than the FSB?",
        "Among all the published results for these three data sets, our two results for the Senseval-2 data set and the top supervised result for the Senseval-2 data set are the only ones statistically significantly above the FSB for noun disambiguation at the 95% confidence interval.",
        "This is partly because ofthe lack ofsufficient data.",
        "For example, the SemEval-2007 data set has only 159 nouns; and a result of71.8% would be needed to demonstrate a difference from the baseline of 64.2% at the 95% confidence interval.",
        "More importantly, however, statistical significance should not be confused with \"significance\" in general.",
        "A statistically significant difference may not be necessary or sufficient for a significant impact on an application.",
        "Even a WSD system that is statistically indistinguishable from the baseline according to the \"total accuracy\" metric is most probably providing significantly different answers compared to always guessing the first sense.",
        "There are metrics that can reveal these differences, such as \"balanced error rate\" (i.e., arithmetic average of the error rates for different senses) or \"accuracy in detecting the use ofa non-dominant sense.\"",
        "Finally, the relatively high first-sense baseline (e.g., 71.0% for Senseval-3 nouns) combined with the relatively low inter-annotator agreement (e.g., 74.9% for Senseval-3 nouns) makes progress in the traditional WSD task difficult.",
        "Annotators who are perfectly proficient in comprehending language nevertheless find it difficult to distinguish between artificially-created dictionary senses.",
        "Ifour long term goal is to model human competence in language comprehension, it would make sense to focus on tasks at which humans are naturally competent.",
        "Dictionary-independent tasks such as lexical substitution or textual entailment may be the right steps in this direction.",
        "5.3 Can We Improve Our Results Using Better Semantic Classes?",
        "In order to get an upper bound for our approach, we searched for the best set of semantic classes specific to each data set using the following greedy algorithm.",

        "4.",
        "Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the WSD accuracy can no longer be improved.",
        "Algorithm 4 was run for each of the three data sets, which resulted in three different sets ofsemantic classes.",
        "The noisy channel model was applied with the best set of semantic classes for each data set.",
        "Table 6 summarizes the results.",
        "Note that these results are not predictive ofout-of-sample accuracy because Algorithm 4 picks a specific set of semantic classes optimal for a given data set.",
        "But the results do indicate that a better set ofsemantic classes may lead to significantly better WSD accuracy.",
        "In particular each result in Table 6 is significantly higher than previously reported supervised or unsupervised results.",

        "2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004; Agirre, Marquez, and Wicentowski 2007) are good sources ofrecent work, and have been used in this article to benchmark our results.",
        "Generative models based on the noisy channel framework have previously been used for speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983), machine translation (Brown et al.",
        "1990), question answering (Echihabi and Marcu 2003), spelling correction (Brill and Moore 2000), and document compression (Daumé III and Marcu 2002) among others.",
        "To our knowledge our work is the first application ofthe noisy channel model to unsupervised word sense disambiguation.",
        "Using statistical language models based on large corpora for WSD has been explored in Yuret (2007) and Hawker (2007).",
        "For specific modeling techniques used in this article see Yuret (2008); for a more general review of statistical language modeling see Chen and Goodman (1999), Rosenfeld (2000), and Goodman (2001).",
        "Grouping similar senses into semantic classes for WSD has been explored in previous work.",
        "Senses that are similar have been identified using WordNet relations (Peters, Peters, and Vossen 1998; Crestan, El-Beze, and De Loupy 2001; Kohomban and Lee 2005), discourse domains (Magnini et al.",
        "2003), annotator disagreements (Chklovski and Mihalcea 2003), and other lexical resources such as Roget (Yarowsky 1992), LDOCE (Dolan 1994), and ODE (Navigli 2006).",

        "Table 2 gives our supersense score as 78% for Senseval-3 nouns.",
        "However, the results are not directly comparable because they do not report the noun and verb scores separately or calculate the corresponding fine-grained score to compare with other Senseval-3 results.",
        "Kohomban and Lee (2007) go beyond the WordNet categories based on lexicographer files and experiment with clustering techniques to construct their semantic classes.",
        "Their classes are based on local features from sense-labeled data and optimize feature-class coherence rather than adhering to the WordNet hierarchy.",

        "7.",
        "Contributions",
        "We have introduced a new generative probabilistic model based on the noisy channel framework for unsupervised word sense disambiguation.",
        "The main contribution of this model is the reduction ofthe word sense disambiguation problem to the estimation of two distributions: the distribution ofwords used to express a given sense, and the distribution ofwords that appear in a given context.",
        "In this framework, context similarity is determined by the distribution ofwords that can be placed in the given context.",
        "This replaces the ad hoc contextual feature design process by a statistical language model, allowing the advances in language modeling and the availability oflarge unlabeled corpora to have a direct impact on WSD performance.",
        "We have provided a detailed analysis ofusing coarse-grained semantic classes for fine-grained WSD.",
        "The noisy channel model is a good fit for class-based WSD, where the model decides on a coarse-grained semantic class instead ofa fine-grained sense.",
        "The chosen semantic class is then mapped to a specific sense based on the WordNet ordering during evaluation.",
        "We show that the potential loss from using coarse-grained classes is limited, and state-of-the-art performance is possible using only a few semantic classes.",
        "We explore semantic classes at various levels ofgranularity and show that the relationship between granularity and fine-grained accuracy is complex, thus more work is needed to determine an ideal set ofsemantic classes.",
        "In several experiments we compare the performance of our unsupervised WSD system with the best systems from previous Senseval and SemEval workshops.",
        "We consistently outperform any previously reported unsupervised results and achieve comparable performance to the best supervised results.",
        "To solve forP(S|C) using P(W|C)and P(W|S), we represent the first two as vectors: Sj – P(S – jC – k)and w( – P(W – ilC – k), and the last one as a matrix: WSj – P(W – ilS – j).",
        "Our problem becomes finding a solution to the linear equation w – WS x s. Using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, WS+,wefind asolution s – WS+ x w.This solution minimizes the distance |WS x s – w|.",
        "There are two potential problems with this pseudoinverse solution.",
        "First, it may violate the non-negativity and normalization constraints ofa probability distribution.",
        "Second, a maximum likelihood estimate should minimize the cross entropy between WS x s and w, not the Euclidean distance.",
        "We addressed the normalization problem using a constrained linear solver and the cross-entropy problem using numerical optimization.",
        "However, our experiments showed the difference in WSD performance to be less than 1% in each case.",
        "The pseudoinverse solution, s – WS+ x w, can be computed quickly and works well in practice, so this is the solution that is used in all our experiments.",
        "Estimating P(W|C) for each context is expensive because the number of words that need to be considered is large.",
        "The Web 1T data set contains 13.5 million unique words, and WordNet defines about 150,000 lemmas.",
        "To make the computation feasible we needed to limit the set ofwords for which P(W|C) needs to be estimated.",
        "We limited our set to WordNet lemmas with the same part ofspeech as the target word.",
        "We further required the word to have a non-zero count in WordNet sense frequencies.",
        "The inflection and capitalization ofeach word W was automatically matched to the target word.",
        "As a result, we estimated P(W|C) for about 10,000 words for each noun context and assumed the other words had zero probability.",
        "The n-grams required for all the contexts were listed, and their counts were extracted from the Web 1T data set in one pass.",
        "The P( W|C) was estimated for all the words and contexts based on these counts.",
        "In the end, we only used the 100 most likely words in each context for efficiency, as the difference in results using the whole distribution was not significant.",
        "For more details on smoothing with a large language model see Yuret (2008), although we did not see a significant difference in WSD performance based on the smoothing method used.",
