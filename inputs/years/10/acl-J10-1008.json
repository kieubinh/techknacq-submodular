        "We simply must excel.",

        "There is no room for that in our line of work.",
        "This already sounds dismal, but it gets worse.",
        "People have come to equate every negative result with failure.",
        "Suppose you have set up an experiment carefully and in good faith, but still it comes up short.",
        "That's not a positive outcome.",
        "Maybe your intuition has let you down.",
        "Maybe this cannot work.",

        "They could not prove it: they failed.",
        "But – their null result prompted a line of research which culminated in the theory of special relativity."
