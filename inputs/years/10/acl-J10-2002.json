        "Readability assessment is an important NLP issue with much application in the domain of language education.",
        "The capability to automatically judge the readability of a text would greatly help language teachers and learners, who currently spend a great deal of time skimming through texts looking for a text at an appropriate reading level.",
        "Substantial previous work has been done over the past decades (Klare 1963, DuBay 2004a, 2004b).",
        "Early work generated measures based on simple text statistics by assuming that these reflect the text reading level.",
        "For example, Kincaid, Fishburne, and Rodgers (1975) assumed that the lengths of words and sentences represent their respective difficulty.",
        "Chall and Dale (1995) used a manually constructed list of words assumed to capture the difficulty of vocabulary.",
        "These measures are easy to use but difficult to apply to languages other than English, because some features, such as word length, are specific to alphabetic writing.",
        "Such methods, however, do not compete with recent methods based on more sophisticated handling of language statistics.",
        "Collins-Thompson and Callan (2004) proposed a classification model by constructing different language models for different school grades (Si and Callan 2001), and Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) applied a support vector machine (SVM).",
        "Both of these methods outperform classical methods and are less language-dependent.",
        "These new methods, however, have a serious problem when implementation is attempted for multiple languages: the lack of training corpora.",
        "Large amounts of training data annotated with 12 school grades have not been at all easy to obtain on a reasonable scale.",
        "Another possibility might have been to manually construct such training data,",

        "Submission received: 7 October 2008; revised submission received: 17 September 2009; accepted for publication: 19 December 2009.",
        "but humans are generally unable to precisely judge the level of a given text among 12 arbitrary levels.",
        "The corpora therefore have to be constructed from academic texts used in schools.",
        "The amount of such data, however, is limited, and its use is usually strictly limited by copyrights.",
        "Thus, it is crucial to devise a new method or approach that allows readability assessment by using only generally available corpora, such as newspapers.",
        "Given a single text, it is hard to attribute an absolute readability level from among 12 levels, but given two texts, there should be a better chance of judging which of them is more difficult.",
        "This intuition led to the new model presented in this article.",
        "Our idea is based on sorting, which is implemented in two stages:",
        "• A comparator is generated by an SVM.",
        "This comparator judges the relative readability of two given texts.",
        "• Given a set of texts, the texts are sorted by the comparator with a sorting algorithm.",
        "In our case, we used a robust binary insertion sort, as explained in further detail later in this article.",
        "The first step requires a training corpus, but because the comparator only judges which of two texts is more difficult, the texts of a corpus need only be labeled according to two different levels.",
        "Two sets of texts – one difficult, the other easy – are far easier to obtain than a training corpus annotated for 12 different levels.",
        "Overall, our model of readability thus differs from previous regression or classification models.",
        "Applying this new method, we also present an application, called Terrace, which is a system that retrieves a text with readability similar to that of a given input text.",
        "Terrace was originally motivated by a faculty request made by teachers of multiple foreign languages.",
        "The system currently works for English and Japanese, and the languages will be extended to include Chinese and French.",
        "Note that we do not claim that our model and method is better than existing methods.",
        "Although our method does compete well with previous methods, the classification approach used in any given scenario should remain the most natural, relevant method.",
        "The intention of this article is simply to propose an alternative way of handling readability assessment, especially when adequate training corpora annotated with multiple levels are not available."

        "Readability, in general, describes the ease with which a text document can be read and understood.",
        "Readability is studied in at least two different domains, those of coherence (Barzilay and Lapata 2008) and language learning.",
        "Readability in this article signifies the latter, for both a mother tongue and a second language.",
        "By the 1980s, there were 200 formulas and over a thousand studies published on the readability formulas attesting to their strong theoretical and statistical validity (p. 2).",
        "Every method of readability assessment extracts some features from a text and maps the feature space to some readability norm.",
        "There are the two viewpoints regarding features and the mapping of feature values to readability, and correspondingly there are two kinds of work in this domain.",
        "Regarding the first type, many researchers have reported how various features affect the readability of text in terms of vocabulary, syntax, and discourse relations.",
        "Recently, Pitler and Nenkova (2008) presented an impressive verification of the effects of each kind of feature and found that vocabulary and discourse relations are prominent, although other features are not negligible.",
        "The focus of the current work, however, is not on what feature set to consider, so we use the same features throughout the article, as explained further in Section 3.1.",
        "Rather, the focus of this article is on mapping the extracted feature values to a readability norm.",
        "So far, two models have been used for this: regression and classification.",
        "In regression, readability is given by a score based on a linearly weighted sum of feature values.",
        "Early methods, from the Wannetka formula (Washburne and Vogel 1928), to the recent methods of Flesch-Kincaid (Kincaid, Fishburne, and Rodgers 1975) and Dale-Chall (Chall and Dale 1995), are of this kind.",
        "Elaboration of such regression methods in a more modern context could proceed through a generalized linear model based on estimation of the weights by machine learning, although we have not found such an approach within the literature of readability assessment for language learning.",
        "Our proposal is compared with such an enhanced version of regression in Section 8.",
        "In classification, readability is segmented by academic grades, and the assessment is conducted as a classification task.",
        "The first is implemented by means of statistical classification modeling, as reported in Collins-Thompson and Callan (2004) and Si and Callan (2001).",
        "The authors used a language model (unigrams) and a naive Bayes classifier by presuming different language models for each reading level.",
        "A language model Mi is constructed for each level of readability i by using different corpora for each level.",
        "The readability of a given text T is assessed using the formula L(Mi\\T) = SwgTC(w)logPr(w|Mi), where w denotes a word in text T, C(w) denotes the frequency of w,andPr(w\\ Mi) denotes the probability of w under Mi.",
        "The second is based on an SVM (Schwarm and Ostendorf 2005) and the authors also studied the effect of statistical features, such as n-grams and syntactic features.",
        "In these papers, the readability norms are represented by means of scores and classes of readability.",
        "That is, given a single text, the system assigns a value corresponding to a school grade.",
        "The result is easy to understand, and various applications have been constructed with this type of scoring.",
        "This solution only works, however, when a sufficient amount of training data with annotations regarding multiple levels is provided.",
        "Usually, the availability of training data in readability assessment is limited, even for school grading.",
        "This is due to the inherent difficulty of classifying the readability of a text into 12 grades, making it difficult to uniformly construct a large set of training data.",
        "Moreover, the copyright issue is more serious for academic texts.",
        "Given this situation, when readability assessment is modeled by regression or classification, a research team wanting to apply these previous methods faces the problem of assembling training data, as we did for over a year.",
        "In this article, the readability norm is designed in a completely different way: Given two texts, a comparator judges which is more difficult.",
        "By applying this comparator, a set of texts is sorted.",
        "The readability of a text is assessed by searching for its position",
        "1 We asked the authors of previous studies based on the classification approach to share their training data, but they could not because of the copyright issue.",
        "This is a serious issue in Japanese, as well: These copyrights are more tightly protected than those of normal texts, and publishing companies refused to provide us with electronic files.",
        "We thus had to scan texts and use OCR to obtain the test data utilized in this work.",
        "This experience demonstrates how difficult it is to obtain large-scale training data with multiple levels.",
        "within the sorted texts.",
        "The norm is thus considered as the location of a text among an ordered set of texts.",
        "Our approach linguistically enhances assessment of the readability of a text as the relative ease compared to other texts, not as the absolute difficulty of the text.",
        "The root of this idea has been presented in two articles of which we are aware.",
        "In Inui and Yamamoto (2001), the readability of sentences for deaf people is judged by a comparator generated by an SVM.",
        "In addition, Pitler and Nenkova (2008) presented a comparison of texts in terms of difficulty by using an SVM.",
        "Similarly to what we present in Section 3.1, those authors propose constructing a comparator by using an SVM to compare two sentences or texts with multiple features.",
        "However, neither further applied this approach to obtain readability assessment based on sorting.",
        "Our contribution in this study is therefore that we show how a machine learning method can be used as a comparator and applied to sort texts.",
        "Our method can be situated more generally among machine learning methods for ranking, where the methods learn so that they rank a set of elements given a set of ordered training data.",
        "Various methods have been proposed so far.",
        "In one of the earliest attempts, Cohen, Schapire, and Singer (1998) obtain a function that scores the probability that an element is ranked higher than another, and rank all elements by maximizing the sum of the pairwise probabilities.",
        "In another, Joachims (2002) applies an SVM to rank elements, by devising the input vector by subtraction of feature values.",
        "In more recent studies, such as Xia et al.",
        "(2008), an attempt is made to directly obtain the ranking function for the whole ordered training data, not as a composition of pairwise function application between elements.",
        "Among these methods, our proposal is unique in two ways.",
        "First, none of the previous methods, as far as we know, proposed discretized ranking based on sorting.",
        "Second and most importantly, all previous methods assume the existence of fully ordered training data.",
        "In contrast, as emphasized by our problem described in this section, such training data are difficult to acquire in the readability domain, and we have to devise a method which works even when very limited training data are all that is available.",
        "Our contribution lies in our study of the possibility of using a learning-to-rank method even when learning data are only partially available.",
        "Such an approach can be further considered for learning-to-rank methods in general in future work."

        "In our method, a comparator of the level of difficulty of two texts is generated by using machine learning and then the comparator is applied to sort a set of texts.",
        "The method has two parts:",
        "• construction of the readability relation <,and",
        "• sorting and searching texts by using the relation.",
        "These tasks are explained in the following sections.",
        "3.1 Readability Comparator",
        "The readability comparator is constructed by applying machine learning.",
        "Given texts a, b £ S, where S is a set of texts, feature vectors Va and Vb are constructed.",
        "By applying an operator o, Vab is constructed as Va o Vb.",
        "When Vab is entered into the comparator, the comparator outputs 1 when a > b (i.e., a is more difficult) and 1 when a < b.",
        "Because",
        "Figure 1",
        "Construction of a comparator using an SVM.",
        "the output is binary, we use an SVM to construct the comparator (see Figure 1).",
        "Note that Vab and Vba are not the same.",
        "Reversibility of a feature vector is thus not obvious in our work, but ideally, when the judgment for Vab is 1, that for Vba will be -1.",
        "In terms of constructing a feature vector Va for a text a, substantial features have been proposed (Klare 1963; DuBay 2004a, 2004b; Schwarm and Ostendorf 2005; Pitler and Nenkova 2008).",
        "In this work, we only utilize the most basic features of vocabulary in terms of word frequencies for three reasons.",
        "First, as stated in Section 2, because the focus of this article is not to study the set of features, it is best to set the feature issue aside and use only the most fundamental features.",
        "Even then, there are many viewpoints to be verified, as will be seen in Sections 7-9.",
        "Furthermore, we have to take into account the pros and cons of various features, because naive features only capture coarse, default trends and could degrade performance.",
        "For example, the text length in our data tends to be longer for more difficult texts, thus having a bad influence on short, higher-grade texts and long, lower-grade texts.",
        "Therefore, in this article, we only consider simple features regarding vocabulary.",
        "Second, previous work has argued for the fundamental nature of vocabulary as a factor in readability (Alderson 1984; Laufer 1991; Pitler and Nenkova 2008).",
        "Third, some features other than word frequencies are language-dependent in terms of the writing system, corpus availability, and performance of NLP analysis systems.",
        "For example, average word length, used in the Flesch-Kincaid approach, cannot be applied to Japanese.",
        "Thus, we have focused on features that are available for any language, so that the performance becomes comparable across languages.",
        "The features we use are as follows.",
        "There are two factors within vocabulary: the local and global factors.",
        "The local factor is what words are used and how frequently they appear within a text, whereas the global factor indicates the degree of readability of these words among the overall vocabulary.",
        "Both are considered within this article, as follows:",
        "Local: the frequency of each word divided by the frequency of the number of words in",
        "the text (this is called relative frequency here).",
        "Global: the log frequency of words obtained from a large corpus.",
        "Local frequency is the most basic statistic used in machine learning methods.",
        "Relative frequency is used to avoid the influence of text length, as mentioned above.",
        "Regarding global frequency, psychological studies have shown that every word has a level of familiarity that is fairly commonly understood among people.",
        "For example, the verb meet is more familiar than the verb encounter.",
        "Such levels of familiarity attributed to all words should affect the difficulty levels of texts.",
        "In Chall and Dale (1995), the authors counted the number of words not appearing in a list of the most basic 3,000 words, in order to judge vocabulary difficulty, but the plausibility of such a list is difficult to evaluate and such lists might not exist for languages other than English.",
        "An alternative is to use word lists with familiarity scores, such as the MRC list in English (Database 2006) or the Amano list in Japanese (Amano and Kondo 2000), but such lists are costly to generate and the word coverage is limited.",
        "Instead, we decided to use the log frequency obtained from several terabytes of corpora, because the psychological familiarity score is known to correlate strongly with the log frequency obtained from corpora, as reported in Tanaka-Ishii and Terada (2009) and Amano and Kondo (1995).",
        "Tanaka-Ishii and Terada show that log frequency correlates better for larger corpora.",
        "Thus, as will be explained in Section 6, Web corpora consisting of 6 terabytes for English and 2 terabytes for Japanese – possibly the largest corpora available for the two languages – were used to obtain the log frequencies.",
        "Local and global features are extracted for all words of the two texts a and b to be compared.",
        "The final vector is generated by applying an operator o, such that Vab = Va o Vb.",
        "Two simple possibilities for the operation o are the following:",
        "Concatenation: concatenate Vb's elements after the elements of Va.",
        "Conjunction: produce a new value for the ith element of Vab from the ith elements of Va and Vb by some function.",
        "Typical possibilities for such a function are subtraction and division.",
        "The two possible vectors for Vab are explained by the illustration in Figure 2.",
        "The upper half of the figure shows Vab generated by concatenation.",
        "Because the comparator is",
        "Figure 2",
        "Composition of the vectors fed into the SVM.",
        "constructed by machine learning, the dimension of the vectors is four times the number of word tokens that appear in the training data.",
        "Each kind of word has a location in a vector, which appears four times within Vab: twice in each Va and Vb for local and global features.",
        "The first half denotes Va, and the second half denotes Vb.",
        "In the first half of Va, the vector values are the relative frequencies for words appearing in text a,orzero otherwise.",
        "For the second half of Va, the values are log frequencies measured in a large corpus for the words appearing in a, or zero otherwise.",
        "Vb is constructed in a similar manner, and the two vectors are concatenated.",
        "In contrast, in the case of conjunction, the dimension of the vector remains twice the number of word tokens appearing in the training data, as illustrated in the lower half of Figure 2.",
        "The ith dimension of Vab is calculated as a function of the ith values of Va and Vb.",
        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008) are likely to have used subtraction within their experiment.",
        "For this reason, among various other possible functions for the conjunction of two vector values, we also used subtraction.",
        "Construction of a comparator requires training data.",
        "Because the comparator judges the difficulty between two texts, the training data contains two sets of texts, a set Ld of a relatively difficult level and a set Le of a relatively easy level.",
        "The SVM is trained on a combination of texts taken from Le and Ld.",
        "The training data can combine up to 2 x\\Le\\x\\Ld\\.",
        "For example, if \\Le\\ = \\Ld\\ = 600, the number of data points for training could amount to 720,000.",
        "Whether learning can fully exploit such combined training data is an interesting issue, which is examined in Section 8.",
        "After training, for two given texts a' and b', the relative difficulty is judged by inputting Va>b> into the SVM.",
        "In this phase, if a new word which was not in the training corpora appears in either a' or b', the word is ignored for the purposes of this work.",
        "With a comparator thus constructed, the texts of S are sorted.",
        "Further, readability assessment is performed by searching for the position of a text within the sorted texts.",
        "The sorting and searching algorithms can be chosen from among the basic ones already established within computer science.",
        "There are further requirements, however, as follows:",
        "• Searching must be as fast as possible for the actual application.",
        "• Sorting and searching should be implemented with the same procedure, given the nature of the application, as will be explained in Section 5.",
        "Moreover, sorting should be done incrementally to facilitate the addition of texts.",
        "• Sorting must be made robust to overcome judgment errors made by the comparator.",
        "Given the first two requirements, we chose binary insertion sort and binary sorting from among various sorting and searching algorithms, because it provides one of the fastest search methods.",
        "2 This is no more than our guess.",
        "The precise calculation method unfortunately cannot be understood from their paper, because the description is very brief.",
        "To meet the last requirement, the algorithm is made robust by performing multiple comparisons at one time, as explained here.",
        "In binary insertion sort, given a new text, the insertion position is searched for among the previously sorted texts (from the easiest text to the most difficult text), and the text is inserted between two successive texts i and i + 1, where the text is more difficult than the ith easiest text and it is easier than the i + 1th text.",
        "Through repetition of this operation, all texts are sorted.",
        "Because our comparator is generated using an SVM, one sole comparison could lead to an erroneous result.",
        "Moreover, one comparison error could lead to disastrous sorting results with a binary sort, because binary search changes the insertion position significantly, especially at the beginning of the search procedure.",
        "To avoid such comparison mistakes, the comparison judgment is made through multiple comparisons with texts located at the proximity of each position.",
        "The number of multiple comparisons is called the width and is denoted as M = 2K +1, with K being a positive natural number, as illustrated in Figure 3.",
        "M is dynamically changed during the search procedure by narrowing it down to indicate the exact position.",
        "The procedure starts with a given set of texts S and an empty set SS.",
        "At each judgment, a text to be inserted is removed from S and inserted into SS.",
        "The procedure proceeds as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Obtain a text x from S.If SS is empty, the text x is put into SS and another text x is obtained from S.",
        "2.",
        "The texts of SS are already sorted and are indexed by i = 1... w, where i = 1 is the easiest and i = n is the most difficult.",
        "Searching is done using three variables, which are initialized as follows: bottom – 1; top – n; middle – [(top + bottom)/2j.",
        "The width M is set as follows: M = 2 x K + 1 (K e N).",
        "3.",
        "If M > [(top - bottom)/2j, then K – [(top - bottom)/2j.",
        "A change in K also changes the value of M, which is always set to 2 x K + 1.",
        "4.",
        "Compare x with texts at i = middle – K...middle + K. If more than K texts are judged as difficult, then top – middle – 1.",
        "Otherwise, bottom – middle +1.",
        "5.",
        "If top < bottom, then insert x before the bottom.",
        "Otherwise, go to step 3.",
        "6.",
        "Insert x before bottom.",
        "7.",
        "If \\S\\ > 1, then go to step 1.",
        "Otherwise, the procedure is complete.",
        "The complexity for sorting a set \\S\\ amounts to 0(C\\S\\), where C is the maximum value of M. Because the time complexity required for insertion is log n, it might seem that the total time complexity is 0(C\\S\\ log \\S\\), but this is not the case: Random access for binary insertion requires the whole data structure to be implemented by an array, which requires copying of the whole SS at every insertion.",
        "Note that the sorting speed at this point does not affect the usability of our application, since the text collection is sorted offline (as explained in Section 5).",
        "On the other hand, the searching speed does affect the usability.",
        "For sorted texts, the readability of a text is assessed by searching for its insertion position.",
        "The searching is done by binary search, through the same procedure in steps 2 to 6.",

        "For each N, the number of training pairs was 2N, constructed by randomly sampling N documents from Ld and Le and forming N pairs, and then constructing Vde and Ved for each pair.",
        "Second, the effect of combination should be considered; that is, the number of pairs whose maximum number is 2 |x|Le| for a given N. When N = 600, this amounts to 720,000 training pairs, which is too large in terms of the time required for training.",
        "Therefore, by fixing N = 100, we tested the learning effect for numbers of training pairs up to 2 x 100 x{ 1,5,10,50,100}.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 9, where the first graph shows the effect of the amount of data and the second graph shows the effect of combination.",
        "The horizontal axes represent the amount of training data (namely, 2N for the first graph and 2 x 100 x {1,5,10,50,100} for the second graph), and the vertical axes represent the correlation.",
        "In the second graph, the horizontal axis is in log scale.",
        "Each graph has four lines, each corresponding to a subset of data from TD2.",
        "Every plot was obtained by averaging five repetitions of the random pairing of learning data.",
        "In the first graph, the increase in the amount of local data led to only a slight increase in performance, which is almost invisible.",
        "In the second graph, the increase in combination did not lead to higher performance, but rather to drastically decreased performance for the English data.",
        "This decrease was especially prominent with TD2-F-E, the English textbook for Japanese students.",
        "This must have been due to the different natures of the training and test data.",
        "On the other hand, the texts of the Asahi newspaper articles and TD2-{M,F}-J are controlled under a similar standard (in terms of vocabulary, syntax, and so forth), which would account for the difference from the case in English.",
        "These results suggest that even if our method has the possibility of obtaining large amounts of training data by combination, this would not lead to higher performance.",

        "They reacted positively to Terrace, even though the system does not show any absolute readability scores.",
        "There are two main reasons for the favorable response.",
        "First, as mentioned, because they need texts rather than scores, teachers liked the fact that Terrace returns texts directly without outputting the values.",
        "With previous systems, teachers themselves had to input one candidate text after another to find one of an appropriate level.",
        "Second, for foreign language teachers, especially of languages other than English, scores are not well standardized, and teachers are often puzzled by some readability scores.",
        "The teaching levels do not necessarily correspond to standard school grades for natives.",

        "Nevertheless, they found that the graphical indicators are helpful for locating themselves among numerous collections.",
        "In Section 4, qualitative analysis showed that a disadvantage of our model is the greater computational complexity in readability assessment.",
        "This section reports on the response time when using Terrace.",
        "The response time of Terrace is determined by the addition of three factors:",
        "• extraction of features from a text",
        "• searching for the text's position within a text collection",
        "• system overhead time (server access, Web page generation, etc.)",
        "The time needed for feature vector construction is linear with respect to the text length.",
        "This process is conducted once before a search.",
        "The text's position within the text collection is then searched for.",
        "Because comparison is performed multiple times in a search, this factor dominates the response time.",
        "As mentioned in Section 3.2, this time is logarithmic with respect to the number of texts in a collection.",
        "The last factor is constant.",
        "We evaluated the response time for TD2-M-E, since we currently have a larger text collection in English and TD2-M-E is a larger data set than TD-F-E. As noted in Section 5, this collection amounts to 14,877 texts taken from CNN (CNN 2008).",
        "The input texts were all texts of TD2-M-E. Because K = 2, which makes M = 2 x K + 1 = 5 (e.g., the width of comparison was 5), the total number of comparisons was about 70 for one search.",
        "The computational environment was as follows: CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9550 (2.83 GHz); main memory: 3.5 GB; OS: Debian GNU/Linux 4.0.",
        "The results are plotted in Figure 11.",
        "Because the key factor for response time is the length of a text, the horizontal axis represents the text length and the vertical axis represents the response time.",
        "Each plot corresponds to one text in TD2-M-E.",
        "The longer the text, the slower the response time will be.",
        "The plotted points are separated into two clusters, with one at the upper right and the other just below.",
        "This disjunction corresponds to texts which were judged as more difficult and those judged as easier, respectively, at the first comparison within the binary search.",
        "Because the Terrace system stores its feature vectors in a MySQL database, when the number of non-zero features is large, access becomes slower, even when all vector dimensions are the same.",
        "For texts judged as more difficult at the first comparison, the vector length in the string (which is how it is implemented in MySQL) becomes longer, and the overall procedure takes a longer time.",
        "In any case, for all texts the response time was less than a second.",
        "Therefore, although our method does have a complexity disadvantage, the results of this evaluation suggest this is not a serious problem."

        "Another comparison with a state-of-the-art classification method confirmed the potential of our method.",
        "We also presented an actual application, called Terrace: a system that retrieves a text of similar readability from a text collection when given an input text.",
        "We showed that Terrace can overcome the disadvantages of the proposed model, by introducing a graphical representation of the positions of texts with known levels, and also by verifying that the response time is always less than a second.",
