        "generalize TAG by allowing elementary structures to be sets of TAG trees.",
        "One member of the MCTAG formalism group is Tree-Local MCTAG (TL-MCTAG), in which all trees from a single elementary tree set are constrained to adjoin or substitute into a single tree in another elementary tree set.",

        "This result calls into question the practicality of systems that employ TL-MCTAG as the formalism for expressing a natural language grammar.",

        "We demonstrate (Section 3) that even under restricted definitions where either the rank or the fanout of the grammar is bounded, the universal recognition problem is NP-complete.",
        "We define a novel variant of multicomponent TAG formalisms that treats the elementary structures as vectors of trees rather than as unordered sets (Section 4).",
        "We demonstrate that this variant of the definition of the formalism (the vector definition)is consistent with the linguistic applications of the formalism presented in the literature.",
        "Universal recognition of the vector definition of TL-MCTAG is NP-complete when both the rank and fanout are unbounded.",
        "However, when the rank is bounded, the universal recognition problem is polynomial in both the length of the input string and the grammar size.",
        "We present a novel parsing algorithm for TL-MCTAG (Section 5) that accommodates both the set and vector definitions of TL-MCTAG.",
        "Although no algorithms for parsing TL-MCTAG have previously been published, the standard method for parsing linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS)-equivalent formalisms can be applied directly to TL-MCTAG to produce a quite inefficient baseline algorithm in which the polynomial degree of the length of the input string depends on the input grammar.",

        "MCTAG, although not specifically for TL-MCTAG.",
        "The method proposed differs from ours in that MCTAGs are parsed first as a standard TAG, with any conditions on tree or set locality checked on the derivation forest as a second step.",
        "No specific algorithm is presented for performing the check of tree-locality on a TAG derivation forest, so it is difficult to directly compare the methods.",
        "However, that method cannot take advantage of the gains in efficiency produced by discarding inappropriate partial parses at the time that they are first considered.",
        "Aside from Kallmeyer's work, little attention has been paid to the problem of directly parsing TL-MCTAG.",
        "Sogaard, Lichte, and Maier (2007) present several proofs regarding the complexity of the recognition problem for some linguistically motivated extensions of TAG that are similar to TL-MCTAG.",
        "Their work shows the NP-hardness of the recognition problem for these variants and, as an indirect result, also demonstrates the NP-hardness of TL-MCTAG recognition.",
        "This work differs from ours in that it does not directly show the NP-hardness of TL-MCTAG recognition and does not further locate and constrain the source of the NP-hardness of the problem to the rank of the input grammar, nor does it provide mitigation through rank reduction of the grammar or by other means.",
        "Our work on TL-MCTAG factorization is thematically though not formally related to the body of work on induction of TAGs from a treebank exemplified by Chen and Shanker (2004).",
        "The factorization performed in their work is done on the basis of syntactic constraints rather than with the goal of reducing complexity.",
        "Working from a treebank of actual natural language sentences, their work does not have the benefit of explicitly labeled adjunction sites but rather must attempt to reconstruct a derivation from complete derived trees.",
        "The factorization problem we address is more closely related to work on factorizing synchronous context-free grammars (CFGs) (Gildea, Satta, and Zhang 2006; Zhang and Gildea 2007) and on factorizing synchronous TAGs (Nesson, Satta, and Shieber 2008).",
        "Synchronous grammars are a special case of multicomponent grammars, so the problems are quite similar to the TL-MCTAG factorization problem.",
        "However, synchronous grammars are fundamentally set-local rather than tree-local formalisms, which in some cases simplifies their analysis.",
        "In the case of CFGs, the problem reduces to one of identifying problematic permutations of non-terminals (Zhang and Gildea 2007) and can be done efficiently by using a sorting algorithm to binarize any non-problematic permutations until only the intractable correspondences remain (Gildea, Satta, and Zhang 2006).",
        "This method is unavailable in the TAG case because the elementary structures may have depth greater than one and therefore the concept of adjacency relied upon in their work is inapplicable.",
        "The factorization algorithm of Nesson, Satta, and Shieber (2008) is the most closely related to this one but is not directly applicable to TL-MCTAG because each link is presumed to have exactly two locations and all adjunctions occur in a set-local rather than tree-local manner."

        "Currently, the definition of fragment does not allow splitting apart a subset of the children of a given node from the remaining ones.",
        "However, if we allow binarization of the elementary trees of the source grammar, then we might be able to isolate sets of links that could not be factorized in the source grammar itself.",
        "It is not difficult to construct an elementary tree a with r links such that no factorization of a is possible if we are required to preserve a's structure, but if we drop such a requirement then we could binarize a in such a way that a factorization can be obtained through the application of the algorithm above, such that any tree in the factorization has no more than two links.",
        "However, the general problem of restructuring elementary trees in such a way that an optimal factorization is possible is not trivial and requires further research.",
        "We leave this problem for future work.",
        "A second case arises when multiple links impinge on the same node of an elementary tree.",
        "As presented, the factorization algorithm is designed to handle grammars in which multiple adjunction is permitted.",
        "However, if multiple adjunction is disallowed and the grammar contains trees in which multiple links impinge on the same node, the use of one link at a node will disqualify any other impinging links from use.",
        "This opens up the possibility of further reducing the rank of the grammar by producing tree sets that do not contain any nodes on which multiple links impinge.",
        "This can be accomplished by performing a first-pass grammar transformation in which a copy of each elementary tree set is added to the grammar for each distinct, maximal, non-conflicting set of links appearing in the tree set.",
        "This transformation in itself may result in a reduction of the rank of the source grammar.",
        "The factorization algorithm can then be applied to the new grammar.",
        "However, if the elementary trees in the source grammar contain clusters of links that are mutually overlapping, the suggested transformation may blow up the size of the input grammar in a way that is not bounded by any polynomial function."
