        "can be extracted automatically from word-aligned parallel text.",
        "These grammars can produce a very rich space of candidate translations and, relative to simpler phrase-based systems (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003), the power of Hiero is most evident in translation between dissimilar languages, such as English and Chinese (Chiang 2005, 2007).",
        "Hiero is able to learn and apply complex patterns in movement and translation that are not possible with simpler systems.",
        "Hiero can also be used to good effect on \"simpler\" problems, such as translation between English and Spanish (Iglesias et al.",
        "2009c), even though there is not the same need for the full complexity of movement and translation.",
        "If gains in using Hiero are small, however, the computational and modeling complexity involved are difficult to justify.",
        "Such concerns would vanish if there were reliable methods to match Hiero complexity for specific translation problems.",
        "Loosely put, it would be a good thing if the complexity of a system was somehow proportional to the improvement in translation quality the system delivers.",
        "Another notable current trend in SMT is system combination.",
        "Minimum Bayes Risk decoding is widely used to rescore and improve hypotheses produced by individual systems (Kumar and Byrne 2004; Tromble et al.",
        "2008; de Gispert et al.",
        "2009), and more aggressive system combination techniques which synthesize entirely new hypotheses from those of contributing systems can give even greater translation improvements (Rosti et al.",
        "2007; Sim et al.",
        "2007).",
        "It is now commonplace to note that even the best available individual SMT system can be significantly improved upon by such techniques.",
        "This puts a burden on the underlying SMT systems which is somewhat unusual in NLP.",
        "The requirement is not merely to produce a single hypothesis that is as good as possible.",
        "Ideally, the SMT systems should generate large collections of candidate hypotheses that are simultaneously diverse and of good quality.",
        "Relative to these concerns, previously published descriptions of Hiero have noted certain limitations.",
        "Spurious ambiguity (Chiang 2005) was described as",
        "a situation where the decoder produces many derivations that are distinct yet have the same model feature vectors and give the same translation.",
        "This can result in n-best lists with very few different translations which is problematic for the minimum-error-rate training algorithm ...",
        "This is due in part to the cube pruning procedure (Chiang 2007), which enumerates all distinct hypotheses to a fixed depth by means of k-best hypothesis lists.",
        "If enumeration was not necessary, or if the lists could be arbitrarily deep, there might still be many duplicate derivations, but at least the hypothesis space would not be impoverished.",
        "Spurious ambiguity is also related to overgeneration (Varile and Lau 1988; Wu 1997; Setiawan et al.",
        "2009).",
        "For our purposes we say that overgeneration occurs when different derivations based on the same set of rules give rise to different translations.",
        "An example is given in Figure 1.",
        "This process is not necessarily a bad thing in that it allows new translations to be synthesized from rules extracted from training data; a strong target language model, such as a high order n-gram, is typically relied upon to discard unsuitable hypotheses.",
        "Overgeneration does complicate translation, however, in that many hypotheses are introduced only to be subsequently discarded.",
        "The situation is further complicated by search errors.",
        "Any search procedure which relies on pruning during search is at risk of search errors and the risk is made worse if the grammars tend to introduce many similar scoring hypotheses.",
        "In particular we have found that cube pruning is very prone to search errors, that is, the hypotheses produced by cube pruning are not the top scoring hypotheses which should be found under the Hiero grammar (Iglesias et al.",
        "2009b).",
        "Hierarchical Translation with WFSTs and Shallow-n Grammars Figure 1",
        "Example of multiple translation sequences from a simple grammar fragment showing variability in reordering in translation of the source sequence abc.",
        "These limitations are clearly related to each other.",
        "Moreover, they become more problematic as the amount of parallel text grows.",
        "As the number of rules in the grammar increases, the grammars become more expressive, but the ability to search them does not improve.",
        "This leads to a widening gap between the expressive power of the grammar and the ability to search it to find good and diverse hypotheses.",
        "In this article we describe the following two refinements to Hiero which are intended to address some of the limitations in its original formulation.",
        "Lattice-based hierarchical translation We describe how the cube pruning procedure can be replaced by standard operations with Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) so that Hiero uses translation lattices rather than n-best lists in search.",
        "We find that keeping partial translation hypotheses in lattice form greatly reduces search errors.",
        "In some instances it is possible to perform translation without any pruning at all so that search errors are completely eliminated.",
        "Consistent with the observation by Chiang (2005), this leads to improvements in minimum error rate training.",
        "Furthermore, the direct generation of translation lattices can improve gains from subsequent language model and Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) rescoring.",
        "Shallow-n grammars and additional nonterminal categories Nonterminals can be incorporated into hierarchical translation rules for the purpose of tuning the size of the Hiero search space for individual language pairs.",
        "Shallow-n grammars are described and shown to control the level of rule nesting, low-level rule catenation, and the minimum and maximum spans of individual translation rules.",
        "In translation experiments we find that a shallow-1 grammar (one level of rule nesting) is sufficiently expressive for Arabic-to-English translation, but that a shallow-3 grammar is required in Chinese-to-English translation to match the performance of a full Hiero system that allows arbitrary rule nesting.",
        "These nonterminals are introduced to control the Hiero search space and do not require estimation from annotated – or parsed – parallel text, as can be required by translation systems based on linguistically motivated grammars.",
        "We use this approach as the basis of a general approach to SMT modeling.",
        "To control overgeneration, we revisit the synchronous context-free grammar defined by hierarchical rules and take a shallow-1 grammar as a starting point.",
        "We then increase the complexity of the rules until the desired translation quality is found.",
        "With these refinements we find that hierarchical phrase-based translation can be efficiently carried out with no (or minimal) search errors in large-data tasks and can achieve state-of-the-art translation performance.",
        "There are many benefits to formulating Hiero translation in terms of WFSTs.",
        "Following the manner in which Knight and Al-Onaizan (1998), Kumar, Deng, and Byrne (2006), and Graehl, Knight, and May (2008) elucidate other machine translation models, we can use WFST operations to make the operations of the Hiero decoder very clear.",
        "The simplicity of the analysis makes it possible to focus on the underlying grammars and avoid the complexities of heuristic search procedures.",
        "Once the decoder is formulated, implementation is mostly straightforward using standard WFST techniques developed for language processing (Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 2002).",
        "What difficulties arise are due to using finite state techniques with grammars which are not themselves finite state.",
        "We will show, however, that the basic operations which need to be performed, such as extracting sufficient statistics for minimum error rate training, can be done relatively easily and naturally.",
        "In Section 2 we describe HiFST, which is a hierarchical phrase-based translation system based on the OpenFST WFST libraries (Allauzen et al.",
        "2007).",
        "We describe how translation lattices can be generated over the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) grid used for parsing under Hiero.",
        "We also review some modeling issues needed for practical translation, such as the efficient handling of source language deletions and the extraction of statistics for minimum error rate training.",
        "This requires running HiFST in \"alignment mode\" (Section 2.3) to find all the rule derivations that generate a given set of translation hypotheses.",
        "In Section 3 we investigate parameters that control the size and nature of the hierarchical phrase-based search space as defined by hierarchical translation rules.",
        "To efficiently explore the largest possible space and avoid pruning in search, we introduce ways to easily adapt the grammar to the reordering needs of each language pair.",
        "We describe the use of additional nonterminal categories to limit the degree of rule nesting, and can directly control the minimum or maximum span each translation rule can cover.",
        "In Section 4 we report detailed translation results for Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English, and review translation results for Spanish-to-English and Finnish-to-English translation.",
        "In these experiments we contrast the performance of lattice-based and cube pruning hierarchical decoding and we measure the impact on processing time and translation performance due to changes in search parameters and grammar configurations.",
        "We demonstrate that it is easy and feasible to compute the marginal instead of the Viterbi probabilities when using WFSTs, and that this yields gains in translation performance.",
        "And finally, we show that lattice-based translation performs significantly better than fc-best lists for the task of combining translation hypotheses generated from alternative morphological segmentations of the data via lattice-based MBR decoding."

        "In this case, the shallow-1 grammar obtained a BLEU score of 28.0, whereas the full hierarchical grammar only achieved 27.6.",
        "This is further evidence that full-hierarchical grammars are not appropriate in all instances.",
        "In this case we suspect that the use of Finnish words without morphological decomposition leads to data sparsity problems and complicates the task of learning complex translation rules.",

        "We have described two linked investigations into hierarchical phrase-based translation.",
        "We investigate the use of weighted finite state transducers rather than k-best lists to represent the space of translation hypotheses.",
        "We describe a lattice-based Hiero decoder, with which we find reductions in search errors, better parameter optimization, and improved translation performance.",
        "Relative to these reductions in search errors, direct generation of target language translation lattices also leads to further translation improvements through subsequent rescoring steps, such as MBR decoding and the application of large n-gram language models.",
        "These steps can be carried out easily via standard WFST operations.",
        "As part of the machinery needed for our experiments we develop WFST procedures for alignment and feature extraction so that statistics needed for system optimization can be easily obtained and represented as transducers.",
        "In particular, we make use of a lattice-based representation of sequences of rule applications, which proves useful for minimum error rate training.",
        "In all instances we find that using lattices as compact representations of translation hypotheses offers clear modeling advantages.",
        "We also investigate refinements in translation search space through shallow-n grammars, structured long-distance movement, and constrained word deletion.",
        "We find that these techniques can be used to fit the complexity of Hiero translation systems to individual language pairs.",
        "In translation from Arabic into English, shallow grammars make it possible to explore the entire search space and to do so more quickly but with the same translation quality as the full Hiero grammar.",
        "Even in complex translation tasks, such as Chinese to English, we find significant speed improvements with minimal loss in performance using these methods.",
        "We take the view that it is better to perform exact search of a constrained space than to risk search errors in translation.",
        "We note finally that Chiang introduced Hiero as a model \"based on a synchronous CFG, elsewhere known as a syntax-directed transduction grammar (Lewis and Stearns 1968).\"",
        "We have taken this formulation as a starting point for the development of novel realizations of Hiero.",
        "Our motivation has mainly been practical in that we seek improved translation quality and efficiency through better models and algorithms.",
        "Our approach suggests close links between Hiero and Recursive Transition Networks (Woods 1970; Mohri 1997).",
        "Although this connection is beyond the scope of this paper, we do note that Hiero translation requires keeping track of two grammars, one based on the Hiero translation rules and the other based on n-gram language model probabilities.",
        "These two grammars have very different dependencies which suggests that a full implementation of Hiero translation such as we have addressed does not have a simple expression as an RTN."
