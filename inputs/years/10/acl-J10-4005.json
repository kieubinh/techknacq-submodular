        "A prominent feature of such systems is the use of an n-gram LM to measure the quality of translation hypotheses.",
        "A drawback of such systems is that the lack of structural information in the output makes it impossible to score translation hypotheses based on their structural soundness.",
        "The Hiero system (Chiang 2007)was a major breakthrough in SMT.",
        "Translation rules in Hiero contain non-terminals (NTs), as well as words, which allow the input to be translated in a hierarchical manner.",

        "This method depends on the quality of source side parsing, and ignores target information during source side analysis.",

        "In this article, we propose a novel string-to-dependency algorithm for statistical machine translation.",
        "It employs a target dependency language model to exploit long distance word relations in decoding, which cannot be captured with a traditional n-gram language model.",
        "Compared with a state-of-the-art hierarchical string-to-string system, our string-to-dependency system generates about 80% fewer rules.",
        "The overall gain in BLEU score on lower-cased decoding output is about two points.",
        "Dependency structures provide a desirable platform for employing linguistic knowledge in MT.",
        "We will extend our approach with deeper linguistic features such as propositional structures (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005).",
        "The fixed and floating structures proposed in this article can be extended to model predicates and arguments."
