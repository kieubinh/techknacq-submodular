        "In the case of anglicize, the desired result would be a high plausibility for words like the (previously seen) wordlist and surname as well as the (unseen) word and spelling, and a low plausibility for (likewise unseen) words like cow and machine.",

        "Our model thus distinguishes between a primary corpus, from which the predicate-role-headword triples are extracted, and a generalization corpus for computing the vector space representations.",
        "This distinction makes it possible to apply our model to primary corpora with rich information that are too small for efficient generalization, such as domain-specific corpora or corpora with deeper linguistic analysis, as long as a larger, even if potentially noisier, generalization corpus is available.",

        "The first task is pseudo-disambiguation (Yarowsky 1993), where the model decides which of two randomly chosen words is a better filler for the given argument position.",
        "This task tests model properties that are needed for concrete semantic analysis tasks, most notably word sense disambiguation, but also for semantic role labeling.",
        "The second task is the prediction of human plausibility ratings, which is a standard task-independent benchmark for the quality of selectional preferences.",

        "For the comparison, we randomly sample a total of 100 noun/inverse-role pairs from the BNC, using the same five frequency bands as for the verbs (50100,100-200, 200-500, 500-1,000, >1,000).",

        "We can expect to see the same overall tendency in regular and inverse selectional preference strength.",
        "It is not possible that inverse selectional preference strength would be uniform throughout if regular selectional preference strength varied between verbs.",

        "As expected, we see substantial strengths in both regular and inverse preferences.",
        "Both parts of speech show the same pattern of decreasing KL divergences for higher-frequency words, presumably because frequent words tend to be polysemous, and can combine with many different words.",
        "However, the strengths for inverse selectional preferences are in general lower than those for regular preferences.",
        "One possible reason for this is that the number of nouns seen with a verb-role pair might differ, in general, from the number of verbs seen with each noun-role pair.",

        "In this article, we have presented a similarity-based model of selectional preferences, EPP.",
        "It computes the selectional fit of a candidate role filler as a weighted sum of semantic similarities to headwords observed in a corpus, in a straightforward implementation",
        "Pseudo-disambiguation results for inverse selectional preferences (BNC as primary and secondary corpus, discr weighting).",

        "Jaccard Lin 500 dimensions",
        "A Flexible, Corpus-Driven Model of Selectional Preferences",
        "of the intuition that plausibility judgments should generalize to fillers with similar meaning.",
        "Our model is simple and easy to compute.",
        "In common with other distributional models like Rooth et al.",
        "(1999), it does not depend on lexical resources.",
        "Our model derives additional flexibility from distinguishing between a primary corpus (for observing headwords) and a generalization corpus (for inducing semantic similarities).",
        "This allows it to use primary corpora with deeper semantic annotation that are too small as a basis for computing vector space representations.",
        "We have evaluated the EPP model on two tasks, a pseudo-disambiguation task that can be viewed as an abstraction of both word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling, as well as on the prediction of human plausibility judgments.",
        "The model achieves similar error rates to the semantic hierarchy-based RESNIK model, at considerably higher coverage, and it achieves lower error rates than the ROOTH ET AL.soft clustering model.",
        "The semantic role-based PADO ET AL.",
        "model, although highly accurate in its predictions, has much lower coverage and needs a semantically annotated corpus as a basis.",
        "We have also demonstrated that our model is able to meaningfully model inverse selectional preferences, that is, expectations of nouns about verbs for which they appear as arguments.",
        "With respect to parameter settings of the EPP model, we find consistent patterns across the three tasks we have considered.",
        "nGCM, Lin, and Cosine are the best-performing similarity measures throughout.",
        "The good performance of the nGCM measure, an exponential similarity measure, is particularly noteworthy.",
        "We found it to work well on data sets that are sparse and not too noisy, whereas the Lin similarity measure achieved better performance when the data was noisy (see Section 5.4 for details).",
        "Dimensionality reduction (PCA) on the vector space raises the performance of the Jaccard and Dice similarity measures to a similar level as the best three.",
        "More importantly, PCA neutralizes a strong frequency bias that otherwise leads to a large performance drop on rare arguments.",
        "Concerning weighting schemes, we found that frequency-based weighting works well when the data is either clean or not too sparse.",
        "In the face of sparse noisy data, DISCR weighting (a variant of tf/idf) is helpful.",
        "Comparing bag-of-words-based and dependency-based vector spaces, DEPSPACEs are sparser but cleaner than WORDSPACEs.",
        "Accordingly, DEPSPACEs are at an advantage when many headwords are available, making efficient use of this information, whereas WORDSPACEs work better for predicates with few seen headwords because they are less affected by sparseness.",
        "We conclude with two open questions.",
        "The first question concerns the appropriate representation of selectional preferences for polysemous verbs such as address, whose direct object can either be a person, or a problem.",
        "Polysemy leads to headwords with lower similarity among them than for non-polysemous verbs, which in turn can lead to artificially low plausibilities for all fillers.",
        "In the SEM PRIMARY setting, occurrences of polysemous verbs are separated into different frames.",
        "In future work, we hope to improve our SYN PRIMARY setting models by clustering the seen headwords, and then computing plausibility of new headwords relative to the nearest cluster.",
        "A second question is the usefulness of inverse selectional preferences for the acquisition of fine-grained information about nouns.",
        "As we discussed in Section 7, the preferred verbs for a noun can often be grouped into meaning clusters.",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate whether there are groups of predicates that recur across similar nouns, and how they can be characterized.",
        "We expect some groups to correspond to Pustejovsky's qualia (Pustejovsky 1995), which constitute particularly salient events for an object, namely, their creation and typical use.",
        "However, we expect corpus data to yield a more complex picture of the events connected to a noun, which manifest themselves in the form of additional, more specific meaning clusters.",
