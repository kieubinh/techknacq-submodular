        "N-best hypotheses, word lattices, and confusion networks have been widely used as an interface between ASR and subsequent spoken language processing tasks, such as machine translation, spoken document retrieval (Chelba et al., 2007; Chia et al., 2008), and shown outperforming using 1-best hypotheses.",
        "However, studies using these rich speech recognition results for speech summarization are very limited.",

        "This is often different from syntactic or semantic meaningful unit (e.g., a sentence), but is a more realistic setup.",

        "Using the confidence scores, we calculate the IDF values as follows,",
        "If a word wi appears in the document, we find its maximum posterior probability among all the positions it occurs in the CNs, which is used to signal wi's soft appearance in this document.",
        "We add these soft counts for all the documents as the denominator in Equation 4.",

        "This can avoid the impact of noisy words, and increase the system speed as well.",
        "We investigate three different pruning methods, listed below.",
        "• absolute pruning: In this method, we delete words if their posterior probabilities are lower than a predefined threshold, i.e., p(wi) < 6.",
        "• max_diff pruning: First for each position k, we find the maximum probability among all the word candidates: Pmaxk = maxj p(wjk).",
        "Then we remove a word wi in this position if the absolute difference of its probability with the maximum score is larger than a predefined threshold, i.e., Pmaxk – p(wik) > 6.",
        "• max_ratio pruning: This is similar to the above one, but instead of absolute difference, we use the ratio of their probabilities, i.e., p^si < 6.",

        "• Average node density.",
        "This is the average number of candidate words for each position in the confusion networks.",

        "When increasing the pruning thresholds, the word coverage decreases following roughly a linear pattern.",
        "When the pruning threshold is 0.45, the word coverage of the pruned CNs is 71.15%, lower than 1-best hypotheses.",
        "For node density, the non-pruned CNs have an average density of 11.04.",
        "With a very small pruning threshold of 0.01, the density decreases rapidly to 2.11.",
        "The density falls less than 2 when the threshold is 0.02, which means that for some nodes there is only one word candidate preserved after pruning (i.e., only one word has a posterior probability higher than 0.02).",
        "When the threshold increases to 0.4, the density is less than 1 (0.99), showing that on average there is less than one candidate left for each position.",
        "This is consistent withthe word coverage results – when the pruning threshold is larger than 0.45, the confusion networks have less word coverage than 1-best hypotheses because even the top word hypotheses are deleted.",

        "We will investigate better methods for term weighting to address this issue in our future work.",
        "These experimental results prove that using the confusion networks and confidence scores can help select the correct sentence segments.",
        "Even though the 1-best WER is quite high, if we can consider more word candidates and/or their confidence scores, this will not impact the process of selecting summary segments.",
        "We can achieve similar performance as using human transcripts, and sometimes even slightly better performance.",
        "This suggests using more word candidates and their confidence scores results in better term weighting and representation in the vector space model.",
        "Some previous work showed that using word confidence scores can help minimize the WER of the extracted summaries, which then lead to better summarization performance.",
        "However, we think the main reason for the improvement in our study is from selecting better utterances, as shown in Table 3.",
        "In our experiments, because different setups select different segments as the summary, we can not directly compare the WER of extracted summaries, and analyze whether lower WER is also helpful for better summarization performance.",

        "Previous research has shown performance degradation when using ASR output for meeting summarization because of word errors.",
        "To address this problem, in this paper we proposed to use confusion networks for speech summarization.",
        "Under the MMR framework, we introduced a vector representation for the segments by using more word candidates in CNs and their associated posterior probabilities.",
        "We evaluated the effectiveness of using different confusion networks, the non-pruned ones, and the ones pruned using three different methods, i.e., absolute, max_diff and max_ratio pruning.",
        "Our experimental results on the ICSI meeting corpus showed that even when we only use the top hypotheses from the CNs, considering the word posterior probabilities can improve the summarization performance on both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores.",
        "By using the pruned CNs we can obtain further improvement.",
        "We found that more gain in ROUGE-2 results was yielded by our proposed soft term weighting method based on posterior probabilities.",
        "Our experiments also demonstrated that it is possible to use confusion networks to achieve similar or even better performance than using human transcripts if the goal is to select the right segments.",
        "This is important since one possible rendering of summarization results is to return the audio segments to the users, which does not suffer from recognition errors.",
        "In our experiments, we observed less improvement from considering more word candidates than using the confidence scores.",
        "One possible reason is that the confusion networks we used are too confident.",
        "For example, on average 90.45% of the candidate words have a posterior probability lower than 0.01.",
        "Therefore, even though the correct words were included in the confusion networks, their contribution may not be significant enough because of low term weights.",
        "In addition, low probabilities also cause problems to our proposed soft IDF computation.",
        "In our future work, we will investigate probability normalization methods and other techniques for term weighting to cope with these problems."
