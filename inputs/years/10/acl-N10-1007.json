        "Access to information has moved from desktop and laptop computers in office and home environments to be an any place, any time activity due to mobile devices.",
        "Although mobile devices have small keyboards that make typing text input cumbersome compared to conventional desktop and laptops, the ability to access unlimited amount of information, almost everywhere, through the Internet, using these devices have made them pervasive.",
        "Even so, information access using text input on mobile devices with small screens and soft/small keyboards is tedious and unnatural.",
        "In addition, by the mobile nature of these devices, users often like to use them in hands-busy environments, ruling out the possibility of typing text.",
        "We address this issue by allowing the user to query an information repository using speech.",
        "We expect that spoken language queries to be a more natural and less cumbersome way of information access using mobile devices.",
        "A second issue we address is related to directly and precisely answering the user's query beyond serving web pages.",
        "This is in contrast to the current approach where a user types in a query using keywords to a search engine, browses the returned results on the small screen to select a potentially relevant document, suitably magnifies the screen to view the document and searches for the answer to her question in the document.",
        "By providing a method",
        "Srinivas Bangalore",
        "for the user to pose her query in natural language and presenting the relevant answer(s) to her question, we expect the user's information need to be fulfilled in a shorter period of time.",
        "We present a speech-driven question answering system, Qme!, as a solution toward addressing these two issues.",
        "The system provides a natural input modality - spoken language input - for the users to pose their information need and presents a collection of answers that potentially address the information need directly.",
        "For a subclass of questions that we term static questions, the system retrieves the answers from an archive of human generated answers to questions.",
        "This ensures higher accuracy for the answers retrieved (if found in the archive) and also allows us to retrieve related questions on the user's topic of interest.",
        "For a second subclass of questions that we term dynamic questions, the system retrieves the answer from information databases accessible over the Internet using web forms.",
        "The layout of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we review the related literature.",
        "In Section 3, we illustrate the system for speech-driven question answering.",
        "We present the retrieval methods we used to implement the system in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we discuss and evaluate our approach to tight coupling of speech recognition and search components.",
        "In Section 6, we present bootstrap techniques to distinguish dynamic questions from static questions, and evaluate the efficacy of these techniques on a test corpus.",
        "We conclude in Section 7."

        "Early question-answering (QA) systems, such as Baseball (Green et al., 1961) and Lunar (Woods, 1973) were carefully hand-crafted to answer questions in a limited domain, similar to the QA components of ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966) and SHRDLU (Winograd, 1972).",
        "However, there has been a resurgence of QA systems following the TREC conferences with an emphasis on answering factoid questions.",
        "This work on text-based question-answering which is comprehensively summarized in (Maybury, 2004), range widely in terms of linguistic sophistication.",
        "At one end of the spectrum, There are linguistically motivated systems (Katz, 1997; Waldinger et al., 2004) that analyze the user's question and attempt to synthesize a coherent answer by aggregating the relevant facts.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum, there are data intensive systems (Dumais et al., 2002) that attempt to use the redundancy of the web to arrive at an answer for factoid style questions.",
        "There are also variants of such QA techniques that involve an interaction and use context to resolve ambiguity (Yang et al., 2006).",
        "In contrast to these approaches, our method matches the user's query against the questions in a large corpus of question-answer pairs and retrieves the associated answer.",
        "In the information retrieval community, QA systems attempt to retrieve precise segments of a document instead of the entire document.",
        "In (To-muro and Lytinen, 2004), the authors match the user's query against a frequently-asked-questions (FAQ) database and select the answer whose question matches most closely to the user's question.",
        "An extension of this idea is explored in (Xue et al., 2008; Jeon et al., 2005), where the authors match the user's query to a community collected QA archive such as (Yahoo!, 2009; MSN-QnA, 2009).",
        "Our approach is similar to both these lines of work in spirit, although the user's query for our system originates as a spoken query, in contrast to the text queries in previous work.",
        "We also address the issue of noisy speech recognition and assess the value of tight integration of speech recognition and search in terms of improving the overall performance of the system.",
        "A novelty in this paper is our method to address dynamic questions as a seamless extension to answering static questions.",
        "Also related is the literature on voice-search applications (Microsoft, 2009; Google, 2009; Yellow-",
        "Pages, 2009; vlingo.com, 2009) that provide a spoken language interface to business directories and return phone numbers, addresses and web sites of businesses.",
        "User input is typically not a free flowing natural language query and is limited to expressions with a business name and a location.",
        "In our system, users can avail of the full range of natural language expressions to express their information need.",
        "And finally, our method of retrieving answers to dynamic questions has relevance to the database and meta search community.",
        "There is growing interest in this community to mine the \"hidden\" web - information repositories that are behind web forms - and provide a unified meta-interface to such information sources, for example, web sites related travel, or car dealerships.",
        "Dynamic questions can be seen as providing a natural language interface (NLI) to such web forms, similar to early work on NLI to databases (Androutsopoulos, 1995)."

        "A lattice representation of the ASR output, in particular, a word-confusion network (WCN) transformation of the lattice, compactly encodes the n-best hypothesis with the flexibility of pruning alternatives at each word position.",
        "An example of a WCN is shown in Figure 3.",
        "The weights on the arcs are to be interpreted as costs and the best path in the WCN is the lowest cost path from the start state (0) to the final state (4).",
