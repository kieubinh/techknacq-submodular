        "Still others induce their syntax from the data (Chiang, 2005).",
        "Despite differences in detail, the vast majority of syntactic methods share a critical dependence on word alignments.",
        "In particular, they infer syntactic correspondences between the source and target languages through word alignment patterns, sometimes in combination with constraints from parser outputs.",
        "However, word alignments are not perfect indicators of syntactic alignment, and syntactic systems are very sensitive to word alignment behavior.",
        "Even a single spurious word alignment can invalidate a large number of otherwise extractable rules, while unaligned words can result in an exponentially large set of extractable rules to choose from.",
        "Researchers have worked to incorporate syntactic information into word alignments, resulting in improvements to both alignment quality (Cherry and Lin, 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007), and translation quality (May and Knight, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we remove the dependence on word alignments and instead directly model the syntactic correspondences in the data, in a manner broadly similar to Yamada and Knight (2001).",
        "In particular, we propose an unsupervised model that aligns nodes of a parse tree (or forest) in one language to spans of a sentence in another.",
        "Our model is an instance of the inversion transduction grammar (ITG) formalism (Wu, 1997), constrained in such a way that one side of the synchronous derivation respects a syntactic parse.",
        "Our model is best suited to systems which use source-or target-side trees only.",
        "The design of our model is such that, for divergent structures, a structurally integrated backoff to flatter word-level (or null) analyses is available.",

        "We show that, with appropriate pruning, our model can be efficiently trained on large parallel corpora.",

        "Parameterizing this length allows our model to effectively control the number of words produced at different levels of the derivation.",

        "The pt distribution is a standard \"translation\" table, familiar from the IBM Models.",
        "The pinv distribution is a \"distortion\" parameter, and models the likelihood of inverting non-terminals B and C. This parameter can capture, for example, the high likelihood that prepositions IN and noun phrases NP often invert in Chinese due to its use of postpositions.",
        "The non-terminal length distributions pj, pm, and pr model the probability of \"backing off\" and emitting foreign words at non-terminals when a more refined analysis cannot be found.",
        "If these parameters place high mass on 0 length word sequences, this heavily penalizes this backoff behaviour.",
        "For the TERMINAL rule, the length distribution pw parameterizes the number of words produced for a particular English word e, functioning similarly to the \"fertilities\" employed by IBM Models 3 and 4 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "This allows us to model, for example, the tendency of English determiners the and a translate to nothing in the Chinese, and of English names to align to multiple Chinese words.",
        "In general, we expect an English word to usually align to one Chinese word, and so we place a weak Dirichlet prior on on the pe distribution which puts extra mass on 1-length word sequences.",
        "This is helpful for avoiding the \"garbage collection\" (Moore, 2004) problem for rare words.",
        "There are often foreign words that do not correspond well to any English word, which our model must also handle.",
        "We elected for a simple augmentation to our model to account for these words.",
        "When generating foreign word sequences f at a non-terminal (i.e. via the Unary or Binary productions), we also allow for the production of foreign words from the non-terminal symbol A.",

        "where pnt is a global binomial parameter which controls how often such alignments are made.",
        "This necessitates the inclusion of parameters like pt( m | NP) into our translation table.",
        "Generally, these parameters do not contain much information, but rather function like a traditional NULL rooted at some position in the tree.",
        "However, in some cases, the particular annotation used by the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) (and hence most parsers) allows for some interesting parameters to be learned.",
        "For example, we found that our aligner often matched the Chinese word T , which marks the past tense (among other things), to the preter-minals VBD and VBN, which denote the English simple past and perfect tense.",
        "Additionally, Chinese measure words like ^ and ^ often align to the CD (numeral) preterminal.",
        "These generalizations can be quite useful - where a particular number might predict a measure word quite poorly, the generalization that measure words co-occur with the CD tag is very robust.",
        "The generative process which describes our model contains a class of grammars larger than the computationally efficient class of ITG grammars.",
        "Fortunately, the parameterization described above not only reduces the number of parameters to a manageable level, but also introduces independence assumptions which permit synchronous binarization (Zhang et al., 2006) of our grammar.",
        "Any SCFG that can be synchronously binarized is an ITG, meaning that our parameterization permits efficient inference algorithms which we will make use of in the next section.",
        "Although several binarizations are possible, we give one such binarization and its associated probabilities in Table 2.",
        "Generally speaking, ITG grammars have proven more useful without the monolingual syntactic constraints imposed by a target parse tree.",
        "When derivations are restricted to respect a target-side parse tree, many desirable alignments are ruled out when the syntax of the two languages diverges, and alignment quality drops precipitously (Zhang and Gildea, 2004), though attempts have been made to address this issue (Gildea, 2003).",
        "Our model is designed to degrade gracefully in the case of syntactic divergence.",
