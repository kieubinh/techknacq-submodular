        "For example, Xiong et al.",
        "(2008) find that translation quality can be significantly improved by either prohibiting reorderings around punctuation or restricting reorderings within a 15-word window.",

        "(Xiong et al., 2009) further presents a bracketing model to include thousands of context-sensitive syntactic constraints.",
        "All of these approaches achieve their improvements by guiding the phrase-based decoder to prefer translations which respect source-side parse trees.",
        "One major problem with such constituent boundary based constraints is that syntactic structures of the source language do not necessarily reflect translation structures where the source and target language correspond to each other.",
        "In this paper, we investigate building classifiers that directly address the problem of translation boundary, rather than extracting constituent boundary from source-side parsers built for a different purpose.",
        "A translation boundary is a position in the source sequence which begins or ends a translation zone spanning multiple source words.",
        "In a translation zone, the source phrase is translated as a unit.",
        "Reorderings which cross translation zones are not desirable.",
        "Inspired by (Roark and Hollingshead, 2008) which introduces classifiers to decide if a word can begin/end a multi-word constituent, we build two discriminative classifiers to tag each word in the source sequence with a binary class label.",

        "In such a way, we can guide the decoder to boost hypotheses that respect translation boundaries and therefore the common translation structure shared by the source and target language, rather than the syntactic structure of the source language.",
        "We report the accuracy of such classifiers by comparing their outputs with \"gold\" translation boundaries obtained from reference translations on the development set.",
        "We integrate translation boundary based constraints into phrase-based decoding and display that they improve translation quality significantly in large-scale experiments.",

        "Our interest is the question of whether a sequence of consecutive source words can be translated as a unit (i.e. whether there is a translation zone covering these source words).",
