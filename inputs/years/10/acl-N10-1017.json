        "Automatically learning paraphrases, or alternative ways of expressing the same meaning, is an active area of NLP research because of its usefulness in a variety of applications, e.g., question answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Reizler et al., 2007), document summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999; McKeown et al., 2002), natural language generation (Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Lenke, 1994; Stede, 1999), machine translation (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2007).",
        "Early work on paraphrase acquisition has focused on using monolingual parallel corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004).",
        "While effective, such methods are hampered by the scarcity of monolingual parallel corpora, an obstacle that limits both the quantity and quality of the paraphrases learned.",
        "To address this limitation, Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) focused their attention on the abundance of bilingual parallel corpora.",
        "The crux of this system (referred to below as \"BCB\") is to align phrases in a bilingual parallel corpus and hypothesize English phrases as potential paraphrases if they are aligned to the same phrase in another language (the \"pivot\").",
        "Callison-Burch (2008) further refines BCB with a system that constrains paraphrases to have the same syntactic structure (Syntactic Bilingual Phrases: SBP).",
        "We take a graphical view of the state-of-the-art BCB and SBP approaches by representing the bilingual parallel corpora as a graph.",
        "A node corresponds to a phrase, and an edge exists between two nodes if their corresponding phrases are aligned.",
        "This graphical form makes the limitations of the BCB/SBP approaches more evident.",
        "The BCB/SBP graph is limited to be bipartite with English nodes on one side and foreign language nodes on the other, and an edge can only exist between nodes on different sides.",
        "This neglects information between foreign language nodes that may aid in learning paraphrases.",
        "Further, by only considering English nodes that are linked via a foreign language node as potential paraphrases, these approaches will fail to find paraphrases separated by distances greater than length two.",
        "In this paper, we present HTP (Hitting Time Paraphraser), a paraphrase learning approach that is based on random walks (Lovasz, 1996) and hitting times (Aldous and Fill, 2001).",
        "Hitting time measures the average number of steps one needs to take in a random traversal of a graph before reaching a destination node from a source node.",
        "Intuitively, the smaller the hitting time from a phrase E to E' (i.e., the closer E' is to E), the more likely it is that E' is a good paraphrase of E. The advantages of HTP are as follows:",
        "• By traversing paths of lengths greater than two, our approach is able to find more paraphrases of a given phrase.",
        "• We do not require the graph to be bipartite.",
        "Edges can exist between nodes of different foreign languages if their corresponding phrases are aligned.",
        "This allows information from foreign phrase alignments to be used in finding English paraphrases.",
        "• We permit domain knowledge to be easily incorporated as nodes in the graph.",
        "This allows domain knowledge to favor good paraphrases over bad ones, thereby improving performance.",
        "In this paper, we focus on learning English paraphrases.",
        "However, our system can be applied to learning paraphrases in any language.",
        "We begin by reviewing random walks and hitting times in the next section.",
        "Then we describe our paraphrase learning algorithm (Section 3), and report our experiments (Section 4).",
        "We discuss related work in Section 5.",

        "In a random walk (Lovasz, 1996), we traverse from node to node via the edges.",
        "Suppose at time step t, we are at node i.",
        "In the next step, we move to its neighbor j with probability proportional to the weight of the edge (i, j), i.e., with probability Wij /Ylj Wij.",

        "This is a desirable property for our system which works on bilingual parallel corpora containing numerous spurious alignments between phrases (i.e., edges between nodes).",
        "However, as observed by Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg (2003), hitting time has the drawback of being sensitive to portions of the graph that are far from the start node because it considers paths of length up to oo.",
        "To circumvent this problem, Sarkar and Moore (2007) introduced the notion of truncated hitting time where random walks are limited to have at most T steps.",
        "The truncated hitting time h j from node i to j is defined as the average number of steps one takes to reach j for the first time starting from i in a random walk that is limited to at most T steps.",

        "We use this figure to illustrate the strengths of HTP.",
        "First, by using moderately long random walks, HTP is able to find paraphrases that are separated by long paths.",
        "For example, there is a high probability path of length 4 (Ei, Fi, E2, F2, E3) from Ei to E3.",
        "Because of the path's high probability, it will appear in many of the random walks starting from Ei that are sampled on the graph, and thus E3 will be visited in many of the samples.",
        "This causes the truncated hitting time hEi e3 to be small, allowing HTP to find E3 as a plausible paraphrase of Ei.",
        "Second, by allowing edges between nodes of different foreign languages",

        "from G if their hitting times is equal to T. AddFeatureNodes(G), adds nodes representing domain knowledge to G",
        "(i.e., by not requiring the graph to be bipartite), HTP allows strong correlation between foreign language nodes to aid in finding paraphrases.",
        "In the figure, even though E4 and E5 are not linked via a common foreign language node, there is a high probability path linking them (E4, F3, Gi, E5 ).",
        "This allows HTP to find E5 as a reasonable paraphrase of E4.",
        "Third, HTP enables domain knowledge to be incorporated as nodes in the graph.",
        "For example, we could incorporate the domain knowledge that phrases with lots of unigrams in common are likely to be paraphrases.",
        "In Figure 1, the \"feature\" node represents such knowledge, linking E4 and Ei as possible paraphrases even though they have no foreign language nodes in common.",
        "Note that such domain knowledge nodes can be linked to arbitrary nodes, not just English ones.",
        "The HTP algorithm is shown in Table 1.",
        "It takes as input a query phrase and a set of bilingual phrase tables.",
        "The algorithm begins by creating a graph from the phrase tables.",
        "Then it estimates the truncated hitting times of each node from the query node by sampling random walks of length T. Next it prunes nodes (and their associated edges) if their truncated hitting times are equal to T. To the resulting graph, it then adds nodes representing domain knowledge and estimates the truncated hitting times of the nodes by sampling random walks as before.",
        "Finally, it returns the nodes in the same language as the query phrase in order of increasing hitting times.",
        "An obvious approach to creating a graph from bilingual parallel corpora is to create a node for every phrase in the corpora, and two directed edges ( i, j) and ( j, i) for every aligned phrase pair i and j.",
        "Let H refer to the graph that is created in this manner.",
        "Such an approach is only tractable for small bilingual parallel corpora that would result in a small H , but not for large corpora containing millions of sentences, such as those described in Section 4.1.",
        "Therefore we approximate H with a graph H' that only contains nodes \"near\" to the node representing the query phrase.",
        "Specifically, we perform breadth-first search starting from the query node up to a depth d, or until the number of nodes visited in the search has reached a maximum of n nodes.",
        "Some nodes at the periphery of H' have edges to nodes that are not in H' but are in H. For a periphery node j that has edges to nodes ji,..., jk outside H', we create a \"dummy\" node a, and replace edges (j, ji ),..., (j, jk) with a single edge (j, a) with weight X=i Wjjx.",
        "We also add edges (a, j) and ( a, a) (each with a heuristic weight of 0.5).",
        "The dummy nodes and their edges approximate the transition probabilities at H''s periphery.",
        "Our empirical results show that this approximation works well in practice.",

        "Using Equation 1, we estimate the truncated hitting time of each node.",

        "Next we add nodes representing domain knowledge to the pruned graph.",
        "In this version of HTP, we implemented three types of feature nodes.",
        "First, we have n-gram nodes.",
        "These nodes capture the domain knowledge that phrases containing many words in common are likely to be paraphrases.",
        "For each 1 to 4-gram that appears in English phrases, we create an n-gram node a.",
        "We add directed edges ( a, j) and ( j, a) if node j represents an English phrase containing n-gram a.",
        "For example, in Figure 2(a), \"reach the objective\" is connected to \"objective\" because it contains that unigram.",
        "Note that such nodes create short paths between nodes with many n-grams in common, thereby reducing the hitting times between them.",
        "Second, we have \"syntax\" nodes, which represent syntactic classes of the start and end words of English phrases.",
        "We created classes such as interrogatives (\"whose\", \"what\", \"where\", etc.",
        "), articles (\"the\", \"a\", \"an\"), etc.",
        "For each class c, we create syntax nodes ac and a'c to respectively represent the conditions that a phrase begins and ends with a word in class c. Directed edges (ac, j) and (j, ac) are added if node j starts with a word in class c (similarly we add (a', j) and (j, a') if it ends with a word in class c).",
        "For example, in Figure 2(b), \"the objective is\" is linked to \"starts with article\" because it begins with \"the\".",
        "These syntax nodes allow HTP to capture broad commonalities about structural distribution, without requiring syntactic equivalence as in Callison-Burch 2008 (or the use of a parser).",
        "Third, we have \"not-substring/superstring-of\" nodes.",
        "We observed that many English phrases (e.g., \"reach the objective\" and \"reach the\") that are super-strings or substrings of each other tend to be aligned to several shared non-English phrases in the bilingual parallel corpora used in our experiments.",
        "Most such English phrase pairs are not paraphrases, but they are linked by many short paths via their common aligned foreign phrase, and thus have small hitting times.",
        "To counteract this, we create a \"not-substring/superstring-of\" node a.",
        "The query node i is always connected to a via edges (i, a) and (a, i).",
        "We add edges (a, j) and (j, a) if English phrase j is not a substring or superstring of the query phrase (see Figure 2(c)).",
        "With the addition of the above, each node representing an English phrase can have four kinds of outgoing edges: edges to foreign phrase nodes, and edges to the three kinds of feature nodes.",
        "Let fphrase, fngram, fsyntax, J.substring denote the distribution of transition probabilities among the four kinds of outgoing edges.",
        "Note that fphrase + jngram + fsyntax + fsubstring 1.0.",
        "These values are user-specified or can be set with tuning data.",
        "An outgoing edge from English phrase node i that originally had weight (transition probability) Wij will now have weight Wij x fphrase.",
        "All k edges from i to n-gram nodes will have weight Jn9™m.",
        "Likewise for edges to the other two kinds of feature nodes.",
        "Each of the k outgoing edges from a feature node is simply set to have a weight of |.",
        "After adding the feature nodes, we again run M independent length-T random walks to estimate the truncated hitting times of the nodes, and return the English phrase nodes in order of increasing hitting times."

        "As future work, we plan to learn the distribution of weights on edges to phrase nodes and feature nodes automatically from data, rather than tuning them manually, and to develop a probabilistic model supporting HTP.",
