        "This paper considers the problem of training classifiers to detect and correct errors in grammar and word usage in text.",
        "Both native and non-native speakers make a variety of errors that are not always easy to detect.",
        "Consider, for example, the problem of context-sensitive spelling correction (e.g., (Gold-ing and Roth, 1996; Golding and Roth, 1999; Carlson et al., 2001)).",
        "Unlike spelling errors that result in non-words and are easy to detect, context-sensitive spelling correction task involves correcting spelling errors that result in legitimate words, such as confusing peace and piece or your and you're.",
        "The typical training paradigm for these context-sensitive ambiguities is to use text assumed to be error free, replacing each target word occurrence (e.g. peace) with a confusion set consisting of, say {peace, piece}, thus generating both positive and negative examples, respectively, from the same context.",
        "This paper proposes a novel error generation approach to the problem of training classifiers for the purpose of detecting and correcting grammar and usage errors in text.",
        "Unlike previous work (e.g., (Sjobergh and Knutsson, 2005; Brockett et al., 2006; Foster and Andersen, 2009)), we selectively introduce mistakes in an appropriate proportion.",
        "In particular, to create training data that closely resemble text with naturally occurring errors, we use error frequency information and error distribution statistics obtained from corrected non-native text.",
        "We apply the method to the problem of detecting and correcting article mistakes made by learners of English as a Second Language (ESL).",
        "The problem of correcting article errors is generally viewed as that of article selection, cast as a classification problem and is trained as described above: a machine learning algorithm is used to train a classifier on native English data, where the possible selections are used to generate positive and negative examples (e.g., (Izumi et al., 2003; Han et al., 2006; De Felice and Pulman, 2008; Gamon et al., 2008)).",
        "The classifier is then applied to non-native text to predict the correct article in context.",
        "But the article correction problem differs from the problem of article selection in that we know the original (source) article that the writer used.",
        "When proposing a correction, we would like to use information about the original article.",
        "One reason for this is that about 90% of articles are used correctly by ESL learners; this is higher than the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers for article selection.",
        "Consequently, not using the writer's article, when making a prediction, may result in making more mistakes than there are in the data.",
        "Another reason is that statistics on article errors (e.g., (Han et al., 2006; Lee and Sen-eff, 2008)) and in the annotation performed for the present study reveal that non-native English speakers make article mistakes in a consistent manner.",
        "The system can consider the article used by the writer at evaluation time, by proposing a correction only when the confidence of the classifier is high enough, but the article cannot be used in training if the classifier is trained on clean native data that do not have errors.",
        "Learning Theory says that the distribution of examples seen in testing should be as similar as possible to the one seen in training, so one would like to train on errors similar to those observed in testing.",
        "Ideally, we would like to train using corrected non-native text.",
        "In that case, the original article of the writer can be used as a feature for the classifier and the correct article, as judged by a native English speaker, will be viewed as the label.",
        "However, obtaining annotated data for training is expensive and, since the native training data do not contain errors, we cannot use the writer's article as a feature for the classifier.",
        "This paper compares the traditional training paradigm that uses native data to training paradigms that use data with artificial mistakes.",
        "We propose several methods of generating mistakes in native training data and demonstrate that they outperform the traditional training paradigm.",
        "We also show that the most successful error generation methods use knowledge about the article distribution and error patterns observed in the ESL data.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we discuss the baseline on the error correction task and show why the baselines used in selection tasks are not relevant for the error correction task.",
        "Next, we describe prior work in error generation and show the key difference of our approach.",
        "Section 4 presents the ESL data that we use and statistics on article errors.",
        "Section 5 describes training paradigms that employ error generation.",
        "In Sections 6 and 7 we present the results and discuss the results.",
        "The key findings are summarized in Table 7 in Section 6.",
        "We conclude with a brief discussion of directions for future work."

        "For example, in word sense disambiguation, the baseline is the most frequent sense.",

        "The majority has been used as the baseline also in the context-sensitive spelling task (e.g., (Golding and Roth, 1999)).",

        "So the real baseline on the task is \"do nothing\".",
        "Therefore, to determine the baseline for a correction task, one needs to consider the error rate in the data.",
        "Using the definitions of precision and recall and the \"real\" baseline, we can also relate the resulting accuracy of the classifier to the precision and recall on an error correction task as follows: Let P and R denote the precision and recall, respectively, of the system on an error correction task, and Base denote the error rate in the data.",
        "Then the task baseline (i.e., accuracy of the data before running the system) is:",
        "Baseline = 1 – Base",
        "It can be shown that the error rate after running the classifier is:",
        "It follows that the accuracy of the system on the task is 1 – Error.",
        "For example, we can obtain a rough estimate on the accuracy of the system in Han et al.",
        "(2006), using precision and recall numbers by error type.",
        "Excluding the error type of category other, we can estimate that Base = 0.1, so the baseline is 0.9, average precision and recall are 0.85 and 0.25, respectively, and the resulting overall accuracy of the system is 92.2%."

        "Thus, for each language group, we train five system types: one system is trained on clean English data without errors (the same classifier for the three language groups) and four systems are trained on data with errors, where errors are produced using the four methods described in Section 5.",
        "Training data are extracted from English Wikipedia.",
        "All of the five systems employ the same set of features based on three tokens to the right and to the left of the target article.",
        "For each context word, we use its relative position, its part-of-speech tag and the word token itself.",
        "We also use the head of the noun phrase and the conjunctions of the pairs and triples of the six tokens and their part-of-speech tags.",
        "In addition to these features, the classifiers trained on data with errors also use the source article as a feature.",
        "The classifier that is trained on clean English data cannot use the source feature, since in training the source always corresponds to the label.",
        "By contrast, when the training data contain mistakes, the source is not always the same as the label, the situation that we also have with the test (ESL) data.",
        "We refer to the classifier trained on clean data as TrainClean.",
        "We refer to the classifiers trained on data with mistakes as TWE (TrainWithErrors).",
        "There are four types of TWE systems for each language group, one for each of the methods of error generation described in Section 5.",
        "All results are the averaged results of training on three random samples from Wikipedia with two million training examples on each round.",
        "All five classifiers are trained on exactly the same set of Wikipedia examples, except that we add article mistakes to the data used by the TWE systems.",
        "The TrainClean system achieves an accuracy of 87.10% on data from English Wikipedia.",
        "This performance is state-of-theart compared to other systems reported in the literature (Knight and Chander, 1994; Minnen et al.,",
        "De Felice and Pulman, 2008).",
        "The best results of 92.15% are reported by De Felice and Pulman (2008).",
        "But their system uses sophisticated syntactic features and they observe that the parser does not perform well on non-native data.",
        "As mentioned in Section 4, the annotation of the ESL data consisted of correcting all errors in the sentence.",
        "We exclude from evaluation examples that have spelling errors in the 3-word window around the target article and errors on words that immediately precede or immediately follow the article, as such examples would obscure the evaluation of the training paradigms.",
        "Tables 4, 5 and 6 show performance by language group.",
        "The tables show the accuracy and the error reduction on the test set.",
        "The results of systems TWE (methods 2 and 3) that use the distribution of articles before and after annotation are merged and appear as ArtDistr in the tables, since, as shown in Table 1, these distributions are very similar and thus produce similar results.",
        "Each table compares the performance of the TrainClean system to the performance of the four systems trained on data with errors.",
        "For all language groups, all classifiers of type TWE outperform the TrainClean system.",
        "The reduction in error rate is consistent when the TWE classifiers are compared to the TrainClean system.",
        "Table 7 shows results for all three languages, comparing for each language group the TrainClean classifier to the best performing system of type TWE.",
        "Table 4: Chinese speakers: Performance of the T rainClean system (without errors in training) and of the best classifiers of type TWE.",
        "Rows 2-4 show the performance of the systems trained with error generation methods described in 5.",

        "It should be noted that the TrainClean system also makes use of the article chosen by the author through a confidence threshold; it prefers to keep the article chosen by the user.",

        "We also note that the best performing TWE systems forChinese and Russian speakers are those that rely on the distribution of articles (Chinese) and the distribution of errors (Russian), but for Czech it is the General TWE system that performs the best, maybe because we had less data for Czech speakers, so their statistics are less reliable.",

        "Since ArtDistr and ErrorDistr depend on the statistics of learner mistakes, the success of the systems that use these methods for error generation depends on the accuracy of these statistics, and we only have between 100 and 250 errors for each language group.",

        "The focus of the present study was on training paradigms.",
        "While it is quite possible that the article correction system presented here can be improved - we would like to explore improving the system by using a more sophisticated feature set - we believe that the performance gap due to the error driven training paradigms shown here will remain.",
        "The reason is that even with better features, some of the features that hold in the native data will not be active in in the ESL writing.",
        "Finally, while this study focused on the problem of correcting article mistakes, we plan to apply the proposed training paradigms to similar text correction problems."
