        "Automatic detection of dialogue structure is an important first step toward deep understanding of human conversations.",
        "Dialogue acts provide an initial level of structure by annotating utterances with shallow discourse roles such as \"statement\", \"question\" and \"answer\".",
        "These acts are useful in many applications, including conversational agents (Wilks, 2006), dialogue systems (Allen et al., 2007), dialogue summarization (Murray et al., 2006), and flirtation detection (Ranganath et al., 2009).",
        "Dialogue act tagging has traditionally followed an annotate-train-test paradigm, which begins with the",
        "*This work was conducted at Microsoft Research.",
        "Also called \"speech acts\"",
        "design of annotation guidelines, followed by the collection and labeling of corpora (Jurafsky et al., 1997; Dhillon et al., 2004).",
        "Only then can one train a tagger to automatically recognize dialogue acts (Stol-cke et al., 2000).",
        "This paradigm has been quite successful, but the labeling process is both slow and expensive, limiting the amount of data available for training.",
        "The expense is compounded as we consider new methods of communication, which may require not only new annotations, but new annotation guidelines and new dialogue acts.",
        "This issue becomes more pressing as the Internet continues to expand the number of ways in which we communicate, bringing us e-mail, newsgroups, IRC, forums, blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and whatever is on the horizon.",
        "Previous work has taken a variety of approaches to dialogue act tagging in new media.",

        "They manually restructure the source act inventories in an attempt to create coarse, domain-independent acts.",
        "Each approach relies on a human designer to inject knowledge into the system through the inventory of available acts.",
        "As an alternative solution for new media, we propose a series of unsupervised conversation models, where the discovery of acts amounts to clustering utterances with similar conversational roles.",
        "This avoids manual construction of an act inventory, and allows the learning algorithm to tell us something about how people converse in a new medium.",
        "There is surprisingly little work in unsupervised dialogue act tagging.",
        "Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) propose an unsupervised Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for dialogue structure in a meeting scheduling domain, but model dialogue state at the word level.",

        "In contrast to previous work, we address the problem of discovering dialogue acts in an informal, open-topic domain, where an unsupervised learner may be distracted by strong topic clusters.",
        "We also train and test our models in a new medium: Twitter.",
        "Rather than test against existing dialogue inventories, we evaluate using qualitative visualizations and a novel conversation ordering task, to ensure our models have the opportunity to discover dialogue phenomena unique to this medium.",
        "To enable the study of large-data solutions to dialogue modeling, we have collected a corpus of 1.3 million conversations drawn from the micro-blogging service, Twitter.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the largest corpus of naturally occurring chat data that has been available for study thus far.",
        "Similar datasets include the NUS SMS corpus (How and Kan, 2005), several IRC chat corpora (Elsner and blog datasets (Yano et al., 2009; Gamon et al., 2008), which can display conversational structure in the blog comments.",
        "As it characterizes itself as a micro-blog, it should not be surprising that structurally, Twitter conversations lie somewhere between chat and blogs.",
        "Like blogs, conversations on Twitter occur in a public environment, where they can be collected for research purposes.",
        "However, Twitter posts are restricted to be no longer than 140 characters, which keeps interactions chat-like.",
        "Like email and unlike IRC, Twitter conversations are carried out by replying to specific posts.",
        "The Twitter API provides a link from each reply to the post it is responding to, allowing accurate thread reconstruction without requiring a conversation disentanglement step (Elsner and Char-niak, 2008).",
        "The proportion of posts on Twitter that are conversational in nature are somewhere around 37% (Kelly, 2009).",
        "To collect this corpus, we crawled Twitter using its publicly available API.",
        "We monitored the public timeline to obtain a sample of active Twitter users.",
        "To expand our user list, we also crawled up to 10 users who had engaged in dialogue with each seed user.",

        "The resulting corpus consists of about 1.3 million conversations, with each conversation containing between 2 and 243 posts.",
        "The majority of conversations on Twitter are very short; those of length 2 (one status post and a reply) account for 69% of the data.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, the frequencies of conversation lengths follow a power-law relationship.",
        "While the style of writing used on Twitter is widely varied, much of the text is very similar to SMS text messages.",

        "The sequence model could instead partition entire conversations into topics, such as food, computers and music, and then predict that each topic self-transitions with high probability: if we begin talking about food, we are likely to continue to do so.",
        "Since we began with a content model, it is perhaps not surprising that our Conversation Model tends to discover a mixture of dialogue and topic structure.",
        "Several high probability posts from a topic-focused cluster discovered by EM are shown in Table 2.",
        "These clusters are undesirable, as they have little to do with dialogue structure.",
        "In general, unsupervised sentence clustering techniques need some degree of direction when a particular level of granularity is desired.",
        "Barzilay and Lee (2004) mask named entities in their content models, forcing their model to cluster topics about earthquakes in general, and not instances of specific earthquakes.",
        "This solution is not a good fit for Twitter.",
        "As explained in Section 2, Twitter's noisiness resists off-the-shelf tools, such as named-entity recognizers and noun-phrase chunkers.",
        "Furthermore, we would require a more drastic form of preprocessing in order to mask all topic words, and not just alter the topic granularity.",
        "During development, we explored coarse methods to abstract away content while maintaining syntax, such as replacing tokens with either parts-of-speech or automaticallygenerated word clusters, but we found that these approaches degrade model performance.",
        "Another approach to filtering out topic information leaves the data intact, but modifies the model to account for topic.",
        "To that end, we adopt a Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA, framework (Blei et al., 2003) similar to approaches used recently in summarization (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",

        "• The conversation's topic",
        "• General English",
        "The extended model is shown in Figure 3.",
        "In addition to act emission and transition parameters, the model now includes a conversation-specific word multinomial 6k that represents the topic, as well as a universal general English multinomial ipE- A new hidden variable, s determines the source of each word, and is drawn from a conversation-specific distribution over sources 7Tfc.",
        "Following LDA conventions, we place a symmetric Dirichlet prior over each of the multinomials.",
        "Dirichlet concentration parameters for act emission, act transition, conversation topic, general English, and source become the hyper-parameters of our model.",
        "The multinomials 6 k, ftk and ipE create non-local dependencies in our model, breaking our HMM dynamic programing.",
        "Therefore we adopt Gibbs sampling as our inference engine.",
        "Each hidden variable is sampled in turn, conditioned on a complete assignment of all other hidden variables throughout the data set.",
        "Again following LDA convention, we carry out collapsed sampling, where the various multinomials are integrated out, and are never explicitly estimated.",
        "This results in a sampling sequence where for each post we first sample its act, and then sample a source for each word in the post.",
        "The hidden act and source variables are sampled according to the following transition distributions:",
        "Ptrans(ai\\a._i,S,w) OC Wi",
        "These probabilities can be computed analogously to the calculations used in the collapsed sampler for a bigram HMM (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), and those used for LDA (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "Note that our model contains five hyperparame-ters.",
        "Rather than attempt to set them using an expensive grid search, we treat the concentration parameters as additional hidden variables and sample each in turn, conditioned on the current assignment to all other variables.",
        "Because these variables are continuous, we apply slice sampling (Neal, 2003).",
        "Slice sampling is a general technique for drawing samples from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the area under its density function.",
        "In Section 4.2 we evaluate our models by comparing their probability on held-out test conversations.",
        "As computing this probability exactly is intractable in our model, we employ a recently proposed Chibb-style estimator (Murray and Salakhutdinov, 2008; Wallach et al., 2009).",
        "Chibb estimators estimate the probability of unseen data, P(w) by selecting a high probability assignment to hidden variables h*, and taking advantage of the following equality which can be easily derived from the definition of conditional probability:",
        "As the numerator can be computed exactly, this reduces the problem of estimating P(w) to the easier problem of estimating P(h*|w).",
        "Murray and Salakhutdinov (2008) provide an unbiased estimator for P(h*|w), which is calculated using the stationary distribution of the Gibbs sampler.",
        "Given the infrastructure necessary for the Conver-sation+Topic model described above, it is straightforward to also implement a Bayesian version of of the conversation model described in Section 3.1.",
        "This amounts to replacing the add-a; smoothing of dialogue act emission and transition probabilities with (potentially sparse) Dirichlet priors, and replacing EM with Gibbs sampling.",
        "There is reason to believe that integrating out multinomials and using sparse priors will improve the performance of the conversation model, as improvements have been observed when using a Bayesian HMM for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007)."

        "In general, we found that using Bayesian inference outperforms EM.",
        "Also note that the Bayesian Conversation model outperforms the Conversation+Topic model at predicting conversation order.",
        "This is likely because modeling conversation content as a sequence can in some cases help to predict post ordering; for example, adjacent posts are more likely to contain similar content words.",
        "Recall though that we found the Conversation+Topic model to be far more interpretable.",
        "Additionally we compare the likelihood of these models on held out test data in Figure 6.",
        "Note that the Bayesian methods produce models with much higher likelihood.",
        "For the EM models, likelihood tends to decrease on held out test data as we increase the number of hidden states, due to overfitting."

        "We have presented an approach that allows the unsupervised induction of dialogue structure from naturally-occurring open-topic conversational data.",
        "Figure 6: Negative log likelihood on held out test data (smaller values indicate higher likelihood).",
        "By visualizing the learned models, coherent patterns emerge from a stew of data that human readers find difficult to follow.",
        "We have extended a conversation sequence model to separate topic and dialogue words, resulting in an interpretable set of automatically generated dialogue acts.",
        "These discovered acts have interesting differences from those found in other domains, and reflect Twitter's nature as a micro-blog.",
        "We have introduced the task of conversation ordering as an intrinsic measure of conversation model quality.",
        "We found this measure quite useful in the development of our models and algorithms, although our experiments show that it does not necessarily correlate with interpretability.",
        "We have directly compared Bayesian inference to EM on our conversation ordering task, showing a clear advantage for Bayesian methods.",
        "Finally, we have collected a corpus of 1.3 million Twitter conversations, which we will make available to the research community, and which we hope will be useful beyond the study of dialogue.",
        "In the future, we wish to scale our models to the full corpus, and extend them with more complex notions of discourse, topic and community.",
        "Ultimately, we hope to put the learned conversation structure to use in the construction of a data-driven, conversational agent."
