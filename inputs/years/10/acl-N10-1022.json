        "Given the model structure and parameters, one can modify Fano's Inequality as follows, Corollary 1 where Pe(9) is the classifier probability of error given model parameters, 6 and Here, Hq(Y|X) is the conditional entropy imposed by model parameters.",

        "These methods are all based on the fact that models with low conditional entropy have their decision boundaries passing through low-density regions of the input distribution, P(X).",
        "This is consistent with the assumption that classes are well separated so that one can expect to take advantage of unlabeled examples (Grandvalet and Bengio, 2004).",
        "In many cases shifting from one domain to another domain, initial trained decision boundaries (on out-of-domain data) result in high conditional entropy for the new domain, due to mismatch between distributions.",
