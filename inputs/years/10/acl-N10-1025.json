        "Even with a vocabulary of one hundred thousand words, a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system encounters out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, especially in new domains or genres.",
        "New words often include named entities, foreign words, rare and invented words.",
        "Since these words were not seen during training, the LVCSR system has no way to recognize them.",
        "OOV words are an important source of error in LVCSR systems for three reasons.",
        "First, OOVs can never be recognized by the LVCSR system, even if repeated.",
        "Second, OOV words contribute to recognition errors in surrounding words, which propagate into to later processing stages (translation, understanding, document retrieval, etc.).",
        "Third, OOVs are often information-rich nouns - mis-recognized OOVs can have a greater impact on the understanding of the transcript than other words.",
        "One solution is to simply increase the LVCSR system's vocabulary, but there are always new words.",
        "Additionally, increasing the vocabulary size without limit can sometimes produce higher word error rates (WER), leading to a tradeoff between recognition accuracy of frequent and rare words.",
        "A more effective solution is to detect the presence of OOVs directly.",
        "Once identified, OOVs can be flagged for annotation and addition to the system's vocabulary, or OOV segments can be transcribed with a phone recognizer, creating an open vocabulary LVCSR system.",
        "Identified OOVs prevent error propagation in the application pipeline.",
        "In the literature, there are two basic approaches to OOV detection: 1) filler models, which explicitly represent OOVs using a filler, sub-word, or generic word model (Bazzi, 2002; Schaaf, 2001; Bisani and Ney, 2005; Klakow et al., 1999; Wang, 2009); and 2) confidence estimation models, which use different confidence scores to find unreliable regions and label them as OOV (Lin et al., 2007; Burget et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2001; Wessel et al., 2001).",
        "Recently, Rastrow et al.",
        "(2009a) presented an approach that combined confidence estimation models and filler models to improve state-of-the-art results for OOV detection.",
        "This approach and other confidence based systems (Hazen and Bazzi, 2001; Lin et al., 2007), treat OOV detection as a binary classification task; each region is independently classified using local information as IV or OOV.",
        "This work moves beyond this independence assumption that considers regions independently for OOV detection.",
        "We treat OOV detection as a sequence labeling problem and add features based on the local lexical context of each region as well as global features from a language model using the entire utterance.",
        "Our results show that such information improves OOV detection and we obtain large reductions in error compared to the best previously reported results.",
        "Furthermore, our approach can be combined with any confidence based system.",
        "We begin by reviewing the current state-of-the-art results for OOV detection.",
        "After describing our experimental setup, we generalize the framework to a sequence labeling problem, which includes features from the local context, lexical context, and entire utterance.",
        "Each stage yields additional improvements over the baseline system.",
        "We conclude with a review of related work."

        "MaxEnt achieved similar performance for observed and unobserved OOVs so we only include a single combined result.",
        "Note that the MaxEnt curve flattens at 26% false alarms, while the CRF continues to decrease.",
        "The elbow in the MaxEnt curve corresponds to the probability threshold at which no other labeled OOV region has a non-zero OOV score (regions with zero entropy and no fragments).",
        "In this case, the CRF model can still rely on the context to predict a nonzero OOV score.",
        "This helps applications where misses are more heavily penalized than false alarms."
