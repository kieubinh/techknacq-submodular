        "Predicting gross revenue for movies is a problem that has been studied in economics, marketing, statistics, and forecasting.",
        "Apart from the economic value of such predictions, we view the forecasting problem as an application of NLP.",
        "In this paper, we use the text of critics' reviews to predict opening weekend revenue.",
        "We also consider metadata for each movie that has been shown to be successful for similar prediction tasks in previous work.",
        "There is a large body of prior work aimed at predicting gross revenue of movies (Simonoff and Sparrow, 2000; Sharda and Delen, 2006; inter alia).",
        "Certain information is used in nearly all prior work on these tasks, such as the movie's genre, MPAA rating, running time, release date, the number of screens on which the movie debuted, and the presence of particular actors or actresses in the cast.",
        "Most prior text-based work has used automatic text analysis tools, deriving a small number of aggregate statistics.",
        "For example, Mishne and Glance (2006) applied sentiment analysis techniques to pre-release and postrelease blog posts about movies and showed higher",
        "*We appreciate reviewer feedback and technical advice from Brendan O'Connor.",
        "This work was supported by NSFIIS-0803482, NSF IIS-0844507, and DARPA NBCH-1080004.",
        "correlation between actual revenue and sentiment-based metrics, as compared to mention counts of the movie.",
        "(They did not frame the task as a revenue prediction problem.)",
        "Zhang and Skiena (2009) used a news aggregation system to identify entities and obtain domain-specific sentiment for each entity in several domains.",
        "They used the aggregate sentiment scores and mention counts of each movie in news articles as predictors.",
        "While there has been substantial prior work on using critics' reviews, to our knowledge all of this work has used polarity of the review or the number of stars given to it by a critic, rather than the review text directly (Terry et al., 2005).",
        "Our task is related to sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002) on movie reviews.",
        "The key difference is that our goal is to predict a future real-valued quantity, restricting us from using any post-release text data such as user reviews.",
        "Further, the most important clues about revenue may have little to do with whether the reviewer liked the movie, but rather what the reviewer found worth mentioning.",
        "This paper is more in the tradition of Ghose et al.",
        "(2007) and Kogan et al.",
        "(2009), who used text regression to directly quantify review \"value\" and make predictions about future financial variables, respectively.",
        "Our aim in using the full text is to identify particular words and phrases that predict the movie-going tendencies of the public.",
        "We can also perform syntactic and semantic analysis on the text to identify richer constructions that are good predictors.",
        "Furthermore, since we consider multiple reviews for each movie, we can compare these features across reviews to observe how they differ both in frequency and predictive performance across different media outlets and individual critics.",
        "In this paper, we use linear regression from text and non-text (meta) features to directly predict gross revenue aggregated over the opening weekend, and the same averaged per screen.",
        "We gathered data for movies released in 2005-2009.",
        "For these movies, we obtained metadata and a list of hyperlinks to movie reviews by crawling Meta-Critic (www.metacritic.com).",
        "The metadata include the name of the movie, its production house, the set of genres it belongs to, the scriptwriter(s), the director(s), the country of origin, the primary actors and actresses starring in the movie, the release date, its MPAA rating, and its running time.",
        "From The Numbers (www.the-numbers.com), we retrieved each movie's production budget, opening weekend gross revenue, and the number of screens on which it played during its opening weekend.",
        "Only movies found on both MetaCritic and The Numbers were included.",
        "Next we chose seven review websites that most frequently appeared in the review lists for movies at Metacritic, and obtained the text of the reviews by scraping the raw HTML.",
        "The sites chosen were the Austin Chronicle, the Boston Globe, the LA Times, Entertainment Weekly, the New York Times, Variety, and the Village Voice.",
        "We only chose those reviews that appeared on or before the release date of the movie (to ensure that revenue information is not present in the review), arriving at a set of 1718 movies with at least one review.",
        "We partitioned this set of movies temporally into training (2005-2007), development (2008) and test (2009) sets.",
        "Not all movies had reviews at all sites (see Table 1)."

        "We consider two response variables, both in U.S. dollars: the total revenue generated by a movie during its release weekend, and the per screen revenue during the release weekend.",
        "We evaluate these predictions using (1) mean absolute error (MAE) in U.S. dollars and (2) Pearson's correlation between the actual and predicted revenue.",
        "We use linear regression to directly predict the opening weekend gross earnings, denoted y, based on features x extracted from the movie metadata and/or the text of the reviews.",
        "That is, given an input feature vector x G Rp, we predict an output y G R using a linear model: y = ß0 + xTß.",
        "To learn values for the parameters 6 = (ßo, ß), the standard approach is to minimize the sum of squared errors for a training set containing n pairs (xi,yi) where Xj G Rp and yj G R for 1 < i < n:",
        "A penalty term P (ß) is included in the objective for regularization.",
        "Classical solutions use an l2 or l1norm, known respectively as ridge and lasso regression.",
        "Introduced recently is a mixture of the two, called the elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005):",
        "where a G (0,1) determines the trade-off between li and l2 regularization.",
        "For our experiments we used the elastic net and specifically the glmnet package which contains an implementation of an efficient coordinate ascent procedure for training (Friedman et al., 2008).",
        "We tune the a and A parameters on our development set and select the model with the (a, A) combination that yields minimum MAE on the development set."

        "We considered seven types of metadata features, and evaluated their performance by adding them to our pool of features in the following order: whether the film is of U.S. origin, running time (in minutes), the logarithm of its budget, # opening screens, genre (e.g., Action, Comedy) and MPAA rating (e.g., G, PG, PG-13), whether the movie opened on a holiday weekend or in summer months, total count as well as of presence of individual Oscar-winning actors and directors and high-grossing actors.",
        "For the first task of predicting the total opening weekend revenue of a movie, the best-performing feature set in terms of MAE turned out to be all the features.",
        "However, for the second task of predicting the per screen revenue, addition of the last feature subset consisting of information related to the actors and directors hurt performance (MAE increased).",
