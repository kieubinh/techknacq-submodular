        "Document summarization, as captured in modern comparative evaluations such as TAC and DUC, is mostly conceived as a \"one-shot\" task.",

        "This paper present a simple extension of a well-known algorithm, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Goldstein et al., 2000), that places the user in the loop.",
        "MMR is an iterative algorithm, where at each step a candidate extract c (e.g., a sentence) is assigned the following score:",
        "The score consists of two components: the relevance of the candidate c with respect to the query q (Rel) and the similarity of the candidate c to each extract s in the current summary S (Sim).",
        "The maximum score from these similarity comparisons is subtracted from the relevance score, subjected to a tuning parameter that controls the emphasis on relevance and anti-redundancy.",
        "Scores are recomputed after each step and the algorithm iterates until a stopping criterion has been met (e.g., length quota).",
        "We propose a simple extension to MMR: at each step, we interactively ask the user to select the best sentence for inclusion in the summary.",
        "That is, instead of the system automatically selecting the candidate with the highest score, it presents the user with a ranked list of candidates for selection."

        "Weighted recall captures how much relevant information is contained in the system response (weighted by each nugget's importance, with an upper bound of one).",
        "Responses that achieve higher nugget recall at shorter length increments are desirable in providing concise, informative answers.",
