        "First we explored information retrieval based topic analysis to extract relevant sentences to the given topics for polarity classification.",

        "Sentimental analysis is a task of text categorization that focuses on recognizing and classifying opinionated text towards a given subject.",
        "Different levels of sentimental analysis has been performed in prior work, from binary classes to more fine grained categories.",
        "Pang et al.",
        "(2002) defined this task as a binary classification task and applied it to movie reviews.",
        "More sentiment classes, such as document objectivity and subjectivity as well as different rating scales on the subjectivity, have also been taken into consideration (Pang and Lee, 2005; Boiy et al., 2007).",
        "In terms of granularity, this task has been investigated from building word level sentiment lexicon (Turney, 2002; Moilanen and Pulman, 2008) to detecting phrase-level (Wilson et al., 2005; Agarwal et al., 2009) and sentence-level (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004) sentiment orientation.",
        "However, most previous work has mainly focused on reviews (Pang et al., 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004), news resources (Wilson et al., 2005), and multi-domain adaptation (Blitzer et al., 2007; Man-sour et al., 2008).",
        "Sentiment analysis on blogs (Chesley et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009) is still at its early stage.",
        "In this paper we investigate binary polarity classification (positive vs. negative).",
        "We evaluate the genre effect between blogs and review data and show the difference of feature effectiveness.",
        "We demonstrate improved polarity classification performance in blogs using two methods: (a) integrating topic relevance analysis to perform topic specific polarity classification; (b) adopting an adaptive method by incorporating multiple classifiers' hypotheses from different review domains as features.",
        "Our manual analysis also points out some challenges and directions for further study in blog domain."

      "text": [
        "For the binary polarity classification task, we use a supervised learning framework to determine whether a document is positive or negative.",
        "We used a subjective lexicon, containing 2304 positive words and 4145 negative words respectively, based on (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "The features we explored are listed below.",
        "(i) Lexical features (LF)",
        "We use the bag of words for the lexical features as they have been shown very useful in previous work.",
        "(ii) Polarized lexical features (PL)",
        "We tagged each sentiment word in our data set with its polarity tag based on the sentiment lexicon (\"POS\" for positive, and \"NEG\" for negative), along with its part-of-speech tag.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"It is good, and I like it\", \"good\" is tagged as \"POS/ADJ\", \"like\" is tagged as \"POS/VRB\".",
        "Then we encode the number of the polarized tags in a document as features.",
        "(iii) Polarized bigram features (PB)",
        "Contextual information around the polarized words can be useful for sentimental analysis.",
        "A word may flip the polarity of its neighboring sentiment words even though this word itself is not necessarily a negative word.",
        "For example, in \"Given her sudden celebrity with those on the left... \" (a sentence in a political blog), \"sudden\" preceding \"celebrity\" implies the author's negative attitude towards \"her\".",
        "We combine the sentiment word's polarized tag and its following and preceding word or its part-of-speech to comprise different bigram features to represent this kind of contextual information.",
        "For example, in \"I recommend this.",
        "\", \"recommend\" is a positive verb, denoted as \"POS/VRB\", and the bigram features including this tag and its previous word \"I\" are \"I_POS/VRB\" and \"pron_POS/VRB\".",
        "(iv) Transition word features (T)",
        "Transition words, such as \"although\", \"even though\", serve as function words that may change the literal opinion polarity in the current sentence.",
        "This information has not been widely explored for sentiment analysis.",
        "In this study, we compiled a transition word list containing 31 words.",
        "We use the co-occurring feature between a transition word and its nearby content words (noun, verb, adjective and adverb) or polarized tags of sentiment words within the same sentence, but not spanning over other transition words.",
        "For example, in \"Although it is good\", we use features like \"although_is\",\"although_good\" and \"although_POS/ADJ\", where \"POS/ADJ\" is the PL feature for word \"good\"."

        "We use 6,896 positive and 5,300 negative blogs.",
        "For the review data, we combined multiple review data sets from (Pang et al., 2002; Blitzer et al., 2007) together.",

        "We notice that incorporating our proposed transition feature (T) always achieves some gain on different feature settings, suggesting that those transition features are useful for sentimental analysis on reviews.",
        "From Table 1, we can see that overall the performance on blogs is worse than on the review data.",
        "We hypothesize this may be due to the large variation in terms of contents and styles in blogs.",
        "Regarding the feature effectiveness, we also observe some differences between blogs and reviews.",
        "Adding the polarized bigram feature and transition feature (PB and T) individually can yield some improvement; however, adding both of them did not result in any further improvement - performance degrades compared to LF+PB.",
        "Interestingly, although \"PL\" feature alone does not seem to help, by adding \"PL\" and \"T\" together, the performance achieved the best accuracy of 72.74%.",
        "We also found that adding all the features together hurts the performance, suggesting that different features interact with each other and some do not combine well (e.g., PB and T features).",
        "In addition, all the improvements here are not statistically significant.",
        "Note that for the blog data, we randomly split them for the cross validation experiments regardless of the queries.",

        "Only 66 queries were kept for this experiments - we did not include those queries that have fewer than 10 relevant blogs.",
        "The results for the query balanced split on blogs are shown in Figure 1.",
        "We also include results for the five individual review data sets in order to see the topic effect.",
        "We present results using four representative feature sets chosen according to Table 1.",
        "For the review data, we notice some difference across different data sets, suggesting their inherent difference in terms of task difficulty.",
        "We observe slight performance increase for some feature sets using the query balanced setup for blog data, but overall it is still much worse than the review data.",
        "This shows that the query unbalanced training/test split does not explain the performance gap between blogs and reviews.",
        "This is consistent with (Zhang et al., 2007) that found that a query-independent classifier performs even better than query-dependent one.",
