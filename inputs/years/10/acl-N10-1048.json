        "This short paper has three aims: firstly, to motivate the importance of this task, both in terms of the benefits of expository dialogue as a way to present information and in terms of potential applications; secondly, to introduce a parallel corpus of monologues and dialogues which enables a data-driven approach to this challenge; and, finally, to describe work-in-progress on semi-automatic construction of Monologue-to-Dialogue (M2D) generation rules."

        "The tasks of text generation - e.g., Reiter et al.",
        "(2005) and Demir et al.",
        "(2008) - and generation in dialogue - e.g., Stent (2002) and DeVault et al.",
        "(2008) - are central topics in Natural Language Generation (NLG).",
        "What sets the two tasks apart is the interactive nature of dialogue, where participants need to adapt their contributions to each other.",
        "This paper introduces an NLG task, the generation of expository dialogue, to the Computational Linguistics community which occupies the middle ground between these two tasks.",
        "An expository dialogue is an authored conversation between two fictive characters.",
        "It can be presented as text, audio or film.",
        "Although there is no real-time interactivity, in expository dialogue the contributions of the characters do need to mesh with each other.",
        "The main purpose of expository dialogue is to present information (a description, explanation or definition) to the reader, hearer or viewer, in contrast with dramatic dialogue, which tells a story.",
        "The use of expository dialogue goes back as far as Plato (c. 470-399 BC), who expressed his ideas as dialogues between Socrates and his contemporaries.",
        "Recently, a number of empirical studies show that for some purposes expository dialogue has advantages over monologue: for learners, dialogue can be more memorable, stimulate them to formulate their own questions (Craig et al., 2000), and get them to talk with each other (Lee et al., 1998).",
        "Expository dialogue has also been found to be more effective for persuasion (Suzuki and Yamada, 2004).",
        "Additionally, dialogue lends itself very well for multimedia presentations by computer-animated agents (Andre et al., 2000; van Deemter et al., 2008).",
        "Potential application domains include education, (serious) games and E-Health.",
        "In education, information from textbooks could be presented in dialogue form, possibly using virtual reality platforms such as Second Life.",
        "Automatically generating dialogue from text for non-player characters could have a tremendous impact on the gaming industry; e.g., (IGDA Game Writers SIG, 2003) state that the amount of dialogue script for a character-driven computer game is usually many times that for the average film.",
        "In connection with E-health, consider patient information leaflets, which are often left unread; presenting them as movies between a virtual pharmacist and client may help address this.",
        "Thus instead of being presented with",
        "(1) a.",
        "You can take aspirin, b. if you have a headache.",
        "c. Though aspirin does have side effects:",
        "d. it can harm circulation.",
        "the patient could watch a movie on their mobile device of an exchange between a virtual client (layman, L) and pharmacist (expert, E):",
        "E: You can take aspirin L: But does it have side effects?",
        "E: Yes, it can harm circulation.",
        "So far, research on generating expository dialogue has been firmly rooted in classical AI approaches.",
        "Work in this area starts from knowledge representations or databases (Andre et al., 2000), and even research that does take text as input - e.g., Piwek et al.",
        "(2007) describe a system for generating dialogues such as Example 2 - relies on handcrafted rules.",
        "Two challenges present themselves for NLP research: 1) generation of expository dialogue from text, and 2) use of data-driven, rather than manually authored, generation rules.",
        "Apart from the cost of manually authoring generation rules, previous research has found that human-authored rules can result in 'too much information [being] given too quickly' (Williams et al., 2007), which can be addressed by conversational padding.",
        "We argue that rather than trying to invent padding rules, the best strategy is to learn rules automatically from professionally authored dialogues."

        "It consists of professionally authored dialogues that have been aligned with monologues (written by ourselves) expressing the same information.",
