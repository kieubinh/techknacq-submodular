        "Hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero, (Chiang, 2005)) has proven to be a very useful compromise between syntactically informed and purely corpus-driven translation.",
        "By automatically learning synchronous grammar rules from parallel text, Hiero captures short-and long-distance reorderings consistently and efficiently.",
        "However, implementations of Hiero generally forbid adjacent nonterminal symbols on the source side of hierarchical rules, a practice we will refer to as the non-adjacent nonterminals constraint.",
        "The main argument against such rules is that they cause the system to produce multiple derivations that all lead to the same translation a form of redundancy known as spurious ambiguity.",
        "Spurious ambiguity can lead to drastic reductions in decoding efficiency, and the obvious solutions, such as reducing beam width, erode translation quality.",
        "In Section 2, we argue that the non-adjacent nonterminals constraints severely limits Hiero's generalization power, limiting its coverage of important reordering phenomena.",
        "In Section 3, we discuss the challenges that arise in relaxing this constraint.",
        "In Section 4 we introduce new methods to address those challenges, and Section 5 validates the approach empirically.",
        "Improving Hiero via variations on rule pruning and filtering is well explored, e.g., (Chiang, 2005; Chiang et al., 2008; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), to name just a few.",
        "These proposals differ from each other mainly in the specific linguistic knowledge being used, and on which side the constraints are applied.",
        "In contrast, we complement previous work by showing that adding rules to Hiero can provide benefits if done judiciously."

        "Our motivations largely follow Menezes and Quirk's (2007) discussion of reorderings and generalization.",
        "As a specific example, we will use a Chinese to English verb phrase (VP) translation (Fig.",
        "1), which represents one of the most prominent phrase constructions in Chinese.",
        "Here the construction of the Chinese VP involves joining a prepositional phrase (PP) and a smaller verbal phrase (VP-A), with the preposition at the beginning as a PP marker.",
        "In the translation, the VP-A precedes the PP, a shift from pre-verbal PP in Chinese to post-verbal in English.",

        "Hiero can correctly translate the example if it learns any of the following rules from training data:",
        "However, in practice, data sparsity makes the chance of learning these rules rather slim.",
        "For instance, learning Rule 1 depends on training data containing instances of the shift with identical wording for the VP-A, which belongs to an open word class.",
        "If Hiero fails to learn any of the above rules, it will apply the \"glue rules\" S – (S Xi, S Xi) and S – (X, X).",
        "But these glue rules clearly cannot model the VP-A's movement.",
        "In failing to learn Rules 1 -3, Hiero has no choice but to translate VP-A in a monotone order.",
        "On the other hand, consider the following rules with adjacent nonterminals on the source side (or XX rules, for brevity):",
        "Note that although XX rules 4-6 can potentially increase the chance of modeling the pre-verbal to post-verbal shift, not all of them are beneficial to learn.",
        "For instance, Rule 5 models the word order shift but introduces spurious ambiguity, since the nonterminals are translated in monotone order.",
        "Rule 6, which resembles the inverted rule of the Inversion Transduction Grammar (Wu, 1997), is highly ambiguous because its application has no lexical grounding.",
        "Rule 4 avoids both problems, and is also easier to learn, since it is lexically anchored by a preposition, îï(at), which we can expect to appear frequently in training.",
        "These observations will motivate us to focus on rules that model non-monotone reordering of phrases surrounding a lexical item on the target side."

      "heading": "3. Addressing XX Rule Challenges",
      "text": [
        "The first challenge created by introducing XX rules is computational: relaxing the constraint significantly increases the grammar size.",
        "Motivated by our earlier discussion, we address this by permitting only rules that model non-monotone reordering, i.e.",
        "those rules whose nonterminals are projected into the target language in a different word order, leaving monotone mappings to be handled by the glue rules as previously.",
        "This choice helps keep the search space more manageable, and also avoids spurious ambiguity.",
        "In addition, we disallow rules in which nonterminals are adjacent on both the source and target sides, by imposing the non adjacent nonterminal constraint on the target side whenever the constraint is relaxed on the source side.",
        "This forces any non-monotone reorderings to always be grounded in lexical evidence.",
        "We refer to the permitted subset of XX rules as XX-nonmono rules.",
        "The second challenge involves modeling: introducing XX rules places them in competition with the existing glue rules.",
        "In particular, these two kinds of rules try to model the same phenomena, namely the translations of phrases that appear next to each other.",
        "However, they differ in terms of the features associated with the rules.",
        "XX rules will be associated with the same features as any other hierarchical rules, since they are all learned via an identical training method.",
        "In contrast, glue rules are introduced into the grammar in an ad hoc manner, and the only feature associated with them is a \"glue penalty\".",
        "These distinct feature sets makes direct comparison of scores unreliable.",
        "As a result the decoder may simply prefer to always select glue rules because they are associated with fewer features resulting in adjacent phrases always being translated in a monotone order.",
        "To address this issue, we introduce a new model, which we call the target-side function words orientation-based model, or simply Porn, which evaluates the application of the two kinds of rules on the same context, i.e. for our example, it is the function word S (at)."

      "text": [
        "The model is motivated by the function words reordering hypothesis (Setiawan et al., 2007), which suggests that function words encode essential information about the (re)ordering of their neighboring phrases.",
        "In contrast to Setiawan et al.",
        "(2007), who looked at neighboring contexts for function words on the source side, we focus here on modeling the influence of function words on neighboring phrases on the target side.",
        "We argue that this focus better fits our purpose, since the phrases that we want to model are the function words' neighbors on the target side, as illustrated in Fig. 1.",
        "To develop this idea, we first define an orit function that takes a source function word as a reference point, along with its neighboring phrase on the orit following orientation values (Nagata et al., 2006): Monotone-Adjacent (MA); Reverse-Adjacent (RA); Monotone-Gap (MG); and Reverse-Gap (RG).",
        "The Monotone/Reverse distinction indicates whether the source order follows the target order.",
        "The Adjacent/Gap distinction indicates whether the two phrases are adjacent or separated by an intervening phrase on the source side.",
        "For example, in Fig. 1, orit with respect to function word 4 (at) is MA, since its corresponding source phrase ^inf^S is adjacent to 4 (at) and their order is preserved on the English side.",
        "The value for left neighbor rank 10th with respect to 4 (at) is RG, since ^^\\%~Y is separated from 4 (at) and their order is reversed on the English side.",
        "More formally, we define Porit(orit(Y,X)\\Y), where orit(Y, X) e {MA, RA, MG, RG} is the orientation of a target phrase X with a source function Y",
        "We estimate the orientation model using maximum likelihood, which involves counting and normalizing events of interest: (Y,o = orit(Y,X)).",
        "Specifically, we estimate Porrh(o\\Y) = C(Y,o)/C(Y, ■).",
        "Collecting training counts C(Y,o) involves several steps.",

        "To ensure uniqueness, we enforce X that satisfies the consistency constraint (Och and Ney, 2004).",
