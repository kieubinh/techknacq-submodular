        "In the field of machine translation, automatic metrics have proven quite valuable in system development for tracking progress and measuring the impact of incremental changes.",
        "However, human judgment still plays a large role in the context of evaluating MT systems.",
        "For example, the GALE project uses human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER), wherein the MT output is scored against a post-edited version of itself (as opposed to being scored against an existing human reference).",
        "This poses a problem for MT researchers, since HTER is not an easy metric to calculate, and would require hiring and training human annotators to perform the editing task.",
        "In this work, we explore soliciting those edits from untrained human annotators, via the online service Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "We show that the collected data allows us to predict HTER-ranking of documents at a significantly higher level than the ranking obtained using automatic metrics."

      "text": [
        "In the early days of machine translation (MT), it was typical to evaluate MT output by soliciting judgments from human subjects, such as evaluating the fluency and adequacy of MT output (LDC, 2005).",
        "While this approach was appropriate (indeed desired) for evaluating a system, it was not a practical means of tracking the progress of a system during its development, since collecting human judgments is both costly and time-consuming.",
        "The introduction of automatic metrics like BLEU contributed greatly to MT research, for instance allowing researchers to measure and evaluate the impact of small modifications to an MT system.",
        "However, manual evaluation remains a core component of system evaluation.",
        "Teams on the GALE project, a DARPA-sponsored MT research program, are evaluated using the HTER metric, which is a version of TER whereby the output is scored against a post-edited version of itself, instead of a preexisting reference.",
        "Moreover, emphasis is placed on performing well across all documents and across all genres.",
        "Therefore, it is important for a research team to be able to evaluate their system using HTER, or at least determine the ranking of the documents according to HTER, for purposes of error analysis.",
        "Instead of hiring a human translator and training them, we propose moving the task to the virtual world of Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT), hiring workers to edit the MT output and predict HTER from those edits.",
        "We show that edits collected this way are better at predicting document ranking than automatic metrics, and furthermore that it can be done at a low cost, both in terms of time and money.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first discuss options available to predict HTER, such as automatic metrics.",
        "We then discuss the possibility of relying on human annotators, and the inherent difficulty in training them, before discussing the concept of soliciting edits over AMT.",
        "We detail the task given to the workers and summarize the data that we collected, then show how we can combine their data to obtain significanly better rank predictions of documents."

      "text": [
        "Translation edit rate (TER) measures the number of edits required to transform a hypothesis into an appropriate sentence in terms of grammaticality and meaning (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "While TER usually scores a hypothesis against an existing reference sentence, human-targeted TER scores a hypothesis against a post-edited version of itself.",
        "While HTER has been shown to correlate quite well with human judgment of MT quality, it is quite challenging to obtain HTER scores for MT output, since this would require hiring and training human subjects to perform the editing task.",
        "Therefore, other metrics such as BLEU or TER are used as proxies for HTER.",
        "The high cost associated with hiring and training a human editor makes it difficult to imagine an alternative to automatic metrics.",
        "However, we propose soliciting edits from workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT).",
        "AMT is a virtual marketplace where \"requesters\" can post tasks to be completed by \"workers\" (aka Turkers) around the world.",
        "Two main advantages of AMT are the preexisting infrastructure, and the low cost of completing tasks, both in terms of time and money.",
        "Data collected over AMT has already been used in several papers such as Snow et al.",
        "(2008) and Cal-lison-Burch (2009).",
        "When a requester creates a task to be completed over AMT, it is typical to have completed by more than one worker.",
        "The reason is that the use of AMT for data collection has an inherent problem with data quality.",
        "A requester has fewer tools at their disposal to ensure workers are doing the task properly (via training, feedback, etc) when compared to hiring annotators in the 'real' world.",
        "Those redundant annotations are therefore collected to increase the likelihood of at least one submission from a faithful (and competent) worker.",
        "The main idea it to mimic the real-world HTER setup by supplying workers with the original MT output that needs to be edited.",
        "The worker is also given a human reference, produced independently from the MT output.",
        "The instructions ask the worker to modify the MT output, using as few edits as possible, to match the human reference in meaning and grammaticality.",
        "The submitted edited hypothesis can then be used as the reference for calculating HTER.",
        "The idea is that, with this setup, a competent worker would be able to closely match the editing behavior of the professionally trained editor."

        "Therefore, we already had the edits produced by a professional translator.",
        "These edits were used as the \"gold-standard\" to evaluate the edits solicited from AMT and to evaluate our methods of combining Turkers' submissions.",
        "The MT output is a translation of more than 2,153 Arabic segments spread across 195 documents in 4 different genres: broadcast conversations (BC), broadcast news (BN), newswire (NW), and blogs (WB).",
        "Table 1 gives a summary of each genre's dataset.",
        "Table 1 : The 4 genres of the dataset.",
        "For each of the 2,153 MT output segments, we collected edits from 5 distinct workers on AMT, for a total of 10,765 post-edited segments by a total of about 500 distinct workers.",
        "The segments were presented in 1,210 groups of up to 15 segments each, with a reward of $0.25 per group.",
        "Hence the total rewards to workers was around $300, at a rate of 36 post-edited segments per dollar (or 2.8 pennies per segment)."

        "However, data collected from AMT should be treated with caution, since a non-trivial portion of the collected data is of poor quality.",
        "Note that this does not necessarily indicate a 'cheating' worker, for even if a worker is acting in good faith, they might not be able to perform the task adequately, due to misunderstanding the task, or neglecting to attempt to use a small number of edits.",
        "And so we need to combine the redundant edits in an intelligent manner.",
        "Recall that, given a segment, we collected edits from multiple workers.",
        "Some baseline methods include taking the minimum over the edits, taking the median, and taking the average.",

        "The weight associated with a worker should reflect our confidence in the quality of that worker's edits.",
        "But how can we evaluate a worker in the first place?",
        "We have available \"gold-standard\" editing behavior for the segments, and we treat a small portion of the segments edited by a Turker as a verification dataset.",
        "On that portion, we evaluate how closely the Turker matches the LDC editor, and weight them accordingly when predicting the number of edits of the rest of that group's segments.",
        "Specifically, the Turker's weight is the absolute difference between the Turker's edit count and the professional editor's edit count.",
        "Notice that we are not simply interested in a worker whose edited submission closely matches the edited submission of the professional translator.",
        "Rather, we are interested in mirroring the professional translator's edit rate.",
        "That is, the closer a Turker's edit rate is to the LDC editor's, the more we should prefer the worker.",
        "This is a subtle point, but it is indeed possible for a Turker to have similar edit rate as the LDC editor but still require a large number of edits to get the LDC editor's submission itself."

        "This can be detected by not limiting our verification to comparing behavior to the professional editor's, but also by comparing submitted edits to the MT output itself and to the human reference.",
        "In other words, a worker's submission could be characterized in terms of its distance to the MT output and to the human reference, thus building a complete 'profile' of the worker, and adding another component to guard against poor data quality and to reward the desired behavior."
