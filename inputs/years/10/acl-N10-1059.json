        "Product attribute extraction is a fundamental task of sentiment analysis.",
        "It aims to extract the product attributes from a product review, such as \"picture quality\" in the sentence \"The picture quality of Canon is perfect.\"",
        "This task is usually performed in two steps: product attribute candidate extraction and candidate classification.",
        "Almost all the previous work pays more attention to the second step, fewer researchers make in-depth research on the first step.",
        "They simply choose the NPs in a product review as the product attribute candidates (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Yi et al., 2003).",
        "However, this method limits the recall of the product attribute extraction for two reasons.",
        "First, there exist other structures of the product attributes except NPs.",
        "Second, the syntactic parsing is not perfect, especially for the Non-English languages, such as Chinese.",
        "Experiments on three Chinese datasets show that nearly 15% product attributes are lost, when only using NPs as the candidates.",
        "Obviously, if using the candidate classification techniques on these NP candidates, it would lead to poor performance (especially for recall) for the final product attribute extraction.",
        "Based on the above discussion, it can be observed that product attribute candidate extraction is well worth studying.",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach by generalizing the syntactic structures of the product attributes to solve this problem.",
        "Figure 1 lists some syntactic structure samples from an annotated corpus, including the special forms of NPs in Figure 1(a) and other syntactic structures, such as VP or IP in Figure 1(b).",
        "We can find that the syntactic structures can not only cover more phrase types besides NP, but also describe the detailed forms of the product attributes.",

        "The standard syntactic structures of the product attributes can be collected from a training set.",
        "Then a simple method of exact matching can be used to select the product attribute candidates from the test set.",
        "In particular, for a syntactic structure T in the test set, if T exactly matches with one of the standard syntactic structures, then its corresponding string can be treated as a product attribute candidate.",
        "However, this method fails to handle similar syntactic structures, such as the two structures in Figure 2.",
        "Besides, this method treats the syntactic structure as a whole during exact matching, without considering any structural information.",
        "Therefore, it is difficult to describe the syntactic structure information explicitly.",
        "All of these prevent this method from generalizing unseen data well.",
        "To overcome the above problems, two generalization strategies are proposed in this paper.",
        "One is to generalize the syntactic structures with two intuitive heuristics.",
        "The other is to deeply mine the syntactic structure by decomposing it into several substructures.",
        "Both strategies will be introduced in the following subsections.",
        "Two intuitive heuristics are adopted to generalize the syntactic structures.",
        "Heu1: For the near-synonymic grammar tags in syntactic structures, we can generalize them by a normalized one.",

        "Heu2: For the sequence of identical grammar tags in syntactic structures, we can replace them with one.",
        "The reason is that the sequential grammar tags always describe the same syntactic function as one grammar tag.",
        "Such as the blue circles in Figure 2.",
        "The heuristic generalization strategy is too restrictive to give a good coverage.",
        "Moreover, after this kind of generalization, the syntactic structure is used as a whole in exact matching all the same.",
        "Thus, as an alternative to the exact matching, tree kernel based methods can be used to implicitly explore the substructures of the syntactic structure in a high-dimensional space.",
        "This kind of methods can directly calculate the similarity between two substructure vectors using a kernel function.",
        "Tree kernel based methods are effective in modeling structured features, which are widely used in many natural language processing tasks, such as syntactic parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2001) and semantic role labeling (Che et al., 2008) and so on.",
        "In this paper, the syntactic structure for a product attribute can be decomposed into several substructures, such as in Figure 3.",
