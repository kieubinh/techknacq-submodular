        "Thus, it is both interesting and necessary to investigate the performance of NLP tools trained on edited text when applied to unedited Web 2.0 text.",
        "McClosky et al.",
        "(2006) report a Parseval f-score decrease of 5% when a WSJ-trained parser is applied to Brown corpus sentences.",
        "In this paper, we move even further from the WSJ by investigating the performance of the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006) on user-generated content.",
        "We create gold standard phrase structure trees for the posts on two threads of the same online discussion forum.",
        "We then parse the sentences in one thread, our development set, with the Berkeley parser under three conditions: 1) when it performs its own tokenisation, 2) when it is provided with gold tokens and 3) when misspellings in the input have been corrected.",
        "A qualitative evaluation is then carried out on parser output under the third condition.",
        "Based on this evaluation, we identify some \"low-hanging fruit\" which we attempt to handle either by transforming the input sentence or by transforming the WSJ training material.",
        "The success of these transformations is evaluated on our development and test sets, with encouraging results."

        "Data Our data consists of sentences that occur on the BBC Sport 606 Football discussion forum.",
        "The posts on this forum are quite varied, ranging from throwaway comments to more considered essay-like contributions.",
        "The development set consists of 42 posts (185 sentences) on a thread discussing a controversial refereeing decision in a soccer match.The test set is made up of 40 posts (170 sentences) on a thread discussing a player's behaviour in the same match.",
        "The average sentence length in the development set is 18 words and the test set 15 words.",
        "Tokenisation and spelling correction were carried out by hand on the sentences in both sets.They were then parsed using Bikel's parser (Bikel, 2004) and corrected by hand using the Penn Treebank Bracketing Guidelines (Bies et al., 1995).",
        "Parser The Berkeley parser is an unlexicalised phrase structure parser which learns a latent variable PCFG by iteratively splitting the treebank nonterminals, estimating rule probabilities for the new grammar using EM and merging the less useful splits.",
        "We train a PCFG from WSJ2-21 by carrying out five cycles of the split-merge process (SM5).",
        "Tokenisation and Spelling Effects In the first experiment, the parser is given the original development set sentences which contain spelling mistakes and which have not been tokenised.",
        "We ask the parser to perform its own tokenisation.",
        "In the second experiment, the parser is given the hand-tokenised sentences which still contain spelling mistakes.",
        "These are corrected for the third experiment.",
        "Since the yields of the parser output and gold trees are not guaranteed to match exactly, we cannot use the evalb implementation of the Parseval evaluation metrics.",
        "Instead we use Sparseval (Roark et al., 2006), which was designed to be used to evaluate the parsing of spoken data and can handle this situation.",
        "An unaligned dependency evaluation is carried out: head-finding rules are used to convert a phrase structure tree into a dependency graph.",
        "Precision and recall are calculated over the dependencies",
        "The Sparseval results are shown in Table 1.",
        "For the purposes of comparison, the WSJ23 performance is displayed in the top row.",
        "We can see that performance suffers when the parser performs its own tokenisation.",
        "A reason for this is the under-use of apostrophes in the forum data, with the result that words such as didnt and im remain untokenised and are tagged by the parser as common nouns: (NP (NP (DTthe) (NNSrefs)) (SBAR (S (NP (NN didnt)) (VP want to make it to obvious))))",
        "To properly see the effect of the 39 spelling errors on parsing accuracy, we factor out the mismatches between the correctly spelled words in the reference set and their incorrectly spelled equivalents.",
        "We do this by evaluating against a version of the gold standard which contains the original misspellings (third row).",
        "We can see that the effect of spelling errors is quite small.",
        "The Berkeley parser's mechanism for handling unknown words makes use of suffix information and it is able to ignore many of the content word spelling errors.",
        "It is the errors in function words that appear to cause a greater problem: (NP (DT the) (JJ zealous) (NNS fans) (NN whpo) (NN care) (JJR more) )",
        "Table 2: Parseval scores for Berkeley SM5 Gold Tokens and Spelling Leaving aside the problems of automatic tokenisation and spelling correction, we focus on the results of the third experiment.",
        "The Parseval results are given in Table 2.",
        "Note that the performance degradation is quite large, more than has been reported for the Charniak parser on the Brown corpus.",
        "We examine the parser output for each sentence in the development set.",
        "The phenomena which lead the parser astray are listed in Table 3.",
        "One problem is coordination which is difficult for parsers on in-domain data but which is exacerbated here by the omission of conjunctions, the use of a comma as a conjunction and the tendency towards unlike constituent coordination.",
        "Parser Comparison We test the lexicalised Char-niak parser plus reranker (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) on the development set sentences.",
        "We also test the Berkeley parser with an SM6 grammar.",
        "The f-scores are shown in Table 4.",
        "The parser achieving the highest score on WSJ23, namely, the C&J reranking parser, also achieves the highest score on our development set.",
        "The difference between the two Berkeley grammars supports the claim that an SM6 grammar overfits to the WSJ (Petrov and Klein, 2007).",
