        "Coreference systems exploit a variety of information sources, ranging from syntactic and discourse constraints, which are highly configurational, to semantic constraints, which are highly contingent on lexical meaning and world knowledge.",
        "Perhaps because configurational features are inherently easier to learn from small data sets, past work has often emphasized them over semantic knowledge.",
        "Of course, all state-of-the-art coreference systems have needed to capture semantic compatibility to some degree.",
        "As an example of nominal headword compatibility, a \"president\" can be a \"leader\" but cannot be not an \"increase.\"",
        "Past systems have often computed the compatibility of specific headword pairs, extracted either from lexical resources (Ng, 2007; Bengston and Roth, 2008; Rahman and Ng, 2009), web statistics (Yang et al., 2005), or surface syntactic patterns (Haghighi and Klein, 2009).",
        "While the pairwise approach has high precision, it is neither realistic nor scalable to explicitly enumerate all pairs of compatible word pairs.",
        "A more compact approach has been to rely on named-entity recognition (NER) systems to give coarse-grained entity types for each mention (Soon et al., 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "Unfortunately, current systems use small inventories of types and so provide little constraint.",
        "In general, coreference errors in state-of-the-art systems are frequently due to poor models of semantic compatibility (Haghighi and Klein, 2009).",
        "In this work, we take a primarily unsupervised approach to coreference resolution, broadly similar to Haghighi and Klein (2007), which addresses this issue.",
        "Our generative model exploits a large inventory of distributional entity types, including standard NER types like person and org, as well as more refined types like weapon and vehicle.",
        "For each type, distributions over typical heads, modifiers, and governors are learned from large amounts of unla-beled data, capturing type-level semantic information (e.g. \"spokesman\" is a likely head for a person).",
        "Each entity inherits from a type but captures entity-level semantic information (e.g. \"giant\" may be a likely head for the Microsoft entity but not all ORGs).",
        "Separately from the type-entity semantic module, a log-linear discourse model captures con-figurational effects.",
        "Finally, a mention model assembles each textual mention by selecting semantically appropriate words from the entities and types.",
        "Despite being almost entirely unsupervised, our model yields the best reported end-to-end results on a range of standard coreference data sets."

        "While it is possible to learn type distributions in a completely unsupervised fashion, we found it useful to prime the system with a handful of important types.",
        "Rather than relying on fully supervised data, we took the approach of Haghighi and Klein (2006).",
        "For each type of interest, we provided a (possibly-empty) prototype list of proper and nominal head words, as well as a list of allowed pronouns.",
        "For instance, for the person type we might provide:",
        "NAM Bush, Gore, Hussein NOM president, minister, official PRO he, his, she, him, her, you, ...",
        "The prototypes were used as follows: Any entity with a prototype on any proper or nominal head word attribute list (Section 3.1) was constrained to have the specified type; i.e. the qk factor (Section 4) places probability one on that single type.",
        "Similarly to Haghighi and Klein (2007) and Elsner et al.",
        "(2009), we biased these types' pronoun distributions to the allowed set of pronouns.",
        "In general, the choice of entity types to prime with prototypes is a domain-specific question.",
        "For experiments here, we utilized the types which are annotated in the ACE coreference data: person (PERS), organization (ORG), geopolitical entity (GPE), weapon (WEA), vehicle (VEH), location (LOC), and facility (FAC).",
        "Since the person type in ACE conflates individual persons with groups of people (e.g., soldier vs. soldiers), we added the group (GROUP) type and generated a prototype specification.",
        "We obtained our prototype list by extracting at most four common proper and nominal head words from the newswire portions of the 2004 and 2005 ACE training sets (A04CU and A05ST); we chose prototype words to be minimally ambiguous with respect to type.",
        "When there are not at least three proper heads for a type (WEA for instance), we did not provide any proper prototypes and instead strongly biased the type fertility parameters to generate empty NAM-HEAD lists.",
        "Because only certain semantic types were annotated under the arbitrary ACE guidelines, there are many mentions which do not fall into those limited categories.",
        "We therefore prototype (refinements of) the ACE types and then add an equal number of unconstrained \"other\" types which are automatically induced.",
        "A nice consequence of this approach is that we can simply run our model on all mentions, discarding at evaluation time any which are of non-prototyped types.",
        "We evaluated on multiple coreference resolution metrics, as no single one is clearly superior, particularly in dealing with the system mention setting.",
        "We utilized MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), BAll (Stoyanov et al., 2009), BNone (Stoyanov et al., 2009), and Pairwise F1.",
        "The BAll and BNone are Bvariants (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) that differ in their treatment of spurious mentions.",
        "For Pairwise F1, precision measures how often pairs of predicted coreferent mentions are in the same annotated entity.",
