        "They showed application of sOEM can produce quicker convergence compared to the batch EM algorithm.",
        "However, the model presented does not incorporate any unseen data, instead iterating over a static data set multiple times using sOEM.",
        "For Liang and Klein (2009) incremental retraining is simply an alternative way to use a fixed training set.",
        "Recent work in Levenberg and Osborne (2009) presented a streaming LM that was capable of adapting to an unbounded monolingual input stream in constant space and time.",
        "The LM has the ability to add or delete n-grams (and their counts) based on feedback from the decoder after translation points.",
        "The model was tested in an SMT setting and results showed recent data benefited performance.",
        "However, adaptation was only to the LM and no tests were conducted on the TM."
