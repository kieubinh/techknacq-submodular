        "With the widespread adoption of the Internet, of modern communication, multimedia and mobile device technologies, the amount of multilingual information distributed and available to anyone, anywhere, has exploded.",

        "), collaboration (e.g. wikis), and sharing of multimedia content, and entertainment.",
        "In particular, social media have today become also an important market for advertisement as well as a global forum for consumer opinions (Kushal et al., 2003).",
        "The growing spread of user-generated content is scaling-up the potential demand for on-line machine translation (MT) but also setting new challenges to the field of natural language processing (NLP) in general.",
        "The language written and spoken in the social media presents an impressive variety of content and styles (Schler et al., 2006), and writing conventions that rapidly evolve over time.",
        "Moreover, much of the content is expressed in informal style, that more or less violates the standard grammar, contains many abbreviations and acronyms, and finally many misspelled words.",
        "From the point of view of MT, language of social media is hence very different from the one represented in the text corpora nowadays available to train statistical MT systems.",
        "Facing all these challenges, we pragmatically scaled down our ambition and decided to investigate a basic, somehow preliminary, well defined problem: the impact of misspelled words in statistical MT.",
        "Unintentional typing errors are indeed remarkably frequent in online chats, blogs, wikis, reviews, and hence constitute a major source of noise (Subra-maniam et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper we aim at studying performance degradation of statistical MT under different levels and kinds of noise, and at analyzing to what extent statistical MT is able to recover from errors by enriching its input with spelling variations.",
        "After a brief overview of NLP literature related to noisy texts, in Section 3 we consider different types of misspellings and derive simple but realistic models that are able to reproduce them.",
        "Such models are then used to generate errors in texts passed to a phrase-based statistical MT system.",
        "Next, in Section 4 we introduce an extension of a statistical MT system able to handle misspellings by exploiting confusion network decoding (Bertoldi et al., 2008).",
        "Experiments are reported in Section 5 that investigate the trade-off between complexity of the extended MT decoder versus translation accuracy.",
        "Moreover, as the proposed model for handling misspellings embeds specific assumptions on how errors are generated, we also measure the robustness of the enhanced MT decoder with respect to different noise sources.",
        "Experiments are reported on two tasks of different complexity, the translation of Eu-roparl texts and weather bulletins, involving English and Italian languages."

        "Concerning spelling correction literature, many works apply the noisy channel model which consists of two components: a source model (prior of word probabilities) and a channel (error) model, that accounts for spelling transformations on letter sequences.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed under this framework, that mainly differ in the employed error model; see for example: (Church and Gale, 1991), (Brill and Moore, 2000) and (Toutanova and Moore, 2002).",
        "Comprehensive surveys on methods to model and recover spelling errors can be found in (Kukich, 1992) and (Pedler, 2007); in particular, the latter work is specifically centered on methods for correcting so-called real-word errors (cf.",
        "Section 3).",
        "The detection of errors and the suggestion of corrections typically rely on the availability of text corpora or human-made lexical resources.",
        "Search for correct alternatives can be based on word similarity measures, such as the edit distance (Mitton, 1995), anagram hashing (Reynaert, 2006), and semantic distance based on WordNet (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005).",
        "More sophisticated approaches have been proposed by (Fossati and Di Eugenio, 2008), that mixes surface and Part-Of-Speech Information, and (Schaback and Li, 2007), which combines similarity measures at the character, phonetic, word, syntax, and semantic levels into one global feature-based framework.",

        "Starting from the possibly noisy input text, spelling variations are generated by assuming that each character is a potential typing error, independent from other characters.",
        "The variants are represented as a character-based CN that models possible substitutions, insertion, deletions of each character, with an empirically determined weight assigned to each alternative.",

        "It is worth noticing that real-word errors are recovered in a different way than random errors; in fact, for the latter a single spelling alternative seems sufficient to guarantee a substantial error recovery, whereas for real-word errors this is not the case.",
        "Concerning the use of spelling variations, it is worth remarking that our system is able to fully recover from both random and non-word errors up to noise levels of 10%, which remains high even for noise levels up to 20%, where the BLEU degradation is limited to around 5% relative.",
        "Real-word errors are optimally recovered in the case of multiple spelling variations until they do not exceed 2% of the words in the input text; after that, the decrement of the MT quality becomes significant but still limited to about 5% BLEU relative for a noise level of 10%.",
        "So the question arises about what could be a realistic real-word noise level.",
        "Clearly this question is not easy to address.",

        "Table 1 only shows the sentences containing errors) that contain in total 8 errors: 7 of which are non-words and 1 is a real-word.",
        "Although from these figures reliable statistics cannot be estimated, a reasonable assumption could be that a global noise level of 10% might contain a 1/10 ratio for real-word vs. non-word errors.",
        "Thus, looking at the real-word error curve of Figure 3, the inability to recover errors for noise levels greater than 2-5% should actually be acceptable given this empirical observation.",
        "Another relevant remark from Figure 3 is that for low noise levels (less than 1%) the use of the error-recovering module is counterproductive, since it introduces more errors than those actually affecting the original input text, causing a slight degradation of the translation performance.",
        "If the computational cost to generate variants, which will be analyzed in the next paragraph, is also taken into account, it results evident the importance of designing a good strategy for enabling or disabling on demand the error-recovering stage.",
        "A starting point for defining an effective activation strategy is the estimation of the noise rate.",
        "For doing this, non-words can be counted by exploiting proper dictionaries or spell checkers; concerning real-word noise, its rate can be inferred either from the non-word rate, or by means of the perplexity, which is expected to become higher as the real-word error rate increases (Subramaniam et al., 2009).",
        "Once the noise level of the input text is known, the decision of activating the correction module can be easily taken on a",
        "English-Italian Italian-English",
        "threshold basis.",
        "Alternatively, the proper working point, in terms of precision and recall, of the correction model could be dynamically chosen as a function of the actual noise level.",
        "Although our investigation does not address explicitly computational aspects of translating noisy input, nevertheless some general considerations can be drawn.",
        "The effectiveness of our recovering approach relies on the compact representation of many spelling alternatives in a word-based CN.",
        "The CN decoding has been shown to be efficient, just minimally larger than the single string decoding (Bertoldi et al., 2008).",
        "On the contrary, in the current enhanced MT setting, the sequence of Steps 1 to 4 for building the CN from the noisy input text is quite costly.",
        "Rather than to an intrinsic complexity, this is due to our choice of creating a rich character-based CN in Step 3 for the sake of flexibility and to a naive implementation of Step 4.",
        "So far we have analyzed in detail our approach on the medium-large sized Europarl task, for the English-to-Italian translation direction.",
        "For assessing portability, we also considered a simpler task the translation of weather forecast bulletins-where the translation quality is definitely higher, for the same language pair but in both translation directions.",
        "The choice of the weather forecast task is not by chance.",
        "In fact, as the automatically translated bulletins are published on the Web, a very high translation quality is required, and then the presence of any typing error in the original text could be a concern.",
        "(By the way, for this task the presence of real-word errors is very marginal.)",
        "Figure 4 plots curves of MT performance under random noise conditions against multiple spelling variations, for two translation directions.",

        "This paper addressed the issue of automatically translating written texts that are corrupted by misspelling errors.",
        "An enhancement of a state-of-the-art statistical MT system is proposed which efficiently performs the translation of multiple spelling variants of noisy input.",
        "These alternatives are generated by a character-based error recovery system under the assumption that misspellings are due to typing errors.",
        "The enhanced MT system has been tested on texts corrupted with increasing noise levels of three different sources: random, non-word, and real-word errors.",
        "Analysis of experimental results has led us to draw the following conclusions:",
        "• The impact of misspelling errors on MT performance depends on the noise rate, but not on the noise source.",
        "• The capability of the enhanced MT system to recover from errors differs according to the noise source: real-word noise is significantly harder to remove than random and non-word noise, which behave substantially the same.",
        "• The exploitation of several spelling alternatives permits to almost fully recover from errors if the noise rate does not exceed 10% for nonword noise and 2% for real-word noise, which are likely above the corruption level observed in many social media.",
        "• Finally, performance slightly decreases when input text is correct or just mistaken at a negligible level, because the error recovery module rewards recall rather than precision and hence tends to overgenerate correction alternatives, even if not needed."
