        "For each constituent, we first computed the language/script specific feature vector, projected it to the common feature space, and found the k-nearest neighbors using the ANN algorithm.",
        "We used k=100 for all our experiments.",
        "After finding the nearest neighbors and the corresponding similarity scores, we combined the scores using the approach described in Section 3.4.",
        "The training and search procedure employed by TRANS-SEARCH are described below.",
        "We used a state-of-the-art CRF-based transliteration technique for transliterating the native language names (Khapra and Bhattacharyya, 2009).",
        "We used CRF++, an open-source CRF training tool, to train the transliteration system.",
        "We used exactly the same features and parameter settings as described in (Khapra and Bhattacharyya, 2009).",
        "As in the case of CCA, we use around 15, 000 single word name pairs in the training.",
        "The preprocessing step for TRANS-SEARCH is the same as that for GEOM-SEARCH.",
        "We transliterated each constituent of the query into English and find all single-word English names that are at an edit distance of at most 3.",
        "We computed the similarity score as described in Section 3.4.",
        "We evaluated the performance of GEOM-SEARCH and TRANS-SEARCH using a tie-aware mean reciprocal rank (MRR).",
        "Table 4 compares the average time per query and the MRR of the two systems.",
        "GEOM-SEARCH performed significantly better than the transliteration based baseline system for all the six languages.",
        "On an average, the relevant English Wikipedia page was found in the top 2 results produced by GEOM-SEARCH for all the six native languages.",
        "Clearly, this shows that GEOM-SEARCH is highly effective as a cross-langauge name search system.",
        "The good results also validate our claim that cross-language name search can improve the multilingual user experience ofESL/EFL users."
