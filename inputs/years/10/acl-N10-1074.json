        "Acquiring a language entails mastering many learning tasks simultaneously, including identifying where words begin and end in continuous speech and learning meanings for those words.",
        "It is common to treat these tasks as separate, sequential processes, where segmentation is a prerequisite to word learning but otherwise there are few if any dependencies.",
        "The earliest evidence of segmentation, however, is for words bordering a child's own name (Bortfeld et al., 2005).",
        "In addition, infants begin learning their first words before they achieve adult-level competence in segmentation.",
        "These two pieces of evidence raise the question of whether the tasks of meaning learning and segmentation might mutually inform one another.",
        "To explore this question we present a joint model that simultaneously identifies word boundaries and attempts to associate meanings with words.",
        "In doing so we make two contributions.",
        "First, by modeling the two levels of structure in parallel we simulate a more realistic situation.",
        "Second, a joint model allows us to explore possible synergies and interactions.",
        "We find evidence that our joint model performs better on a segmentation task than an alternative model that does not learn word meanings.",
        "The picture in Figure 1 depicts a language learning situation from our corpus (originally from Fer-nald and Morikawa, 1993; recoded in Frank et al., 2009) where a mother talks while playing with various toys.",
        "Setting down the dog and picking up the hand puppet of a pig, she asks, \"Is that the pig?\"",
        "Starting out, a young learner not only does not know that the word \"pig\" refers to the puppet but does not even know that \"pig\" is a word at all.",
        "Our model simulates the learning task, taking as input the unsegmented phonemic representation of the speech along with the set of objects in the non-linguistic context as shown in Figure 1 (a), and infers both a segmentation and a word-object mapping as in Figure 1 (b).",
        "One can formulate the word learning task as that of finding a reasonably small set of reusable word-meaning pairs consistent with the underlying communicative intent.",
        "Infant directed speech often refers to objects in the immediate environment, and early word learning seems to involve associating frequently co-occurring word-object pairs (Akhtar and Montague, 1999; Markman, 1990).",
        "Several computational models are based on this idea that a word",
        "Figure 1 : (a) The input to our system for the utterance \"Is that the pig?\"",
        "consists of an unsegmented sequence of phonemes and the set of objects representing the non-linguistic context.",

        "The basic idea is that learning a vocabulary that both meets the constraints of the word-learning task and is consistent with the objective of the segmentation task can yield a better segmentation.",
        "That is, we hope to find a synergy in the joint inference of meaning and segmentation.",
        "Note that to the best of our knowledge there is very little computational work that combines word form and word meaning learning (Frank et al.",
        "2006 takes a first step but their model is applicable only to small artificial languages).",

        "(2009a) and Regier (2003) review pure word learning models and, in addition to the papers we have already cited, Brent (1999) presents a fairly comprehensive review of previous pure segmentation models.",
        "However, none of the models reviewed make any attempt to jointly address the two problems.",
        "Similarly, in the behavioral literature on development, we are aware of only one segmentation study (Graf-Estes et al., 2007) that involves non-linguistic context, though this study treats the two tasks sequentially rather than jointly.",

        "that frequently occurs in the presence of an object and not so frequently in its absence is likely to refer to that object (Frank et al., 2009a; Siskind, 1996; Yu and Ballard, 2007).",
        "Importantly, all these models assume words are pre-segmented in the input.",
        "While the word segmentation task relates less clearly to the communicative content, it can be formulated according to a similar objective, that of attempting to explain the sound sequences in the input in terms of some reasonably small set of reusable units, or words.",
        "Computational models have successfully addressed the problem in much this way (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009; Goldwater et al., 2009; Brent, 1999), and the general approach is consistent with experimental observations that humans are sensitive to statistics of sound sequences (Saffran et al., 1996; Frank et al., 2007).",
        "The two tasks can be integrated in a relatively seamless way, since, as we have just formulated them, they have a common objective, that of finding a minimal, consistent set of reusable units.",

        "Note that this topical unigram model is a straightforward generalization of the unigram segmentation model (Goldwater et al., 2009) to the case of multiple topics.",
        "In fact, ifall words were assumed to refer to the same object (or to no object at all) the models would be identical.",

        "Though necessitated by data sparsity issues, we also note that it is very rare in our corpus for utterances to refer to more than one object in the non-linguistic context, so the choice of a single topic may also be a more accurate model.",

        "While relying on non-linguistic context helps segment the meaning-bearing words, the overall improvement is small in our current corpus.",

        "We find (1) that it is possible to jointly infer both meanings and a segmentation in a fully unsupervised way and (2) that doing so improves the segmentation performance of our model.",
        "In particular, we found that although the word learning side suffered from segmentation errors, and performed worse than a model that learned from a gold standard segmentation, the loss was only slight.",
        "On the other hand, segmentation performance for the meaning bearing words improved a great deal.",
        "The first result suggests that is not necessary to assume fully segmented input in order to learn word meanings, and that the segmentation and word learning tasks can be effectively modeled in parallel, allowing us to explore potential developmental interactions.",
        "The second result suggests that synergies do actually exist and argue not only that we can model the two as parallel processes, but that doing so could prove fruitful.",
        "Our model is relatively simple both in terms of word learning and in terms of word segmentation.",
        "For instance, social cues and shared attention, or discourse effects, might all play a role (Frank et al., 2009b).",
        "Shared features or other relationships can also potentially impact how quickly one might generalize a label to multiple instances (Tenenbaum and Xu, 2000).",
        "There are many ways to elaborate on the word learning task, with additional potential synergistic implications.",
        "We might also elaborate the linguistic structures we incorporate into the word learning model.",
        "For instance, Johnson (2008) explores synergies in syllable and morphological structures in word segmentation.",
        "Aspects of linguistic structure, such as morphology, may contribute to word meaning learning beyond its contribution to word segmentation performance."
