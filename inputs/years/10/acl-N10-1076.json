        "In its own right, the ability to diacritize can aid language learning and is necessary for speech-based assis-tive technologies, including speech recognition and text-to-speech.",
        "Diacritics are also useful for tasks such as segmentation, morphological disambiguation, and machine translation, making diacritization important to Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and intelligence gathering.",
        "In alphabetic writing systems, similar techniques have been used to restore accents from plain text (Yarowsky, 1999) and could be used to recover missing letters in the compressed writing styles found in email, text, and instant messages.",
        "We are particularly interested in diacritizing Syr-iac, a low-resource dialect of Aramaic, which possesses properties similar to Arabic and Hebrew.",
        "This work employs conditional Markov models (CMMs) (Klein and Manning, 2002) to diacritize Semitic (and other) languages and requires only diacritized texts for training.",
        "Such an approach is useful for languages (like Syriac) in which annotated data and linguistic tools such as part-of-speech (POS) taggers, segmenters, and morphological analyzers are not available.",
        "Our main contributions are as follows: (1) we introduce a hybrid word and consonant CMM that allows access to the diacritized form of the previous words; (2) we introduce new features available in the proposed model; and (3) we describe an efficient, approximate decoder.",
        "Our models significantly outperform existing low-resource approaches across multiple related and unrelated languages and even achieve near state-of-the-art results when compared to resource-rich systems.",
        "In the next section, we review previous work relevant to our approach.",
        "Section 3 then motivates and describes the models and features used in our framework, including a description of the decoder.",
        "We describe our data in Section 4 and detail our experimental setup in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 presents our results.",
        "Finally, Section 7 briefly discusses our conclusions and offers ideas for future work."

        "Diacritization has been receiving increased attention due to the rising interest in Semitic languages, coupled with the importance of diacritization to other NLP-related tasks.",
        "The existing approaches can be categorized based on the amount of resources they require, their basic unit of analysis, and of course the language they are targeting.",
        "Probabilistic systems can be further divided into generative and conditional approaches.",
        "Existing methodologies can be placed along a continuum based on the quantity of resources they require – a reflection of their cost.",
        "Examples of resources used include morphological analyzers (Habash and Rambow, 2007; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2005; Vergyri and Kirchhoff, 2004; El-Sadany and Hashish, 1989), rules for grapheme-to-sound conversion (El-Imam, 2008), transcribed speech (Ver2006; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2005), and a list of prefixes and suffixes (Nelken and Shieber, 2005).",
        "When such resources exist for a particular language, they typically improve performance.",
        "For instance, Habash and Rambow's (2007) approach reduces the error rate of Zitouni et al.",
        "'s (2006) by as much as 30% through its use of a morphological analyzer.",
        "In fact, such resources are not always available.",
        "Several data-driven approaches exist that require only diacritized texts (e.g., Kiibler and Mohamed, 2008; Zitouni et al., 2006; Gal, 2002) which are relatively inexpensive to obtain: most literate speakers of the target language could readily provide them.",
        "Apart from the quantity of resources required, di-acritization systems also differ in their basic unit of analysis.",
        "A consonant-based approach treats each consonant in a word as a potential host for one or more (possibly null) diacritics; the goal is to predict the correct diacritic(s) for each consonant (e.g., Kubler and Mohamed, 2008).",
        "Zitouni et al.",
        "(2006) extend the problem to a sequence labeling task wherein they seek the best sequence of diacritics for the consonants.",
        "Consequently, their approach has access to previously chosen diacritics.",
        "Alternatively, the basic unit of analysis can be the full, undiacritized word.",
        "Since morphological analyzers produce analyses of undiacritized words, di-acritization approaches that employ them typically fall into this category (e.g., Habash and Rambow,",
        "'We refer to all graphemes present in undiacritized texts as consonants.",
        "low-resource solutions tend to treat the problem as word-level sequence labeling (e.g., Gal, 2002).",
        "Unfortunately, word-based techniques face problems due to data sparsity: not all words in the test set are seen during training.",
        "In contrast, consonant-based approaches rarely face the analogous problem of previously unseen consonants.",
        "Thus, one low-resource solution to data sparsity is to use consonant-based techniques for unknown words (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2005; Nelken and Shieber, 2005).",
        "Many of the existing systems, especially recent ones, are probabilistic or contain probabilistic components.",
        "Zitouni et al.",

        "(2006).",
        "In the published literature for Arabic, the latter two have the best low-resource solutions.",

        "1.",
        "Many undiacritized words are unambiguous: 90.8% of the word types and 63.5% of the tokens have a single diacritized form.",
        "2.",
        "Most undiacritized word types have only a few possible diacritizations: the average number of possible diacritizations is 1.11.",
        "3.",
        "Low-frequency words have low ambiguity: Undiacritized types occurring fewer than 5 times have an average of 1.05 possible diacriti-zations.",
        "4.",
        "Diacritized words not seen in the training data occur infrequently at test time: 10.5% of the diacritized test tokens were not seen in training.",
        "5.",
        "The diacritics of previous words can provide useful morphological information such as person, number, and gender.",
        "Contrary to observations 1 and 2, consonant-level approaches dedicate modeling capacity to an exponential (in the number of consonants) number of possible diacritizations of a word.",
        "In contrast, a word-level approach directly models the (few) dia-critized forms seen in training.",
        "Furthermore, word-based approaches naturally have access to the diacritics of previous words if used in a sequence labeler, as per observation 5.",
        "However, without a \"backoff\" strategy, word-level models cannot predict a diacritized form not seen in the training data.",
        "Also, low-frequency words by definition have less information from which to estimate parameters.",
        "In contrast, abundant information exists for each diacritic in a consonant-level system.",
        "To the degree to which they hold, observations 3 and 4 mitigate these latter two problems.",
        "Clearly a hybrid approach would be advantageous.",
        "To this end we employ a CMM in which we treat the problem as an instance of sequence labeling at the word level with less common words being handled by a consonant-level CMM.",

        "We leave discussion for what constitutes a \"rare\" undiacritized type for Section 5.2.",
        "Figure 1b presents a graphical model of a simple example sentence in Syriac.",

        "These diacritized words Di depend on previous Di-1 as per equation (1) for an order-1 CMM (note that the capitalized A, I, and O are in fact consonants in this transliteration).",
        "Because \"NKTA\" and \"RGT\" are rare, their diacritization is represented by a consonant-level CMM: one variable for each possible diacritic in the word.",
        "Importantly, these consonant-level models have access to the previously diacritized word (D4 and D6, respectively).",
        "We use log-linear models for all local distributions in our CMMs, i.e., we use maximum entropy (maxent) Markov models (McCallum et al., 2000; Berger et al., 1996).",

        "Similarly, the consonant model can be learned independent of the word models.",
        "We place a spherical normal prior centered at zero with a standard deviation of 1 over the weights of all models and use an L-BFGS minimizer to find the MAP estimate of the weights for all the models (words and consonant).",

        "• The prefixes and suffixes (up to 4 characters) of the previously diacritized words.",
        "• The string of the actual diacritics, including the null diacritic, from each of the previous o dia-critized words and n-grams of these strings; a similar set of features is extracted but without the null diacritics.",

        "• The current consonant.",
        "• Previous diacritics (individually, and n-grams of diacritics ending in the diacritic prior to the current consonant, where n is the consonant-level Markov order).",

        "• Prefixes and suffixes (of up to length 4) of previously diacritized words conjoined with previous diacritics in the current token, both individually and n-grams of such.",
        "This last template is only possible because of our model's dependency on previous diacritized words.",
        "Given a sentence consisting of undiacritized words, we seek the most probable sequence of diacritized words, i.e., argmaxj P(d|u...).",
        "In sentences containing no rare words, the well-known Viterbi algorithm can be used to find the optimum.",
        "However, as can be seen in Figure 1b, predictions in the consonant-level model (e.g., CS}1,„4) depend on previously diacritized words (D4), and some diacritized words (e.g., D6) depend on diacritics in the previous rare word (C5;1_4).",
        "These dependencies introduce an exponential number of states (in the length of the word) for rare words, making exact decoding intractable.",
        "Instead, we apply a non-standard beam during decoding to limit the number of states for rare words to the n-best (locally).",
        "This is accomplished by using an independent \"inner\" n-best decoder for the consonant-level CMM to produce the n-best diacritizations for the rare word given the previous diacritized words and other features.",
        "These become the only states to and from which transitions in the \"outer\" word-level decoder can be made.",
        "We note this is the same type of decoding that is done in pipeline models that use n-best decoders (Finkel et al., 2006).",
        "Additionally, we use a traditional beam-search of width 5 to further reduce the search space both in the outer and inner CMMs.",
        "Although our primary interest is in the Syriac language, we also experimented with the Penn Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004) for the sake of comparison with other approaches.",
        "We include Hebrew to provide results for yet another Semitic language.",
        "We also apply the models to English to show that our method and features work well outside of the Semitic languages.",
        "A summary of the datasets, including the number of diacritics, is found in Figure 2.",
        "The number of diacritics shown in the table is less than the number of possible predictions since we treat contiguous diacritics between consonants as a single prediction.",
        "For our experiments in Syriac, we use the New Testament portion of the Peshitta (Kiraz, 1994) and treat each verse as if it were a sentence.",
        "The diacritics we predict are the five short vowels, as well as Seyame, Rukkakha, Qussâya, and linea ocultans.",
        "For Arabic, we use the training/test split defined by Zitouni et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "We group all words having the same P index value into a sentence.",
        "We build our own development set by removing the last 15% of the sentences of the training set.",
        "Like Zitouni, when no solution exists in the treebank, we take the first solution as the gold tag.",
        "Zitouni et al.",
        "(2006) report results on several different conditions, but we focus on the most challenging of the conditions: we predict the standard three short vowels, three tanween, sukuun, shadda, and all case endings.",
        "(Preliminary experiments show that our models perform equally favorably in the other scenarios as well.)",
        "For Hebrew, we use the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) in the Westminster Leningrad Codex (Zefa-nia XML Project, 2009).",
        "As with Syriac, we treat each verse as a sentence and remove the paragraph markers (pe and samekh).",
        "There is a large number of diacritics that could be predicted in Hebrew and no apparent standardization in the literature.",
        "For these reasons, we attempt to predict as many diacritics as possible.",

        "Since Syriac is of primary interest to us, we begin by examining the results from this dataset.",
        "Syriac appears to be easier to diacritize than Arabic, considering it has a similar number of diacritics and only one-third the amount of data.",
        "On this dataset, hybrid has the lowest WER and DER, achieving nearly 30% and 18% reduction in WER and DER, respectively, over kUbler; it reduces both error rates over cons-only by more than 14%.",
        "These results attest to the effectiveness of our model in accounting for the observations made in Section 3.",
        "A similar pattern holds for the Hebrew and English datasets, namely that hybrid reduces the WER over kUbler by 28% to upwards of 50%; cons-only also consistently and significantly outperforms kübler and ccmm.",
        "However, the reduction in error rate for our cons-only and hybrid models tends to be lower for DER than WER in all languages except for English.",
        "In the case of hybrid, this is probably because it is inherently word-based.",
        "Having access to entire previous dia-critized words may be a contributing factor as well, especially in cons-only.",
        "When comparing model classes (kuübler and ccmm), it appears that performance is comparable across all languages, with the maxent approach enjoying a slight advantage except in English.",
        "Interestingly, the maxent solution usually handles unknown words better, although it does not specifically target this case.",
        "Both models outperform zitouni-lex in Arabic, despite the fact that they use a much simpler feature set, most notably, the lack of previous diacritics.",
        "In the case of ccmm this may be attributable in part to our use of an L-BFGS optimizer, convergence criteria, feature selection, or other potential differences not noted in Zitouni et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "We note that the maxent-based approaches are much more time and memory intensive.",
        "Using the Arabic data, we are able to compare our methods to several other published results.",

        "This empirically suggests that the independence assumptions in consonant-only models are too strict.",

        "In fact, cons-only has a lower WER than all but two of the seven techniques used by Habash and Rambow (2007), which use a morphological analyzer.",
        "Interestingly, hybrid does worse than cons-only on this dataset, although it is still competitive with zitouni-all.",
        "We hypothesize that the observations from Section 3 do not hold as strongly for this dataset.",
        "For this reason, using a smooth interpolation function (rather than the abrupt one we employ) may be advantageous and is an interesting avenue for future research.",
        "One last observation is that the approaches that use diacritics from previous words (i.e., cons-only and hybrid) usually have lower sentence error rates (not shown in Figure 4).",
        "This highlights an advantage of observation 5: that dependencies on previously diacritized words can help ensure a consistent tagging within a sentence."

        "In this paper, we have presented a low-resource solution for automatic diacritization.",
        "Our approach is motivated by empirical observations of the ambiguity and frequency of undiacritized and diacritized words as well as by the hypothesis that diacritics from previous words provide useful information.",
        "The main contributions of our work, based on these observations, are (1) a hybrid word-level CMM combined with a consonant-level model for rare words, (2) a consonant-level model with dependencies on previous diacritized words, (3) new features that leverage these dependencies, and (4) an efficient, approximate decoder for these models.",
        "As expected, the efficacy of our approach varies across languages, due to differences in the actual ambiguity and frequency of words in these languages.",
        "Nevertheless, our models consistently reduce WER by 15% to nearly 50% over the best performing low-resource models in the literature.",
        "In Arabic, our models approach state-of-the-art despite not using a morphological analyzer.",
        "Arguably, our results have brought diacritization very close to being useful for practical application, especially when considering that we evaluated our method on the most difficult task in Arabic, which has been reported to have double the WER (Zitouni et al., 2006).",
        "The success of this low-resource solution naturally suggests that where more resources are available (e.g., in Arabic), they could be used to further reduce error rates.",
        "For instance, it may be fruitful to incorporate a morphological analyzer or segmentation and part-of-speech tags.",
        "In future work, we would like to consider using CRFs in place of MEMMs.",
        "Also, other approximate decoders used in pipeline approaches could be explored as alternatives to the one we used (e.g., Finkel et al., 2006).",
        "Additionally, we wish to include our model as a stage in a pipeline that segments, dia-critizes, and labels morphemes.",
        "Since obtaining data for these tasks is substantially more expensive, we hope to use active learning to obtain more data.",
        "Our framework is applicable for any sequence labeling task that can be done at either a word or a sub-word (e.g., character) level.",
        "Segmentation and lemmatization are particularly promising tasks to which our approach could be applied.",
        "Finally, for the sake of completeness, we note that more recent work has been done based on our baseline models that has emerged since the preparation of the current work, particularly Zitouni et al.",
        "(2009) and Mohamed et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "We wish to address any improvements captured by this more recent work such as the use of different data sets and addressing problems with the hamza to decrease error rates."
