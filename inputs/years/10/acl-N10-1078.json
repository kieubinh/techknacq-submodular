        "On Arabic-English and Chinese-English, using standard test data and current statistical machine translation systems, 10 monolingual translators were able to translate 35% of Arabic and 28% of Chinese sentences correctly on average, with some of the participants coming close to professional bilingual performance on some of the documents.",
        "While machine translation systems have advanced greatly over the last decade, nobody seriously expects human-level performance any time soon, except for very constraint settings.",
        "But are todays systems good enough to enable monolingual speakers of the target language without knowledge of the source language to generate correct translations?",
        "And what type of assistance from machine translation is most helpful for such translators?",
        "We carried out a study that involved monolingual translators who had no knowledge of Chinese and Arabic to translate documents from the NIST 2008 test sets, being assisted by statistical machine translation systems trained on data created under the GALE research program.",
        "Our study shows that monolingual translators were able to translate 35% of Arabic and 28% of Chinese sentences, under a strict standard of correctness that scored professional bilingual translations as 61% and 66% correct for Arabic and Chinese, respectively.",
        "We found also large variability among the participants and between the documents in the http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/mt/ http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/programs/gale/gale.asp study, indicating the importance of general language skills and domain knowledge.",

        "Especially for the commercially most relevant field of publication-quality translation of official reports, product manuals, promotion material, web sites, and so on, machine translation currently plays at most a supportive role.",
        "The main drawback of relying on professional human translators is their high cost.",
        "A number of technological advances in the industry have increased the productivity of translators, and thus lowered their cost, over the last two decades.",
        "The pervasive use of computers and the Internet has reduced the cost of management, and helped a industry where translation is outsources many times over: from the original customer to a translation agency, from a translation agency to freelance translators, and maybe some additional levels in between.",
        "The use of computers has also led to the adoption of tools such as translation memories (databases of translated material that are queried for fuzzy matches, i.e. translated sentences similar to the one to be processed), monolingual and bilingual concordances (showing words used in context, and their translations), terminology databases, online dictionaries and thesauri, and basic editing tools such as word processors and spell checkers (Desilets, 2009).",
        "The use of machine translation has not yet made great inroads into the toolbox of professional translators.",
        "Being reduced to mere post-editors of badly machine translated texts is not an appealing prospect, and machine translation is generally considered (rightly or wrongly) not yet good enough to increase productivity.",

        "Both skill sets may be hard to find, especially in combination.",
        "In fact, it is common practice in the translation industry to differentiate translators according to their qualifications.",
        "For instance, junior translators may produce the first draft, and senior translators edit it – which they will be able to do much faster than a translation from scratch by themselves.",
        "Human translation is also performed in a nonprofessional environment by generally less qualified volunteer translators.",
        "To give just a few example: there are vibrant communities that concern themselves with the translation of Wikipedia articles (Kumaran et al., 2008), open source software documentation, movie subtitles, and even material such as the TED conference talks.",

        "While there is increasing effort to build grammar-based translation models that take into account the recursive nature of language, currently the most popular models are still phrase-based.",
        "In phrase based models, the input is segmented into text chunks (that do not have to correspond to linguistic phrases), each is translated and may be reordered, and the output is assembled with the help of a language model.",

        "Typically, up to 20 translation options for each input phrase are considered during decoding.",

        "In these setups, the human translator is creating the translation, but receives suggestions how to complete the sentence or is offered alternative translation options for the input words and phrases.",
        "The translation options that the decoder is using are ranked based on their probability and presented to the human translator, as done by Koehn (2009).",
        "Sentence completion prediction is based on the search graph (Barrachina et al., 2009).",

        "An important question is how the improvements in translation quality can be utilized.",
        "The second motivation for choosing Arabic-English and Chinese-English is that they are undeci-pherably foreign for a typical European or American speaker of English.",
        "The fact that both languages are written in a different script already makes it impossible to spot cognates, except for the occasional number.",
        "In our study, the test subjects had to practically exclusively rely on the given sentence translations or phrase translations options.",
        "Chinese-English is considered significantly harder than Arabic-English, as measured by automatic metrics (which measure similarity to a human reference translation), human evaluation metrics such as HTER (which measures the number of editing steps necessary to correct the output into an acceptable translation), or human judgment on the correctness of the translation, its fluency or adequacy (which is typically measured on a scale from 1 to 5).",
        "All these metrics have been criticized in the past as too simple, biased towards statistical systems, non-repeatable, having low intra and inter-annotator agreement, or plainly too expensive to use.",
        "How to properly evaluate machine translation quality is still an open problem.",
        "From the view of machine translation evaluation, this paper explores the question if current machine translation systems have reached the goal to bring across the meaning of a foreign text.",

        "We approached this study from two directions: the motivation to enable monolingual translators and the need for a way to assess the quality of todays machine translation systems.",
        "Coming from a human translator's perspective, we asked what type of assistance machine translation can provide for a human translator.",
        "We compared the use of interactive machine translation against post-editing, and found no significant difference for Arabic (34% vs. 35%), but better performance with richer assistance for Chinese (30% vs. 26%).",
        "We believe that there is ample opportunity to provide additional assistance and we will explore this in future work.",
        "Coming from a machine translation perspective, we asked if current systems are good enough to bring across the meaning of documents, even if generating output language with grammatical and idiomatic mistakes.",
        "Given the harsh metric we use to assess translation quality (complete correctness of a sentence), we showed that monolingual translators were able to produce translations that were on average 35% (Arabic) and 28% (Chinese) correct, compared to 61% (Arabic) and 66% (Chinese) correctness for professional bilingual translations.",
        "Arguable, the method we use to assess the preservation of meaning in machine translation is superior to subjective adequacy judgments: it separates the task of defining the meaning of a machine translation from the assessment of its correctness.",
        "We identified name and number translation as important aspects to improve performance on this task.",
        "We also learned that there are significant difference between human translators, which indicates that general language skills and effort are very important.",
        "We also learned that the performance varies significantly for different documents in a way that hints at the importance of domain knowledge.",
        "In conclusion, a good monolingual translator has good language skills in the target language and understands the domain.",
        "In this case, this study suggests, she may be as good as a professional bilingual translator.",
