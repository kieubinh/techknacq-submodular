        "Since their introduction, automated measures of machine translation quality have played a critical role in the development and evolution of SMT systems.",
        "While such metrics were initially intended for evaluation, popular training methods such as minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) and margin infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008) train translation models toward a specific evaluation metric.",
        "This makes the quality of the resulting model dependent on how accurately the automatic metric actually reflects human preferences.",
        "The most popular metric for both comparing systems and tuning MT models has been BLEU.",
        "While BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is relatively simple, scoring translations according to their n-gram overlap with reference translations, it still achieves a reasonable correlation with human judgments of translation quality.",
        "It is also robust enough to use for automatic optimization.",
        "However, BLEU does have a number of shortcomings.",
        "It doesn't penalize n-gram scrambling (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), and since it isn't aware of synonymous words or phrases, it can inappropriately penalize translations that use them.",
        "Recently, there have been efforts to develop better evaluation metrics.",
        "Metrics such as Translation Edit Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006; Snover et al., 2009) and METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) perform a more sophisticated analysis of the translations being evaluated and the scores they produce tend to achieve a better correlation with human judgments than those produced by BLEU (Snover et al., 2009; Lavie and Denkowski, 2009; Przybocki et al., 2008; Snover et al., 2006).",
        "Their better correlations suggest that we might obtain higher quality translations by making use of these new metrics when training our models.",
        "We expect that training on a specific metric will produce the best performing model according to that metric.",
        "Doing better on metrics that better reflect human judgments seems to imply the translations produced by the model would be preferred by human judges.",
        "However, there are four potential problems.",
        "First, some metrics could be susceptible to systematic exploitation by the training algorithm and result in model translations that have a high score according to the evaluation metric but that are of low quality.",
        "Second, other metrics may result in objective functions that are harder to optimize.",
        "Third, some may result in better generalization performance at test time by not encouraging overfitting of the training data.",
        "Finally, as a practical concern, metrics used for training cannot be too slow.",
        "In this paper, we systematically explore these four issues for the most popular metrics available to the MT community.",
        "We examine how well models perform both on the metrics on which they were trained and on the other alternative metrics.",
        "Multiple models are trained using each metric in order to determine the stability of the resulting models.",
        "Select models are scored by human judges in order to determine how performance differences obtained by tuning to different automated metrics relates to actual human preferences.",
        "The next sections introduce the metrics and our training procedure.",

        "Designing good automated metrics for evaluating machine translations is challenging due to the variety of acceptable translations for each foreign sentence.",
        "Popular metrics produce scores primarily based on matching sequences of words in the system translation to those in one or more reference translations.",
        "The metrics primarily differ in how they account for reorderings and synonyms.",
        "BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) uses the percentage of n-grams found in machine translations that also occur in the reference translations.",
        "These n-gram precisions are calculated separately for different ngram lengths and then combined using a geometric mean.",
        "The score is then scaled by a brevity penalty if the candidate translations are shorter than the references, BP = min(1.0, e-len(R)/len(T)).",
        "Equation 1 gives BLEU using n-grams up to length N for a corpus of candidate translations T and reference translations R. A variant of BLEU called the NIST metric (Doddington, 2002) weights n-gram matches by how informative they are.",
        "While easy to compute, BLEU has a number of shortcomings.",
        "Since the order of matching n-grams is ignored, n-grams in a translation can be randomly rearranged around non-matching material or other n-gram breaks without harming the score.",
        "BLEU also does not explicitly check whether information is missing from the candidate translations, as it only examines what fraction of candidate translation n-grams are in the references and not what fraction of references n-grams are in the candidates (i.e., BLEU ignores n-gram recall).",
        "Finally, the metric does not account for words and phrases that have similar meanings.",
        "METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) computes a one-to-one alignment between matching words in a candidate translation and a reference.",
        "If a word matches multiple other words, preference is given to the alignment that reorders the words the least, with the amount of reordering measured by the number of crossing alignments.",
        "Alignments are first generated for exact matches between words.",
        "Additional alignments are created by repeatedly running the alignment procedure over unaligned words, first allowing for matches between word stems, and then allowing matches between words listed as synonyms in WordNet.",
        "From the final alignment, the candidate translation's unigram precision and recall is calculated P = îiïïiEï^ and R = T^g^.",
        "These twoare then combined into a weighted harmonic mean (2).",
        "To penalize reorderings, this value is then scaled by a fragmentation penalty based on the number of chunks the two sentences would need to be broken into to allow them to be rearranged with no crossing alignments, Pßri = 1 - 7 ß.",
        "Equation 3 gives the final METEOR score as the product of the unigram harmonic mean, F , and the fragmentation penalty, Pß;7.",
        "The free parameters a, ß, and y can be used to tune the metric to human judgments on a specific language and variation of the evaluation task (e.g., ranking candidate translations vs. reproducing judgments of translations adequacy and fluency).",
        "TER (Snover et al., 2006) searches for the shortest sequence of edit operations needed to turn a candidate translation into one of the reference translations.",
        "The allowable edits are the insertion, deletion, and substitution of individual words and swaps of adjacent sequences of words.",
        "The swap operation differentiates TER from the simpler word error rate (WER) metric (Nießen et al., 2000), which only makes use of insertions, deletions, and substitutions.",
        "Swaps prevent phrase reorderings from being excessively penalized.",
        "Once the shortest sequence of operations is found, TER is calculated simply as the number of required edits divided by the reference translation length, or average reference translation length when multiple are available (4).",
        "TER - miD;fitSh (4) avg ret length",
        "TER-Plus (TERp) (Snover et al., 2009) extends TER by allowing the cost of edit operations to be tuned in order to maximize the metric's agreement with human judgments.",
        "TERp also introduces three new edit opertions: word stem matches, WordNet synonym matches, and multiword matches using a table of scored paraphrases.",
        "MERT is the standard technique for obtaining a machine translation model fit to a specific evaluation metric (Och, 2003).",
        "Learning such a model cannot be done using gradient methods since the value of the objective function only depends on the translation model's argmax for each sentence in the tuning set.",
        "Typically, this optimization is performed as a series of line searches that examines the value of the evaluation metric at critical points where a new translation argmax becomes preferred by the model.",
        "Since the model score assigned to each candidate translation varies linearly with changes to the model parameters, it is possible to efficiently find the global minimum along any given search direction with only O(n) operations when n-best lists are used.",
        "Using our implementation of MERT that allows for pluggable optimization metrics, we tune models to BLEU:N for N = 1... 5, TER, two configurations of TERp, WER, several configurations of METEOR, as well as additive combinations of these metrics.",
        "The TERp configurations include the default configuration of TERp and TERpA: the configuration of TERp that was trained to match human judgments for NIST Metrics MATR (Matthew Snover and Schwartz, 2008; Przybocki et al., 2008).",
        "For METEOR, we used the standard METEOR English parameters (a = 0.8, ß = 2.5, y = 0.4), and the English parameters for the ranking METEOR (a = 0.95, ß = 0.5, y = 0.5), which was tuned to maximize the metric's correlation with WMT-07 human ranking judgements (Agarwal and Lavie, 2008).",
        "The default METEOR parameters favor longer translations than the other metrics, since high a values place much more weight on unigram recall than precision.",
        "Since this may put models tuned to METEOR at a disadvantage when being evaluated by the other metrics, we also use a variant of the standard English model and of ranking METEOR with a set to 0.5, as this weights both recall and precision equally.",
        "For each iteration of MERT, 20 random restarts were used in addition to the best performing point discovered during earlier iterations of training.",
        "Since MERT is known to be sensitive to what restart points are provided, we use the same series of random restart points for each model.",
        "During each iteration of MERT, the random seed is based on the MERT iteration number.",
        "Thus, while a different set of random points is selected during each MERT iteration, on any given iteration all models use the same set of points.",
        "This prevents models from doing better or worse just because they received different starting points.",
        "However, it is still possible that certain random starting points are better for some evaluation metrics than others."

        "In fact, the BLEU:3 trained model outperforms all other models on BLEU:N metrics.",

        "While the introduction of swaps allows the scores produced by the TER metrics to achieve better correlation with human judgments, our models are apparently unable to exploit this during training.",
        "This maybe due to the monotone nature of the reference translations and the fact that having multiple references reduces the need for re-orderings.",
        "However, it is possible that differences between training to WER and TER would become more apparent using models that allow for longer distance reorderings or that do a better job of capturing what reorderings are acceptable.",
        "Third, with the exception of BLEU:1, the performance of the BLEU, NIST, and the METEOR a=.5 models appears to be more robust across the other evaluation metrics than the standard METEOR, METEOR ranking, and edit distance based models (WER, TER, TERp, an TERpA).",

        "Training to different evaluation metrics follows the expected pattern whereby models perform best on the same type of metric used to train them.",
        "However, models trained using the n-gram based metrics, BLEU and NIST, are more robust to being evaluated using the other metrics.",
        "Edit distance models tend to do poorly when evaluated on other metrics, as do models trained using METEOR.",
        "However, training models to METEOR can be made more robust by setting a to 0.5, which balances the importance the metric assigns to precision and recall.",
        "The fact that the WER, TER and TERp models perform very similarly suggests that current phrase-based translation systems lack either the features or the model structure to take advantage of swap edit operations.",
        "The situation might be improved by using a model that does a better job of both capturing the structure of the source and target sentences and their allowable reorderings, such as a syntactic tree-to-string system that uses contextually rich rewrite rules (Galley et al., 2006), or by making use of larger more fine grained feature sets (Chiang et al., 2009) that allow for better discrimination between hypotheses.",
        "Human results indicate that edit distance trained models such as WER and TERp tend to produce lower quality translations than BLEU or NIST trained models.",
        "Tuning to METEOR works reasonably well for Chinese, but is not a good choice for Arabic.",
        "We suspect that the newer RYPT metric (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2009), which directly makes use of human adequacy judgements of substrings, would obtain better human results than the automated metrics presented here.",
        "However, like other metrics, we expect performance gains still will be sensitive to how the mechanics of the metric interact with the structure and feature set of the decoding model being used.",
        "BLEU and NIST's strong showing in both the machine and human evaluation results indicates that they are still the best general choice for training model parameters.",
        "We emphasize that improved metric correlations with human judgments do not imply that models trained to a metric will result in higher quality translations.",
        "We hope future work on developing new evaluation metrics will explicitly explore the translation quality of models trained to them."
