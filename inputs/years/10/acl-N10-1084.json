        "Steganography is concerned with hiding information in some cover medium, by manipulating properties of the medium in such a way that the hidden information is not easily detectable by an observer (Fridrich, 2009).",
        "The covert communication is such that the very act of communication is to be kept secret from outside observers.",
        "A related area is Watermarking, in which modifications are made to a cover medium in order to identify it, for example for the purposes of copyright.",
        "Here the changes may be known to an observer, and the task is to make the changes in such a way that the watermark cannot easily be removed.",
        "There is a large literature on image steganogra-phy and watermarking, in which images are modified to encode a hidden message or watermark.",
        "Image stegosystems exploit the redundancy in an image representation together with limitations of the human visual system.",
        "For example, a standard image stegosystem uses the least-significant-bit (LSB) substitution technique.",
        "Since the difference between 11111111 and 11111110 in the value for red/green/blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye, the LSB can be used to hide information other than colour, without being perceptable by a human observer.",
        "A key question for any steganography system is the choice of cover medium.",
        "Given the ubiquitous nature of natural languages and electronic text, text is an obvious medium to consider.",
        "However, the literature on Linguistic Steganography, in which linguistic properties of a text are modified to hide information, is small compared with other media (Bergmair, 2007).",
        "The likely reason is that it is easier to make changes to images and other non-linguistic media which are undetectable by an observer.",
        "Language has the property that even small local changes to a text, e.g. replacing a word by a word with similar meaning, may result in text which is anomalous at the document level, or anomalous with respect to the state of the world.",
        "Hence finding linguistic transformations which can be applied reliably and often is a challenging problem for Linguistic Steganography.",
        "In this paper we focus on steganography rather than watermarking, since we are interested in the requirement that any changes to a text be imperceptible to an observer.",
        "Figure 1 shows the Linguistic Steganography framework.",
        "First, some secret message, represented as a sequence of bits, is hidden in a cover text using the embedding algorithm, resulting in the stego text?",
        "Next, the stego text passes the human observer, who is happy for innocuous messages to pass between the sender and receiver, but will examine the text for any suspicious looking content.",
        "Once the stego text reaches the receiver, the hidden message is recovered using the extracting algorithm.",
        "There is a fundamental tradeoff in all steganogra-phy systems, and one that is especially apparent in the Linguistic Steganography framework: the tradeoff between imperceptibility and payload.",
        "Payload is the number of bits that can be encoded per unit of cover medium, for example per sentence in the linguistic case.",
        "The tradeoff arises because any attempt to hide additional information in the cover text, through the application of more linguistic transformations, is likely to increase the chances of raising the suspicions of the observer, by introducing anomalies into the text.",
        "The key elements of a Linguistic Steganography system are the linguistic transformation and the embedding method.",
        "In this paper we focus on the linguistic transformation.",
        "Section 5 describes a possible embedding method for our framework, and for readers unfamiliar with linguistic steganography shows how linguistic transformations can be used to embed hidden bits in text.",
        "Section 2 describes some of the previous transformations used in Linguistic Steganography.",
        "Note that we are concerned with transformations which are linguistic in nature, rather than dealing with superficial properties of the text, e.g. the amount of white space between words (Por et al., 2008).",
        "Our proposed method is based on the automatically acquired paraphrase dictionary described in Callison-Burch (2008), in which the application of paraphrases from the dictionary encodes secret bits.",
        "One advantage of the dictionary is that it has wide coverage, being automatically extracted; however, a disadvantage is that it contains many paraphrases which are either inappropriate, or only appropriate in certain contexts.",
        "Since we require any changes to be imperceptible to a human observer, it is crucial to our system that any uses of paraphrasing are grammatical and retain the meaning of the original cover text.",
        "In order to test the grammaticality and meaning preserving nature of a paraphrase, we employ a simple technique based on checking whether the contexts containing the paraphrase are in the Google n-gram corpus.",
        "This technique is based on the simple hypothesis that, if the paraphrase in context has been used many times before on the web, then it is an appropriate use.",
        "We test our n-gram-based system against some human judgements of the grammaticality of paraphrases in context.",
        "We find that using larger contexts leads to a high precision system (100% when using 5-grams), but at the cost of a reduced recall.",
        "This precision-recall tradeoff reflects the inherent tradeoff between imperceptibility and payload in a Linguistic Steganography system.",
        "We also experiment with a CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2007), requiring that the contexts surrounding the original phrase and paraphrase are assigned the same CCG lexical categories by the parser.",
        "This method increases the precision of the Google n-gram check with a slight loss in recall.",
        "A contribution of this paper is to advertise the Linguistic Steganography problem to the ACL community.",
        "The requirement that any linguistic transformation maintain the grammaticality and meaning of the cover text makes the problem a strong test for existing NLP technology."

        "We define a google-count function G().",
        "This function takes a context window pair W<£> as input and outputs a frequency count pair of W<> recorded in the Google n-gram data.",
        "If a context window cannot be found in the Google n-gram data, the frequency count of that window is zero.",
        "Also, we define a binary occurrence function O().",

        "The function outputs one if either both WlO> and WR<n> already occurred in the original sentence (before paraphrasing) or if the frequency counts output by G(W<n>) are both greater than zero.",
        "The two major components in our method are the paraphrase dictionary and the Google n-gram data.",
        "Once a phrase P in the cover sentence S is matched with that in the paraphrase dictionary, we test the use of its paraphrase P' by the following method.",
        "This method takes into account maximum C contextual words at both sides of the target phrase, and uses Google n-gram data as a check, where n = 2, 3, 4 or 5, and maxC = 1 to n – 1.",

        "For example, we want to check the acceptability of the paraphrase in context shown in Figure 3 by using google tri-gram data (n = 3) and taking maximum context size equal to two into consideration (maxC = 2).",
        "The procedure starts from taking context size C equal to one into account, namely checking the occurrence of W3.",
        "If the paraphrase P' passes the current test, in the next iteration it will be tested by taking one more context word into account, namely W. However, If the paraphrase P' fails the current (n, C) check the checking procedure will terminate and report that the paraphrase fails.",
        "In contrast, if the paraphrase passes all the (n, C) checks where C = 1 to maxC, the procedure determines the paraphrase as acceptable.",
        "What is happening is that an n-gram window is effectively being shifted across the paraphrase boundary to include different amounts of context and paraphrase.",
        "In order to improve the grammaticality checking, we use a parser as an addition to the basic Google n-gram method.",
        "We use the Clark and Curran (2007) ccg parser to analyse the sentence before and after paraphrasing.",
        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccg) is a lexicalised grammar formalism, in which ccg lexical categories – typically expressing sub-categorisation information – are assigned to each word in a sentence.",
        "The grammatical check works by checking if the words in the sentence outside of the phrase and paraphrase receive the same lexical categories before and after paraphrasing.",
        "If there is any change in lexical category assignment to these words then the paraphrase is judged ungrammatical.",
        "Hence the grammar check is at the word, rather than derivation, level; however, ccg lexical categories contain a large amount of syntactic information which this method is able to exploit.",
        "The test corpus described in Section 3.3 was split into development and test data: 100 instances for development and 400 for testing.",
        "The development data was used for preliminary experiments.",
        "For the test data, 246 of the examples (61.5%) had been judged as grammatical, and 154 (38.5%) had been judged as ungrammatical by the annotators.",

        "Precision and recall are relevant in our setting because high precision implies high imperceptibility, since grammatical phrases in context are less likely to be viewed as suspicious by the observer; whereas high recall maximises the payload (given the dictionary), since high recall implies that phrases are being paraphrased where possible (and hence embedding as much information as possible).",
        "An accuracy baseline is obtained by always returning the majority class, in this case always judging the paraphrase grammatical, which gives an accuracy of 61.5%.",
        "Table 3 gives the performance when only the ccg parser is used for checking grammaticality.",
        "As far as steganography is concerned, the precision is low, since over 30% of the paraphrases used are ungrammatical, which is likely to raise the suspicions of the observer.",
        "Table 4 gives the results for the Google n-gram method, for various n-gram and context sizes.",
        "As the n-gram size increases – meaning that a larger part of the context is used – the accuracy falls below that of the baseline.",
        "However, from a steganogra-phy aspect, accuracy is not useful, since the tradeoff between precision and recall is more relevant.",
        "As expected, with larger n-grams checking the left and right contexts, the precision increases, reaching 100% for the 5-grams.",
        "Hence, as far as grammaticality judgements are concerned, the imperceptibility requirement is completely satisified.",

        "size of an embedding unit, is 3.",
        "Next, we segment the cover text into three embedding units u1, u2 and u3, each of which contains three sentences.",
        "Since we want to embed secret bits 101 in u1 , u2 and u3 respectively, the embedding unit u2 should contain no paraphrasable sentence.",
        "That is, the paraphrasable phrase in t4 should be replaced by its paraphrase.",
        "Finally, the stego text is output and sent along with the private key D to the other party.",
        "A private key is known only to the parties that exchange messages.",
        "In order for this method to work, we require certain properties of the paraphrase dictionary.",
        "For example, it is crucial that, once a phrase has been paraphrased, it does not produce another phrase that can be paraphrased.",
        "This can be achieved by simply requiring that any paraphrase 'on the RHS' of the dictionary does not also appear as a phrase on the LHS.",
        "In fact, this is not so unnatural for the Callison-Burch dictionary, which consists of phrases mapped to sets of paraphrases, many of which only appear on one side.",
        "For extracting the secret data, first, the stego text T' undergoes sentence segmentation, and N defined sentences s1, s'2,..., s'N are obtained.",
        "According to the private key D, every D sentences are treated as an information unit, and in each unit we check the occurrence of paraphrasable sentences making use of our paraphrasing method.",
        "If an information unit contains at least one paraphrasable sentence, this information unit implies the embedding of 1.",
        "In contrast, if none of the sentences in the information unit are paraphrasable, it implies the embedding of 0.",
        "Hence, in order to recover the hidden message, the receiver requires the sentence segmentation algorithm, the paraphrase dictionary, the automatic program determining grammaticality of paraphrases in context, and the secret key D. The extraction process essentially reverses the embedding method."

        "The contributions of this paper are to develop an automatic system for checking the grammaticality and fluency of paraphrases in context, and the proposal of using paraphrases as a suitable transformation for Linguistic Steganography.",
        "An advantage of our proposed method is that it is somewhat language and domain independent, requiring only a paraphrase dictionary and a Google n-gram corpus, both of which are likely to be available for a range of languages in the future.",
        "There are various practical issues in the application of Linguistic Steganography systems that we have chosen to ignore.",
        "For example, we have not discussed the choice of cover text.",
        "If a newspaper article were chosen as the cover text, then any changes could be easily found in practice by comparing the stego text with the original article, which is likely to be readily available.",
        "Another interesting question that we have not addressed is whether some languages are better suited to Linguistic Steganography than others, or whether some languages are better suited to particular linguistic transformations than others.",
        "Finally, we have only evaluated our grammatical checker and not the steganography system itself (other than giving an indication of the likely payload).",
        "How best to evaluate the imperceptibility of such a system we leave to future work."
