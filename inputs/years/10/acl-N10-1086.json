        "In this paper, we focus on question generation (QG) for the creation of educational materials for reading practice and assessment.",
        "Our goal is to generate fact-based questions about the content of a given article.",
        "The top-ranked questions could be filtered and revised by educators, or given directly to students for practice.",
        "Here we restrict our investigation to questions about factual information in texts.",
        "We begin with a motivating example.",
        "Consider the following sentence from the Wikipedia article on the history of Los Angeles: During the Gold Rush years in northern California, Los Angeles became known as the \"Queen of the Cow Counties\" for its role in supplying beefand other foodstuffs to hungry miners in the north.",
        "Consider generating the following question from that sentence: What did Los Angeles become known as the \"Queen of the Cow Counties\" for?",
        "We observe that the QG process can be viewed as a two-step process that essentially \"factors\" the problem into simpler components.",
        "Rather than simultaneously trying to remove extraneous information and transform a declarative sentence into an interrogative one, we first transform the input sentence into a simpler sentence such as Los Angeles become known as the \"Queen ofthe Cow Counties\" for its role in supplying beefand other foodstuffs to hungry miners in the north, which we then can then transform into a more succinct question.",
        "Question transformation involves complex long distance dependencies.",
        "For example, in the question about Los Angeles, the word what at the beginning of the sentence is a semantic argument of the verb phrase known as ... at the end of the question.",
        "The characteristics of such phenomena are (arguably) difficult to learn from corpora, but they have been studied extensively in linguistics (Ross, 1967; Chomsky, 1973).",
        "We take a rule-based approach in order to leverage this linguistic knowledge.",
        "However, since many phenomena pertaining to question generation are not so easily encoded with rules, we include statistical ranking as an integral component.",
        "Thus, we employ an overgenerate-and-rank approach, which has been applied successfully in areas such as generation (Walker et al., 2001; Langkilde and Knight, 1998) and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2000).",
        "Since large datasets of the appropriate domain, style, and form of questions are not available to train our ranking model, we learn to rank from a relatively small, tailored dataset of humanlabeled output from our rule-based system.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "§2 clarifies connections to prior work and enumerates our contributions.",
        "§3 discusses particular terms and conventions we will employ.",
        "§4 discusses rule-based question transformation.",
        "§5 describes the data used to learn and to evaluate our question ranking model, and §6 then follows with details on the ranking approach itself.",

        "The generation of questions by humans has long motivated theoretical work in linguistics (e.g., Ross, 1967), particularly work that portrays questions as transformations of canonical declarative sentences (Chomsky, 1973).",
        "Questions have also been a major topic of study in computational linguistics, but primarily with the goal of answering questions (Dang et al., 2008).",
        "While much of the question answering research has focused on retrieval or extraction (e.g., Ravichan-dran and Hovy, 2001; Hovy et al., 2001), models of the transformation from answers to questions have also been developed (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) with the goal of finding correct answers given a question (e.g., in a source-channel framework).",
        "Also, Harabagiu et al.",
        "(2005) present a system that automatically generates questions from texts to predict which user-generated questions the text might answer.",
        "In such work on question answering, question generation models are typically not evaluated for their intrinsic quality, but rather with respect to their utility as an intermediate step in the question answering process.",
        "QG is very different from many natural language generation problems because the input is natural language rather than a formal representation (cf. Reiter and Dale, 1997).",
        "It is also different from some other tasks related to generation: unlike machine translation (e.g., Brown et al., 1990), the input and output for QG are in the same language, and their length ratio is often far from one to one; and unlike sentence compression (e.g., Knight and Marcu, 2000), QG may involve substantial changes to words and their ordering, beyond simple removal of words.",
        "Some previous research has directly approached the topic of generating questions for educational purposes (Mitkov and Ha, 2003; Kunichika et al., 2004; Gates, 2008; Rus and Graessar, 2009; Rus and Lester, 2009), but to our knowledge, none has involved statistical models for choosing among output candidates.",
        "Mitkov et al.",
        "(2006) demonstrated that automatic generation and manual correction of questions can be more time-efficient than manual authoring alone.",
        "Much of the prior QG research has evaluated systems in specific domains (e.g., introductory linguistics, English as a Second Language), and thus we do not attempt empirical comparisons.",
        "Existing QG systems model their transformations from source text to questions with many complex rules for specific question types (e.g., a rule for creating a question Who did the Subject Verb?",
        "from a sentence with SVO word order and an object referring to a person), rather than with sets of general rules.",
        "This paper's contributions are as follows:",
        "• We apply statistical ranking to the task of generating natural language questions.",
        "In doing so, we show that question rankings are improved by considering features beyond surface characteristics such as sentence lengths.",
        "• We model QG as a two-step process of first simplifying declarative input sentences and then transforming them into questions, the latter step being achieved by a sequence of general rules.",
        "• We incorporate linguistic knowledge to explicitly model well-studied phenomena related to long distance dependencies in WH questions, such as noun phrase island constraints.",
        "• We develop a QG evaluation methodology, including the use of broad-domain corpora."

        "The term \"source sentence\" refers to a sentence taken directly from the input document, from which a question will be generated (e.g., Kenya is located in Africa.).",
        "The term \"answer phrase\" refers to phrases in declarative sentences which may serve as targets for WH-movement, and therefore as possible answers to generated questions (e.g., in Africa).",
        "The term \"question phrase\" refers to the phrase containing the WH word that replaces an answer phrase (e.g., Where in Where is Kenya located?",
        ").",
        "To represent the syntactic structure of sentences, we use simplified Penn Treebank-style phrase structure trees, including POS and category labels, as produced by the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "Noun phrase heads are selected using Collins' rules (Collins, 1999).",
        "To implement the rules for transforming source sentences into questions, we use Tregex, a tree query language, and Tsurgeon, a tree manipulation language built on top of Tregex (Levy and Andrew, 2006).",
        "The Tregex language includes various relational operators based on the primitive relations of immediate dominance (denoted \"<\") and immediate precedence (denoted \".\").",

        "Many useful questions can be viewed as lexical, syntactic, or semantic transformations of the declarative sentences in a text.",
        "We describe how to model this process in two steps, as proposed in §1.",
        "In the first step for transforming sentences into questions, each of the sentences from the source text is expanded into a set of derived declarative sentences (which also includes the original sentence) by altering lexical items, syntactic structure, and semantics.",
        "Many existing NLP transformations could potentially be exploited in this step, including sentence compression, paraphrase generation, or lexical semantics for word substitution.",
        "In our implementation, a set of transformations derive a simpler form of the source sentence by removing phrase types such as leading conjunctions, sentence-level modifying phrases, and apposi-tives.",
        "Tregex expressions identify the constituents to move, alter, or delete.",
        "Similar transformations have been utilized in previous work on headline generation (Dorr and Zajic, 2003) and summarization (Toutanova et al., 2007).",
        "To enable questions about syntactically embedded content, our implementation also extracts a set of declarative sentences from any finite clauses, relative clauses, appositives, and participial phrases that appear in the source sentence.",
        "For example, it transforms the sentence Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic stop-loss orders, which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels into Automatic stop-loss orders are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels, from which the next step will produce What are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels?.",
        "In the second step, the declarative sentences derived in step 1 are transformed into sets of questions by a sequence of well-defined syntactic and lexical transformations (subject-auxiliary inversion, WH-movement, etc.).",
        "It identifies the answer phrases which may be targets for WH-movement and converts them into question phrases.",
        "In the current implementation, answer phrases can be noun phrases or prepositional phrases, which enables who, what, where, when, and how much questions.",
        "The system could be extended to transform other types of phrases into other types of questions (e.g., how, why, and what kind of).",
        "It should be noted that the transformation from answer to question is achieved by applying a series of generalpurpose rules.",
        "This would allow, for example, the addition of a rule to generate why questions that builds off of the existing rules for subject-auxiliary inversion, verb decomposition, etc.",
        "In contrast, previous QG approaches have employed separate rules for specific sentence types (e.g., Mitkov and Ha, 2003; Gates, 2008).",
        "For each sentence, many questions may be produced: there are often multiple possible answer phrases, and multiple question phrases for each answer phrase.",
        "Hence many candidates may result from the transformations.",
        "These rules encode a substantial amount of linguistic knowledge about the long distance dependencies prevalent in questions, which would be challenging to learn from existing corpora of questions and answers consisting typically of only thousands of examples (e.g., Voorhees, 2003).",

        "For ranking experiments, we present results for the following configurations of features:",
        "All This configuration includes the entire set of features described in §6.",
        "Surface Features This configuration includes only features that can be computed from the surface form of the question, source sentence, and answer phrase – that is, without hidden linguistic structures such as parts of speech or syntactic structures.",
        "Specifically, it includes features for lengths, length histograms, WH words, negation, and language model likelihoods.",
        "Question Only This configuration includes all features of questions, but no features involving the source sentence or answer phrase (e.g., it does not include source sentence part of speech counts).",
        "It does not include transformation features.",
        "We also present two baselines for comparison:",
        "Random The expectation of the performance if questions were ranked randomly.",
        "Oracle The expected performance if all questions that were labeled acceptable were ranked higher than all questions that were labeled unacceptable.",
        "Figure 2 shows that the percentage of questions rated as acceptable generally increases as the set of questions is restricted from the full 428 questions in the test set to only the top ranked questions.",
        "While 27.3% of all test set questions were acceptable, 52.3% of the top 20% of ranked questions were acceptable.",
        "Thus, the quality of the top fifth was nearly doubled by ranking with all the features.",
        "Ranking with surface features also improved question quality, but to a lesser extent.",
        "Thus, unobserved linguistic features such as parts of speech and syntax appear to add value for ranking questions.",
        "The ranker seems to have focused on the \"Does not make sense\" and \"Vague\" categories.",
        "The percentage of nonsensical questions dropped from 20.6% to 4.7%, and vagueness dropped from 19.6%",

        "to 7.0%, while ungrammaticality dropped from 14.0% to 10.5%, and the other, less prevalent, categories changed very little.",
        "Ablation experiments were also conducted to study the effects of removing each of the different types of features.",
        "Table 2 presents the percentages of acceptable test set questions in the top 20% and top 40% when they are scored by rankers trained with various feature sets that are defined by removing various feature types from the set of all possible features.",
        "Grammatical features appear to be the most important: removing them from the feature set resulted in a 9.0% absolute drop in acceptability in the top 20% of questions, from 52.3% to 43.3%.",
        "Some of the features did not appear to be particularly helpful, notably the N-gram language model features.",
        "We speculate that they might improve results when used with a larger, less noisy training set.",
        "Performance did not drop precipitously upon the removal of any particular feature type, indicating a high amount of shared variance among the features.",
        "However, removing several types of features at once led to somewhat larger drops in performance.",
        "For example, using only surface features led to a 12.8%",
