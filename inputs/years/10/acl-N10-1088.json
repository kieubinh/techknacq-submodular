        "For many semantic natural language processing tasks, systems require world knowledge to disambiguate language utterances.",
        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is no exception – systems for WSD require world knowledge to figure out which aspects of a word's context indicate one sense over another.",
        "A fundamental problem for WSD is that the required knowledge is open-ended.",
        "That is, for every ambiguous term, new kinds of information about the world become important, and the knowledge that a system may have acquired for previously-studied ambiguous terms may have little or no impact on the next ambiguous term.",
        "Thus open-ended knowledge acquisition is a fundamental obstacle to strong performance for this disambiguation task.",
        "Researchers have investigated a variety of techniques that address this knowledge acquisition bottleneck in different ways.",
        "Supervised WSD techniques, for instance, can learn to associate features in the context of a word with a particular sense of that word.",
        "Knowledge-based techniques rely on machine-readable dictionaries or lexical resources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to provide the necessary knowledge.",
        "And most recently, systems have used resources like Wikipedia, which contain user-contributed knowledge in the form of sense-disambiguated links, to acquire world knowledge for WSD.",
        "Yet each of these approaches is limited by the amount of manual effort that is needed to build the necessary resources, and as a result the techniques are limited to a subset of English words for which the manually-constructed resources are available.",
        "In this work we investigate an alternative approach that attacks the problem of knowledge acquisition head-on.",
        "We use information extraction (IE) techniques to extract glosses, or short textual characterizations of the meaning of one sense of a word.",
        "In the ideal case, we would extract full logical forms to define word senses, but here we instead focus on a more feasible, but still very useful, sub-task: for a given word sense, extract a collection of terms that are highly correlated with that sense and no other sense of the ambiguous word.",
        "Our system requires as input only an unlabeled corpus of documents that each contain the ambiguous term of interest.",
        "In experiments, we demonstrate that our gloss extraction system can often determine key aspects of a word's senses.",
        "In one experiment our system was able to extract glosses with 60% precision for 20 ambiguous biomedical terms, while discovering 7 senses of those terms that never appeared in a widely-used dictionary of biomedical terminology.",
        "In addition, we demonstrate that our extracted glosses are useful for real WSD problems: our system outperforms a state-of-the-art unsupervised system, and it comes close to the performance of a supervised WSD system on a challenging dataset.",
        "In the next section, we describe previous work.",
        "In Section 3, we formally define the gloss extraction task and refine it into a subtask that is feasible for an IE approach, and Section 5 presents our technique for using extracted glosses in a WSD task.",
        "Section 6 discusses our experiments and results."

        "Many previous systems (Cui et al., 2007; Androut-sopoulos and Galanis, 2005) have studied the related task of answering definitional questions on the Web, such as \"What does cold mean?\".",
        "Such systems are focused on information retrieval for human consumption, and especially on recall of definitional information (Velardi et al., 2008).",
        "They generally do not consider the problem of how to merge the large number of similar extracted definitions into a single item (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000), so that the overall result contains one definition per sense of the word.",
        "A separate approach (Paşca, 2005) relies on the WordNet lexical database to supply the set of senses, and extracts alternate glosses for the senses that have already been defined.",
        "When glosses are to be used by computational methods, as in a WSD system in our case, it becomes critical that the system extract one coherent gloss per sense.",
        "As far as we are aware, no previous system has extracted glosses for word sense disambiguation.",
        "Gloss extraction is related to the task of ontology extraction, in which systems extract hierarchies of word classes (Snow et al., 2006; Popescu et al., 2004).",
        "Gloss extraction differs from ontology extraction in that it extracts definitional information characterizing senses of a single word, rather than trying to place a word in a hierarchy of other words.",
        "Most WSD systems have relied on hand-labeled training examples (Leroy and Rindflesch, 2004; Joshi et al., 2005; Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004) or on dictionary glosses (Lesk, 1986; Stevenson and Wilks, 2001) or the WordNet hierarchy (Boyd-",
        "Graber et al., 2007) to help make disambiguation choices.",
        "In recent coarse-grained evaluations, such systems have achieved accuracies of close to 90% (Pradhan et al., 2007; Agirre and Soroa, 2007; Schi-jvenaars et al., 2005).",
        "However, by some estimates, English contains over a million word types, and new words and new senses are added to the language every day.",
        "It is unreasonable to expect that any system will have access to hand-labeled training examples or useful dictionary glosses for each ofthem.",
        "More recent techniques based on user-contributed knowledge (Mihalcea, 2007; Chklovski and Mihalfound in Wikipedia, suffer from similar problems -Wikipedia contains many articles on well known entities, categories, and events, but very few articles that disambiguate verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and certain kinds of nouns which are poorly represented in an encyclopedia.",
        "On the other hand, word usages in large corpora like the Web reflect nearly all of the word senses in use in English today, albeit without manually-supplied labels.",
        "Unsupervised approaches to WSD use clustering techniques to group instances of words into clusters that correspond to different senses (Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "While such systems are more general than supervised and dictionary-based approaches in that they can handle any word type and word sense, they have lagged behind other approaches in terms of accuracy thus far - for example, the best system in the recent word sense induction task of Semeval 2007 (Agirre and Soroa, 2007) achieved an F1 score of 78.7, slightly below the baseline (78.9) in which all instances of a word are part of a single cluster.",
        "Part of the problem is that the clustering techniques operate in a bag-of-words-like representation.",
        "This is an extremely high-dimensional space, and it is difficult in such a space to determine which dimensions are noise and which ones correlate with different senses.",
        "Our gloss extraction technique helps to address this curse of dimensionality by reducing the large vocabulary of a corpus to a much smaller set of terms that are highly relevant for WSD.",
        "Others (Kulkarni and Ped-ersen, 2005) have used feature selection techniques like mutual information to reduce dimensionality, but so far these techniques have only been able to find features that correlate with an ambiguous term.",
        "With gloss extraction, we are able to find features that correlate with individual senses of a term."

        "The first major challenge to a Gloss Extraction system is that the space of possible features is enormous, and almost all of them are irrelevant to the task at hand.",
        "Supervised techniques can use labeled examples to provide clues, but in an unsupervised setting the curse of dimensionality can be overwhelming.",
        "Indeed, unsupervised WSD techniques suffer from exactly this problem.",
        "GLOSSY's answer to this problem is based on the following observation: pairs of potential features which rarely or never co-occur in the same document in a large corpus are likely to represent features for two distinct senses.",
        "The well-known observation that words rarely exhibit more than one sense per discourse (Yarowsky, 1995) implies that features closely associated with a particular sense have a low probability of appearing in the same document as features associated with another sense.",
        "Features that are independent of any particular sense of the keyword, on the other hand, have no such restriction, and are just as likely to appear in the context of one sense as any other.",

        "The ambiguous terms vary from acronyms (7 terms), which are common and important in biomedical literature, to ambiguous biomedical terminology (3 terms), to terms like \"culture\" and \"mole\" that have some biomedical senses and some senses that are part of the general lexicon (11 terms).",
        "There were on average 271 labeled documents per term; the smallest number of documents for a term is 125, and the largest is 503.",
        "For every ambiguous term, we added on average 9625 (minimum of 1544, maximum of 15711) unlabeled documents to our collection by searching for the term on PubMed Central and downloading additional PubMed abstracts.",
        "We measured the performance of Glossy's gloss extraction by comparing the extracted glosses with definitions contained in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus.",
        "First, for each ambiguous term, we looked up the set of exact matches for that term in the Metathesaurus, and downloaded definitions for all of the different senses listed under that term.",
        "Wherever possible, we used the MeSH definition of a sense; when that was unavailable, we used the definition from the NCI Thesaurus; and when both were unavailable, we used the definition from the resource listed first.",
        "34 senses (40%) had no available definitions at all, but in all cases, the Metathesaurus lists a short (usually 1-3 word) gloss of the sense, which we used instead.",
        "We manually aligned extracted glosses with UMLS senses in a way that maximizes the number of matched senses for every ambiguous term.",
        "We consider an extracted gloss to match a UMLS sense when the extracted gloss unambiguously refers to a single sense of the ambiguous term, and that sense matches the definition in UMLS.",
        "Typically, this means that the extracted features in the gloss overlap content words in the UMLS definition (e.g., the extracted feature \"symptoms\" for the \"common cold\" sense of the term \"cold\").",
        "In some cases, however, there was no strict overlap in content words between the extracted gloss and the UMLS definition, but the sense of the extracted gloss still unambiguously matched a unique UMLS sense: e.g., for the term \"transport,\" the extracted gloss \"intracel-lular transport\" was matched with the UMLS sense of \"Molecular Transport,\" which the NCI Thesaurus defines as, \"Any subcellular or molecular process involved in translocation of a biological entity, such as a macromolecule, from one site or compartment to another.\"",
        "In the end, such matchings were determined by hand.",
        "Table 1 shows extracted glosses and UMLS definitions for the term \"mole.\"",
        "For each ambiguous term, we measure the number of extracted glosses, the number of UMLS senses, and the number of matches between the two.",

        "Table 2 shows the average of the precision and recall numbers over all terms.",
        "Since these terms have different numbers of senses, we can compute this average in two different ways: a Macro average, in which each term has equal weight in the average; and a Micro average, in which each term's weight in the average is proportional to the number of senses (extracted senses for the precision, and UMLS senses for the recall).",
        "We report on both.",
        "A strict matching between Glossy's glosses and UMLS senses is potentially unfair to Glossy in several ways: Glossy may discover valid senses that happen not to appear in UMLS; UMLS senses may overlap one another, and so multiple UMLS senses may match a single GLoSSY gloss; and the two sets of senses may differ in granularity.",
        "For the sake of repeatable experiments, in this evaluation we make no attempt to change existing UMLS senses.",
        "However, to highlight one particular strength of the Gloss Extraction paradigm, we do consider a separate evaluation that allows for new senses that GLoSSY discovers, but do not appear in UMLS.",
        "For instance, \"biliopancreatic diversion\" and \"bipolar disorder\" are both valid senses for the acronym \"BPD.\"",
        "GLoSSY discovers both, but UMLS does not contain entries for either, so in our original evaluation both senses would count against GLoSSY's precision.",
        "To correct for this, our second evaluation adds senses to the list of UMLS senses whenever GLoSSY discovers valid entries missing from the Metathesaurus.",
        "The last five columns of Table 2 show our results under these conditions.",
        "Despite the difficulty of the task, Glossy is able to find glosses with 53% precision and 47% recall (Macro average, no discovered senses) using only unlabeled corpora as input, and it is extracting roughly the right number of senses for each ambiguous term.",
        "In addition, GLoSSY is able to identify 7 valid senses missing from UMLS for the 20 terms in our evaluation.",
        "Including these senses in the evaluation increases GLoSSY's F1 by 6.2 points Micro (4.7 Macro).",
        "We are quite encouraged by the results, especially because they hold promise for WSD.",
        "Note that in order to improve upon a WSD baseline which tags all instances of a word as the same sense, GLoSSY only needs to be able to separate one sense from the rest.",

        "A more serious problem for Glossy is that the unlabeled corpus that it extracts glosses from may not match well with the labeled test data.",
        "Ifthe relative frequency of senses in the unlabeled documents does not match the relative frequency of senses in the labeled test set, Glossy may not extract the right set of glosses.",
        "Manual inspection of the extracted glosses shows that this is indeed a problem: for example, the labeled data contains two senses of the word \"mole\": a discolored area of skin (78%), and a burrowing mammal (22%); our unlabeled data contains both of these senses, but the additional sense of \"mole\" as a unit of measurement is by far predominant.",
        "Glossy manages to extract glosses for \"skin\" and \"unit ofmeasurement,\" butmisses out on \"mammal\" as a result of the skew in the data.",
        "Note that this problem, though serious for our experiments, is largely artificial from the point of view of applications.",
        "In a typical usage of a WSD system, there is a supply of data that the system needs to disambiguate, and accuracy is measured on a labeled sample of this data.",
        "Here, we started from a sample of labeled data, constructed a larger corpus that does not necessarily match it, and then ran our algorithm.",
        "To correct for the artificial bias in our experiment, we ran a second test in which we manually labeled a random sample of 100 documents for each ambiguous term from the larger unlabeled corpus.",
        "We used a subset of 14 of the 21 keywords in the original dataset.",
        "As before, we compared our system against Sensational and the most-frequent-sense Baseline.",
        "We also compare against an SVM system using 3-fold cross-validation.",
