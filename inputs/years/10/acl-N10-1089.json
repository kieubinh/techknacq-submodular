        "Multiword expressions are sequences of words that tend to co-occur more frequently than chance and are characterised by various levels of idiosyncracy (Baldwin et al., 2003; Baldwin, 2006).",

        "(see Section 6).",
        "The vast majority of these publications identifies as motivation for multiword expression research its potential contribution to deep or shallow parsing.",
        "On the other side of this issue, the state-of-the-art parsing systems seem to ignore the fact that treating multiword expressions as syntactic units would potentially increase parser's accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we present an experimental study attempting to estimate the contribution of integrating multiword expressions into shallow parsing.",
        "We focus on multiword expressions that consist of two successive tokens; in particular, compound nominals proper names and adjective-noun constructions.",
        "We also present a detailed classification method to aid human annotation during the procedure of deciding if a parse is correct or wrong.",
        "We present experimental results about the different classes of changes that occur in the parser output while unifying multiword expression components.",
        "We conclude that treating known multiwords expressions as singletons leads to an increase of between 7.5% and 9.5% in accuracy of shallow parsing of sentences containing these multiword expressions.",
        "Increase percentages are higher for multiword expressions that consist of an adjective followed by a noun (12% to 15%); and even higher for non-compositional multiword expressions that consist of an adjective and a noun (15.5% to 19.5%).",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we present how multiword expressions can be annotated in text and used by a shallow parser.",
        "In Section 3 we present an overview of our experimental process.",

        "The target of our experiment is to evaluate whether replacing the multiword expression tokens with a single token, unknown to the part of speech tagger, improves shallow parsing accuracy.",
        "The ideal way to perform this evaluation would be to use a corpus with manual annotation about parsing and multiword expressions.",
        "Given this corpus we would be able to measure the accuracy of a shallow (or deep) parser before and after replacing multiword expressions.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge there is no corpus available to include this type of annotations in English.",
        "Instead, there are two options: Firstly, we can use treebank data, where manual parsing annotation is readily available, and manually annotate multiword expressions.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that results are directly comparable with other results of the literature, due to the use of benchmark data.",
        "Manual annotation of multiword expressions is a very time-and effort-consuming process due to the large size of most treebanks.",
        "Alternatively, multiword expression annotation could be done using a method of recognition.",
        "Annotating the multiword expressions that appear in WordNet could be a safe decision, in terms of correctness, however, WordNet is reported to have limited coverage of multiword expressions (Baldwin, 2006; Laporte and Voyatzi, 2008).",
        "WordNet covers only 9.1 % and 16.1 % of the datasets of Nicholson and Baldwin (2008) (484 noun noun compounds), respectively.",
        "Secondly, we can use a set of multiword expressions as a starting point and then create corpora that contain instances of these multiword expressions.",
        "In succession, these sentences need to be manually annotated in terms of parsing, and this requires huge human effort.",
        "Alternatively, we can parse the corpora before and after replacing the multiword expression and then compare the parser output.",
        "This is the evaluation procedure that we chose to follow, and is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The above procedure is only able to retrieve instances where the replacement of the multiword expression leads to a different parsing, a different allocation of tokens to phrases.",
        "It is not able to spot instances where the parser output remains unchanged after the replacement, no matter if they are correct.",

        "Multiword expression: \"fire wheel\" multiword expressions with a single token improves parsing accuracy, we are not interested in instances that remain unchanged.",
        "We focus on instances that changed; either they were corrected or they were made wrong or they remain erroneous.",
        "For example, the shallow parser output for example A in Table 1 did not change after the replacement.",
        "Example B in Table 1 shows a sentence which was corrected after the replacement.",
        "Instead of manually annotating the sentences whose parser output changed after the replacement as corrected or not, we identify a number of change classes under which we classify all these sentences.",
        "In the following section, we present the change classes.",

        "We also discuss the opposite; if the form of each change class guarantees that its sentences are correctly parsed before the change and wrongly parsed after the change.",
        "In this case, the sentences of the corresponding class should be counted as true negatives.",
