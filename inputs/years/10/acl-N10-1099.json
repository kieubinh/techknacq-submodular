        "There is a small body of work that has investigated using NLP for the problem of identifying coherence in student essays.",

        "Foltz, et al.",
        "(1998) systems measure lexical relatedness between text segments by using vector-based similarity between adjacent sentences; Higgins et al's (2004) system computes similarity across text segments.",
        "Foltz et al.",
        "'s (1998) approach is in line with the earlier TextTiling method that identifies subtopic structure in text (Hearst, 1997).",
        "Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) addressed essay coherence using Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein, 1995).",
        "More recently, Barzilay and Lapata's (2008) approach (henceforth, BL08) used an entity-based representation to evaluate coherence.",
        "In BL08, entities (nouns and pronouns) are represented by their sentence roles in a text.",
        "The algorithm keeps track of the distribution of entity transitions between adjacent sentences, and computes a value for all transition types based on their proportion of occurrence in a text.",
        "BL08 apply their algorithm to three tasks, using well-formed newspaper corpora: text ordering, summary coherence evaluation, and readability assessment.",
        "For each task, their system outperforms a Latent",
        "Semantic Analysis baseline.",
        "In addition, best performance on each task is achieved using different system and feature configurations.",
        "Pitler coherence in well-formed texts.",
        "Coherence quality is typically present in scoring criteria for evaluating a student's essay.",
        "This paper focuses on the development of models to predict low-and high-coherence ratings for essays.",
        "Student essay data, unlike newspaper text, is typically noisy, especially when students are non-native English speakers (NNES).",
        "Here, we evaluate how BL08 algorithm features can be used to model coherence in a new, noisy data domain -student essays.",
        "We found that coherence can be best modeled by combining BL08 entity-based features with novel writing quality features.",
        "Further, our use of data sets from three different test-taker populations also shows that coherence models will differ across populations.",
        "Different populations might use language differently which could affect how coherence is presented.",

        "Vectors are used to build coherence models.",
        "The first step in the algorithm is to construct an entity grid in which all entities (nouns and pronouns) are represented by their roles (i.e., Subject (S), Object (O), Other (x)).",
        "Entity roles are then used to generate entity transitions - the role transitions across adjacent sentences (e.g., Subject-to-Object, Object-to-Object).",
        "Entity transition probabilities are the proportions of different entity transition types within a text.",

        "Entities can be represented in grids with specified roles (Syntax+) (S,O,X).",

        "Co-referential entities can be resolved (Coreference+) or not (Coreference-).",
        "Finally, the Salience option reflects the frequency with which an entity appears in the discourse: if the entity is mentioned two or more times, it is salient (Salient+), otherwise, not (Salient-).",

        "Given the combination, the entity transition probabilities were computed for all labeled essays in each data set.",

        "GUMS features describe the technical quality of the essay.",
        "The motivation for type/token features (*_TT) is to measure word variety.",
        "For example, a high probability for a \"Subject-to-Subject\" transition indicates that the writer is repeating an entity in Subject position across adjacent sentences.",
        "However, this does not take into account whether the same word is repeated or a variety of words are used.",
        "The {S,O,X,SOX}_TT (type/token) features uncover the actual words collapsed into the entity transition probabilities.",
        "Shell nouns (Atkas & Cortes, 2008), common in essay writing, might also affect coherence.",
        "NNES essays can contain many spelling errors.",
        "We evaluated the impact of a context-sensitive spell checker (SPCR+), as spelling variation will affect the transition probabilities in the entity grid.",
