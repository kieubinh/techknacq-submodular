        "Twitter is a communication platform which combines SMS, instant messages and social networks.",
        "It enables users to share information with their friends or the public by updating their Twitter messages.",
        "A large majority of the Twitter users are individual subscribers, who use Twitter to share information on \"what am I doing\" or \"what's happening right now\".",
        "Most of them update their Twitter messages very frequently, in which case the Twitter messages compose a detailed log of the user's everyday life.",
        "These Twitter messages contain rich information about an individual user, including what s/he is interested in and concerned about.",
        "Identifying an individual user's interests and concerns can help potential commercial applications.",
        "For instance, this information can be employed to produce \"following\" suggestions, either a person who shares similar interests (for expanding their social network) or a company providing products or services the user is interested in (for personalized advertisement).",
        "In this work, we focus on automatically generating personalized annotation tags to label Twitter user's interests and concerns.",
        "We formulate this problem as a keyword extraction task, by selecting words from each individual user's Twitter messages as his/her tags.",
        "Due to the lack of human generated annotations, we employ an unsupervised strategy.",
        "Specifically, we apply TFIDF ranking and TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) keyword extraction on Twitter messages after a series of text preprocessing steps.",
        "Experiments on randomly selected users showed good results with TextRank, but high variability among users."

        "Research work related to Twitter message analysis includes a user sentiment study (Jansen et al., 2009) and information retrieval indexing.",
        "To our knowledge, no previously published research has yet addressed problems on tagging user's personal interests from Twitter messages via keyword extraction, though several studies have looked at keyword extraction using other genres.",
        "For supervised keyword extraction, (Turney, 2000; Turney, 2003; Hulth, 2003; Yih et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2008) employed TFIDF or its variants with Part-of-Speech (POS), capitalization, phrase and sentence length, etc., as features to train keyword extraction models, and discriminative training is usually adopted.",
        "Yih et al.",
        "(2006) use logistic regression to extract keywords from web pages for content-targeted advertising, which has the most similar application to our work.",
        "However, due to the lack of human annotation on Twitter messages, we have to adopt an unsupervised strategy.",
        "For unsupervised keyword extraction, TFIDF ranking is a popular method, and its effectiveness has been shown in (Hulth, 2003; Yih et al., 2006).",
        "TextRank and its variants (Mihalcea and Ta-rau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2009) are graph-based text ranking models, which are derived from Google's PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "It outperforms TFIDF ranking on traditional keyword extraction tasks.",
        "However, previous work on both TFIDF ranking and TextRank has been done mainly on academic papers, spoken documents or web pages, whose language style is more formal (or, less \"conversational\") than that of Twitter messages.",
        "Twitter messages contain large amounts of \"noise\" like emoticons, internet slang words, abbreviations, and misspelled words.",
        "In addition, Twitter messages are a casual log of a user's everyday life, which often lacks of a coherent topic sequence compared to academic papers and most spoken documents.",
        "Hence, it remains to see whether TFIDF ranking and TextRank are effective for identifying user's interests from Twitter messages."

        "Figure 1 shows the framework of our system for tagging Twitter user's interests.",
        "A preprocessing pipeline is designed to deal with various types of \"noise\" in Twitter messages and produce candidate words for user tags.",

        "TFIDF ranking / TextRank",
        "Personalized annotation tags for the Twitter user",
        "In addition to messages describing \"What am I doing\" or \"what's happening right now\", Twitter users also write replying messages to comment on other users' messages.",
        "This kind of message generally contains more information about the users they reply to than about themselves, and therefore they are removed in the preprocessing pipeline.",
        "Emoticons frequently appear in Twitter messages.",
        "Although some of them help express user's sentiment on certain topics, they are not directly helpful for keyword analysis and may interfere with POS tagging in the preprocessing pipeline.",
        "Therefore, we designed a set of regular expressions to detect and remove them.",
        "Internet slang words and abbreviations are widely used in Twitter messages.",
        "Most of them are out-of-vocabulary words in the POS tagging model used in the next step, and thus will deteriorate the POS tagging accuracy.",
        "Hence, we build a lookup table based on the list of abbreviations in the NoSlang online dictionary, which we divide by hand into three sets for different processing.",
        "The first set includes 422 content words and phrases, such as \"bff\" (best friend forever) and \"fone\" (phone), with valid candidate words for user tags.",
        "The second set includes 67 abbreviations of function words that usually form grammatical parts in a sentence, such as \"im\" (i'm), \"abt\" (about).",
        "Simply removing them will affect the POS tagging.",
        "Thus, the abbreviations in both these sets are replaced with the corresponding complete words or phrases.",
        "The third set includes 4576 phrase abbreviations that are usually separable parts of a sentence that do not directly indicate discussion topics, such as \"lol\" (laugh out loud), \"clm\" (cool like me), which are removed in this step.",
        "We apply the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000) on Twitter messages, and only select nouns and adjectives as valid candidates for user tags.",
        "At the end of the preprocessing pipeline, the candidate words are processed with the rule-based Porter stemmer and stopwords are filtered using a publicly available list.",
        "In the TFIDF ranking algorithm, messages from user u are put together as one document.",
        "The TFIDF value of word i from this user's messages is computed as tfidfi,u = ^ log(U ) where niyU is the count of word i in user u's messages, Ui is the number of users whose messages contain word i, and U is the total number of users in the Twitter corpus.",
        "For each user, words with top N TFIDF values are selected as his/her tags.",
        "According to the TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), each candidate word is represented by a vertex in the graph; edges are added between two candidate words according to their cooccurrence.",
        "In the context of user tag extraction, we build a TextRank graph with undirected edges for each Twitter user.",
        "One edge is added between two candidate words if they coexist within at least one message; the edge weight is set to be the total count of within-message co-occurrence of the two words throughout all messages of this user.",
        "Starting with an arbitrarily assigned value (e.g. 1.0), the rank value R(Vi) of the candidate word at vertex Vi is updated iteratively according to the following equation, where wji is the weight of the edge that links Vj and Vi, E(Vi) is the set of vertices which Vi is connected to, and d is a damping factor that is usually set to 0.85 (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "The rank update iteration continues until convergence.",
        "The candidate words are then sorted according to their rank values.",
        "Words with top-N rank values are selected as tags for this user."
