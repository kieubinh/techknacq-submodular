        "Phonetic string transduction problems, such as letter-to-phoneme conversion and name transliteration, have recently received much attention in the NLP community.",
        "In the past few years, two methods have come to dominate as solutions to supervised string trans-duction: generative joint n-gram models, and discriminative sequence models.",
        "Both approaches benefit from their ability to consider large, flexible spans of source context when making transduction decisions.",
        "However, they encode this context in different ways, providing their respective models with different information.",
        "To combine the strengths of these two systems, we include joint n-gram features inside a state-of-the-art discriminative sequence model.",
        "We evaluate our approach on several letter-to-phoneme and transliteration data sets.",

        "Phonetic string transduction transforms a source string into a target representation according to its pronunciation.",
        "Two important examples of this task are letter-to-phoneme conversion and name transliteration.",
        "In general, the problem is challenging because source orthography does not unambiguously specify the target representation.",
        "When considering letter-to-phoneme, ambiguities and exceptions in the pronunciation of orthography complicate conversion.",
        "Transliteration suffers from the same ambiguities, but the transformation is further complicated by restrictions in the target orthography that may not exist in the source.",
        "Joint n-gram models (Bisani and Ney, 2002; Chen, 2003; Bisani and Ney, 2008) have been widely applied to string transduction problems (Li et al., 2004; Demberg et al., 2007; Jansche and Sproat, 2009).",
        "The power of the approach lies in building a language model over the operations used in the conversion from source to target.",
        "Crucially, this allows the inclusion of source context in the generative story.",
        "Smoothing techniques play an important role in joint n-gram models, greatly affecting their performance.",
        "Although joint n-gram models are capable of capturing context information in both source and target, they cannot selectively use only source or target information, nor can they consider arbitrary sequences within their context window, as they are limited by their back-off schedule.",
        "Discriminative sequence models have also been shown to perform extremely well on string transduction problems.",
        "These begin with a Hidden Markov Model architecture, augmented with substring operations and discriminative training.",
        "The primary strength of these systems is their ability to include rich indicator features representing long sequences of source context.",
        "We will assume a specific instance of discriminative sequence modeling, DI-recTL (Jiampojamarn et al., 2009), which achieved the best results on several language pairs in the NEWS Machine Transliteration Shared Task (Li et al., 2009).",
        "The same system matches or exceeds the performance of the joint gram approach on letter-to-phoneme conversion (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008).",
        "Its features are optimized by an online, marginbased learning algorithm, specifically, the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm, MIRA (Crammer and",
        "Singer, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach that combines these two different paradigms by formulating the joint n-gram model as a new set of features in the discriminative model.",
        "This leverages an advantage of discriminative training, in that it can easily and effectively incorporate arbitrary features.",
        "We evaluate our approach on several letter-to-phoneme and transliteration data sets.",
        "Our results demonstrate an improvement in overall performance with respect to both the generative joint n-gram approach and the original DirecTL system."

        "String transduction transforms an input string x into the desired output string y.",
        "The input and output are different representations of the same entity; for example, the spelling and the pronunciation of a word, or the orthographic forms of a word in two different writing scripts.",
        "One approach to string transduction is to view it as a tagging problem where the input characters are tagged with the output characters.",
        "However, since sounds are often represented by multicharacter units, the relationship between the input and output characters is often complex.",
        "This prevents the straightforward application of standard tagging techniques, but can be addressed by substring decoders or semi-Markov models.",
        "Because the relationship between x and y is hidden, alignments between the input and output characters (or substrings) are often provided in a preprocessing step.",
        "These are usually generated in an unsupervised fashion using a variant of the EM algorithm.",
        "Our system employs the many-to-many alignment described in (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007).",
        "We trained our system on these aligned examples by using the online discriminative training of (Jiampo-jamarn et al., 2009).",
        "At each step, the parameter update is provided by MIRA."

        "The transition features enforce the cohesion of the generated output with target-side bigrams.",

        "The set of feature templates described above has been demonstrated to achieve excellent performance.",
        "The context features express rich information on the source side, but no feature template allows target context beyond yi_i, yi.",
        "Target and source context are considered jointly, but only in a very limited fashion, as provided by the linear chain features.",
        "Jiampojamarn et al.",

        "gram results in no significant improvement.",
        "Intuitively, the joint information of both source and target sides is important in string transduction problems.",
        "By integrating the joint n-gram features into the online discriminative training framework, we enable the system to not only enjoy rich context features and long-range dependency linear-chain features, but we also take advantage of joint information between source and target substring pairs, as encoded by the joint n-gram template shown in the bottom of Table 1.",
        "An alternative method to incorporate a joint n-gram feature would compute the generative joint n-gram scores, and supply them as a real-valued feature to the model.",
        "As all of the other features in the DirecTL framework are indicators, the training algorithm may have trouble scaling an informative real-valued feature.",
        "Therefore, we represent these joint n-gram features as binary features that indicate whether the model has seen particular strings of joint evidence in the previous n â€“ 1 operations when generating y\\ from xi.",
        "In this case, the system learns a distinct weight for each substring ofthe joint n-gram.",
        "In order to accommodate higher-order joint n-grams, we replace the exact search algorithm of Ji-ampojamarn et al.",
        "(2008) with a beam search.",
        "During our development experiments, we observed no significant decrease in accuracy after introducing this approximation.",
        "Figure 1 shows the system performance in terms of the word accuracy as a function of the beam size on a development set.",
        "The performance starts to converge quickly and shows no further improvement for values grater than 20.",
        "In the remaining experiments we set the beam size to 50.",
        "We also performed development experiments with a version of the system that includes only joint n-gram indicators.",
        "Figure 2 shows the word accuracy with different values of n. The accuracy reaches its maximum for n = 4, and actually falls off for larger values of n. This anomaly is likely caused by the model using its expanded expressive power to memorize sequences of operations, overfit-ting to its training data.",
        "Such overfitting is less likely to happen in the generative joint n-gram model, which smooths high-order estimates very carefully."

        "Our full system outperforms both DirecTL and the joint n-gram approach in all data sets.",
        "This shows the utility of adding joint n-gram features to the DirecTL system, and confirms an advantage of discriminative approaches: strong competitors can simply be folded into the model.",
        "Comparing across tables, one can see that the gap between the generative joint n-gram and the DirecTL methods is much larger for the transliteration tasks.",
        "This could be because joint n-grams are a poor fit for transliteration, or the gap could stem from differences between the joint n-gram implementations used for the two tasks.",
        "Looking at the improvements to DirecTL from joint n-gram features, we see further evidence that joint n-grams are better suited to letter-to-phoneme than they are to transliteration: letter-to-phoneme improvements range from relative error reductions of 3.6 to 17.3, while in transliteration, the largest reduction is 3.1."
