        "For instance, in the sentence \"President Obama said he will visit ...\" there are three mentions: President, Obama and he.",
        "This is similar to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task with the additional twist of also identifying nominal and pronominal mentions.",
        "We formulate the mention detection problem as a classification problem, by assigning to each token in the text a label, indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside all mentions.",

        "In this paper, we investigate different segmentation schemes in order to define the best unit of analysis for Arabic MD.",
        "Arabic adopts a very complex morphology, i.e. each word is composed of zero or more prefixes, one stem and zero or more suffixes.",
        "Consequently, the Arabic data is sparser than other languages, such as English, and it is necessary to \"segment\" the words into several units of analysis in order to achieve a good performance.",

        "This is different for Sem f : we first run classifiers on the morphologically segmented data.",
        "Thereafter, we project those labels to other corpora.",
        "This is because, we use classifiers initially trained on morphologically segmented data such as ACE 2003, 2004 and 2005 data.",
        "In such data, two morphs belonging to the same word or ATB token may have 2 different mentions.",
        "During transfer, a token will have the label of the corresponding stem in the morphologically segmented data.",
        "One motivation to not retrain classifiers on each corpus separately is to be able to extract Semf features from classifiers with similar performance.",
        "Results in Table 1 show that classifiers built on ATBs and Morphs have shown to perform better than classifiers trained on data with other segmentation styles.",
        "When the system uses character as the unit of analysis, performance is poor.",
        "This is because the token itself becomes insignificant information to the classifier.",
        "On the other hand, when only punctuation separation is performed (Words), the data is significantly sparse and the obtained results achieves high F-measure (77.1) only when outputs of other classifiers are used.",
        "As mentioned earlier, classifiers used to extract those features are trained on Morphg (less sparse), which explains their remarkable positive impact since they resolve part of the data sparseness problem in Words.",
        "When using full morphological segmentation, the data is less sparse, which leads to less Out-Of-Vocabulary tokens (OOVs): the number of OOVs in the Morphs data is 1,518 whereas it is 2,464 in the ATBs.",
        "As an example, the word iL*) \\ (Alrhynp – the hostage), which is person mention in the training data.",

        "This word is unchanged in ATBs and is segmented to \" jj+ o+ à**]\" (rhyn +p +yn) in Morphs.",
        "For the model built on ATBs, this word is an OOV, whereas for the model built on Morphs the stem has been seen as part of a person mention and consequently has a better chance to tag it correctly.",
        "These phenomena are frequent, which make the classifier trained on Morphs more robust for such cases.",
        "Also, we observed that models trained on ATBs perform better on long span mentions.",
        "We think this is because a model trained on ATBs has access to larger context.",
        "One may argue that a similar behavior of the model built on the Morphs might be obtained if we use a wider context window than the one used for ATBs in order to have similar contextual information.",

        "When limited resources are available (e.g. Lexf, Stemf or Syntf), we believe that it is more effective to morphologically segment the text (Morphs) as a preprocessing step.",
        "The use of morph as a unit of analysis reduces the data sparseness issue and at the same time allows better context handling when compared to character.",
        "On the other hand, when a larger set of resources are available (e.g., Semf), the use of the ATB token as a unit of analysis combined with morph-based features leads to better performance (79.0 vs. 78.3 on Morphs).",
