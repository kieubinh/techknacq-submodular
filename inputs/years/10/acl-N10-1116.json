        "This method substantially exceeds Klein and Manning's published scores and achieves 39.4% accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "The second, Less is More, uses a low-complexity subset of the available data: sentences up to length 15.",
        "Focusing on fewer but simpler examples trades off quantity against ambiguity; it attains 44.1% accuracy, using the standard linguistically-informed prior and batch training, beating state-of-the-art.",
        "Leapfrog, our third heuristic, combines Less is More with Baby Steps by mixing their models of shorter sentences, then rapidly ramping up exposure to the full training set, driving up accuracy to 45.0%.",

        "In the extreme case of a single-word sentence, there is no choice but to parse it correctly.",
        "At two words, a raw 50% chance of telling the head from its dependent is still high, but as length increases, the accuracy of even educated guessing rapidly plummets.",

        "Its base case – sentences of length one – has a trivial solution that requires neither initialization nor search yet reveals something of sentence heads.",
        "The next step – sentences of length one and two – refines initial impressions of heads, introduces dependents, and exposes their identities and relative positions.",

        "In contrast, Baby Steps' scores usually do not change much from one step to the next, and where its impact of learning is big (at WSJ{4, 5,14}), it is invariably positive.",
        "Ad-Hoc*'s curve (see Figure 5) suggests how Klein and Manning's Ad-Hoc initializer may have scaled with different gradations of WSJ.",
        "Strangely, our implementation performs significantly above their reported numbers at WSJ10: 54.5% (68.3%) is even slightly higher than Baby Steps; nevertheless, given enough data (from WSJ22 onwards), Baby Steps overtakes Ad-Hoc*, whose ability to learn takes a serious dive once the inputs become sufficiently complex (at WSJ23), and never recovers.",
        "Note that Ad-Hoc* 's biased prior peaks early (at WSJ6), eventually falls below the guessing rate (by WSJ24), yet still remains well-positioned to climb, outperforming uninformed learning.",
        "Figure 6 shows that Baby Steps scales better with more (complex) data – its curves do not trend downwards.",
        "However, a good initializer induces a sweet spot at WSJ15, where the DMV is learned best using Ad-Hoc*.",
        "This mode is \"Less is More,\" scoring 44.1% (58.9%) on WSJ45.",
        "Curiously, even oracle training exhibits a bump at WSJ15: once sentences get long enough (at WSJ36), its performance degrades below that of oracle training with virtually no supervision (at the hardly representative WSJ3).",
        "Mixing Ad-Hoc* with Baby Steps at WSJ15 yields a model whose performance initially falls between its two parents but surpasses both with a little training (see Figure 5).",
        "Leaping to WSJ45, via WSJ30, results in our strongest model: its 45.0% (58.4%) accuracy bridges half of the gap between Baby Steps and the skyline, and at a tiny fraction of the cost.",

        "Leapfrog does best across the board but dips on Brown100, despite its safeguards against over-fitting.",
        "Section 23 (see Table 2) reveals, unexpectedly, that Baby Steps would have been state-of-the-art in 2008, whereas \"Less is More\" outperforms all prior work on longer sentences.",

        "We explored three simple ideas for unsupervised dependency parsing.",
        "Pace Halevy et al.",
        "(2009), we find \"Less is More\" – the paradoxical result that better performance can be attained by training with less data, even when removing samples from the true (test) distribution.",
        "Our small tweaks to Klein and Manning's approach of 2004 break through the 2009 state-of-the-art on longer sentences, when trained at WSJ15 (the auto-detected sweet spot gradation).",
        "The second, Baby Steps, is an elegant meta-heuristic for optimizing non-convex training criteria.",
        "It eliminates the need for linguistically-biased manually-tuned initializers, particularly if the location of the sweet spot is not known.",
        "This technique scales gracefully with more (complex) data and should easily carry over to more powerful parsing models and learning algorithms.",
        "Finally, Leapfrog forgoes the elegance and meticulousness of Baby Steps in favor of pragmatism.",
        "Employing both good initialization strategies at its disposal, and spending CPU cycles wisely, it achieves better performance than both \"Less is More\" and Baby Steps.",
        "Future work could explore unifying these techniques with other state-of-the-art approaches.",
        "It may be useful to scaffold on both data and model complexity, e.g., by increasing head automata's number ofstates (Alshawi and Douglas, 2000).",
        "We see many opportunities for improvement, considering the poor performance of oracle training relative to the supervised state-of-the-art, and in turn the poor performance ofunsupervised state-of-the-art relative to the oracle models.",
        "To this end, it would be instructive to understand both the linguistic and statistical nature of the sweet spot, and to test its universality."
