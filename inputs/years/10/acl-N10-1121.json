        "Opinion holder extraction is one of the important subtasks in sentiment analysis.",
        "The effective detection of an opinion holder depends on the consideration of various cues on various levels of representation, though they are hard to formulate explicitly as features.",
        "In this work, we propose to use convolution kernels for that task which identify meaningful fragments of sequences or trees by themselves.",
        "We not only investigate how different levels of information can be effectively combined in different kernels but also examine how the scope of these kernels should be chosen.",
        "In general relation extraction, the two candidate entities thought to be involved in a relation are commonly chosen to be the boundaries of sequences and trees.",
        "The definition of boundaries in opinion holder extraction, however, is less straightforward since there might be several expressions beside the candidate opinion holder to be eligible for being a boundary."

        "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the automatic detection of opinionated content in natural language text.",
        "One of the more important tasks in sentiment analysis is the extraction of opinion holders.",
        "Opinion holder extraction is one of the critical components of an opinion question-answering system (i.e. systems which automatically answer opinion questions, such as \"What does [X] like about [Y]?\").",
        "Such systems need to be able to distinguish which entities in a candidate answer sentence are the sources of opinions (= opinion holder) and which are the targets.",
        "On other NLP tasks, in particular, on relation extraction, there has been much work on convolution kernels, i.e. kernel functions exploiting huge amounts of features without an explicit feature representation.",
        "Previous research on that task has shown that convolution kernels, such as sequence and tree kernels, are quite effective when compared to manual feature engineering (Moschitti, 2008; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Nguyen et al., 2009).",
        "In order to effectively use convolution kernels, it is often necessary to choose appropriate substructures of a sentence rather than represent the sentence as a whole structure (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Moschitti, 2008).",
        "As for tree kernels, for example, one typically chooses the syntactic subtree immediately enclosing two entities potentially expressing a specific relation in a given sentence.",
        "The opinion holder detection task is different from this scenario.",
        "There can be several cues within a sentence to indicate the presence of a genuine opinion holder and these cues need not be member of a particular word group, e.g. they can be opinion words (see Sentences 1-3), communication words, such as maintained in Sentence 2, or other lexical cues, such as according in Sentence 3.",
        "1.",
        "The U.S. commanders consideropinion the prisoners to be un-lawful_combatantsopinion as opposed to prisoners of war.",
        "2.",
        "During the summit, Koizumi maintainedcommunication a clear-cut_collaborative_stanceopinion towards the U.S. and emphasized that the President was objectiveopinion and circumspect.",
        "3.",
        "Accordingc^e to Fernandez, it was the worst_mistakeopinion in the history of the Argentine economy.",
        "Thus, the definition of boundaries of the structures for the convolution kernels is less straightforward in opinion holder extraction.",
        "The aim of this paper is to explore in how far convolution kernels can be beneficial for effective opinion holder detection.",
        "We are not only interested in how far different kernel types contribute to this extraction task but we also contrast the performance of these kernels with a manually designed feature set used as a standard vector kernel.",
        "Finally, we also examine the effectiveness of expanding word sequences or syntactic trees by additional prior knowledge."

        "We exclusively rely on entities marked as opinion holders.",
        "In many practical situations, the annotation beyond opinion holder labeling is too expensive.",
        "Complex convolution kernels have been successfully applied to various NLP tasks, such as relation extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 2009), question answering (Zhang and Lee, 2003; Moschitti, 2008), and semantic role labeling (Moschitti et al., 2008).",
        "In all these tasks, they offer competitive performance to manually designed feature sets.",
        "Bunescu and Mooney (2005) combine different sequence kernels encoding different contexts of candidate entities in a sentence.",
        "They argue that several kernels encoding different contexts are more effective than just using one kernel with one specific context.",

        "(2009) suggest that different kinds of information, such as word sequences, part-of-speech tags, syntactic and semantic information should be contained in separate convolution kernels.",
        "We also adhere to this notion.",
        "As labeled data, we use the sentiment annotation of the MPQA 2.0 corpus.",
        "Opinion holders are not explicitly labeled as such.",
        "However sources of private states and subjective speech events (Wiebe et al., 2003) are a fairly good approximation of the task.",

        "Generalized sequences employ named-entity tags, an OPINION tag for opinion words and a COMM tag for communication words.",
        "Thus, in a generalized word sequence (WRDgn) a word is replaced by a generalized token whereas in a generalized part-of-speech sequence (POSGn) a part-of-speech tag is replaced.",
        "For augmented constituent trees (CONSTaug), the same sources of information are used.",
        "The difference to generalizing sequences is that instead of replacing words by generalized tokens, we add a node in the syntax tree with a generalized token so that it dominates the pertaining leaf node (see also nodes marked with aug in Figure 2).",
        "All sources used for this type of generalization are known to be predictive for opinion holder classification (Choi et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2005; Choi et al., 2006; Kim and",
        "Hovy, 2006; Bloom et al., 2007).",
        "Note that the grammatical relation paths, i.e. GRAMwrd and GRAMpos, can only be applied in case there is another expression in the focus in addition to the candidate of the data instance itself, e.g. the nearest opinion expression to the candidate.",
        "Section 4.4 explains in detail how this is done.",
        "Predicate-argument structures (PAS) are represented by PropBank trees (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).",
        "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one of the most robust supervised machine learning techniques in which training data instances x are separated by a hyperplane H(x) = w ‚Ä¢ x + b = 0 where w G Rnand b G R. One advantage of SVMs is that kernel methods can be applied which map the data to other feature spaces in which they can be separated more easily.",
        "Given a feature function j : O ‚Äì R, where O is the set of the objects, the kernel trick allows the decision hyperplane to be rewritten as:",

        "In STK, a tree fragment can be any set of nodes and edges of the original tree provided that every node has either all or none of its children.",
        "This constraint makes that kind of kernel well-suited for constituency trees which have been generated by context free grammars since the constraint corresponds to the restriction that no grammatical rule must be broken.",
        "For example, STK enforces that a subtree, such as [VP [VBZ, NP]], cannot be matched with [VP [VBZ]] since the latter VP node only possesses one of the children of the former.",
        "PTKbasic is more flexible since the constraint of STK on nodes is relaxed.",
        "This makes this type of tree kernel less suitable for constituency trees.",
        "We, therefore, apply it only to trees representing predicate-argument structures (PAS) (see Figure 1).",
        "Note that a data instance is represented by a set of those structures rather than a single structure.",

        "Since a classifier based on convolution kernels has to derive meaningful features by itself, the larger these structures are, the more likely noise is included in the model.",
        "Previous work in relation extraction has also shown that the usage of more focused substructures, e.g. the smallest subtree containing the two candidate entities of a relation, is more effective (Zhang et al., 2006).",
