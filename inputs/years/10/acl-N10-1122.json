        "Online review sites continue to grow in popularity as more people seek the advice of fellow users regarding services and products.",
        "Unfortunately, users are often forced to wade through large quantities of written data in order to find the information they want.",
        "This has led to an increase in research in the areas of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, with the aim of providing systems that can automatically analyze user reviews and extract the information most relevant to the user.",
        "One example of such an application is generating a summary of the important factors mentioned in the reviews of a product (see Lerman et al.",
        "2009).",
        "Another application is comparing two similar products.",
        "In this case, it is important to present to the user the aspects in which the products differ, rather than just provide a general star rating.",
        "A third example is systems for generating automatic recommendations, based on similarity between products, user reviews, and history of previous purchases.",
        "These types of application require an underlying framework to identify the important aspects of the product (also known as features or attributes), and the sentiment expressed by the review writer.",
        "Unsupervised Methods are desirable for this task, for two reasons.",
        "First, due to the wide range and variety of products and services being reviewed, the framework must be robust and easily transferable between domains.",
        "The second reason is the nature of the data.",
        "Online reviews are often short and unstructured, and may contain many spelling and grammatical errors, as well as slang or specialized jargon.",
        "These factors often present a problem to methods relying exclusively on dictionaries, manually-constructed knowledge resources, and gazetteers, as they may miss out on an important aspect of the product or an indicator of sentiment.",
        "Unsupervised methods, on the other hand, are not influenced by the lexical form, and can handle unknown words or word-forms, provided they occur frequently enough.",
        "This insures that any emergent topic that is salient in the data will be addressed by the system.",
        "In this paper, we present an unsupervised system which addresses the core tasks necessary to enable advanced applications to handle review data.",
        "We introduce a local topic model, which works at the sentence level and employs a small number of topics, to automatically infer the aspects.",
        "For sentiment detection, we present a method for automatically deriving an unsupervised seed set of positive and negative adjectives that replaces the manually constructed ones commonly used in the literature.",
        "Our approach is specifically designed to take into account the interaction between the two tasks.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Sec. 2 we provide relevant background, and place our method in the context of previous work in the field.",
        "We describe the data we used in Sec. 3, and our experiments on the aspect and sentiment-polarity components in Sec. 4 and 5, respectively.",
        "We conclude in Sec. 6 with a discussion of our results and findings and directions for future research."

      "heading": "2. Previous Approaches",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we focus on the detection of two principle elements in the review text: aspects and sentiment.",
        "In previous work these elements have been treated, for the most part, as two separate tasks.",
        "Aspect The earliest attempts at aspect detection were based on the classic information extraction (IE) approach of using frequently occurring noun phrases (e.g., Hu and Liu 2004).",
        "Such approaches work well in detecting aspects that are strongly associated with a single noun, but are less useful when aspects encompass many low frequency terms (e.g., the food aspect of restaurants, which involves many different dishes), or are abstract (e.g. ambiance can be described without using any concrete nouns at all).",
        "Common solutions to this problem involve clustering with the help of knowledge-rich methods, involving manually-constructed rules, semantic hierarchies, or both (e.g., Popescu and Etzioni 2005, Fahrni and Klenner 2008).",
        "Titov and McDonald (2008b) underline the need for unsupervised methods for aspect detection.",
        "However, according to the authors, existing topic models, such as standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), are not suited to the task of aspect detection in reviews, because they tend to capture global topics in the data, rather than rateable aspects pertinent to the review.",
        "To address this problem, they construct a multi-grain topic model (MG-LDA), which attempts to capture two layers of topics - global and local, where the local topics correspond to rateable aspects.",
        "MG-LDA distinguishes tens of local topics, but the many-to-one mapping between these and rateable aspects is not explicit in the system.",
        "To resolve this issue, the authors extend their model in Titov and McDonald (2008a) and attempt to infer such a mapping with the help of aspect-specific ratings provided along with the review text.",
        "Sentiment Sentiment analysis has been the focus of much previous research.",
        "In this discussion, we will only mention work directly related to our own.",
        "For a comprehensive survey of the subject, the reader is directed to Pang and Lee (2008).",
        "Most previous approaches rely on a manually constructed lexicon of terms which are strongly positive or negative regardless of context.",
        "This information on its own is usually insufficient, due to lack of coverage and the fact that sentiment is often expressed through words whose polarity is highly domain and context specific.",
        "If a sentiment lexicon is available for one domain, domain adaptation can be used, provided the domains are sufficiently similar (Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "Another common solution is through bootstrapping - using a seed group of terms with known polarity to infer the polarity of domain specific terms (e.g., Fahrni and Klenner 2008; Jijk-oun and Hofmann 2009).",
        "The most minimalist example of this approach is Turney (2002), who used only a single pair of adjectives (good and poor) to determine the polarity of other terms through mutual information.",
        "For Chinese, Zagibalov and Carroll (2008) use a single seed word meaning good, and six common indicators of negation in their bootstrapping approach.",
        "Often, when using a context independent seed, large amounts of domain-specific data are required, in order to obtain sufficient co-occurrence statistics.",
        "Commonly, web queries are used to obtain such data.",
        "Independently of any specific task, Hatzivas-siloglou and McKeown (1997) present a completely unsupervised method for determining the polarity of adjectives in a large corpus.",
        "A graph is created, in which adjectives are nodes, and edges between them are weighted according to a (dis)similarity function based primarily on whether the two adjectives occurred in a conjunction or disjunction in the corpus.",
        "A heuristic approach is then used to split the graph in two.",
        "The group containing the adjectives with the higher average frequency is labeled as positive, and the other as negative.",
        "Combined Approaches Aspects can influence sentiment polarity within a single domain.",
        "For example, in the restaurant domain, cheap is usually positive when discussing food, but negative when discussing the decor or ambiance.",
        "Many otherwise neutral terms (e.g., warm, heavy, soft) acquire a sentiment polarity in the context of a specific aspect.",
        "Recent work has addressed this interaction in different ways.",
        "Mei et al.",
        "(2007) present a form of domain adaptation using an LDA model which treats positive and negative sentiment as two additional topics.",
        "Fahrni and Klenner (2008) directly address the specificity of sentiment to the word it is modifying.",
        "Aspects are defined by a manually specified subset of the Wikipedia category hierarchy.",
        "For sentiment, the authors use a seed set of positive and negative adjectives, and iteratively propagate sentiment polarity through conjunction relations (like those used by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997, above).",
        "Web queries are used to overcome the sparsity issue of these highly-specific patterns.",
        "In the IE setting, Popescu and Etzioni (2005) extract frequent terms, and cluster them into aspects.",
        "The sentiment detection task is formulated as a Relaxation Labeling problem of finding the most likely sentiment labels for opinion-bearing terms, while satisfying as many local constraints as possible.",
        "The authors use a variety of knowledge sources, web queries, and hand crafted rules to detect relations between terms (e.g., meronymy).",
        "These relations are used both for the clustering, and as a basis for the constraints.",
        "Our approach is designed to be as unsupervised and knowledge-lean as possible, so as to make it transferable across different types of products and services, as well as across languages.",
        "Aspects are determined via a local version of LDA, which operates on sentences, rather than documents, and employs a small number of topics that correspond directly to aspects.",
        "This approach overcomes the problems of frequent-term methods, as well as the issues raised by Titov and McDonald (2008b).",
        "We use morphological negation indicators to automatically create a seed set of highly relevant positive and negative adjectives, which are guaranteed to be pertinent to the aspect at hand.",
        "These automatically-derived seed sets achieve comparable results to the use of manual ones, and the work of Zagibalov and Carroll (2008) suggests that the use of negation can be easily transfered to other languages.",
        "Our primary dataset is the publicly available corpus used in Ganu et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "It contains over 50,000 restaurant reviews from Citysearch New York.",
        "Additionally, to demonstrate the domain independence of our system, we collected 1086 reviews for four leading netbook computers from Amazon.com.",
        "For evaluation purposes, we used the annotated dataset from Ganu et al.",
        "(2009), which is a subset of 3,400 sentences from the Citysearch corpus.",
        "These sentences were manually labeled for aspect and sentiment.",
        "There were six manually defined aspect labels - Food & Drink, Service, Price, Atmosphere, Anecdotes and Miscellaneous.",
        "A sentence could contain multiple aspects, but, for our evaluation, we used only sentences with a single label.",
        "For sentiment, each sentence was given a single value -Positive, Negative, Neutral or Conflict (indicating a mixture of positive and negative sentiment).",
        "We were also provided with a seed set of 128 positive and 88 negative adjectives used by Fahrni and Klenner (2008), which were specifically selected to be domain and target independent.",
        "For the purpose of the experiments presented here, we focused on sentences containing noun-adjective pairs.",
        "Such pairs are one of the most common way of expressing sentiment about an aspect and allow us to capture the interaction between the two."

        "We believe the reason for this stems from the composition of online reviews.",

        "These are of particular interest in our task, and are likely to be missing or incorrectly labeled in standard sentiment dictionaries.",
        "For our purposes, since we need to handle adjectives expressing various shades of sentiment, not only strongly positive or negative ones, we are interested in a scoring method, rather than a binary labeling.",
        "Also, we do not want to use a general corpus, but rather the text from the reviews themselves.",
        "This usually means a much smaller corpus than the one used in the original paper, but has the advantage of being domain specific.",
        "Our method of building the polarity graph differed in several ways from the original.",
        "First, we did not use disjunctions (e.g., 'but') as indicators of opposite polarity.",
        "The reason for this was that, in our domain of online reviews, disjunctions often did not convey contrast in polarity, but rather in perceived expectations, e.g., \"dainty but strong necklace\"', and \"cheap but delicious food\" .",
        "Instead of using regular expressions to capture explicit conjunctions, we retrieved all cases where our parser indicated that two adjectives modified a single noun in the same sentence.",
        "To ensure that aspect-specific adjectives are handled correctly, we built a separate graph for each aspect, by selecting the cases where the modified noun was one of the representative words for that aspect (see Sec. 4.1).",
        "Constructing a Seed Set We used morphological information and explicit negation to find pairs of opposite polarity.",
        "Specifically, adjective pairs which were distinguished only by one of the prefixes 'un', 'in', 'dis', 'non', or by the negation marker 'not-' were selected for the seed set.",
        "Starting with the most frequent pair, we assigned a positive polarity to the more frequent member of the pair.",
        "Then, in order of decreasing frequency, we assigned polarity to the other seed pairs, based on the shortest path either of the members had to a previously labeled adjective.",
        "That member received its neighbor's polarity, and the other member of the pair received the opposite polarity.",
        "When all pairs were labeled, we corrected for misclassifications by iterating through the pairs and reversing the polarity if that improved consistency, i.e., if it caused the members of the pair to match the polarities of more of their neighbors.",
        "Finally, we reverse the polarity of the seed groups if the negative group has a higher total frequency.",
        "Propagating Polarity Our propagation method is based on the label propagation algorithm of Zhu and Ghahramani (2002).",

        "As expected, exact inter-annotator agreement was low - only 54%, but when considering two adjacent ratings as equivalent (i.e, Strongly vs. Weakly Negative or Positive, and Neutral vs. Weakly Negative or Positive), agreement was 93.3%.",
        "This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005).",
        "We therefore translated the annotator ratings to a numerical scale, from ‚Äì 2 (Strongly Negative) to +2 (Strongly Positive) at unit intervals.",
        "After discarding adjectives where one or more annotators gave a 'N/A' tag, we averaged the two annotator numerical scores, and used this data as the gold standard for our evaluation.",
        "Table 3: For each aspect, the number of frequently occurring adjectives for each aspect (# Adj.",
        "), number of adjectives remaining after removing those labeled 'N/A' (# Rated), and percent of rated adjectives labeled 'Neutral' by both annotators (% Neu.",
        ").",
        "Kendall's tau coefficient (Tk) and Kendall's distance (Dk) are commonly used (e.g., Jijkoun and Hofmann 2009) to compare rankings.",
        "These measures look at the number of pairs of ranked items that agree or disagree with the ordering in the gold standard.",
        "The value of Tk ranges from 1 (perfect disagreement) to 1 (perfect agreement), with 0 indicating an almost random ranking.",
        "The value of Dk ranges from 0 (perfect agreement) to 1 (perfect disagreement).",
        "It is important to note that only pairs that are ordered in the gold standard are used in the comparison.",
        "Table 4 reports Kendall's coefficient (Tk) and distance (Dk) values for our method when using our automatically derived seed set (Auto.).",
        "For comparison, we ran our procedure using the manually compiled seed set (Manual) of Fahrni and Klenner Food - General: Mexican, French, Eastern, Turkish, European, Tuscan, Mediterranean, American, Cuban, Thai, Peruvian, Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, African, Japanese, Italian, Chinese, Asian Mood: Vietnamese, Brazilian, Turkish, Eastern, Caribbean, Cuban, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, European, Mediterranean, Colombian, Mexican, Asian, Indian, Thai, British, American, French, Korean, Chinese, Russian, Moroccan Staff: British, European, Chinese, Indian, American, Spanish, Asian, Italian, French (2008).",
        "Using the manual seed set obtains results that correspond better to our gold standard.",
        "Our automatic method also achieves good results, and can be used when a manual seed set is not available.",
        "More importantly, correlation with the gold standard may not indicate better suitability to the sentiment detection task in reviews.",
        "For instance, it is interesting to note that the worst correlation scores were on the Main Dishes and Food - General aspects.",
        "If we compare to Table 3, we can see these aspects have the highest percentage of adjectives rated as neutral by the annotators.",
        "However, in many cases, these adjectives actually carry some sentiment in their context.",
        "An example of this are adjectives describing the type of cuisine, which are objective, and therefore usually considered neutral by annotators.",
        "Table 5 shows the automatic ranking of cuisine type from positive to negative in three aspects.",
        "It is interesting to see that the rankings change according to the aspect, and certain cuisines are strongly associated with specific aspects and not with others.",
        "This is supported by Ganu et al.",
        "(2009), who observed during the annotation that, in the restaurant corpus, French and Italian restaurants were strongly associated with the service aspect.",

        "Our experiments confirm the value of a fully unsupervised approach to the tasks of aspect detection and sentiment analysis.",
        "The aspects are inferred from the data, and are more representative than manually derived ones.",
        "For instance, in our restaurant domain, the manually constructed aspect list omitted or over-generalized some important aspects, while over-representing others.",
        "There was no separate Drinks category, even though it was strongly present in the data.",
        "The Service aspect, dealing with waiting time, reservations, and mistaken orders, was an important emergent aspect on its own, but was grouped under Staffin the manual annotation.",
        "Adjectives can convey different sentiments depending on the aspect being discussed.",
        "For example, the adjective 'warm' was ranked very positive in the Staffaspect, but slightly negative in the General Food aspect.",
        "A knowledge-rich approach might ignore such adjectives, thereby missing important elements of the review.",
        "Finally, as online reviews belong to an informal genre, with inventive spelling and specialized jargon, it may be insufficient, for both aspect and sentiment, to rely only on lexicons.",
        "For example, our restaurant reviews included spelling errors such as desert, decour/decore, anti-pasta, creme-brule, sandwhich, omlette, exelent, tastey, as well as at least six different common misspellings of restaurant.",
        "There were also specialized terms, such as Ko-rma, Edamame, Dosa and Pho, all of which do not appear in common dictionaries, and creative use of adjectives, such as orgasmic and New-Yorky.",
        "This work has opened many avenues for future research and improvements.",
        "So far, we focused on adjectives as sentiment indicators, however, there have been studies showing that other parts of speech can be very helpful for this task (e.g., Pang et al.",
        "2002; Benamara et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Also, it would be interesting to take a closer look at the interactions between aspect and sentiment, especially at a multiple-sentence level (see Snyder and Barzilay 2007).",
        "Finally, we feel that the true test of the usability of our system should be through an application, and intend to proceed in that direction."
