        "al., 1999).",
        "A salient example domain is biomedical literature: the PubMed online repository contains over 18 million abstracts on biomedical research, with more than two thousand new abstracts added each day; the abstracts are written in grammatical English, which enables the use of advanced NLP tools such as syntactic and semantic parsers.",
        "Traditionally, research on knowledge extraction from text is primarily pursued in the field of information extraction with a rather confined goal of extracting instances for flat relational schemas with no nested structures (e.g, recognizing protein names and protein-protein interaction (PPI)).",
        "This restriction mainly stems from limitations in available resources and algorithms.",
        "The BioNLP'09 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2009) is one of the first that faced squarely information needs that are complex and highly structured.",

        "The task has generated much interest, with twenty-four teams having submitted their results.",
        "The top system by UTurku (Bjorne et al., 2009) attained the state-of-the-art F1 of 52.0%.",
        "The nested event structures make this task particularly attractive for applying joint inference.",
        "By allowing information to propagate among events and arguments, joint inference can facilitate mutual disambiguation and potentially lead to substantial gain in predictive accuracy.",
        "However, joint inference is underexplored for this task.",

        "A bio-molecular event (bio-event) refers to the change of state for biomolecules such as DNAs and proteins.",
        "The goal is to extract these events from unstructured text such as biomedical abstracts.",
        "For each event, one needs to identify the trigger words that signifies the event and the theme arguments that undergo the change.",
        "In addition, for regulation events, the cause argument also needs to be identified if it is present.",
        "The task considers nine event types: Expression, Transcription, Localization, Phosphorylation, Catabolism, Binding, Regulation, Positive.regulation, and Negative_regulation.",
        "Only Binding can take multiple themes.",
        "Regulation events may take events as arguments.",
        "To facilitate evaluation, the task fixes the type of non-event arguments to protein and provides ground truth of protein mentions as input.",
        "Like any NLP task, ambiguity is a central problem.",
        "The same event can be expressed in many variations.",
        "For example, a Negative_regulation event may be signified by \"inhibition\", \"down-regulation\", \"is abrogated by\", to name a few.",
        "On the other hand, depending on the context, the same expression may represent different events.",
        "For example, \"level\" may signify any one of five event types in the training set, or signify none.",
        "In addition, the nested event structures present new challenges to knowledge extraction systems.",
        "To recognize a complex event, besides from identifying the event type and trigger words, one also needs to identify its arguments and recursively identify their event structures.",
        "A mistake in any part will render a failure in this extraction.",
        "The interdependencies among events and arguments naturally argue for joint predictions.",
        "For example, given the snippet \"the level of VCAM-1 mRNA\", knowing that \"level\" might signify an event helps to recognize the prepositional phrase (PP) as its theme.",
        "Conversely, the presence of the PP suggests that \"level\" is likely an event.",
        "Moreover, the word \"mRNA\" in the PP indicates that the event type is probably Transcription.",
        "Most existing systems adopt a pipeline architecture and reduce the task to independent classifications of events and arguments.",
        "For example, the best system UTurku (Bjorne et al., 2009) first extracts a list of candidate triggers with types, and then determines for each pair of candidate triggers or proteins whether one is a theme or cause of the other.",
        "The triggers missed in the first stage can never be recovered in the second one.",
        "Moreover, since the second stage is trained with gold triggers as input, any trigger identified in the first stage tends to get at least one argument, even though it may not be an event at all.",
        "As a result, the authors had to use an ad hoc procedure to trade off precision and recall for the final prediction task while training the first-stage extractor.",
        "In addition, each trigger or argument is classified independently using a multi-class SVM.",
        "While joint inference can potentially improve accuracy, in practice, it is often very challenging to make it work (Poon and Domingos, 2007).",
        "The previous best joint approach for this task was proposed by Riedel et al.",
        "(2009) (labeled UT+DBLS in Kim et al.",

        "Their system is also based on Markov logic (Domingos and Lowd, 2009).",

        "Most systems, Riedel et al.",
        "'s included, classify each candidate argument path as a whole.",
        "A notable exception is the UTokyo system (Saetre et al., 2009), which incorporated sequential modeling by adapting a state-of-the-art PPI system based on MEMM.",
        "But they considered adjacent words in the sentence, which offered little help in this task, and their system trailed UTurku by 15 points in F1.",
        "All top systems for event extraction relied heavily on syntactic features.",
        "We went one step further by formulating joint predictions directly on dependency edges.",
        "While this leverages sequential correlation along argument paths, it also makes our system more prone to the adverse effect of syntactic errors.",
        "Joint syntactic and semantic processing has received much attention lately (Hajic et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we explore using a heuristic method to correct syntactic errors based on semantic information, and show that it leads to significant performance gain for event extraction."

        "Efficient inference can be performed using MC-SAT (Poon and Domingos, 2006).",

        "The latter can be viewed as approximating the Hessian with its diagonal, and is guaranteed optimal when the weights are not correlated (e.g., in logistic regression).",

        "Computationally, this formulation is also attractive.",
        "The number of predictions is bounded by the number of tokens and edges, and is linear in sentence length, rather than quadratic.",

        "We notice that events of the three regulation types often occur in similar contexts, and sometimes share trigger words (e.g., \"involve\").",
        "Therefore, our MLN merges them into a single event type Regulation, and additionally predicts the regulation direction (Positive or Negative).",

        "By default, we also added the unit formulas: Theme(x, y), Cause(x, y), EventType(x, +e), RegType(x, +r), which capture default regularities.",
        "Joint Inference: Like any classification system, the formulas in the base MLN make independent predictions at inference time.",
        "This is suboptimal, because query atoms are interdependent due to either hard constraints (e.g., an event must have a type) or soft correlation (e.g., \"increase\" signifies an event and the dobj edge from it leads to a theme).",
        "We thus augment the base MLN with two groups of joint-inference formulas.",

        "InArgPath(i, j, Cause) == Event(j)V Prot(j) V 3 k = i. InArgPath( j, k, Cause)",
        "The first three formulas enforce that events must have a type, that a token assigned an event (regulation) type must be an (regulation) event.",
        "The next four formulas enforce the consistency of argument path assignments: an argument path must start with an event, in particular, a cause path must start with a regulation event; a theme path must eventually trace to a protein, whereas a cause path may also stop at an event (which does not have a cause itself).",
        "To avoid looping, we forbid reverse edges in a path.",
        "Notice that with these constraints, adjacent edges in the dependency tree correlate with each other in their InArgPath assignments, much like in an HMM for linear sequences.",
        "Moreover, these assignments correlate with the event and event-type ones; knowing that i probably signifies an event makes it easier to detect an argument path, and vice versa.",
        "In addition, events that share partial argument paths can inform each other through the predictions on edges.",
        "In the experiments section, we will see that merely adding these hard constraints leads to 26-point gain in F1.",
        "We also notice that different trigger words may use different dependencies to start an argument path of a particular type.",
        "For example, for many verbs, nsubj tends to start a cause path and dobj a theme path.",
        "However, for \"bind\" that signifies a Binding event, both lead to themes, as in \"A binds B\".",
        "Such soft regularities can be captured by a single joint formula: Token(i, +w) A Dep(i, j, +d) == Event (i) A InArgPath(i, j, +a), which correlates event and argument type with token and dependency.",

        "The linguistically-motivated formulas are beneficial, as can seen by comparing with the system without them ( – LING), although the difference is small.",
        "Fixing the syntactic errors with semantic information, on the other hand, leads to substantial performance gain.",
        "Without doing it ( – SYN-FIX), our system suffers an F1 loss of more than four points.",
        "This verifies that the quality of syntactic analysis is important for event extraction.",
        "The differences between FULL and other variants (except -LING) are all statistically significant at 1% level using McNemar's test.",

        "Both trigger and argument-edge detections leave much room for improvement.",
