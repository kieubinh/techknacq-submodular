        "As the volume of published medical literature continues to grow exponentially, there is more and more research for physicians to assess and evaluate and less time to do so.",
        "Evidence-based medicine (EBM) (Sackett et al., 1996) is a widely accepted paradigm in medical practice that relies on evidence from patient-centered clinical research to make decisions.",
        "Taking an evidence-based approach to searching means doing a systematic search of all the available literature, individually critically appraising each research study and then applying the findings in clinical practice.",
        "However, this is a time consuming activity.",
        "One way to facilitate searching for a precise answer is to formulate a well-focused and structured question (Schardt et al., 2007).",
        "Physicians are educated to formulate their clinical questions according to several well defined aspects in EBM: Patient/Problem (P), Intervention (I),",
        "Comparison (C) and Outcome (O), which are called PICO elements.",
        "In many documents in medical literature (e.g. MEDLINE), one can find the elements of the PICO structure, but rarely explicitly annotated (Dawes et al., 2007).",
        "To identify documents corresponding to a patient's state, physicians also construct their queries according to the PICO structure.",
        "For example, in the question \"In children with pain and fever how does paracetamol compared with ibuprofen affect levels of pain and fever?\"",
        "one can identify the following PICO elements:",
        "Patient/Problem: children/pain and fever Intervention: paracetamol Comparison: ibuprofen Outcome: levels ofpain and fever",
        "Very little work, if any, has been carried out on the use of these elements in the Information Retrieval (IR) process.",
        "There are several reasons for that.",
        "It is not easy to identify PICO elements in documents, as well as in the question if these are not explicitly separated in it.",
        "Several studies have been performed on identifying PICO elements in abstracts (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007; Hansen et al., 2008; Chung, 2009).",
        "However, all of them are reporting coarse-grain (sentence-level) tagging methods that have not yet been shown to be sufficient for the purpose of IR.",
        "Moreover, there is currently no standard test collection of questions in PICO structure available for evaluation.",
        "On the other hand, the most critical aspect in IR is term weighting.",
        "One of the purpose of tagging PICO elements is to assign appropriate weights to these elements during the retrieval process.",
        "From this perspective, a semantic tagging of PICO elements may be a task that goes well beyond that is required for IR.",
        "It may be sufficient to have a method that assigns appropriate weights to elements rather than recognizing their semantic roles.",
        "In this paper, we will propose an approach to determine term weights according to document structure.",
        "This method will be compared to that using tagging of PICO elements.",
        "In this paper, we first report an attempt to manually annotate the PICO elements in documents by physicians and use them as training data to build an automatic tagging tool.",
        "It turns out that there is a high disagreement rate between human annotators.",
        "The utilization of the automatic tagging tool in an IR experiment shows only a small gain in retrieval effectiveness.",
        "We therefore propose an alternative to PICO element detection that uses the structural information of documents.",
        "This solution turns out to be robust and effective.",
        "The alternative approach is motivated by a strong trend that we observe in the distribution of PICO elements in documents.",
        "We then make use of both PICO query and document structure to extend the classical language modeling approach to IR.",
        "Specifically, we investigate how each element of a PICO query should be weighted and how a location-based weighting strategy can be used to emphasize the most informative parts (i.e. containing the most PICO elements) of documents.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first briefly review the previous work, followed by a description of the method we propose.",
        "Next, we present our experiments and results.",

        "Although these studies are reporting interesting results, they are limited in several aspects.",
        "First, many are restricted to some segments of the medical documents (e.g.",
        "Method section) (Chung, 2009), and in most cases, the test collection is very small (a few hundreds abstracts).",
        "Second, the precision and granularity of these methods have not yet been shown to be sufficient for the purpose of IR.",
        "The structural information provided by markup languages (e.g. XML) has been successfully used to improve the IR effectiveness (INEX, 2002 2009).",
        "For such documents, the structure information can be used to emphasize some particular parts of the document.",
        "Thereby, a given word should not have the same importance depending on its position in the document structure.",
        "Taking into account the structure can be done either at the step of querying or at the step of indexing.",
        "One way to integrate the structure at querying is to adapt query languages (Fuhr and Großjohann, 2001).",
        "These approaches follow the assumption that the user knows where the most relevant information is located.",
        "However, (Kamps et al., 2005) showed that it is preferable to use structure as a search hint, and not as a strict search requirement",
        "The second approach consists in integrating the document structure at the indexing step by introducing a structure weighting scheme (Wilkinson, 1994).",
        "In such a scheme, the weight assigned to a word is not only based on its frequency but also on its position in the document.",
        "The structure of a document can be defined in terms of tags (e.g. title, section), each of those having a weight chosen either empirically or automatically by the use of optimizing techniques such as genetic algorithms (Trotman, 2005)."

        "It could also be caused by the limited number of query in our test collection.",
        "However, we can determine reasonable weights by tuning each part weight separately.",
        "Experiments with model-2",
        "We have seen that a large improvement could come from weighting each part accordingly.",
        "In a second series of experiments, we try to assign a different",

        "A grid search was used to find the optimal 5e weights combination.",
        "The results are shown in Table 3.",
        "We observe a MAP score increase of 22.5% and an increase of 11% in P@ 10.",
        "Though the use of a PICO weighting scheme increases the retrieval accuracy, there is clearly much to gain by using the document structure.",
        "The optimal [5p, 5i, 5c, 5o] weights distribution is [0.3,1.2,0,0.1] for Qa and [0.2,1,0,0.2] for Qb.",
        "That means that the most important words in queries belong to the Intervention element.",
        "This supports the manual search strategy proposed by (Weinfeld and Finkelstein, 2005), in which they suggested that I and P elements should be used first to construct queries, and only if too many results are obtained that other elements should be considered.",
        "It is interesting to see that query words belonging to the Comparison element have to be considered as the least important part of a query.",
        "Even more so because they are in the same semantic group as the Intervention words.",
        "A reason for that could be the use of vague words such as \"no-intervention\" or \"placebo\".",
        "The methodology employed to construct the queries is also responsible.",
        "Indeed, physicians have focused on producing alternative formulations of 10 general clinical questions by predominantly modifying the one of the PICO elements.",
        "As a result, some of them do share the same vague Comparison words.",

        "(*: t.test < 0.01)",
        "Experiments with model-1+2",
        "We have seen that both the use of a location-based weighting and a PICO-structure weighting scheme increase the retrieval accuracy.",
        "In this last series of experiments, we analyse the results of their combination.",
        "We can observe that fusing model-1 and model-2 allows us to obtain the best retrieval accuracy with a MAP score increase of 61.5% and a P@10 increase of 70.0%.",
        "It is a large improvement over the baseline as it means that instead of about two relevant documents in the top 10, our system can retrieve nearly four.",
        "These results confirm that both PICO framework and document structure can be very helpful for the IR process."

        "We presented a language modeling approach that integrates document and PICO structure for the purpose of clinical IR.",
        "A straightforward idea is to detect PICO elements in documents and use the elements in the retrieval process.",
        "However, this approach does not work well because of the difficulty to arrive at a consistent tagging of these elements.",
        "Instead, we propose a less demanding approach which assigns different weights to different parts of a document.",
        "We first analysed the distribution of PICO elements in a manually annotated abstracts collection.",
        "The observed results led us to believe that a location-based weighting scheme can be used instead of a PICO detection approach.",
        "We then explored whether this strategy can be used as an indicator to refine document relevance.",
        "We also proposed a model to integrate the PICO information provided in queries and investigated how each element should be balanced in the ranking function.",
        "On a data set composed of 1.5 million abstracts extracted from PubMed, our method obtains an increase of 61.5% for MAP and 70% for P@10 over the classical language modeling approach.",
        "This work can be much improved in the future.",
        "For example, the location-based weighting method can be improved in order to model a different weight distribution for each PICO element.",
        "As the distribution in abstracts is not the same among PICO elements, it is expected that differentiated weighting schemes could result in better retrieval effectiveness.",
        "In a similar perspective, we are continuing our efforts to construct a larger manually annotated collection of abstracts.",
        "It will be thereafter conceivable to use this data to infer the structural weighting schemes or to train a more precise PICO detection method.",
        "The focused evaluation described in this paper is a first step.",
        "Although the queries are limited to diabetes, this does not affect the general PICO structure in queries.",
        "We plan to extend the coverage of queries to other topics in the future."
