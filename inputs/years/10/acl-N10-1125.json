        "Creating image databases for model development is, however, costly and time consuming, since the keywords must be hand-coded and the process repeated for new collections.",
        "In this work we exploit the vast resource of images and documents available on the web for developing image annotation models without any human involvement.",
        "We describe a probabilistic model based on the assumption that images and their co-occurring textual data are generated by mixtures of latent topics.",

        "Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of image collections available for searching and browsing over the Internet.",
        "Although image search engines are still in their infancy, initial research suggests that the deployed algorithms are not very accurate (Hawking et al., 1999).",
        "Given a query, search engines retrieve relevant pictures by analyzing the image caption (if it exists), textual descriptions found adjacent to the image, and other text-related factors such as the file name of the image.",
        "However, since they do not analyze the actual content of the images, search engines cannot be used to retrieve pictures from unan-notated collections.",
        "The ability to perform the annotation task automatically would be of significant practical import for many image-based applications.",
        "Besides search and retrieval, other examples include browsing support (e.g., by clustering images into groups that are visually and semantically coherent) and story picturing (i.e., automatically suggesting images to illustrate text).",
        "Automatic image annotation is a popular task in computer vision; a large number of approaches have been proposed in the literature under many distinct learning paradigms.",
        "These range from supervised classification (Smeulders et al., 2000; Vailaya et al., 2001) to instantiations of the noisy-channel model (Duygulu et al., 2002), to clustering (Barnard et al., 2002) , and methods inspired by information retrieval (Feng et al., 2004; Lavrenko et al., 2003).",
        "Despite differences in application and formulation, all these methods essentially attempt to learn the correlation between image features and words from examples of annotated images.",
        "The Corel database has been extensively used as a testbed for the development and evaluation of image annotation models.",
        "It is a collection of stock photographs, divided into themes (e.g., tigers, sunsets) each of which are associated with keywords (e.g., sun, sea) that are considered appropriate descriptors for all images belonging to the same theme.",
        "Unfortunately, the Corel database is not representative of the size or content of real-world image collections.",
        "It has a small number of themes with many closely related images which in turn share keyword descriptions.",
        "It is therefore relatively easy to learn the associations between images and keywords and do well on annotation and retrieval tasks (Tang and Lewis, 2007; Westerveld and de Vries, 2003).",
        "An appealing alternative is the use of resources where images and their annotations co-occur naturally.",
        "Examples include images found in news documents, consumer photo collections, Wikipedia articles, illustrated stories and so on.",
        "The key idea here is to treat the words in the surrounding text as annotations for the image.",
        "These annotations are undoubtedly noisy, but plenty and cost-free.",
        "Moreover, the collateral text is often longer and more informative in comparison to the few keywords reserved for each image in Corel.",
        "In this paper we propose a probabilistic image annotation model that learns to automatically label images under such noisy conditions.",
        "We use the database created in Feng and Lapata (2008) which consists of news articles, images, and their captions.",
        "Our model exploits the redundancy inherent in this multimodal dataset by assuming that images and their surrounding text are generated by a shared set of latent variables or topics.",
        "Specifically, we describe documents and images by a common multimodal vocabulary consisting of textual words and visual terms (visiterms).",
        "Due to polysemy and synonymy many words in this vocabulary will refer to the same underlying concept.",
        "Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, Blei and Jordan 2003), a probabilistic model of text generation, we represent visual and textual meaning jointly as a probability distribution over a set of topics.",
        "Our annotation model takes these topic distributions into account while finding the most likely keywords for an image and its associated document.",
        "We also show how the model can be straightforwardly modified to perform automatic text illustration.",
        "The task is routinely performed by news writers who often have to search large image collections in order to find suitable pictures for their text.",
        "Here, the model takes a document as input and suggests images that match its content.",
        "Experimental results on both tasks bring improvements over competitive models."

        "A variety of learning methods have been applied to the image annotation task.",
        "These generally fall under two broad categories.",
        "Supervised methods define annotation as a classification task, e.g., by assuming a one-to-one correspondence between vocabulary words and classes or by grouping several words into a single class (see Chai and Hung 2008 for an overview).",
        "Unsupervised approaches attempt to discover the underlying connections between visual features and words, typically by introducing latent variables.",
        "Standard latent semantic analysis (LSA) and its probabilistic variant (PLSA) have been applied to this task (Hofmann, 2001; Monay and Gatica-Perez, 2007; Pan et al., 2004).",
        "More sophisticated models estimate the joint distribution of words and regional image features, whilst treating annotation as a problem of statistical inference in a graphical model (Barnard et al., 2002; Blei and Jordan, 2003; Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Irrespectively of the underlying model or task at hand, much work has focused how to best represent the visual and textual modalities in order to exploit their synergy.",
        "Several approaches attempt to render images more word-like, by reducing the dimensionality of the image feature space (Bosch et al., 2008; Fei-Fei and Perona, 2005) or by learning a single representation for both visual and textual features (Monay and Gatica-Perez, 2007; Zhao and Grosky, 2003).",
        "Our own work approaches the image annotation (and related story picturing) task from a slightly different angle.",
        "We train and test our model on images that contain implicit (and thus noisy) annotations that have not been specifically created for our task.",
        "On account of this, our model has access to knowledge sources other than the image and its keywords (i.e., the news article containing the image we wish to annotate).",
        "In Feng and Lapata (2008) we addressed this problem with a modified version of the continuous relevance annotation model (Lavrenko et al., 2003).",
        "Unlike other unsupervised approaches where a set of latent variables is introduced, each defining a joint distribution on the space of keywords and image features, the relevance model captures the joint probability of images and annotated words directly, without requiring an intermediate clustering stage (i.e., each annotated image in the training set is treated as a latent variable).",
        "We modified this model so as to exploit the information present in the document in two ways.",
        "First, in estimating the conditional probability of a keyword given an image, we also considered its likelihood in the collateral document.",
        "Secondly, we used an LDA model (trained on the document collection) to prune from the model's output words that are not representative of the document's topics.",
        "The proposed approach differs from Feng and Lapata (2008) in three important respects: (a) document-based information is an integral part of our model as we predict caption words given the image and its accompanying document (b) LDA is no longer a post-processing step; our model relies on LDA to infer meaningful topics that capture the cooccurrence of visual features and words; (c) beyond image annotation, we show how the same framework can be applied to story picturing (Joshi et al., 2006), a task which has received less attention in the literature.",
        "In terms of model structure, Blei and Jordan (2003) and Monay and Gatica-Perez (2007) are closest to our work.",
        "The first model, known as correspondence LDA (CorrLDA), has been successfully employed for modeling annotated images in the Corel domain.",
        "CorrLDA also uses the notion of topic to model the generation of images and their captions.",
        "In this model, the visual modality drives the definition of the latent space to which the textual modality is linked.",
        "The second model is based on PLSA and learns a representation similar to ours consisting of textual and visual features.",
        "It is also trained using captioned images from the Corel database.",
        "We work with noisier and larger datasets.",
        "Our model exploits the captions accompanying the images as well as their surrounding documents.",
        "As a result, we obtain a similar number of textual and visual words; these are often imbalanced in the Corel database, where visual words are nearly 50 times more than textual words.",
        "The different nature of our data dictates the use of a model where the visual and textual modality are given equal importance in defining the latent space."

        "The images are usually 203 pixels wide and 152 pixels high.",
        "The average caption length is 5.35 tokens, and the average document length 133.85 tokens.",
        "The captions vocabulary is 2,167 words and the document vocabulary is 6,253.",
        "The vocabulary shared between captions and documents is 2,056 words.",
        "In contrast to the Corel database, this dataset contains more complex images (with many objects) and has a larger vocabulary (Corel's vocabulary is approximately 300 words).",
        "An example of an abridged database entry is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Due to the non-standard nature of the database we assume that the caption and news article describe the content of the image either directly or indirectly.",

        "Yet, both modalities on some level capture the same underlying concepts as they are used to describe the same objects.",
        "A common first step to all previous methods is the segmentation of the image into regions, using either a fixed-grid layout or an image segmentation algorithm.",

        "In order to do this we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm (Lowe, 1999).",
        "The general idea behind the algorithm is to first sample an image with the difference-of-Gaussians point detector at different scales and locations.",
