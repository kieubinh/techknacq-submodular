        "Wizard-of-Oz (WOz) studies have long been used for spoken dialogue system design.",
        "In a relatively new variant, a subject (the wizard) is presented with real or simulated automated speech recognition (ASR) to observe how people deal with incorrect speech recognition output (Rieser, Kruijff-Korbayov√¢, & Lemon, 2005; Skantze, 2003; Stuttle, Williams, & Young, 2004; Williams & Young, 2003, 2004; Zollo, 1999).",
        "In these experiments, when a wizard could not interpret the ASR output (non-understanding), she rarely asked users to repeat themselves.",
        "Instead, the wizard found other ways to continue the task.",
        "This paper describes an experiment that presented wizards with ASR results for utterances whose interpretation is critical to task success: requests for books from a library database, identified by title.",
        "To avoid non-understandings, wizards used voice search (Wang et al., 2008): they directly queried the application database with ASR output.",
        "To investigate how to avoid errors in understanding (misunderstandings), we examined how wizards dealt with uncertainty in voice search results.",
        "When the voice search results included the requested title, all seven of our wizards were likely to identify it.",
        "One wizard, however, recognized far better than the others when the voice search results did not contain the requested title.",
        "The experiment employed a novel design that made it possible to include system features in models of wizard behavior.",
        "The principal result is that our learned models of the best wizard's behavior combine features that are available to wizards with some that are not, such as recognition confidence and acoustic model scores.",
        "The next section of the paper motivates our experiment.",
        "Subsequent sections describe related work, the dialogue system and embedded wizard infrastructure, experimental design, learning methods, and results.",
        "We then discuss how to generalize from the results of our study for spoken dialogue system design.",
        "We conclude with a summary of results and their implications."

      "heading": "2. Motivation",
      "text": [
        "Rather than investigate full dialogues, we addressed a single type of turn exchange or adjacency pair (Sacks et al., 1974): a request for a book by its title.",
        "This allowed us to collect data exclusively about an utterance type critical for task success in our application domain.",
        "We hypothesized that low-level features from speech recognition, such as acoustic model fit, could independently affect voice search confidence.",
        "We therefore applied a novel approach, embedded WOz, in which a wizard and the system together interpret noisy ASR.",
        "To address how to avoid misunderstandings, we investigated how wizards dealt with uncertainty in voice search returns.",
        "To illustrate what we mean by uncertainty, if we query our book title database with the ASR hypothesis:",
        "ROLL DWELL",
        "our voice search procedure returns, in this order:",
        "CROMWELL ROBERT LOWELL ROAD TO WEALTH",
        "The correct title appears last because of the score it is assigned by the string similarity metric we use.",
        "Three factors motivated our use of voice search to interpret book title requests: noisy ASR, unusually long query targets, and high overlap of the vocabulary across different query types (e.g., author and title) as well as with non-query words in caller utterances (e.g., \"Could you look up .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "\").",
        "First, accurate speech recognition for a real-world telephone application can be difficult to achieve, given unpredictable background noise and transmission quality.",
        "For example, the 68% word error rate (WER) for the fielded version of Let's Go Public!",
        "(Raux et al., 2005) far exceeded its 17% WER under controlled conditions.",
        "Our application handles library requests by telephone, and would benefit from robustness to noisy ASR.",
        "Second, the book title field in our database differs from the typical case for spoken dialogue systems that access a relational database.",
        "Such systems include travel booking (Levin et al., 2000), bus route information (Raux et al., 2006), restaurant guides (Johnston et al., 2002; Komatani et al., 2005), weather (Zue et al., 2000) and directory services (Georgila et al., 2003).",
        "In general for these systems, a few words are sufficient to retrieve the desired attribute value, such as a neighborhood, a street, or a surname.",
        "Mean utterance length in a sample of 40,000 Let's Go Public!",
        "utterances, for example, is 2.4 words.",
        "The average book title length in our database is 5.4 words.",
        "Finally, our dialogue system, CheckItOut, allows users to choose whether to request books by title, author, or catalogue number.",
        "The database represents 5028 active patrons (with real borrowing histories and preferences but fictitious personal information), 71,166 book titles and 28,031 authors.",
        "Though much smaller than a database for a directory service application (Georgila et al., 2003), this is much larger than that of many current research systems.",
        "For example, Let's Go Public!",
        "accesses a database with 70 bus routes and 1300 place names.",
        "Titles and author names contribute 50,394 words to the vocabulary, of which 57.4% occur only in titles, 32.1% only in author names, and 10.5% in both.",
        "Many book titles (e.g., You See I Haven't Forgotten, You Never Know) have a high potential for confusability with non-title phrases in users' book requests.",
        "Given the longer database field and the confusability of the book title language, integrating voice search is likely to have a relatively larger impact in CheckItOut.",
        "We seek to minimize non-understandings and misunderstandings for several reasons.",
        "First, user corrections in both situations have been shown to be more poorly recognized than non-correction utterances (Litman et al., 2006).",
        "Non-understandings typically result in re-prompting the user for the same information.",
        "This often leads to hyper-articulation and concomitant degradation in recognition performance.",
        "Second, users seem to prefer systems that minimize non-understandings and misunderstandings, even at the expense of dialogue efficiency.",
        "Users of the TOOT train information spoken dialogue system preferred system-initiative to mixed-or user-initiative, and preferred explicit confirmation to implicit or no confirmation (Litman & Pan, 1999).",
        "This was true despite the fact that a mixed-initiative, implicit confirmation strategy led to fewer turns for the same task.",
        "Most of the more recent work on spoken dialogue systems focuses on mixed-initiative systems in laboratory settings.",
        "Still, recent work suggests that while mixed-or user-initiative is rated highly in usability studies, under real usage it \"fails to provide [a] robust enough interface\" (Turunen et al., 2006).",
        "Incorporating accurate voice search into spoken dialogue systems could lead to fewer non-understandings and fewer misunderstandings."

        "Our approach to noisy ASR contrasts with many other information-seeking and transaction-based dialogue systems.",
        "Those systems typically perform natural language understanding on ASR output before database query with techniques that try to improve or expand ASR output.",
        "None that we know of use voice search.",
        "For one directory service application, users spell the first three letters of surnames, and then ASR results are expanded using frequently confused phones (Georgila et al., 2003).",
        "A two-pass recognition architecture added to Let's Go Public!",
        "improved concept recognition in postconfirmation user utterances (Stoyanchev & Stent, 2009).",
        "In (Komatani et al., 2005), a shallow semantic interpretation phase was followed by decision trees to classify utterances as relevant either to query type or to specific query slots, to narrow the set of possible interpretations.",
        "CheckItOut is most similar in spirit to the latter approach, but relies on the database earlier, and only for semantic interpretation, not to also guide the dialogue strategy.",
        "Our approach to noisy ASR is inspired by previous WOz studies with real (Skantze, 2003; Zollo, 1999) or simulated ASR (Kruijff-Korbayov√¢ et al., 2005; Rieser et al., 2005; Williams & Young, 2004).",
        "Simulation makes it possible to collect dialogues without building a speech recognizer, and to control for WER.",
        "In the studies that involved task-oriented dialogues, wizards typically focused more on the task and less on resolving ASR errors 1999).",

        "Rieser et al., 2005).",
        "Zollo collected seven dialogues with different human-wizard pairs to develop an evacuation plan.",
        "incorrect ASR, wizard utterances indicated a failure to understand for only 35% of them.",
        "Wizards ignored words not salient in the domain and hypothesized words based on phonetic similarity.",
        "In (Skantze, 2003), both users and wizards knew there was no dialogue system; 44 direction-finding dialogues were collected with 16 subjects.",
        "Despite a WER of 43%, the wizard operators signaled misunderstanding only 5% of the time, in part because they often ignored ASR errors and continued the dialogue.",
        "For the 20% of non-understandings, operators continued a route description, asked a task-related question, or requested a clarification.",
        "Williams and Young collected 144 dialogues simulating tourist requests for directions and other negotiations.",
        "WER was constrained to be high, medium, or low.",
        "Under medium WER, a task-related question in response to a non-understanding or misunderstanding led to full understanding more often than explicit repairs.",
        "Under high WER, however, the reverse was true.",
        "Misunderstandings significantly increased when wizards followed non-understandings or misunderstandings with a task-related question instead of a repair.",
        "In (Rieser et al., 2005), wizards simulated a multimodal MP3 player application with access to a database of 150K music albums.",
        "Responses could be presented verbally or graphically.",
        "In the noisy transcription condition, wizards made clarification requests about twice as often as that found in similar human-human dialogue.",
        "In a system like CheckItOut, user utterances that request database information must be understood.",
        "We seek an approach that would reduce the rate of misunderstandings observed for high WER in (Williams & Young, 2004) and the rate of clarification requests observed in (Rieser et al., 2005)."

        "What wizards saw on the GUI, their recent success, and recognizer confidence scores were key attributes in the decision trees.",

        "The impact of RecentSuccess might result not just from the wizard's confidence in her current strategy, but also from consistency in the user's speech characteristics.",
        "The Helios confidence annotation uses a learned model based on features from the recognizer, the parser, and the dialogue state.",
        "Here confidence primarily reflects",
        "recognition confidence; due to the simplicity of our grammar, parse results only indicate whether there is a parse.",
        "In addition to these five features, every tree relied on at least one measure of similarity between the hypothesis and the candidates.",
        "W4 achieved superior accuracy: she knew when to offer a title and when not to.",
        "In the learned tree for W4, if the DisplayType was NoisyList, W4 asked a question; if DisplayType was Ambiguous-List, the features used to predict W4's action included the five listed above, along with the acoustic model score, word length of the ASR, number of times the wizard had asked the user to repeat, and the maximum size of the gap between words in the candidates that matched the ASR hypothesis.",
        "To focus on W4's questioning behavior, we trained an additional decision tree to learn how W4 chose between two actions: offering a title versus asking a question.",
        "This 37-node, 8-attribute tree was based on 600 data points, with F=0.91 for making an offer and F=0.68 for asking a question.",
        "The tree is distinctive in that it splits at the root on the number of frames in the ASR.",
        "If the ASR is short (as measured both by the number of recognition frames and the words), W4 asks a question when DisplayType = AmbiguousList or NoisyList, either RecentSuccess < 1 or ContiguousWord-Match = 0, and the acoustic model score is low.",
        "Note that shorter titles are more confusable.",
        "If the ASR is long, W4 asks a question when Conti-guousWordMatch < 1, RecentSuccess < 2, and either CandidateDisplay = NoisyList, or Confidence is low, and there is a choice of titles."

        "This is true even with the relatively simplistic measure of similarity between the ASR hypothesis and candidate titles used here.",

      "text": [
        "This paper presents a novel methodology that embeds wizards in a spoken dialogue system, and collects data for a single turn exchange.",
        "Our results illustrate the merits of ranking wizards, and learning from the best.",
        "Our wizards were uniformly good at choosing the correct title when it was present, but most were overly eager to identify a title when it was not among the candidates.",
        "In this respect, the best wizard (W4) achieved the highest accuracy because she demonstrated a much greater ability to know when not to offer a title.",
        "We have shown that it is feasible to replicate this ability in a model learned from features that include the presentation of the search results (length of the candidate list, amount of word overlap of candidates with the ASR hypothesis), recent success at selecting the correct candidate, and measures pertaining to recognition results (confidence, acoustic model score, speaker rate).",
        "If replicated in a spoken dialogue system, such a model could support integration of voice search in a way that avoids misunderstandings.",
        "We conclude that learning from embedded wizards can exploit a wider range of relevant features, that dialogue managers can profit from access to more fine-grained representations of user utterances, and that machine learners should be selective about which people to model.",
        "That wizard actions can be modeled using system features bodes well for future work.",
        "Our next experiment will collect full dialogues with embedded wizards whose actions will again be restricted through an interface.",
        "This time, NLU will integrate voice search with the linguistically motivated CFG rules for book titles described earlier, and a larger language model and grammar for database entities.",
        "We will select wizards who perform well during pilot tests.",
        "Again, the goal will be to model the most successful wizards, based upon data from recognition results, NLU, and voice search results."
