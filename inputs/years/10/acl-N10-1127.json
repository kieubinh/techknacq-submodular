        "The word reordering problem has been one of the major problems in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Since exploring all possible reorderings of a source sentence is an NP-complete problem (Knight 1999), SMT systems limit words to be reordered within a window of length k. IBM Models 3 through 5 (Brown et.al.",
        "1993) model reorderings based on surface word information.",
        "For example, Model 4 attempts to assign target-language positions to source-language words by modeling d(j | i, l, m) where j is the target-language position, i is the source-language position, l and m are respectively source and target sentence lengths.",
        "These models are not effective in modeling reorderings because they don't have enough context and lack structural information.",
        "Phrase-based SMT systems such as (Koehn et.al.",
        "2003) move from using words as translation units to using phrases.",
        "One of the advantages of phrase-based SMT systems is that local reorderings are inherent in the phrase translations.",
        "However, phrase-based SMT systems capture reordering instances and not reordering phenomena.",
        "For example, if the Arabic phrase \"the car red\" and its English translation \"the red car' is seen in the training data, phrase-based SMT is able to produce the correct English for the Arabic 'the car red'.",
        "However it will not be able to produce 'the blue car' for the Arabic 'the car blue' if the training data does not contain this phrase pair.",
        "Phrases do not capture the phenomenon that Arabic adjectives and nouns need to be reordered.",
        "Another problem with phrase-based SMT is the problem of longrange reorderings.",
        "Recent work on reordering has been focusing on capturing general reordering phenomena (as opposed to instances) and on solving long-range reordering problems.",
        "(Al-onaizan et.al.",
        "2006) proposes 3 distortion models, the inbound, outbound, and pair models.",
        "They together model the likelihood of translating a source word at position i given that the source word at position j has just been translated.",
        "These models perform better than n-gram based language models but are limited in their use of only the surface strings.",
        "Instead of directly modeling the distance of word movement, phrasal level reordering models model how to move phrases, also called orientations.",
        "Orientations typically apply to adjacent phrases.",
        "Two adjacent phrases can be either placed monotonically (sometimes called straight) or swapped (non-monotonically or inverted).",
        "Early orientation models do not use lexical contents such as (Zens et.",
        "al., 2004).",
        "More recently,",
        "Tillmann, 2004; Kumar et al., 2005, Ni et al., 2009) all presented models that use lexical features from the phrases to predict their orientations.",
        "These models are very powerful in predicting local phrase placements.",
        "More recently (Galley et.al.",
        "2008) introduced a hierarchical orientation model that captures some non-local phrase reorderings by a shift reduce algorithm.",
        "Because of the heavy use of lexical features, these models tend to suffer from data sparseness problems.",
        "Another limitation is that these models are restricted to reorderings with no gaps and phrases that are adjacent.",
        "We present a probabilistic reordering model that models directly the source translation sequence and explicitly assigns probabilities to the reorderings of the source input with no restrictions on gap, length or adjacency.",
        "This is different from the approaches of pre-order such as (Xia and",

        "al.",
        "2005; Li et.",
        "al., 2007).",
        "Although our model can be used to produce top N pre-ordered source, the experiments reported here do not use the model in the pre-order mode.",
        "Instead, the reordering model is used to generate a reorder lattice which encodes many reorderings and their costs (negative log probability).",
        "This reorder lattice is independent of the translation decoder.",
        "In principle, any decoder can use this lattice for its reordering needs.",
        "We have integrated the reorder lattice into a phrase-based.",
        "The experiments reported here are from the phrase-based decoder.",
