        "Translation models based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) have become widespread in recent years (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2007).",
        "Compared to phrase-based models, which can be represented as finite-state transducers (FSTs, Kumar et al.",
        "(2006)), one important benefit that SCFG models have is the ability to process long range reordering patterns in space and time that is polynomial in the length of the displacement, whereas an FST must generally explore a number of states that is exponential in this length.",
        "As one would expect, for language pairs with substantial structural differences (and thus requiring long-range reordering during translation), SCFG models have come to outperform the best FST models (Zollmann et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we explore a new way to take advantage of the computational benefits of CFGs during translation.",
        "Rather than using a single SCFG to both reorder and translate a source sentence into the target language, we break the translation process into a two step pipeline where (1) the source language is reordered into a target-like order, with alternatives encoded in a context-free forest, and (2) the reordered source is transduced into the target language using an FST that represents phrasal correspondences.",
        "While multi-step decompositions of the translation problem have been proposed before (Kumar et al., 2006), they are less practical with the rise of SCFG models, since the context-free languages are not closed under intersection (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979).",
        "However, the CFLs are closed under intersection with regular languages.",
        "By restricting ourselves to a finite-state phrase transducer and representing reorderings of the source in a context-free forest, exact inference over the composition of the two models is possible.",
        "The paper proceeds as follows.",
        "We first explore reordering forests and describe how to translate them with an FST (§2).",
        "Since we would like our reordering model to discriminate between good re-orderings of the source and bad ones, we show how to train our reordering component as a latent variable in an end-to-end translation model (§3).",
        "We then presents experimental results on language pairs requiring small amounts and large amounts of reordering (§4).",
        "We conclude with a discussion of related work (§6) and possible extensions (§7)."

        "In this section, we describe source reordering forests, a context-free representation of source language word order alternatives.",
        "The basic idea is that for the source sentence, f, that is to be translated, we want to create a (monolingual) context-free grammar F that generates strings (f/) of words in the source language that are permutations of the original sentence.",
        "Specifically, this forest should contain derivations that put the source words into an order that approximates how they will be ordered in the grammar of the target language.",
        "For a concrete example, let us consider the task of English-Japanese translation.",
        "Our input sentence is John ate an apple.",
        "Japanese is a head-final language, where the heads of phrases (such as the verb in a verb phrase) typically come last, and English is a head-initial language, where heads come first.",
        "As a result, the usual order for a declarative sentence in English is SVO (subject-verb-object), but in Japanese, it is SOV, and the desired translation is John-ga ringo-o [an apple] tabeta [ate].",
        "In summary, when translating from English into Japanese, it is usually necessary to move verbs from their position between the subject and object to the end of the sentence.",
        "This reordering can happen in two ways, which we depict in Figure 1.",
        "In the derivation on the left, a memorized phrase pair captures the movement of the verb (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "In the other derivation, the source is first reordered into target word order and then translated, using smaller translation units.",
        "In addition, we have assumed that the phrase translations were learned from a parallel corpus that is in the original ordering, so the reordering forest F should include derivations of phrase-size units in the source order as well as the target order.",
        "Figure 2: A fragment of a phrase-based English-Japanese translation model, represented as an FST.",
        "Japanese romanization is given in brackets.",
        "A minimal reordering forest that supports the derivations depicted needs to include both an SOV and SVO version of the source.",
        "This could be accomplished trivially with the following grammar:",
        "S – John ate an apple S – John an apple ate",
        "However, this grammar misses the opportunity to take advantage of the regularities in the permuted structure.",
        "A better alternative might be:",
        "S – John VP",
        "VP – ate NP",
        "VP – NP ate",
        "NP – an apple",
        "In this grammar, the phrases John and an apple are fixed and only the VP contains ordering ambiguity.",
        "Many kinds of reordering forests are possible; in general, the best one for a particular language pair will be one that is easiest to create given the resources available in the source language.",
        "It will also be the one that most compactly expresses the source reorderings that are most likely to be useful for translation.",
        "In this paper, we consider a particular kind of reordering forest that is inspired by the reordering model of Yamada and Knight (2001).",
        "These are generated by taking a source language parse tree and 'expanding' each node so that it rewrites with different permutations of its children.For an illustration using our example sentence, refer to Figure 3 for the forest representation and Figure 4 for its isomorphic CFG representation.",
        "It is easy to see that this forest generates the two 'good' order variants from Figure 1; however, the forest includes many other derivations that will probably not lead to good translations.",
        "For this reason, it is helpful to associate the edges in the forest (that is, the rules in the CFG) with weights reflecting how likely that rule is to lead to a good translation.",
        "We discuss how these weights can be learned automatically in §3.",
        "Having described how to construct a context-free reordering forest for the source sentence, we now turn to the problem of how to translate the source forest into the target language using a phrase-based translation model encoded as an FST, e.g.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "The process is quite similar to the one used when translating a source sentence with an SCFG, but with a twist: rather than representing the translation model as a grammar and parsing the source sentence, we represent the source sentence as a grammar (i.e. its reordering forest), and we use it to 'parse' the translation model (i.e. the FST representation of the phrase-based model).",
        "The end result (either way!)",
        "is a translation forest containing all possible target-language translations of the source.",
        "Parsing can be understood as a means of computing the intersection of an FSA and a CFG (Grune and Jacobs, 2008).",
        "Since we are dealing with FSTs that define binary relations over strings, not FSAs defining strings, this operation is more properly composition.",
        "However, since CFG/FSA intersection is less cumbersome to describe, we present the algorithm in terms of intersection.",
        "To compute the composition of a reordering forest, G, with an FSA, F, we will make use of a variant of Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970).",
        "Let weighted finite-state automaton F = (S,Q,q0,qfinal,ö,w).",
        "S is a finite alphabet; Q is a set of states; qo and qfinal S Q are start and accept states, respectively, ö is the transition function Q x S – 2Q, and w is the transition cost function Q x Q – R. We use variables that refer to states in the FSA with the letters q, r, and s. We use x to represent a variable that is an element of S. Variables u and v represent costs.",
        "X and Y are non-terminals.",
        "Lowercase Greek letters are strings of terminals and non-terminals.",
        "The function ö(q, x) returns the state(s) that are reachable from state q by taking a transition labeled with x in the FSA.",
        "Figure 5 provides the inference rules for a top-down intersection algorithm in the form of a weighted logic program; the three inference rules correspond to Earley's scan, predict, and complete, respectively."

        "A variety of translation processes can be formalized as the composition of a finite-state representation of input (typically just a sentence, but often a more complex structure, like a word lattice) with an SCFG (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2007; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).",
        "Like these, our work uses parsing algorithms to perform the composition operation.",
        "But this is the first time that the input to a finite-state transducer has a context-free structure.",
        "Although not described in terms of operations over formal languages, the model of Yamada and Knight (2001) can be understood as an instance of our class of models with a specific input forest and phrases restricted to match syntactic constituents.",
        "In terms of formal similarity, Mi et al.",
        "(2008) use forests as input to a tree-to-string transducer process, but the forests are used to recover from 1-best parsing errors (as such, all derivations yield the same source string).",
        "Iglesias et al.",
        "(2009) use a SCFG-based translation model, but implement it using FSTs, although they use non-regular extensions that make FSTs equivalent to recursive transition networks.",
        "Galley and Manning (2008) use a context-free reordering model to score a phrase-based (exponential) search space.",
        "Syntax-based preprocessing approaches that have relied on handwritten rules to restructure source trees for particular translation tasks have been quite",

        "Discrimina-tively trained reordering models have been extensively explored.",
        "A widely used approach has been to use a classifier to predict the orientation of phrases during decoding (Zens and Ney, 2006; Chang et al., 2009).",
        "These classifiers must be trained independently from the translation model using training examples extracted from the training data.",
        "A more ambitious approach is described by Tromble and Eisner (2009), who build a global reordering model that is learned automatically from reordered training data.",

      "text": [
        "We have described a new model of translation that takes advantage of the strengths of context-free modeling, but splits reordering and phrase transduction into two separate models.",
        "This lets the context-free part handle what it does well, mid-to-long range reordering, and lets the finite-state part handle local phrasal correspondences.",
        "We have further shown that the reordering component can be trained effectively as a latent variable in a discriminative translation model using only conventional parallel training data.",
        "This model holds considerable promise for future improvement.",
        "Not only does it already achieve quite reasonable performance (performing particularly well in Chinese-English, where midrange reordering is often required), but we have only begun to scratch the surface in terms of the kinds of features that can be included to predict reordering, as well as the kinds of reordering forests used.",
        "Furthermore, by reintroducing the concept of a cascade of transducers into the context-free model space, it should be possible to develop new and more effective rescoring mechanisms.",
        "Finally, unlike SCFG and phrase-based models, our model does not impose any distortion limits."
