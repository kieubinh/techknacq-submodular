        "Sentence compression is the task of producing a shorter form of a single given sentence, so that the new form is grammatical and retains the most important information of the original one (Jing, 2000).",
        "Sentence compression is valuable in many applications, for example when displaying texts on small screens (Corston-Oliver, 2001), in subtitle generation (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004), and in text summarization (Madnani et al., 2007).",
        "People use various methods to shorten sentences, including word or phrase removal, using shorter paraphrases, and common sense knowledge.",
        "However, reasonable machine-generated sentence compressions can often be obtained by only removing words.",
        "We use the term extractive to refer to methods that compress sentences by only removing words, as opposed to abstractive methods, where more elaborate transformations are also allowed.",
        "Most of the existing compression methods are extractive (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; Mc-",
        "Donald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Although abstractive methods have also been proposed (Cohn and Lapata, 2008), and they may shed more light on how people compress sentences, they do not always manage to outperform extractive methods (Nomoto, 2009).",
        "Hence, from an engineering perspective, it is still important to investigate how extractive methods can be improved.",
        "In this paper, we present a new extractive sentence compression method that relies on supervised machine learning.",
        "In a first stage, the method generates candidate compressions by removing branches from the source sentence's dependency tree using a Maximum Entropy classifier (Berger et al., 2006).",
        "In a second stage, it chooses the best among the candidate compressions using a Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) model (Chang and Lin, 2001).",
        "We show experimentally that our method compares favorably to a state-of-the-art extractive compression method (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2009), without requiring any manually written rules, unlike other recent work (Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Nomoto, 2009).",
        "In essence, our method is a two-tier over-generate and select (or rerank) approach to sentence compression; similar approaches have been adopted in natural language generation and parsing (Paiva and Evans, 2005; Collins and Koo, 2005)."

        "The best compression of x is the one that maximizes P(x|y) • P(y), and it is found using a noisy channel decoder.",
        "In a second, alternative method Knight and Marcu (2002) use a tree-to-tree transformation algorithm that tries to rewrite directly x to the best y.",
        "This second method uses C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) to learn when to perform tree rewriting actions (e.g., dropping subtrees, combining subtrees) that transform larger trees to smaller trees.",
        "Both methods were trained and tested on data from the Ziff-Davis corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2002), and they achieved very similar grammaticality and meaning preservation scores, with no statistically significant difference.",
        "However, their compression rates (counted in words) were very different: 70.37% for the noisy-channel method and 57.19% for the C4.5-based one.",
        "McDonald (2006) ranks each candidate compression using a function based on the dot product of a vector of weights with a vector of features extracted from the candidate's n-grams, POS tags, and dependency tree.",

        "Manually defined constraints (in effect, rules) that operate on dependency trees indicate which syntactic constituents can be deleted.",
        "This method outperformed McDonald's (2006) in grammaticality and meaning preservation on test sentences from Edinburgh's \"written\" and \"spoken\" corpora.",
        "However, the compression rates of the two systems were difboth on the written corpus).",
        "We compare our method against Cohn and Lapata's T3 system (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2009), a state-of-the-art extractive sentence compression system that learns parse tree transduction operators from a parallel extractive corpus of source-compressed trees.",
        "T3 uses a chart-based decoding algorithm and a Structured Support Vector Machine (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) to learn to select the best compression among those licensed by the operators learnt.",
        "T3 outperformed McDonald's (2006) system in grammaticality and meaning preservation on Edinburgh's \"written\" and \"spoken\" corpora, achieving comparable compression rates have also developed an abstractive version of T3, which was reported to outperform the original, extractive T3 in meaning preservation; there was no statistically significant difference in grammaticality.",
        "Finally, Nomoto (2009) presented a two-stage extractive method.",
        "In the first stage, candidate compressions are generated by chopping the source sentence's dependency tree.",
        "Many ungrammatical compressions are avoided using hand-crafted drop-me-not rules for dependency subtrees.",
        "The candidate compressions are then ranked using a function that takes into account the inverse document frequencies of the words, and their depths in the source dependency tree.",
        "Nomoto's extractive method was reported to outperform Cohn and Lapata's abstractive version of T3 on a corpus collected via RSS feeds.",
        "Our method is similar to Nomoto's, in that it uses two stages, one that chops the source dependency tree generating candidate compressions, and one that ranks the candidates.",

The (s, g) training pairs are used to estimate the propability that a dependency edge e of a dependency tree Ts of an input sentence s is retained or not in the dependency tree Tg of the compressed sentence g. More specifically, we want to estimate the probabilities P(Xilcontext(ei)) for every edge ei of Ts, where Xi is a variable that can take one of the following three values: not-del, for not deleting ei; del_u for deleting ei along with its head; and del J for deleting e along with its modifier.",

        "Cohn and Lapata (2009) have reported very similar scores forT3 on adifferentsplitofthe corpus (F1: 49.48%, CR: 61.09%).",
        "Table 2: Results on 80 test sentences.",

        "Our system outperforms T3 in all evaluation measures.",
        "We used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey tests to check whether the judge ratings differ significantly (p < 0.1); all judge ratings of gold compressions are significantly different from T3's and those of our system; also, our system differs significantly from T3 in grammaticality, but not in meaning preservation and overall score.",
        "We also performed Wilcoxon tests, which showed that the difference in the F1 scores of the two systems is statistically significant (p < 0.1) on the 80 test sentences.",
        "Table 3 shows the F1 scores and the average compression rates for all 291 test sentences.",
        "Both systems have comparable compression rates, but again our system outperforms T3 in F1, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001).",

        "Finally, we computed the Pearson correlation r of the overall (Ov) scores that the judges assigned to the machine-generated compressions with the corresponding F1 scores.",
        "The two measures were found to corellate reliably (r = 0.526).",
        "Similar results have been reported (Clarke and Lapata, 2006) for Edinburgh's \"spoken\" corpus (r = 0.532) and the Ziff-Davis corpus (r = 0.55755)."

        "We presented a new two-stage extractive method for sentence compression.",
        "The first stage generates candidate compressions by removing or not edges from the source sentence's dependency tree; an ME model is used to prune unlikely edge deletion or non-deletions.",
        "The second stage ranks the candidate compressions; we experimented with three ranking models, achieving the best results with an S VR model trained with an objective function that combines token accuracy and a language model.",
        "We showed experimentally, via automatic evaluation and with human judges, that our method compares favorably to a state-of-the-art extractive system.",
        "Unlike other recent approaches, our system uses no hand-crafted rules.",
        "In future work, we plan to support more complex tranformations, instead of only removing words and experiment with different sizes of training data.",
        "The work reported in this paper was carried out in the context of project indigo, where an autonomous robotic guide for museum collections is being developed.",
        "The guide engages the museum's visitors in spoken dialogues, and it describes the exhibits that the visitors select by generating textual descriptions, which are passed on to a speech synthesizer.",
        "The texts are generated from logical facts stored in an ontology (Galanis et al., 2009) and from canned texts; the latter are used when the corresponding information is difficult to encode in symbolic form (e.g., to store short stories about the exhibits).",
        "The descriptions of the exhibits are tailored depending on the type of the visitor (e.g., child vs. adult), and an important tailoring aspect is the generation of shorter or longer descriptions.",
        "The parts of the descriptions that are generated from logical facts can be easily made shorter or longer, by conveying fewer or more facts.",
        "The methods of this paper are used to automatically shorten the parts of the descriptions that are canned texts, instead of requiring multiple (shorter and longer) handwritten versions of the canned texts."
