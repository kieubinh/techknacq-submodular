        "Topic identification is the first stage of the generally accepted three-phase model in automatic text summarization, in which the goal is to identify the most important units in a document, i.e., phrases, sentences, or paragraphs (Hovy and Lin, 1999; Lin, 1999; Sparck-Jones, 1999).",
        "This stage is followed by the topic interpretation and summary generation steps where the identified units are further processed to bring the summary into a coherent, human readable abstract form.",
        "The extractive summarization systems, however, only employ the topic identification stage, and simply output a ranked list of the units according to a compression ratio criterion.",
        "In general, for most systems sentences are the preferred units in this stage, as they are the smallest grammatical units that can express a statement.",
        "Since the sentences in a document are reproduced verbatim in extractive summaries, it is theoretically possible to explore the search space of this problem through an enumeration of all possible extracts for a document.",
        "Such an exploration would not only allow us to see how far we can go with extractive summarization, but we would also be able to judge the difficulty of the problem by looking at the distribution of the evaluation scores for the generated extracts.",
        "Moreover, the high scoring extracts could also be used to train a machine learning algorithm.",
        "However, such an enumeration strategy has an exponential complexity as it requires all possible sentence combinations of a document to be generated, constrained by a given word or sentence length.",
        "Thus the problem quickly becomes impractical as the number of sentences in a document increases and the compression ratio decreases.",
        "In this work, we try to overcome this bottleneck by using a large cluster of computers, and decomposing the task into smaller problems by using the given section boundaries or a linear text segmentation method.",
        "As a result of this exploration, we generate a probability density function (pdf) of the ROUGE score (Lin, 2004) distributions for four different domains, which shows the distribution of the evaluation scores for the generated extracts, and allows us to assess the difficulty of each domain for extractive summarization.",
        "Furthermore, using these pdfs, we introduce a new success measure for extractive summarization systems.",

        "Despite the large amount of work in automatic text summarization, there are only a few studies in the literature that employ an exhaustive search strategy to create extracts, which is mainly due to the prohibitively large search space of the problem.",
        "Furthermore, the research regarding the alignment of abstracts to original documents has shown great variations across domains (Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1997; Marcu, 1999; Jing, 2002; Ceylan and Mihalcea, 2009), which indicates that the extractive summarization techniques are not applicable to all domains at the same level.",
        "In order to automate the process of corpus construction for automatic summarization systems, (Marcu, 1999) used exhaustive search to generate the best Extract from a given (Abstract, Text) tuple, where the best Extract contains a set of clauses from Text that have the highest similarity to the given Abstract.",
        "In addition, (Donaway et al., 2000) used exhaustive search to create all the sentence extracts of length three starting with 15 TREC Documents, in order to judge the performance of several summary evaluation measures suggested in their paper.",
        "Finally, the study most similar to ours was done by (Lin and Hovy, 2003), who used the articles with less than 30 sentences from the DUC 2001 data set to find oracle extracts of 100 and 150 (±5) words.",
        "These extracts were compared against one summary source, selected as the one that gave the highest inter-human agreement.",
        "Although it was concluded that a 10% improvement was possible for extractive summarization systems, which typically score around the lead baseline, there was no report on how difficult it would be to achieve this improvement, which is the main objective of our paper."

        "As mentioned in Section 1, an exhaustive search algorithm requires generating all possible sentence combinations from a document, and evaluating each one individually.",
        "For example, using the values from Table 1, and assuming 20 words per sentence, we find that the search space for the news domain contains approximately (5) x 50 = 10, 068, 800 summaries.",
        "The same calculation method for the scientific domain gives us (g) x 50 = 8.56 x 10summaries.",
        "Obviously the search space gets much bigger for the legal and literary domains due to their larger text size.",
        "In order to be able to cope with such a huge search space, the first thing we did was to modify the ROUGE 1.5.5 Perl script by fixing the parameters to those used in the DUC experiments, and also by modifying the way it handles the input and output to make it suitable for streaming on the cluster.",
        "The resulting script evaluates around 25-30 summaries per second on an Intel 2.33 GHz processor.",
        "Next, we streamed the resulting ROUGE script for each (document, summary) pair on a large cluster of computers running on an Hadoop Map-Reduce framework.",
        "Based on the size of the search space for a (document, summary) pair, the number ofcom-puters allocated in the cluster ranged from just a few to more than one thousand.",
        "Although the combination of a large cluster and a faster ROUGE is enough to handle most of the documents in the news domain in just a few hours, a simple calculation shows that the problem is still impractical for the other domains.",
        "Hence for the scientific, legal, and literary domains, rather than considering each document as a whole, we divide them into sections, and create extracts for each section such that the length of the extract is proportional to the length of the section in the original document.",
        "For the legal and scientific domains, we use the given section boundaries (without considering the subsections for scientific documents).",
        "For the novels, we treat each chapter as a single document (since each chapter has its own summary), which is further divided into sections using a publicly available linear text segmentation algorithm by (Utiyama and Isa-hara, 2001).",
        "In all cases, we let the algorithm pick the number of segments automatically.",
        "To evaluate the sections, we modified ROUGE further so that it applies the length constraint to the extracts only, not to the model summaries.",
        "This is due to the fact that we evaluate the extracts of each section individually against the whole model summary, which is larger than the extract.",
        "This way, we can get an overall ROUGE recall score for a document extract, simply by summing up the recall scores of each section extracts.",
        "The precision score for the entire document can also be found by adding the weighted precision scores for each section, where the weight is proportional to the length of the section in the original document.",
        "In our study, however, we only use recall scores.",
        "Note that, since for the legal, scientific, and literary domains we consider each section of a document independently, we are not performing a true exhaustive search for these domains, but rather solving a suboptimal problem, as we divide the number of words in the model summary to each section proportional to the section's length.",
        "However, we believe that this is a fair assumption, as it has been shown repeatedly in the past that text segmentation helps improving the performance of text summarization systems (yen Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000;",

        "Hence, we start generating sentence combinations in lexicographic order, for r = 1.. .n, and for each combination Eik = Si1, Si2,Sik where k > 1, we generate additional extracts Eik by successfully swapping Sij with Sik for j = 1,k – 1 and checking to see if the above constraints are still satisfied.",

        "This is due to the fact that the leading sentences for these two domains do not indicate any significance, hence the Lead system just behaves like Random.",
        "However for the scientific and newswire domains, the leading sentences do have",
        "Table 3 : ROUGE recall scores of the Lead baseline, TextRank, and Random sentence selector across domains importance so the Lead system consistently outperforms Random.",
        "Furthermore, although TextRank is the best system for the literary, scientific, and legal domains, it gets outperformed by the Lead system on the newswire domain.",
        "This is also an expected result as none of the single-document summarization systems were able to achieve a statistically significant improvement over the lead baseline in the previous Document Understanding Conferences (DUC).",
        "The ROUGE scoring scheme does not tell us how much improvement a system achieved over another, or how far it is from the upper bound.",
        "Since we now have access to the pdf of each domain in our data set, we can find this information simply by calculating the percentile rank of each system using the formula given in Equation 2.",
        "The percentile ranks of all three systems for each domain are shown in Table 4.",
        "Notice how different the gap is between the scores of each system this time, compared to the scores in Table 3.",
        "For example, we see in Table 3 that TextRank on scientific domain has only a 3.51 ROUGE-1 score improvement over a system that randomly selects sentences to include in the extract.",
        "However, Table 4 tells us that this improvement is in fact 57.57%.",
        "From Table 4, we see that both TextRank and the Lead system are in the 99.99% percentile of",
        "Table 4: Percentile rankings of the Lead baseline, TextRank, and Random sentence selector across domains the newswire domain although the systems have 1.20, 1.61, and 1.12 difference in their ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4 scores respectively.",
        "The high percentile for the Lead system explains why it was so hard to improve over these baseline in previous evaluations on newswire data (e.g., see the evaluations from the Document Understanding Conferences).",
        "Furthermore, we see from Table 2 that the upper bounds corresponding to these scores are 65.7, 37.4, and 38.1 respectively, which are well above both the TextRank and the Lead systems.",
        "Therefore, the percentile rankings of the Lead and the TextRank systems for this domain do not seem to give us clues about how the two systems compare to each other, nor about their actual distance from the upper bounds.",
        "There are two reasons for this: First, as we mentioned earlier, most of the summary space consists of easy extracts, which make the distribution long-tailed.",
        "Therefore even though we have quite a bit of systems achieving high scores, their number is negligible compared to the millions of extracts that are clustered around the mean.",
        "Secondly, we need a higher resolution (i.e. larger number of bins) in constructing the pdfs in order to be able to see the difference more clearly between the two systems.",
        "Finally, when comparing two successful systems using percentile ranks, we believe the use of error reduction would be more beneficial.",

        "In this paper, we described a study that explores the search space of extractive summaries across four different domains.",
        "For the news domain we generated all possible extracts of the given documents, and for the literary, scientific, and legal domains we followed a divide-and-conquer approach by chunking the documents into sections, handled each section independently, and combined the resulting scores at the end.",
        "We then used the distributions of the evaluations scores to generate the probability density functions (pdfs) for each domain.",
        "Various statistical properties of these pdfs helped us asses the difficulty of each domain.",
        "Finally, we introduced a new scoring scheme for automatic text summarization systems that can be derived from the pdfs.",
        "The new scheme calculates a percentile rank of the ROUGE-1 recall score of a system, which gives scores in the range [0-100].",
        "This lets us see how far each system is from the upper bound, and thus make a better comparison among the systems.",
        "The new scoring system showed us that while there is a 20.1% gap between the upper bound and the lead baseline for the news domain, closing this gap is difficult, as the percentile rank of the lead baseline system, 99.99%, indicates that the system is already very close to the upper bound.",
        "Furthermore, except for the literary domain, the percentile rank of the TextRank system is also very close to the upperbound.",
        "This result does not suggest that additional improvements cannot be made in these domains, but that making further improvements using only extractive summarization will be considerably difficult.",
        "Moreover, in order to see these future improvements, a higher resolution (i.e. larger number of bins) will be needed when constructing the pdfs.",
        "In all our experiments we used the ROUGE (Lin, 2004) evaluation package and its ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4 recall scores.",
        "We would like to note that since ROUGE performs its evaluations based on the n-gram overlap between the peer and the model summary, it does not take other summary quality metrics such as coherence and cohesion into account.",
        "However, our goal in this paper was to analyze the topic-identification stage only, which concentrates on selecting the right content from the document to include in the summary, and the ROUGE scores were found to correlate well with the human judgments on assessing the content overlap of summaries.",
        "In the future, we would like to apply a similar exhaustive search strategy, but this time with different compression ratios, in order to see the impact of compression ratios on the pdf of each domain.",
        "Furthermore, we would also like to analyze the high scoring extracts found by the exhaustive search, in terms of coherence, position and other features.",
        "Such an analysis would allow us to see whether these extracts exhibit certain properties which could be used in training machine learning systems."
