        "Automatically finding email messages that contain requests for action can provide valuable assistance to users who otherwise struggle to give appropriate attention to the actionable tasks in their inbox.",
        "As a speech act classification task, however, automatically recognising requests in free text is particularly challenging.",
        "The problem is compounded by the fact that typical emails contain extraneous material that makes it difficult to isolate the content that is directed to the recipient of the email message.",
        "In this paper, we report on an email classification system which identifies messages containing requests; we then show how, by segmenting the content of email messages into different functional zones and then considering only content in a small number of message zones when detecting requests, we can improve the accuracy of message-level automated request classification to 83.76%, a relative increase of 15.9%.",
        "This represents an error reduction of 41% compared with the same request classifier deployed without email zoning."

        "The variety of linguistic forms that can be used to express requests, and in particular the frequency with which indirect speech acts are used in email, is a major source of difficulty in determining whether an email message contains one or more requests.",
        "Another significant problem arises from the fact that whether or not a request is directed at the recipient of the email message depends on where in the message the request is found.",
        "Most obviously, if the request is part of a replied-to message that is contained within the current message, then it is perhaps more likely that this request was directed at the sender of the current message.",
        "However, separating out content intended for the recipient from other extraneous content is not as simple as it might appear.",
        "Segmenting email messages into their different functional parts is hampered by the lack of standard syntax used by different email clients to indicate different message parts, and by the ad hoc ways in which people vary the structure and layout of messages.",
        "In this paper, we present our results in classifying messages according to whether or not they contain requests, and then show how a separate classifier that aims to determine the nature of the zones that make up an email message can improve upon these results.",
        "Section 2 contains some context and motivation for this work before we briefly review relevant related work in Section 3.",
        "Then, in Section 4, we describe a first experiment in request classification using data gathered from a manual annotation experiment.",
        "In analysing the errors made by this classifier, we found that a significant number of errors seemed to arise from the inclusion of content in parts of a message (e.g., quoted reply content) that were not authored by the current sender, and thus were not relevant other than as context for interpreting the current message content.",
        "Based on this analysis, we hypothesised that segmenting messages into their different functional parts, which we call email zones, and then using this information to consider only content from certain parts of a message for request classification, would improve request classification performance.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we developed an SVM-based automated email zone classifier configured with graphic, orthographic and lexical features; this is described in more detail in (Lampert et al., 2009).",
        "Section 5 describes how we improve request classification performance using this email zone classifier.",
        "Section 6 summarises the performance of our request classifiers, with and without automated email zoning, along with an analysis of the contribution of lexical features to request classification, discussion of request classification learning curves, and a detailed error analysis that explores the sources of request classification errors.",
        "Finally, in Section 7, we offer pointers to future work and some concluding remarks."

      "text": [
        "Previous research has established that users routinely use email for managing requests in the workplace – e.g., (Mackay, 1988; Ducheneaut and Bel-lotti, 2001).",
        "Such studies have highlighted how managing multiple ongoing tasks through email leads to information overload (Whittaker and Sid-ner, 1996; Bellotti et al., 2003), especially in the face of an ever-increasing volume of email.",
        "The result is that many users have difficulty giving appropriate attention to requests hidden in their email which require action or response.",
        "A particularly lucid summary of the requirements placed on email users comes from work by Murray (1991), whose ethnographic research into the use of electronic messaging at IBM highlighted that:",
        "[Managers] would like to be able to track outstanding promises they have made, promises made to them, requests they've made that have not been met and requests made of them that they have not fulfilled.",
        "This electronic exchange of requests and commitments has previously been identified as a fundamental basis of the way work is delegated and completed within organisations.",
        "Winograd and Flores were among the first to recognise and attempt to exploit this with their Coordinator system (Wino-grad and Flores, 1986).",
        "Their research into organisational communication concluded that \"Organisations exist as networks of directives and commis-sives\".",
        "It is on this basis that our research explores the use of requests (directive speech acts) and commitments (commissive speech acts) in email.",
        "In this paper, we focus on requests; feedback from users of the request and commitment classifier plug-in for Microsoft Outlook that we have under development suggests that, at least within the business context of our current users, requests are the more important of the two phenomena.",
        "Our aim is to create tools that assist email users to identify and manage requests contained in incoming and outgoing email.",
        "We define a request as an utterance that places an obligation on an email recipient to schedule an action; perform (or not perform) an action; or to respond with some speech act.",
        "A simple example might be Please call when you have a chance.",
        "A more complicated request is David will send you the latest version if there have been any updates.",
        "If David (perhaps cc'ed) is a recipient of an email containing this second utterance, the utterance functions as a (conditional) request for him, even though it is addressed as a commitment to a third-party.",
        "In real-world email, requests are frequently expressed in such subtle ways, as we discuss in Section 4.",
        "A distinction can be drawn between message-level identification – i.e., the task of determining whether an email message contains a request – and utterance-level identification – i.e., determining precisely where and how the request is expressed.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of message-level identification, since utterance-level identification is a significantly more problematic task: it is often the case that, while we might agree that a message contains a request or commitment, it is much harder to determine the precise extent of the text that conveys this request (see (Lampert et al., 2008b) for a detailed discussion of some of the issues here)."

      "text": [
        "Our request classification work builds on influential ideas proposed by Winograd and Flores (1986) in taking a language/action perspective and identifying speech acts in email.",
        "While this differs from the approach of most currently-used email systems, which routinely treat the content of email messages as homogeneous bags-of-words, there is a growing body of research applying ideas from Speech Act Theory (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) to analyse and enhance email communication.",
        "Khosravi and Wilks (1999) were among the first to automate message-level request classification in email.",
        "They used cue-phrase based rules to classify three classes of requests: Request-Action, Request-Information and Request-Permission.",
        "Unfortunately, their approach was quite brittle, with the rules being very specific to the computer support domain from which their email data was drawn.",
        "Cohen, Carvalho and Mitchell (2004) developed machine learning-based classifiers for a number of email speech acts.",
        "They performed manual email zoning, but didn't explore the contribution this made to the performance of their various speech act classifiers.",
        "For requests, they report peak F-measure of 0.69 against a majority class baseline accuracy of approximately 66%.",
        "Cohen, Carvalho and Mitchell found that unweighted bigrams were particularly useful features in their experiments, outperforming other features applied.",
        "They later applied a series of text normalisations and n-gram feature selection algorithms to improve performance (Carvalho and Cohen, 2006).",
        "We apply similar normalisations in our work.",
        "While difficult to compare due to the use of a different email corpus that may or may not exclude annotation disagreements, our request classifier performance exceeds that of the enhanced classifier reported in (Carvalho and Cohen, 2006).",
        "Goldstein and Sabin (2006) have also worked on related email classification tasks.",
        "They use verb classes, along with a series of hand-crafted form-and phrase-based features, for classifying what they term email genre, a task which overlaps significantly with email speech act classification.",
        "Their results are difficult to compare since they include a mix of form-based classifications like response with more intent-based classes such as request.",
        "For requests, the results are rather poor, with precision of only 0.43 on a small set of personal mail.",
        "The SmartMail system (Corston-Oliver et al., 2004) is probably the most mature previous work on utterance-level request classification.",
        "SmartMail attempted to automatically extract and reformulate action items from email messages for the purpose of adding them to a user's to-do list.",
        "The system employed a series of deep linguistic features, including phrase structure and semantic features, along with word and part-of-speech n-gram features.",
        "The authors found that word n-grams were highly predictive for their classification task, and that there was little difference in performance when the more expensive deep linguistic features were added.",
        "Based on this insight, our own system does not employ deeper linguistic features.",
        "Unfortunately, the results reported reveal only the aggregate performance across all classes, which involves a mix of both form-based classes (such as signature content address lines and URL lines), and intent-based classes (such as requests and promises).",
        "It is thus very difficult to directly compare the results with our system.",
        "Additionally, the experiments were performed over a large corpus of messages that are not available for use by other researchers.",
        "In contrast, we use messages from the widely-available Enron email corpus (Klimt and Yang, 2004) for our own experiments.",
        "While several of the above systems involve manual processes for removing particular parts of message bodies, none employ a comprehensive, automated approach to email zoning.",
        "We focus on the combination of email zoning and request classification tasks and provide details of how email zoning improves request classification – a task not previously explored.",
        "To do so, we require an automated email zone classifier.",
        "We experimented with using the Jangada system (Carvalho and Cohen, 2004), but found similar shortcomings to those noted by Estival et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "In particular, Jangada did not accurately identify forwarded or reply content in email messages from the email Enron corpus that we use.",
        "We achieved much better performance with our own Zebra zone classifier (Lampert et al., 2009); it is this system that we use for email zoning throughout this paper."

        "Identifying requests requires interpretation of the intent that lies behind the language used.",
        "Given this, it is natural to approach the problem as one of speech act identification.",
        "In Speech Act Theory, speech acts are categories like assertion and request that capture the intentions underlying surface utterances, providing abstractions across the wide variety ofdif-ferent ways in which instances of those categories might be realised in linguistic form.",
        "In this paper we focus on the speech acts that represent requests, where people are placing obligations upon others via actionable content within email messages.",
        "The task of building automated classifiers is difficult since the function of conveying a request does not neatly map to a particular set of language forms; requests often involve what are referred to as indirect speech acts.",
        "While investigating particular surface forms of language is relatively unproblematic, it is widely recognised that \"investigating a collection of forms that represent, for example, a particular speech act leads to the problem of establishing which forms constitute that collection\" (Archer et al., 2008).",
        "Email offers particular challenges as it has been shown to exhibit a higher frequency of indirect speech acts than other media (Hassell and Christensen, 1996).",
        "We approach the problem by gathering judgments from human annotators and using this data to train supervised machine learning algorithms.",
        "Our request classifier works at the message-level, marking emails as requests if they contain one or more request utterances.",
        "As noted earlier, we define a request as an utterance from the email sender that places an obligation on a recipient to schedule an action (e.g., add to a calendar or task list), perform an action, or respond.",
        "Requests may be conditional or unconditional in terms of the obligation they impose on the recipient.",
        "Conditional requests require action only if a stated condition is satisfied.",
        "Previous annotation experiments have shown that conditional requests are an important phenomena and occur frequently in email (Scerri et al., 2008; Lampert et al., 2008a).",
        "Requests may also be phrased as either a direct or indirect speech act.",
        "Although some linguists distinguish between speech acts that require a physical response and those that require a verbal or information response, e.g., (Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975), we follow Searle's approach and make no such distinction.",
        "We thus consider questions requiring an informational response to be requests, since they place an obligation on the recipient to answer.",
        "Additionally, there are some classes of request which have been the source of systematic human disagreement in our previous annotation experiments.",
        "One such class consists of requests for inaction.",
        "Requests for inaction, sometimes called prohibitives (Sadock and Zwicky, 1985), prohibit action or request negated action.",
        "An example is: Please don't let anyone else use the computer in the office.",
        "As they impose an obligation on the sender, we consider requests for inaction to be requests.",
        "Similarly, we consider that meeting announcements (e.g., Today's Prebid Meeting will take place in EB32c2 at 3pm) and requests to read, open or otherwise act on documents attached to email messages (e.g., See attached) are also requests.",
        "Several complex classes of requests are particularly sensitive to the context for their interpretation.",
        "Reported requests are one such class.",
        "Some reported requests, such as Paul asked if you could put together a summary ofyour accomplishments in an email, clearly function as a request.",
        "Others do not impose an obligation on the recipient, e.g., Sorryfor the delay; Paul requested your prize to be sent out late December.",
        "The surrounding context must be used to determine the intent of utterances like reported requests.",
        "Such distinctions are often difficult to automate.",
        "Other complex requests include instructions.",
        "Sometimes instructions are of the kind that one might 'file for later use'.",
        "These tend to not be marked as requests.",
        "Other instructions, such as Your user id and password have been set up.",
        "Please follow the steps below to access the new environment, are intended to be executed more promptly.",
        "Temporal distance between receipt of the instruction and expected action is an important factor to distinguish between requests and non-requests.",
        "Another influencing property is the likelihood of the trigger event that would lead to execution of the described action.",
        "While the example instructions above are likely to be executed, instructions for how to handle suspected anthrax-infected mail are (for most people) unlikely to be actioned.",
        "Further detail and discussion of these and other challenges in defining and interpreting requests in email can be found in (Lampert et al., 2008b).",
        "In particular, that paper includes analysis of a series of complex edge cases that make even human agreement in identifying requests difficult to achieve.",
        "Our request classifier is based around an SVM classifier, implemented using Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005).",
        "Given an email message as input, complete with header information, our binary request classifier predicts the presence or absence of request utterances within the message.",
        "For training our request classifier, we use email from the database dump of the Enron email corpus released by Andrew Fiore and Jeff Heer.",
        "This version of the corpus has been processed to remove duplicate messages and to normalise sender and recipient names, resulting in just over 250,000 email messages.",
        "No attachments are included.",
        "Our request classifier training data is drawn from a collection of 664 messages that were selected at random from the Enron corpus.",
        "Each message was annotated by three annotators, with overall kappa agreement of 0.681.",
        "From the full dataset of 664 messages, we remove all messages where annotators disagreed for training and evaluating our request classifier, in order to mitigate the effects of annotation noise, as discussed in (Beigman and Klebanov, 2009).",
        "The unanimously agreed data set used for training consists of 505 email messages.",
        "The features we use in our request classifier are:",
        "message length in characters and words; number and percentage of capitalised words; number of non alphanumeric characters; whether the subject line contains markers of email replies or forwards (e.g. Re:, Fw: ); the presence of sender or recipient names; the presence of sentences that begin with a modal verb (e.g., might, may, should, would); the presence of sentences that begin with a question word (e.g, who, what, where, when, why, which, how);",
        "• whether the message contains any sentences that end with a question mark; and",
        "• binary word unigram and word bigram features for n-grams that occur at least three times across the training set.",
        "Before generating n-gram features, we normalise the message text as shown in Table 1, in a manner similar to Carvalho and Cohen (2006).",

        "One possible approach would be to build sender-specific profiles that might allow us to deal with forwarded content (and potentially content from other zones) differently for different users, essentially learning to adapt to the different styles of different email users.",
