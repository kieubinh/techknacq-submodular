        "Shallower models exploit matching methods between syntactic/semantic graphs of texts and hypotheses (Haghighi et al., 2005).",
        "The matching step is carried out after the application of some lexical-syntactic rules that are used to transform the text T or the hypothesis H (Bar-Haim et al., 2009) at surface form level.",
        "For all these methods, the effective use of syntactic and semantic information depends on the coverage and the quality of the specific rules.",
        "Lexical-syntactic rules can be automatically extracted from plain corpora (e.g., (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008)) but the quality (also in terms of little noise) and the coverage is low.",
        "In contrast, rules written at the semantic level are more accurate but their automatic design is difficult and so they are typically hand-coded for the specific phenomena.",
        "In this paper, we propose models for effectively using syntactic and semantic information in RTE, without requiring either large automatic rule acquisition or hand-coding.",
        "These models exploit lexical similarities to generalize lexical-syntactic rules automatically derived by supervised learning methods.",
        "In more detail, syntax is encoded in the form of parse trees whereas similarities are defined by means of WordNet simlilarity measures or Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) applied to Wikipedia or to the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "The joint syntactic/semantic model is realized by means of novel tree kernels, which can match subtrees whose leaves are lexically similar (so not just identical).",
        "To assess the benefit of our approach, we carried out comparative experiments with previous work: especially with the method described in (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2009).",
        "This constitutes our strong baseline as, although it can only exploit lexical-syntactic rules, it has achieved top accuracy in all RTE challenges.",
        "The results, across different RTE challenges, show that our approach constantly and significantly improves the baseline model.",
        "Moreover, our approach does not require any adaptation or tuning and uses a computation for the similarity function based on Wikipedia which is faster than the computation of tools based on WordNet or other resources (Basili et al., 2006).",

        "Supervised approaches were experimented in (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2009), where lexical-syntactic rules were derived from examples in terms of complex relational features.",

        "In this section we present the main component of our new kernel, i.e. a lexical similarity derived from different resources.",

        "All WordNet similarities apply to pairs of synonymy sets (synsets) and return a value indicating their semantic relatedness.",

        "Path the measure is equal to the inverse of the shortest path length (path-length) between two synsets e1 and c2 in WordNet pathJength(ci, c2) similarity metric is based on the depth of two given synsets e1 and c2 in the WordNet taxonomy, and the depth of their least common subsumer (les).",

        "For each pair, we have two rows representing a different j parameter of SVM.",
        "An increase of j augments the weight of positive with respect to negative examples and during learning it tunes-up the Recall/Precision rate.",
        "We use two values j = 1 (the default value) and j = 0.9 (selected during a preliminary experiment on a validation set on RTE2).",
        "j = 0.9 was used to minimally increase the Precision, considering that the semantic model tends to improve the Recall.",
        "The results show that:",
        "• WIKI semantics constantly improves the basic kernel (no Semantics) for any datasets or parameter.",
        "• The distributional semantics is almost always better than the WordNet-based one.",
        "of the j parameters, i.e. j = 1, which was not selected by our limited parameter validation.",
        "Finally, the difference between the accuracy of the best WIKI kernels and the No Semantic kernels are statistically significant (p << 0.05).",
        "The previous experiments (Sec.",
        "6.2) show that Wikipedia-based distributional semantics provides an effective similarity to generalize lexico-syntactic rules (features).",

        "In the each column, the different kernels are reported.",
        "For example, the entry in the 4th column and the 2nd row refers to the accuracy of SSTK in combination with WOK, i.e. WOK+SSTK for the RTE2.",
        "We observe that: first WOK produces a very high accuracy in RTE challenges, i.e. 60.62, 66.75 and 60.67 and it is an essential component of RTE systems since its ablation always causes a large accuracy decrease.",
        "This is reasonable as the major source of information to establish entailment between sentences is their word overlap.",
