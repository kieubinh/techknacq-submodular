        "Scientific, technological, engineering and medical (STEM) research is entering the so-called 4th Paradigm of \"data-intensive scientific discovery\", in which advanced data mining and pattern discovery techniques need to be applied to vast datasets in order to drive further discoveries.",
        "A key component of this process is efficient search and exploitation of the huge repository of information that only exists in textual or visual form within the \"bibliome\", which itself continues to grow exponentially.",
        "Today's computationally driven research methods have outgrown traditional methods of searching for scientific data, creating a widespread and unfulfilled need for advanced search and information extraction.",

        "To provide a scalable solution capable of analysing the entire STEM bibliome of over 20m electronic journal and conference papers, we have developed a robust system that can be used with a grid of computers running distributed job management software.",
        "This system has been deployed and tested using a subset of the resources provided by the UK Grid for Particle Physics (Britton et al., 2009), part of the worldwide Grid of around 200000 CPU cores assembled to allow analysis of the petabyte-scale data volumes to be recorded each year by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.",
        "Processing of the FlyBase archive of around 15000 papers required about 8000 hours of CPU time, and has been successfully completed in about 3 days, with up to a few hundred jobs run in parallel.",
        "A distributed spider for collecting open-source PDF documents has also been developed.",
        "This has been run concurrently on over 2000 cores cores, and has been used to retrieve over 350000 subject-specific papers, but these are not considered in the present demo."

      "text": [
        "Camtology's search and extraction engine is the first to integrate a full structural analysis of a scientific paper in PDF format (identifying headings, sections, captions and associated figures, citations and references) with a sentence-by-sentence grammatical analysis of the text and direct visual search over figures.",
        "Combining these capabilities allows us to transform paper search from keyword based paper retrieval, where the end result is a set of putatively relevant PDF files which need to be read, to information extraction based on the ability to interactively specify a rich variety of linguistic patterns which return sentences in specific document locales, and which combine text with image-based constraints; for instance:",
        "\"all sentences in figure captions which contain any gene name as the theme of the action 'express' where the figure is a picture of an eye\"",
        "Camtology allows the user to build up such complex queries quickly though an intuitive process of query refinement.",
        "Figures often convey information crucial to the understanding of the content of a paper and are typically not available to search.",
        "Camtology's search engine integrates text search to the figure and caption level with the ability to re-rank search returns on the basis of visual similarity to a chosen archetype (ambiguities in textual relevance are often resolved by visual appearance).",
        "Figure 1 provides a compact overview of the search functionality supported by our current demonstrator.",
        "Interactively, constructing and running such complex queries takes a few seconds in our intuitive user interface, and allows the user to quickly browse and then aggregate information across the entire collection of papers indexed by the system.",
        "For instance, saving the search result from the example above would yield a computer-readable list of gene names involved in eye development (in fruit flies in our demonstrator) in a second or so.",
        "With existing web portals and keyword based selection of PDF files (for example, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, DeepDyve or PubGet), a query like this would typically take many hours to open and read each one, using cut and paste to extract gene names (and excludes the possibility of ordering results on a visual basis).",
        "The only other alternative would require expensive bespoke adaptation of a text mining system by IT professionals using licensed software (such as Ariadne Genomics, Temis or Linguamatics).",
        "This option is only available to a tiny minority of researchers working for large well-funded corporations."

        "(1999)) that we extend to include images.",

        "We index using fields derived from word-lemmas, grammatical relations and named entities.",
        "At the same time, these complex representations are hidden from the user, who, as a first step, performs a simple keyword search; for example \"express Vnd\".",
        "This returns all sentences that contain the words \"express\" and \"Vnd\" (search is on lemmatised words, so morphological variants of \"express\" will be retrieved).",
        "Different colours represent different types of biological entities and processes (green for a gene), and blue shows the entered search terms in the result sentences.",
