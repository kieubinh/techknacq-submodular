        "Other useful utilities packaged with the toolkit include: a conditional phrase extraction system that builds a phrase table just for a specific dataset; and an implementation of MERT that allows for pluggable evaluation metrics for both training and evaluation with built in support for a variety of metrics (e.g., TERp, BLEU, METEOR)."

        "Progress in machine translation (MT) depends critically on the development of new and better model features that allow translation systems to better identify and construct high quality machine translations.",
        "The popular Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) was designed to allow new features to be defined using factored translation models.",
        "In such models, the individual phrases being translated can be factored into two or more abstract phrases (e.g., lemma, POStags) that can be translated individually and then combined in a seperate generation stage to arrive at the final target translation.",
        "While greatly enriching the space of models that can be used for phrase-based machine translation, Moses only allows features that can be defined at the level of individual words and phrases.",
        "The Phrasal toolkit provides easy-to-use APIs for the development of arbitrary new model features.",
        "It includes an API for extracting feature statistics from aligned bitexts and for incorporating the new features into the decoding model.",
        "The system has already been used to develop a number of innovative new features (Chang et al., 2009; Galley and Manning, 2008; Galley and Manning, 2009; Green et al., 2010) and to build translation systems that have placed well at recent competitive evaluations, achieving second place for Arabic to English translation on the NIST 2009 constrained data track.",
        "We implemented the toolkit in Java because it offers a good balance between performance and developer productivity.",
        "Compared to C++, developers using Java are 30 to 200% faster, produce fewer defects, and correct defects up to 6 times faster (Phipps, 1999).",
        "While Java programs were historically much slower than similar programs written in C or C++, modern Java virtual machines (JVMs) result in Java programs being nearly as fast as C++ programs (Bruckschlegel, 2005).",
        "Java also allows for trivial code portability across different platforms.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we will highlight various useful capabilities, components and modeling features included in the toolkit."

        "Finally, the system trains the feature weights for the decoding model using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) to maximize the system's BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) on the development data given by dev.source.txt and dev.ref.",

        "One of these features is a hierarchical generalization ofthe Moses lexical reordering model.",
        "Instead of just looking at the reordering relationship between individual phrases, the new feature examines the reordering of blocks of adjacent phrases (Galley and Manning, 2008) and improves translation quality when the material being reordered cannot be captured by single phrase.",
        "This hierarchical lexicalized reordering model is used by default in Phrasal and is responsible for the gains shown in Table 2 using the default features.",

        "The target side dependency language model feature captures these long distance relationships by providing a dependency score for the target translations produced by the decoder.",
        "This is done using an efficient quadratic time algorithm that operates within the main decoding loop rather than in a separate reranking stage (Galley and Manning, 2009).",
        "Discriminative Distortion The standard distortion cost model used in phrase-based MT systems such as Moses has two problems.",
        "First, it does not estimate the future cost of known required moves, thus increasing search errors.",
        "Second, the model penalizes distortion linearly, even when appropriate re-orderings are performed.",
        "To address these problems, we used the Phrasal feature API to design a new discriminative distortion model that predicts word movement during translation and that estimates future cost.",
        "These extensions allow us to triple the distortion limit and provide a statistically significant improvement over the baseline (Green et al., 2010).",
