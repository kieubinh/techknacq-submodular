        "The lessons make extensive use of automated speech recognition focused on learner language, and provide learners with feedback on their performance.",
        "Cultural notes describing customs and nonverbal gestures are integrated into the Skill Builder lessons.",
        "Trainees apply their skills in an interactive Arcade Game, where they use spoken commands in the target language to navigate a town grid, and in a Mission Game, where they participate in real-time dialog with simulated local people in order to accomplish their mission."

        "Five TLCTS/OLCTS training courses have been developed so far: Tactical IraqiTM, focusing on Iraqi Arabic, Tactical PashtoTM and Tactical DariTMfocusing on the predominant dialects spoken in Afghanistan, Tactical FrenchTM for Sahel Africa, and Operational IndonesianTM.",
        "TLCTS courses are complete training courses, providing all of the training materials needed to conduct basic training in foreign language and culture.",
        "For example, Tactical IraqiTM includes eighteen Mission Game scenes, ten Arcade Game levels, and sixty-three Skill Builder scenes comprising over 2000 lesson pages.",
        "Additional scenes and lessons are under development.",
        "While the platform imposes no limit on content size, the material developed so far or these systems typically covers 80-120 hours of training.",
        "In-game reference materials, including glossaries, summaries of lesson content, and grammar notes, are available both as part of the training package and as is a support Web site.",
        "Manuals, comprising tutorials and training guidelines, help with initial orientation, training management, and troubleshooting.",
        "The OLCTS versions of these courses include supplementary exercises delivered on handheld devices and on the web, giving trainees a range of platforms for \"train-anywhere\" access.",
        "TLCTS rapidly transitioned into widespread use.",
        "Computer labs for training with TLCTS courses have been established in numerous locations in the USA and around the world.",
        "An estimated twenty-five thousand US military users have trained with the system, and consistently rate it highly.",
        "It has also been made available to service members in allied military forces.",
        "Although the Tactical Language and Culture concept was originally developed under military funding, the approach can be applied quite generally to language and culture learning.",
        "The key is that the courses are task-oriented: the learner has a task to carry out, the Skill Builder helps the learner to acquire the skills necessary to carry out the task, and the Mission Game gives the learner an opportunity to practice the task in compelling simulated settings."

        "They can be called upon to learn some basic communication skills in Dari and apply them in the Mission Game.",
        "This will give participants a firsthand understanding of how each component of OLCTS supports learning, how the components support each other, and how artificial intelligence technology is applied in the learning experience.",
        "Finally, the presenter will demo some of the authoring tools used to create OLCTS content.",
        "The participants will propose modifications or extensions to an existing OLCTS course.",

        "Recognized player speech is posted to a dialog history window that appears near the top of the virtual scene, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The NPC responds using spoken output, creating a realistic and engaging practice environment.",
        "During the dialog, the player may view hints that display key phrases in Dari.",
