        "There is a whole family of problems within the parsing world where error-free results, in the form of perfectly annotated trees, are needed.",
        "Constructing error-free trees is a necessity in many tasks, such as handwritten mathematical expression recognition (Yamamoto et al., 2006), or new gold standard treebank creation (de la Clergerie et al., 2008).",
        "It is a fact that current state-of-the-art syntactic parsers provide trees that, although of excellent quality, still contain errors.",
        "Because of this, the figure of a human corrector who supervises the annotation process is unavoidable in this kind of problems.",
        "When using automatic parsers as a baseline for building perfect syntactic trees, the role of the human annotator is to post-edit the trees and correct the errors.",
        "This manner of operating results in the typical two-step process for error correcting, in which the system first generates the whole output and then",
        "his invaluable help with the CAT-API library.",
        "the user verifies or amends it.",
        "This paradigm is rather inefficient and uncomfortable for the human annotator.",
        "For example, in the creation of the Penn Treebank annotated corpus, a basic two-stage setup was employed: a rudimentary parsing system provided a skeletal syntactic representation, which then was manually corrected by human annotators (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "Other tree annotating tools within the two-step paradigm exist, such as the TreeBanker (Carter, 1997) or the Tree Editor TrEd.",
        "With the objective of reducing the user effort and making this laborious task easier, we devised an Interactive Predictive framework.",
        "Our aim is to put the user into the loop, embedding him as a part of the automatic parser, and allowing him to interact in real time within the system.",
        "In this manner, the system can use the readily available user feedback to make predictions about the parts that have not been validated by the corrector.",
        "In this paper, we present a Web-based demo, which implements the Interactive Predictive Parsing (IPP) framework presented in (Sanchez-Saez et al., 2009).",
        "User feedback (provided by means of keyboard and mouse operations) allows the system to predict new subtrees for unvalidated parts of the annotated sentence, which in turn reduces the human effort and improves annotation efficiency.",
        "As a back-end for our demo, we use a more polished version of the CAT-API library, the Web-based Computer Assisted Tool introduced in (Alabau et al., 2009).",
        "This library allows for a clean application design, in which both the server side (the parsing engine) and the client side (which draws the trees, captures and interprets the user feedback, and requests",
        "(a) System: output tree 1 (b) User: span modification (c) System: output tree 2",
        "Figure 1 : An interaction example on the IPP system.",
        "parsed subtrees to the server) are independent.",
        "One of the features that steam from the CAT-API library is the ability for several annotators to work concurrently on the same problem-set, each in a different client computer sharing the same parsing server.",
        "Interactive predictive methods have been successfully demonstrated to ease the work of transcrip-tors and translators in fields like Handwriting Text Recognition (Romero et al., 2009; Toselli et al., 2008) and Statistical Machine Translation (Ortiz et al., 2010; Vidal et al., 2006).",
        "This new paradigm enables the collaboration between annotators across the globe, granting them a physical and geographical freedom that was inconceivable in the past."

        "A tree t, associated to a string xi\\x\\, is composed by substructures that are usually referred as constituents.",

        "Here follows a general formulation for the non-interactive parsing scenario.",
        "Using a grammatical model G, the parser analyzes the input sentence x = (xi,..., x\\x\\} and produces the parse tree t where pg (tlx) is the probability of parse tree t given the input string x using model G, and T is the set of all possible parse trees for x.",
        "In the interactive predictive scenario, after obtaining the (probably incorrect) best tree tt, the user is able to individually correct any of its constituents c -.",
        "The system reacts to each of the corrections introduced by the human, proposing a new i' that takes into account the aforementioned corrections.",
        "The action of modifying an incorrect constituent (either setting the correct span or the correct label) implicitly validates a subtree that is composed by the partially corrected constituent, all of its ancestor constituents, and all constituents whose end span is lower than the start span of the corrected constituent.",
        "We will name this subtree the validated prefix tree tp.",
        "When the user replaces the constituent with the correct one c'A, the validated prefix tree is:",
        "with d(cBn ) being the depth of constituent cBn.",

        "Given that we are working with context-free grammars, the only subtree that effectively needs to be recalculated is the one starting from the parent of the corrected constituent."
