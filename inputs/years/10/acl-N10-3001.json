        "This subtask of syntactic parsing is explored here for biomedical scientific literature.",
        "In particular, the intuition that sentences containing coordinating conjunctions can often be rephrased as two or more smaller sentences derived from the coordination structure is exploited.",
        "Generating candidate sentences corresponding to different possible coordination structures and comparing them with a language model is employed to help determine which coordination structure is best.",
        "This strategy is used to augment a simple baseline system for coordination resolution which outperforms both the baseline system and a constituent parser on the same task."

        "For this work, coordination resolution (CR) refers to the task of automatically identifying the correct coordination structure of coordinating conjunctions.",
        "In this study the conjunctions and and or and the conjuncts they coordinate are examined.",
        "CR is an important subtask of syntactic parsing in the biomedical domain because many information extraction tasks require correct syntactic structures to perform well, in particular coordination structures.",
        "For example, (Cohen et al., 2009) showed that using a constituent parser trained on biomedical data to provide coordination structures to a high-precision proteinprotein interaction recognition system resulted in a significant performance boost from an overall F-measure of 24.7 to 27.6.",
        "Coordination structures are the source of a disproportionate number of parsing errors for both constituent parsers (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007) and dependency parsers (Nivre and McDonald, 2008).",
        "CR is difficult for a variety of reasons related to the linguistic complexity of the phenomenon.",
        "There are a number of measurable characteristics of coordination structures that support this claim including the following: constituent types of conjuncts, number of words per conjunct, number of conjuncts per conjunction, and the number of conjunctions that are nested inside the conjunct of another conjunction, among others.",
        "Each of these metrics reveal wide variability of coordination structures.",
        "For example, roughly half of all conjuncts consist of one or two words while the other half consist of three or more words including 15% of all conjuncts that have ten or more words.",
        "There is also an increased prevalence of coordinating conjunctions in biomedical literature when compared with newswire text.",
        "Table 1 lists three corpora in the biomedical domain that are annotated with deep syntactic structures; CRAFT (described below), GENIA (Tateisi et al., 2005), and Penn BIOIE (Bies et al., 2005).",
        "The number of coordinating conjunctions they contain as a percentage of the number of total tokens in each corpus are compared with the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "The salient result from this table is that there are 50% more conjunctions in biomedical scientific text than in newswire text.",
        "It is also interesting to note that 15.4% of conjunctions in the biomedical corpora are nested inside a conjunct of another conjunction as compared with 10.9% for newswire.",
        "Table 1: Biomedical corpora that provide coordination structures compared with the Penn Treebank corpus.",
        "The Colorado Richly Annotated Full-Text (CRAFT) Corpus being developed at the University of Colorado Denver was used for this work.",
        "Currently, the corpus consists of 97 full-text open-access scientific articles that have been annotated by the Mouse Genome Institute with concepts from the Gene Ontology and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology.",
        "Thirty-six of the articles have been annotated with deep syntactic structures similar to that of the Penn Treebank corpus described in (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "As this is a work in progress, eight of the articles have been set aside for a final holdout evaluation and results for these articles are not reported here.",
        "In addition to the standard treebank annotation, the NML tag discussed in which marks nominal subconstituents which do not observe the right-branching structure common to many (but not all) noun phrases is annotated.",
        "This is of particular importance for coordinated noun phrases because it provides an unambiguous representation of the correct coordination structure.",
        "The coordination instances in the CRAFT data were converted to simplified coordination structures consisting of conjunctions and their conjuncts using a script that cleanly translates the vast majority of coordination structures."

        "There are two main approaches to CR.",
        "The first approach considers CR as a task in its own right where the solutions are built specifically to perform CR.",
        "Often the task is narrowly defined, e.g. only coordinations of the pattern noun-1 conjunction noun-2 noun-3 are considered, and relies on small training and testing data sets.",
        "Generally, such research efforts do not attempt to compare their results with previous results other than in the broadest and most-qualified way.",
        "Studies by (Chantree et al., 2005), (Nakov and Hearst, 2005), and (Resnik, 1999) are representative examples of such work.",
        "A study by (Shimbo and Hara, 2007) performed CR on sentences from the GENIA corpus containing one instance of the word \"and\" coordinating noun phrases.",
        "They used a sequence alignment algorithm modified for CR drawing on the intuition that conjuncts have similar syntactic constructs.",
        "In each of these studies, promising results were achieved by careful application of their respective approaches.",
        "However, each study is limited in important respects because they narrowly constrain the problem, use limited training data, and make certain unrealistic assumptions in their experimental setup that make general application of their solutions problematic.",
        "For example, in the study by (Shimbo and Hara, 2007) they chose only sentences that have one instance of \"and\" because their algorithm does not handle nested conjunctions.",
        "Additionally, they assume an oracle that provides the system with only sentences that contain coordinated noun phrases.",
        "The work most similar to this study was done by (Hara et al., 2009) in that they define the CR task essentially the same as is done here.",
        "Their approach involves a grammar tailored for coordination structures that is coupled with a sequence alignment algorithm that uses perceptrons for learning feature weights of an edit graph.",
        "The evaluation metric they use is slightly less strict than the metric used for this study in that they require identification of the left boundary of the leftmost conjunct and the right boundary of the rightmost conjunct to be counted correct.",
        "Two other important differences are that the evaluation data comes from the GENIA corpus and they use gold-standard part-of-speech tags for the input data.",
        "Regardless of these relatively minor differences, their performance of 61.5 F-measure far outperforms what is reported below and experiments that are directly comparable to their work will be performed.",

        "For example, (Nilsson et al., 2006) show that for dependency parsing it is useful to transform dependency structures that make conjunctions the head of their conjuncts into structures in which coordination dependencies are chained.",
        "(Charniak and Johnson, 2005) discusses a constituent-based parser that adds two features to the learning model that directly address coordination.",
        "The first measures parallelism in the labels of the conjunct constituents and their children and the second measures the lengths of the conjunct constituents.",

        "• Tyr mutation results in altered diurnal changes.",
        "Using this simple rewrite strategy a candidate sentence for each possible conjunct can be composed.",

        "For example, the candidate conjunct corresponding to the third word is results in increased IOP and the corresponding sentence rewrite is Tyr mutation altered diurnal changes.",
        "The resulting candidate sentences can be compared by calculating a sentence probability using a language model.",
        "Ideally, the candidate sentence corresponding to the correct conjunct boundary will have a higher probability than the other candidate sentences.",

        "This has a large and undesirable (for this task) impact on the probability calculation.",

        "Because the number of candidate conjuncts varies from one sentence to the next (as determined by the token index of the conjunction) it is useful to translate the rank into a percentile.",
        "The rank percentile of the candidate conjuncts will be applied to the task of CR as described below.",
        "However, it is informative to directly evaluate how good the rank percentile scores of the correct conjuncts are.",
        "To build a language model a corpus of more than 80,000 full-text open-access scientific articles were obtained from PubMed Central.",
        "The articles are provided in a simple XML format which was parsed to produce plain text documents using only sections of the articles containing contentful prose (i.e. by excluding sections such as e.g. acknowledgments and references.)",
        "The plain text documents were automatically sentence segmented, tokenized, and part-of-speech tagged resulting in nearly 13 million sentences and over 250 million tagged words.",
        "A language model was then built using this data with the",
        "SRILM toolkit described in (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "Default options were used for creating the language model except that the order of the model was set to four and the \"-tagged\" option was used.",
        "Thus, a 4-gram model with Good-Turing discounting and Katz backoff for smoothing was built.",
        "For each token to the left of a conjunction a candidate conjunct/sentence pair is derived, its probability calculated, and a rank percentile score is assigned to it relative to the other candidates.",
        "Because multiple conjuncts can appear on the left-hand-side of the conjunction, the left border of the leftmost conjunct is considered here.",
        "The same is done for tokens",
        "Figure 1: The first column can be read as \"The correct conjunct candidate had the highest rank percentile 32.1% of the time.\"",
        "The second column can be read as \"The correct conjunct candidate had a rank percentile of 90% or greater 17.6% of the time.\"",

        "Similarly, at the conjunction level a true positive requires that a coordination structure generated by the system has the same number of conjuncts each with extents exactly the same as the corresponding conjunct in the gold-standard coordination structure.",
        "Where 10-fold cross-validation is performed, training is performed on roughly 90% of the data and testing on the remaining 10% with the results micro-averaged.",

        "on the right-hand-side of the conjunction.",
        "Figure 1 shows a histogram of the rank percentile scores for the correct left conjunct.",
        "The height of the bars correspond to the percentage of the total number of conjunctions in which the correct candidate was ranked within the percentile range.",
        "Thus, the columns add to one and generalizations can be made by adding the columns together.",
        "For example, 66.7% of the conjunctions (by adding the first three columns) fall above the eightieth percentile.",
        "The overall average rank percentage for all of the left-hand-side conjuncts was 81.1%.",
        "The median number of candidates on the left-hand-side is 17 (i.e. the median token index of the conjunction is 17).",
        "Similar results were obtained for the right-hand-side data but were withheld for space considerations.",
        "The overall average rank percentage for right-hand-side conjuncts was 82.2%.",
        "This slightly better result is likely due to the smaller median number of candidates on the right-hand-side of 12 (i.e. the median token index of the conjunction is 12 from the end of the sentence.)",
