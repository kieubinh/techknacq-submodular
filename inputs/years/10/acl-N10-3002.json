        "In the context of automated metrics for evaluation of summary quality, content evaluations have been presented through the last decade and continue to evolve, however a careful examination of readability aspects of summary quality has not been as exhaustive.",
        "In this paper we explore alternative evaluation metrics for 'grammaticality' and 'coherence and structure' that are able to strongly correlate with manual ratings.",
        "Our results establish that our methods are able to perform pairwise ranking of summaries based on grammaticality, as strongly as ROUGE is able to distinguish for content evaluations.",
        "We observed that none of the five aspects of readability are independent of each other, and hence by addressing the individual criterion of evaluation we aim to achieve automated appreciation of readability of summaries."

        "Summarization evaluations help in the creation of reusable resources and infrastructure; it sets up the stage for comparison and replication of results by introducing an element of competition to produce better results (Hirschman and Mani, 2001).",
        "Readability or Fluency of a summary is categorically measured based on a set of linguistic quality questions that manual assessors answer for each summary.",
        "The linguistic quality markers are: grammaticality, Non-Redundancy, Referential Clarity, Focus and Structure and Coherence.",
        "Hence readability assessment is a manual method where expert assessors give a rating for each summary on the Likert Scale for each of the linguistic quality markers.",
        "Manual evaluation being time-consuming and expensive doesn't help system developers – who appreciate fast, reliable and most importantly automated evaluation metric.",
        "So despite having a sound manual evaluation methodology for readability, there is an need for reliable automatic metrics.",
        "All the early approaches like Flesch Reading Ease (Flesch, 1948) were developed for general texts and none of these techniques have tried to characterize themselves as approximations to grammaticality or structure or coherence.",
        "In assessing readability of summaries, there hasn't been much of dedicated analysis with text summaries, except in (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) where local coherence was modeled for text summaries and in (Vadlapudi and Katragadda, 2010) where grammaticality of text summaries were explored.",
        "In a marginally related work in Natural Language Generation, (Mutton et al., 2007) addresses sentence level fluency regardless of content, while recent work in (Chae and Nenkova, 2009) gives a systematic study on how syntactic features were able to distinguish machine generated translations from human translations.",

        "Grammaticality of summaries, in this paper, is defined based on the grammaticality of its sentences, since it is more a sentence level syntactic property.",
        "A sentence can either be grammatically correct or grammatically incorrect.",
        "The problem of grammatical incorrectness should not occur in summaries being evaluated because they are generated mostly by extract based summarization systems.",
        "But as the distribution of grammaticality scores in Table 1 shows, there are a lot of summaries that obtain very low scores.",
        "Hence, We model the problem of grammaticality as \"how suitable or acceptable are the sentence structures to be a part ofa summary?",
        "\".",
        "The acceptance or non acceptance of sentence structures varies across reviewers because of various factors like usage, style and dialects.",
        "Hence, we define a degree to which a sentence structure is acceptable to the reviewers, this is called the degree of acceptance throughout this paper.",
        "In this paper, the degree ofacceptance of sentence structures is estimated using language models trained on a corpus of human written summaries.",
        "Considering the sentence structures in reference summaries as the best accepted ones (with highest degree ofacceptance), we estimate the degree of acceptance of sentences in system generated summaries by quantifying the amount of similarity/digression from the references using the language models.",
        "The structure of the sentences can be represented by sequences of parts-of-speech (POS) tags and chunk tags.",
        "Our previous observations (Vadlapudi and Katragadda, 2010) show that the tagset size plays an important role in determining the degree ofacceptance.",
        "In this paper, we combine the two features of a sentence – the POS-tag sequence and chunk-tag sequence – to generate the POS-Chunk-tag training corpus.",
        "Some aspects of grammatical structure are well identifiable at the level of POS tags, while some other aspects (such as distinguishing between appos-itives and lists for eg.)",
        "need the power of chunk tags, the combination of these two tag-sequences provides the power of both.",
        "Hence, the following approaches use probabilistic models, learned on POS tag corpus and POSChunk tag corpus, in 3 different ways to determine the grammaticality of a sentence.",
        "As described in our previous work, the Ngram model estimates the probability of a sentence to be grammatically acceptable with respect to the corpus using language models.",
        "Sentences constructed using frequent grammar rules would have higher probability and are said to have a well accepted sentence structure.",
        "The grammaticality of a summary is computed as",
        "where G(Sum) is grammaticality score of a summary Sum and G(Si) is grammaticality of sentence Si which is estimated by the probability (P(Seqi)) of its POS-tag sequence (Seqi).",
        "P(Kj) is probability of POS-tag trigram Kj which is i,_2tj-itj and Vi,, tj G POS tags.",
        "The additional tags t_1, to and tn+1 are the beginning-of-sequence and end-of-sequence markers.",
        "The average AVG of the grammaticality scores of sentences P(Seqi) in a summary gives the final grammaticality score of the summary.",
        "In the prior work, arithmetic mean was used as the averaging technique, which performs consistently well.",
        "However, here two other averaging techniques namely geometric mean and harmonie mean are experimented and based on our experiments, we found geometrie mean performing better than the other two averaging techniques.",
        "All the results reported in this paper are based on geometrie mean.",
        "The above procedure estimates grammaticality of sentence using its POS tags and we call this run 'Ngram (POS)'.",
        "A similar procedure is followed to estimate grammaticality using its POS-Chunk tags (language models trained on POS-chunk-tag training corpus).",

        "Grammaticality of summaries is manually scored on a scale of 1 to 5, which means the summaries are classified into 5 classes.",
        "We assume that each sentence of the summary is also rated on a similar scale which cumulatively decides to which class the summary must belong.",
        "In our approach, sentences are classified into 5 classes on the basis of frequencies of underlying grammar rules (trigram) by defining class boundaries on frequencies.",
        "Hence, the cumulative score of the rules estimate the score of grammaticality of a sentence and inturn the summary.",
        "Similar to (Vadlapudi and Katragadda, 2010), tri-grams are classified into 5 classes Ci, C2, C3, C4and C5 and each class is assigned a score on a similar scale (Vjscore(Cj) = j) and class boundaries are estimated using the frequencies of trigrams in the training corpus.",
        "The most frequent trigram, for example, would fall into class C5.",
        "POS-Class sequences are generated from POS-tag sequences using class boundaries as shown in Figure 1.",
        "This is the first level of classification.",
        "Like the first level of classification, a series of classifications are performed upto 'k' levels.",
        "At each level we apply the scoring method described below to evaluate the grammaticality of summaries.",
        "We observed that from 3rd level onwards the structural dissimilarity disappears and the ability to distinguish different structures is lost.",
        "Hence, we report on the second level of classification, that captures the grammatical acceptability of summaries very well, and Figure 1 explains the two level classification.",
        "AVG is the average of H(Cwi), where wl, w2, ... wn are class trigrams, Cwi is the class into which class trigram wi falls into and H(Cwi) is score assigned to the class Cwi.",
        "The AVG is computed using geometric mean and this run is referred as Class (POS 2 level)' in the results.",
        "Similar to above approach, the grammaticality of a sentence can also be estimated using POSChunk tag sequence and POS-Chunk Class training data, and the corresponding run is referred as Class (POS-Chunk 2 level)'.",
        "As would be later seen in Table 2, the Ngram (POS) and Class (POS 2 level) runs are able to distinguish various systems based on grammaticality.",
        "We also note that these runs are able to very finely distinguish the degree of grammaticality at summary level.",
        "This is a very positive result, one that shows the applicability of applying these methods to any test summaries in this genre.",
        "To fully utilize these methods we combine the two methods by a linear combination of their scores to form a hybrid model'.",
        "As seen with earlier approaches, both the POS-tag sequences and POS-Chunk-tag sequences could be used to estimate the grammaticality of a sentence, and hence the summary.",
