        "In this paper, firstly, in section 4 we create a gold standard to train the classifier, by improvising upon the existing annotations in our meeting corpus.",
        "Then in section 5 we present actual numbers which display a very skewed class distribution to learn for the binary classifier.",
        "This skewness is attributed to the less number of actual extract-worthy and important DAs (positive examples) compared to ordinary chit-chat, backchannel noises etc (negative examples) spoken during the course of the meeting.",
        "We tackle this data skewness with a novel resampling approach which reselects the data set to create a more comparable class distribution between these postive and negative instances.",

        "By this definition, weighted recall can have a maximum score of 1 since it is a fraction of the total links for the entire summary.",
        "Also, there is no theoretical maximum for weighted precision as annotators were allowed to create any number of links for a single DA.",
        "Both weighted precision and recall share the same numerator: num = Sd Ld/N where Ld is the number of links for a DA d in the extractive summary, and N is the number of annotators.",

        "Therefore the high scoring DAs are in a way indicative of quintessential topics and agenda points of the meeting.",
