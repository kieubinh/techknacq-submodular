        "An interesting task in temporal information processing is how to identify a temporal relation between a pair of temporal entities such as events (EVENT) and time expressions (TIMEX) in a narrative.",
        "After the publication of TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b) annotated in TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a), supervised learning techniques have been tested in the temporal relation identification task with different types of temporal entity pairs (Chambers et al., 2007; Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Verhagen et al., 2007).",
        "There are three issues in applying supervised machine learning methods to this task.",
        "The first issue is that a temporal entity pair that is defined as a directed temporal link (TLINK) in TimeML should be classified into a relation among fourteen relations.",
        "The second issue is that the number of TLINKs is relatively small in spite of the fourteen targets.",
        "The third issue is skewed distributions of the relations.",
        "Without the solutions of the issues, it is impossible to achieve good performance in temporal relation identification through machine learning techniques.",
        "Several solutions have been suggested such as increased number of TLINKs with a transitivity closure algorithm (Mani et al., 2007; Chambers et al., 2007) and decreased target relations into six (Mani et al., 2006; Chambers et al., 2007; Tatu and Srikanth, 2008) or three (Verhagen et al., 2007).",
        "An issue of the reduced-relation method is how to recover original relations.",
        "A module for the recovery can cause performance degeneration and seems intuitively inappropriate.",
        "In this paper, a new reduced-relation method is presented.",
        "The method uses endpoints of temporal entities.",
        "A TimeML relation can be represented into four endpoint pairs with three relations: before, equal, and after.",
        "This method requires four relation identification classifiers among endpoints for a TLINK and each classifier has only three target relations instead of fourteen.",
        "The four classified relations need to be combined in order to restore an interval-based relation.",
        "In this study, the performance of the proposed method will be evaluated in identifying TLINK relations between temporal entities empirically.",
        "Firstly, related studies are described in section 2.",
        "Secondly, the identification of four pointwise relations is described.",
        "Thirdly, methods for the combination of pointwise relations are explained.",

        "(2006) used closure algorithm to increase training data size and merged inverse relations into six main relations.",
        "Their study applied the methods to classify relations of all TLINKs and showed the benefit of the methods in temporal relation identification.",

        "(2007) reported 67.0% accuracy on the relation identification task among EVENT-EVENT (EE) TLINKs using the merged relations.",
        "And, the accuracy is the best performance with EE TLINKs.",
        "The merging method assumes that target relations of TLINKs is already known.",
        "When a TLINK relation from an anchor to a target is AFTER, it can be changed into BEFORE by conversing the anchor and the target each other.",
        "When unknown instance is given, the merging process is impossible.",
        "When six merged relations were used as target relations, we assumes the conversion is already done.",
        "And the assumption is inappropriate.",
        "TempEval07 (Verhagen et al., 2007) integrated 14 TLINK relations into three: before, after, and overlap.",
        "overlap is an extended relation that covers 12 relations except BEFORE and AFTER.",
        "This approach has a burden to recover 12 relations from the extensive one.",
        "In this study, a TLINK is decomposed into four pairs of endpoint links in the step of applying machine learning approaches.",
        "Then, four classified endpoint relations are combined into a TimeML relation.",
        "Allen (1983) showed a relative order between intervals can be decomposed into relative orders of four endpoint pairs.",
        "In TimeML, temporal entities, EVENT and TIMEX, are intervals.",
        "An interval has a pair of endpoints: start and end.",
        "A relation between two intervals can be represented into relations of four pairs of starts and ends as in Table 2.",
        "A relative order between endpoints can be represented with three relations: before, equal, and after.",
