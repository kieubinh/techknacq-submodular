        "Each language has its typical verbal form, and they share mood, voice, aspect and person qualities (Comrie, 1993).",

        "The hybrid Stat-XFER system uses a transfer-based method and statistical paradigm for the translation process and it is composed of the following main components: the Bilingual Phrasal Lexicon, Morphology, Transfer Engine and the Decoder.",
        "Given one sentence in the source language, this input will go through all those components until the system outputs a set of pairs mapping candidate translations to probabilities.",
        "The Stat-XFER framework is shown in the figure 1 below.",
        "Morphology",
        "Bilingual Phrasal Lexicon.",
        "The Portuguese-English lexicon is made up of a word-level lexicon.",
        "The lexicon was automatically extracted from the EUROPARL corpus and in order to adjust it to this system's needs, this lexicon has been modified with new entries and deleted of the repeated entries.",
        "Morphology.",
        "The system uses the Jspell morphology analyzer, which was developed by the Minho University in Portugal.",
        "Jspell produces all possible labels for a lexical entry in the input and it provides a stem for each word with a different label.",
        "Upon each sentence in the lexicon input, the Morphology Analyzer examines each lexical entry and performs its analysis.",
        "Transfer Engine.",
        "This component was developed by the AVENUE group from Carnegie Mellon University (Probst et al., 2002, Lavie et al., 2003, Lavie et al., 2004, Lavie 2008) and applies the lexical transfer rules specified by the Lexicon component, i.e. the lexical entries in Portuguese are substituted by their translations in English.",
        "This component also applies the transfer grammar rules from Portuguese into English producing constituents translated into the English structure.",
        "When the transfer stage has completed, we have a chart (hypergraph) in which each key contains an n-best beam for each non-terminal type of each source span.",
        "Each entry in the beam has a unification feature structure and log-linear feature scores associated with it.",
        "Before decoding, the chart is turned into a lattice by removing hierarchical structure and respecting only the target-side ordering of the constituents produced by the grammar.",
        "The unification features and unification constraints on each rule can remove ungrammatical hypotheses from the search space.",
        "Decoder.",
        "For each sentence, the Decoder does a monotonic left-to-right decoding on the Translation Lattice with no reordering beyond what the grammar produced.",
        "For each source span, the decoder keeps the n most likely hypotheses."

        "According to Ma and McKeown (2009), in translations the main verb of a sentence is the most important element for the sentence comprehension.",
        "In Machine Translation, the goal is to produce understandable translations.",
        "Therefore, we started our experiment by adjusting the verbal tense rules between the Brazilian Portuguese and English.",
        "Natural languages do not share the same properties concerning verbs.",
        "The pair of languages Portuguese and English for example, has different systems of modality.",
        "According to Palmer (1986), the English language has its system of modal verbs defined by can, could, will, would, may, must, might, ought, shall, should, need and dare.",
        "However, the Portuguese language has a system of mood consisting of indicative and subjunctive moods (Bechara, 2002).",
        "Moreover, the Brazilian Portuguese and the English languages present morphological differences between verbal forms.",
        "For example, many verbs in English have the following form: Base + {-s form (3rd person singular present)/PAST/-ing/-ed} (Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973).",
        "Nonetheless, in Brazilian Portuguese the verbs present the following form in most case: Base + thematic vowel + number/person agreement + tense/mood agreement.",
        "This verbal form is present in every tense in the indicative and subjunctive moods.",
        "In order not to lose any information concerning the distinction between verbal tenses from Brazilian Portuguese to English, we built a corpus with sentences in all verbal tenses in Portuguese (Be-chara, 2002) and manually mapped them into English.",
        "Each Portuguese verbal form was mapped into English in all their conceivable translations.",
        "This corpus is a sentence-level parallel corpus with original sentences in the Portuguese language and their respective translations.",
        "The main goal of building this corpus was to verify all possible translations between Portuguese and English verbal tenses.",
        "Since this was a pilot experiment, we were interested in verifying if our changes improved the system.",
        "This pilot experiment consists of translating a corpus containing all three verb conjugation classes in Portuguese: 1) First conjugation class: verbs ending in -AR; 2) Second conjugation class:",
        "verbs which end in -ER; and 3) Third Conjugation class: verbs ending in -IR, respecting each tense, mood and number in Stat-XFER system and then evaluating their results.",
        "To construct the three corpora - one corpus for each conjugation class - we extracted the 100 most frequent Portuguese verbs appearing in Google's search engine in all three conjugation classes in Portuguese.",
        "The search for the most frequent Portuguese verbs was done using a tool developed in Python and followed the following constrains: a) a result had to be an infinitive verb; b) had to be in the Portuguese language and c) had to be found in a Brazilian Web page.",
        "From the one hundred most frequent Portuguese verbs in each conjugation class we manually built three corpora of all three verb conjugation classes in Portuguese, respecting each tense, mood, number, and person, and then a human translator mapped them into English through manual translation.",
        "Each corpus contains no more than three examples of each most frequent verb selected, resulting in 163 sentences.",
        "Once all verbal tenses were translated into English, we applied these three corpora to the Stat-XFER system and evaluated all resulting translations using Meteor.",
        "Meteor is a metric for the evaluation of Machine Translation output.",
        "The metric is based on the harmonic mean of unigram precision and recall (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).",
        "The Meteor scores are in a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means the translation is the farthest from the reference translation and 1 means the translation is most similar to a human translation.",
        "After the evaluation, we initiated the improvement of the grammar module with new syntactic transfer rules in order to deal with the problems presented by the differences between the verbal tenses.",
        "The transfer rules were manually developed and encoded how constituent structures in the source language transfer to the target language.",
        "In the beginning of our research, the system had 113 such rules in its grammar, but with some modifications the system now has 152 rules concerning the mapping from Portuguese to English.",
        "We add a rule for each tense in each conjugation class.",
        "Few rules address more than one tense.",
        "A Stat-XFER syntactic rule example is shown below.",
        "The first line is the name of rule, in this case VP, 2.",
        "The second and third lines are examples of transference between both languages, which means a source language (SL) will be encoded into a respective target language (TL).",
        "The forth line indicates that a simple verb in SL will be translated as a simple verb in TL as well.",
        "The condition of application of that rules is between parenthesis, shown in the fifth and twelfth lines.",
        "In line six, inside these parentheses, it is indicated that the first element of the verbal phrase from source language, i.e. X1, will be converted as the first element of the verbal phrase in the target language, i.e. 71.",
        "Line seven says that X1 must be in the present tense and line eight says it must not be a subjunctive mood.",
        "Line nine states that Y1 must be in the present tense.",
        "Lines ten and eleven indicate that X1 will receive the number and person from an element in the source language, X0 in this case.",
        "Another significant modification concerns the Bilingual phrasal lexicon.",
        "In the beginning of our research, the system had 56.665 entries with their respective translations.",
        "However, many of these lexical items presented improper translations, repetitions and lack of correct meanings.",
        "To help improve the development of our system some modifications in this lexicon were required.",
        "This word level lexicon is in constant modification with the inclusion of missing lexicon items, cleaning of repeated items and correction of the inappropriate ones.",
        "The Stat-XFER word-level lexicon has now 57.315 entries with their respective translations.",
        "After the insertion of new syntactic rules, adjustment of the existing (old) rules and the modifications in the lexicon, we translated the same three corpora again to evaluate the performance one more time.",

        "An interesting observation is that in the corpus manually built for the experiment, the score of the first conjugation decreased (Table 1), while we expected that it should increase.",
        "We were surprised by this phenomenon and started investigating its causes.",
        "After preliminary studies, we now believe that this is due to a greater number of possible meanings that verbs from the first conjugation in Portuguese can assume, thus producing several translations in English, with smaller a correlation with respective human reference translations.",
        "According to Williams (1962), the endings of infinitive verbs in Portuguese are derived from Classical Latin.",
        "The first conjugation in Brazilian Portuguese also contains verbs borrowed from different languages, e.g. the English verb to delete has its correspondent deletar in Portuguese.",
        "Moreover, the creation of new verbs in Portuguese is always included in the first conjugation, sharing a common set of characteristic of verbs ended in -AR.",

        "In particular, improving the transfer rules in other aspects beyond the Verbal tense is a promising area of future research.",
