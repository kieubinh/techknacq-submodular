        "Data-driven (statistical) approaches have been playing an increasingly prominent role in parsing since the 1990s.",
        "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in dependency-based as opposed to constituency-based approaches to syntactic parsing, with application to a wide range of research areas and different languages.",
        "Graph-based and transition-based methods are the two dominant data-driven approaches to dependency parsing.",
        "In a graph-based model, it defines a space of candidate dependency trees for a given sentence.",
        "Each candidate tree is scored via a local or global scoring function.",
        "The parser (usually uses dynamic programming) outputs the highest-scored tree.",
        "In contrast, in a transition-based model, it defines a transition system for mapping a sentence to its dependency tree.",
        "It induces a model for predicting the next state transition, given the transition history.",
        "Given the induced model, the output parse tree is built deterministically upon the construction of the optimal transition sequence.",
        "Both Graph-based and transition-based approaches have been used to achieve state-of-the-art dependency parsing results for a wide range of languages.",
        "Some researchers have used the combination of the two models and it shows the performance of the combined model is significantly better than the individual models.",
        "Another recent trend is to apply online training to shift-reduce parsing in the transition-based models.",
        "In this tutorial, we first introduce the two mainstream data-driven dependency parsing models---graph-based and transition-based models.",
        "After comparing the differences between them, we show how these two models can be combined in various ways to achieve better results."
