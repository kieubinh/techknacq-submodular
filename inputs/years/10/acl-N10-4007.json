        "Brief Description",
        "Over the last two decades, computational linguistics has been revolutionized as a result of three closely related developments, two empirical and one theoretical: increases in computing power, the new availability of large linguistic datasets, and a paradigm shift toward the view that language processing by computers is best approached through the tools of statistical inference.",
        "During roughly the same time frame, there have been similar theoretical developments in cognitive psychology towards a view of major aspects of human cognition as instances of rational statistical inference.",
        "Developments in these two fields have set the stage for renewed interest in computational approaches to human language processing.",
        "In this tutorial, we briefly survey some of the key theoretical issues at the forefront of this interdisciplinary field today, and show how modeling techniques from NLP are being employed, extended, and coupled with experimental techniques from psycholinguistics to further our understanding of real-time human language use."
