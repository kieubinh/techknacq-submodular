        "The NLP and ML communities are rising to grander, larger-scale challenges such as Machine Reading, Learning by Reading, and Learning to Read, challenges requiring deeper and more integrated natural language understanding capabilities.",
        "The task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) requires automated systems to identify when two spans of text share a common meaning -for example, that \"Alphaville Inc.'s attempted acquisition of Bauhaus led to a jump in both companies' stock prices'' entails \"Bauahaus' stock rose'', but not \"Alphaville acquired Bauhaus''.",
        "This general capability would be a solid proxy for Natural Language Understanding, and has direct relevance to the grand challenges named above.",
        "Moreover, it could be used to improve performance in a large range of Natural Language Processing tasks such as Information Extraction, Question Answering, Exhaustive Search, Machine Translation and many others.",
        "The operational definition of Textual Entailment used by researchers in the field avoids commitment to any specific knowledge representation, inference method, or learning approach, thus encouraging application of a wide range of techniques to the problem.",
        "Techniques developed for RTE have now been successfully applied in the domains of Question Answering, Relation Extraction, and Machine translation, and RTE systems continue to improve their performance even as the corpora on which they are evaluated (provided first by PASCAL, and now by NIST TAC) have become progressively more challenging.",
        "Over the sequence of RTE challenges from PASCAL and NIST TAC, the more successful systems seem to have converged in their overall approach.",
        "The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment to researchers from other areas of NLP.",
        "We will identify and analyze common inference and learning approaches from a range of the more successful RTE systems, and investigate the role of knowledge resources.",
        "We will examine successful applications of RTE techniques to Question Answering and Machine Translation, and identify key research challenges that must be overcome to continue improving RTE systems.",
