        "Since it is costly and difficult to build human-annotated treebanks, a lot of works have also been devoted to the utilization of unannotated text.",
        "For example, the unsupervised dependency parsing (Klein and Manning, 2004) which is totally based on unannotated data, and the semisupervised dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008) which is based on both annotated and unannotated data.",
        "Considering the higher complexity and lower performance in unsupervised parsing, and the need of reliable priori knowledge in semisupervised parsing, it is a promising strategy to project the dependency structures from a resource-rich language to a resource-scarce one across a bilingual corpus (Hwa et al., 2002; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang et al., 2009).",
        "For dependency projection, the relationship between words in the parsed sentences can be simply projected across the word alignment to words in the unparsed sentences, according to the DCA assumption (Hwa et al., 2005).",
        "Such a projection procedure suffers much from the word alignment errors and syntactic isomerism between languages, which usually lead to relationship projection conflict and incomplete projected dependency structures.",
        "To tackle this problem, Hwa et al.",
        "(2005) use some filtering rules to reduce noise, and some hand-designed rules to handle language heterogeneity.",

        "Jiang and Liu (2009) resort to a dynamic programming procedure to search for a completed projected tree.",
        "However, these strategies are all confined to the same category that dependency projection must produce completed projected trees.",
        "Because ofthe free translation, the syntactic isomerism between languages and word alignment errors, it would be strained to completely project the dependency structure from one language to another.",
        "We propose an effective method for dependency projection, which does not have to produce complete projected trees.",
        "Given a word-aligned bilingual corpus with source language sentences parsed, the dependency relationships of the word pairs in the source language are projected to the word pairs of the target language.",
        "A dependency relationship is a boolean value that represents whether this word pair forms a dependency edge.",
        "Thus a set of classification instances are obtained.",
        "Meanwhile, we propose an intuitionistic model for dependency parsing, which uses a classifier to determine whether a pair of words form a dependency edge.",
        "The classifier can then be trained on the projected classification instance set, so as to build a projected dependency parser without the need of complete projected trees.",

        "The classifier trained on the Chinese projected classification instances achieves a precision of 58.59% on the CTB standard test set.",
        "More importantly, when this classifier is integrated into a 2nd-ordered maximum spanning tree (MST) dependency parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) in a weighted average manner, significant improvement is obtained over the MST baselines.",

        "Especially for the parser trained on the smaller CTB 1.0, more than 1 points precision increment is obtained.",
