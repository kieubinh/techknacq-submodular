        "Parsing bilingual texts (bitexts) is crucial for training machine translation systems that rely on syntactic structures on either the source side or the target side, or the both (Ding and Palmer, 2005; Nakazawa et al., 2006).",
        "Bitexts could provide more information, which is useful in parsing, than a usual monolingual texts that can be called \"bilingual constraints\", and we expect to obtain more accurate parsing results that can be effectively used in the training of MT systems.",
        "With this motivation, there are several studies aiming at highly accurate bitext parsing (Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Huang et al., 2009).",
        "This paper proposes a dependency parsing method, which uses the bilingual constraints that we call bilingual subtree constraints and statistics concerning the constraints estimated from large unlabeled monolingual corpora.",
        "Basically, a (candidate) dependency subtree in a source-language sentence is mapped to a subtree in the corresponding target-language sentence by using word alignment and mapping rules that are automatically learned.",
        "The target subtree is verified by checking the subtree list that is collected from unla-beled sentences in the target language parsed by a usual monolingual parser.",
        "The result is used as additional features for the source side dependency parser.",
        "In this paper, our task is to improve the source side parser with the help of the translations on the target side.",
        "Many researchers have investigated the use of bilingual constraints for parsing (Burkett and Klein, 2008; Zhao et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2009).",
        "For example, Burkett and Klein (2008) show that parsing with joint models on bitexts improves performance on either or both sides.",
        "However, their methods require that the training data have tree structures on both sides, which are hard to obtain.",
        "Our method only requires dependency annotation on the source side and is much simpler and faster.",
        "Huang et al.",
        "(2009) proposes a method, bilingual-constrained monolingual parsing, in which a source-language parser is extended to use the reordering of words between two sides' sentences as additional information.",
        "The input of their method is the source trees with their translation on the target side as ours, which is much easier to obtain than trees on both sides.",
        "However, their method does not use any tree structures on the target side that might be useful for ambiguity resolution.",
        "Our method achieves much greater improvement because it uses the richer subtree constraints.",
        "Our approach takes the same input as Huang et al.",
        "(2009) and exploits the subtree structure on the target side to provide the bilingual constraints.",
        "The subtrees are extracted from large-scale auto-parsed monolingual data on the target side.",
        "The main problem to be addressed is mapping words on the source side to the target subtree because there are many to many mappings and reordering problems that often occur in translation (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We use an automatic way for generating mapping rules to solve the problems.",
        "Based on the mapping rules, we design a set of features for parsing models.",
        "The basic idea is as follows: if the words form a subtree on one side, their corresponding words on the another side will also probably form a subtree.",
        "Experiments on the translated portion of the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2002; Bies et al., 2007) show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art monolingual parsers by 2.93 points for Chinese and 1.64 points for English.",

        "Then we verify that the words form a subtree by looking up the subtree list.",
