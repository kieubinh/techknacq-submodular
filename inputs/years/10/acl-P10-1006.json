        "So there is an urgent demand for efficient, high-quality named entity disambiguation methods.",
        "Currently, the common methods for named entity disambiguation include name observation clustering (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and entity linking with knowledge base (McNa-mee and Dang, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the method of name observation clustering.",

        "To a human, named entity disambiguation is usually not a difficult task as he can make decisions depending on not only contextual clues, but also the prior background knowledge.",
        "For example, as shown in Figure 1, with the background knowledge that both Learning and Graphical models are the topics related to Machine learning, while Machine learning is the sub domain of Computer science, a human can easily determine that the two Michael Jordan in the 1st and 4th observations represent the same person.",
        "In the same way, a human can also easily identify that the two Michael Jordan in the 2nd and 3rd observations represent the same person.",

        "The development of systems which could replicate the human disambiguation ability, however, is not a trivial task because it is difficult to capture and leverage the semantic knowledge as humankind.",
        "Conventionally, the named entity disambiguation methods measure the similarity between name observations using the bag of words (BOW) model (Bagga and Baldwin (1998); Mann and Yarowsky (2006); Fleischman and Hovy (2004); Pedersen et al.",
        "(2005)), where a name observation is represented as a feature vector consisting of the contextual terms.",

        "Fortunately, in recent years, due to the evolution of Web (e.g., the Web 2.0 and the Semantic Web) and many research efforts for the construction of knowledge bases, there is an increasing availability of large-scale knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia and WordNet.",
        "These large-scale knowledge sources create new opportunities for knowledge-based named entity disambiguation methods as they contain rich semantic knowledge.",
        "For example, as shown in Figure 2, the link structure of Wikipedia contains rich semantic relations between concepts.",
        "And we believe that the disambiguation performance can be greatly improved by designing algorithms which can exploit these knowledge sources at best.",
        "The problem of these knowledge sources is that they are heterogeneous (e.g., they contain different types of semantic relations and different types of concepts) and most of the semantic knowledge within them is embedded in complex structures, such as graphs and networks.",
        "For example, as shown in Figure 2, the semantic relation between Graphical Model and Computer Science is embedded in the link structure of the Wikipedia.",

        "These knowledge-based methods, however, usually are specialized to the knowledge sources they used, so they often have the knowledge coverage problem.",
        "Furthermore, these methods can only exploit the semantic knowledge to a limited extent because they cannot take the structural semantic knowledge into consideration.",
        "To overcome the deficiencies of previous methods, this paper proposes a knowledge-based method, called Structural Semantic Relatedness (SSR), which can enhance the named entity disambiguation by capturing and leveraging the structural semantic knowledge from multiple knowledge sources.",
        "The key point of our method is a reliable semantic relatedness measure between concepts (including WordNet concepts, NEs and Wikipedia concepts), called Structural Semantic Relatedness, which can capture both the explicit semantic relations between concepts and the implicit semantic knowledge embedded in graphs and networks.",
        "In particular, we first extract the semantic relations between two concepts from a variety of knowledge sources and represent them using a graph-based model, semantic-graph.",
        "Then based on the principle that \"two concepts are semantic related if they are both semantic related to the neighbor concepts of each other\", we construct our Structural Semantic Relatedness measure.",

        "In this step we extract all the concepts in the contexts of name observations and represent them as the nodes in the semantic-graph.",
        "We first gather all the N-grams (up to 8 words) and identify whether they correspond to semantically meaningful concepts: if a N-gram is contained in the WordNet, we identify it as a WordNet concept, and use its primary word sense as its semantic meaning; to find whether a N-gram is a named entity, we match it to the named entity list extracted using the open-Calais API3, which contains more than 30 types of named entities, such as Person, Organization and Award; to find whether a N-gram is a Wiki-pedia concept, we match it to the Wikipedia anchor dictionary, then find its corresponding Wiki-pedia concept using the method described in (Medelyan et al., 2008).",
        "After concept identification, we filter out all the N-grams which do not correspond to the semantic meaningful concepts, such as the N-grams \"learning in\" and \"wins NBA MVP'\".",
        "The retained N-grams are identified as concepts, corresponding with their semantic meanings (a concept may have multiple semantic meaning explanation, e.g., the \"MVP\" has three semantic meaning, as \"most valuable player,",
        "MVP\" in WordNet, as the \"Most Valuable Player\" in Wikipedia and as a named entity of Award type).",
        "2) Concept Connection.",
        "In this step we represent the semantic relations as the edges between nodes.",
        "That is, for each pair of extracted concepts, we identify whether there are semantic relations between them: 1) If there is only one semantic relation between them, we connect these two concepts with an edge, where the edge weight is the strength of the semantic relation; 2) If there is more than one semantic relations between them, we choose the most reliable semantic relation, i.e., we choose the semantic relation in the knowledge sources according to the order of WordNet, Wikipedia and NE Co-concurrence corpus (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "For example, if both Wikipedia and WordNet provide the semantic relation between MVP and NBA, we choose the semantic relation provided by WordNet.",
        "7,900,000 web pages, while only co-occurs with \"EMNLP\" in less than 1,000 web pages.",
        "So the co-occurrence statistics can be used to measure the social relatedness between named entities.",
        "In this paper, given a NE Co-occurrence Corpus D, the social relatedness scr between two named entities ne1 and ne2 is measured using the Google Similarity Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007):",
        "where D1 and D2 are the document sets correspondingly containing ne1 and ne2.",
        "An example of social relatedness is shown in Table 3, which is computed using the Web corpus through Google.",
        "In this section, we describe how to capture the semantic relations between the concepts in semantic-graph using a semantic relatedness measure.",
        "Totally, the semantic knowledge between concepts is modeled in two forms:",
        "1) The edges of semantic-graph.",
        "The edges model the direct semantic relations between concepts.",
        "We call this form of semantic knowledge as explicit semantic knowledge.",
        "2) The structure of semantic-graph.",
        "Except for the edges, the structure of the semantic-graph also models the semantic knowledge of concepts.",
        "For example, the neighbors of a concept represent all the concepts which are explicitly semantic-related to this concept; and the paths between two concepts represent all the explicit and implicit semantic relations between them.",
        "We call this form of semantic knowledge as structural semantic knowledge, or implicit semantic knowledge.",
        "Therefore, in order to deduce a reliable semantic relatedness measure, we must take both the edges and the structure of semantic-graph into consideration.",
        "Under the semantic-graph model, the measurement of semantic relatedness between concepts equals to quantifying the similarity between nodes in a weighted graph.",
        "To simplify the description, we assign each node in semantic-graph an integer index from 1 to \\V and use this index to represent the node, then we can write the adjacency matrix of the semantic-graph G as A, where A[i,j] or Ay is the edge weight between node i and node j.",
        "The problem of quantifying the relatedness between nodes in a graph is not a new problem, e.g., the structural equivalence and structural similarity (the SimRank in Jeh and Widom (2002) and the similarity measure in Leicht et al.",
        "(2006)).",
        "However, these similarity measures are not suitable for our task, because all of them assume that the edges are uniform so that they cannot take edge weight into consideration.",
        "In order to take both the graph structure and the edge weight into account, we design the structural semantic relatedness measure by extending the measure introduced in Leicht et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "The fundamental principle behind our measure is \"a node u is semantically related to another node v if its immediate neighbors are semantically related to v\".",
        "This definition is natural, for example, as shown in Figure 3, the concept Basketball and its neighbors NBA and Chi cago Bulls are all semantically related to MVP.",
        "This definition is recursive, and the starting point we choose is the semantic relatedness in the edge.",
        "Thus our structural semantic relatedness has two components: the neighbor term of the previous recursive phase which captures the graph structure and the semantic relatedness which captures the edge information.",
        "Thus, the recursive form of the structural semantic relatedness Sij between the node i and the node j can be written as:",
        "Sjj =aY Ai^Sj + /uA, where X and i control the relative importance of the two components and Ni={j | Aij > 0} is the set of the immediate neighbors of node i;",
        "d. = S Aj is the degree of node i.",
        "In order to solve this formula, we introduce the",
        "following two notations: T: The relatedness transition matrix, where T[i,j]=Aij/di, indicating the transition rate of relatedness from node j to its neighbor i.",
        "S: The structural semantic relatedness matrix,",
        "where S[i,j]=Sij.",
        "Now we can turn our first form of structural semantic relatedness into the matrix form:",
        "S = XTS + id A By solving this equation, we can get:",
        "S = ju(I -XT)-1A where I is the identity matrix.",
        "Since i is a parameter which only contributes an overall scale factor to the relatedness value, we can ignore it and get the final form of the structural semantic relatedness as:",
        "S = (I -XT)-1A Because the S is asymmetric, the finally relatedness between node i and node j is the average of Sij and Sji.",
        "The meaning of X : The last question of our structural semantic relatedness measure is how to set the free parameter X .",
        "To understand the meaning of X, let us expand the similarity as a power series thus:",
        "s = (i +xt + xXt +... + xktk +...) a Noting that the [Tk]ij- element is the relatedness transition rate from node i to node j with path length k, we can view the x as a penalty factor for the transition path length: by setting the x with a value within (0, 1), a longer graph path will contribute less to the final relatedness value.",
        "The optimal value of x is 0.6 through a learning",
        "process shown in Section 4.",
        "For demonstration, Table 4 shows some structural semantic relatedness values of the Semantic-graph in Figure 3 (CS represents computer science and GM represents Graphical model).",
        "From Table 4, we can see that the structural semantic relatedness can successfully capture the semantic knowledge embedded in the structure of semantic-graph, such as the implicit semantic relation between Researcher and Learning.",
        "3 Named Entity Disambiguation by Leveraging Semantic Knowledge",
        "In this section we describe how to leverage the semantic knowledge captured in the structural semantic relatedness measure for named entity disambiguation.",
        "Because the key problem of named entity disambiguation is to measure the similarity between name observations, we integrate the structural semantic relatedness in the similarity measure, so that it can better reflect the actual similarity between name observations.",
        "Concretely, our named entity disambiguation system works as follows: 1) Measuring the similarity between name observations; 2) Grouping name observations using the clustering algorithm.",
        "In the following we describe each step in detail.",
        "Intuitively, if two observations of the target name represent the same entity, it is highly possible that the concepts in their contexts are closely related, i.e., the named entities in their contexts are socially related and the Wikipedia concepts in their contexts are semantically related.",
        "In contrast, if two name observations represent different entities, the concepts within their contexts will not be closely related.",
        "Therefore we can measure the similarity between two name observations by summarizing all the semantic relatedness between the concepts in their contexts.",
        "To measure the similarity between name observations, we represent each name observation as a weighted vector of concepts (including named entities, Wikipedia concepts and WordNet concepts), where the concepts are extracted using the same method described in Section 2.2, so they are just the same concepts within the semantic-graph.",
        "Using the same concept index as the semantic-graph, a name observation oi is then represented as oi = {wi1,wi2,...,win}, where wik is the kth concept's weight in observation oi, computed using the standard TFIDF weight model, where the DF is computed using the Google Web1T 5-gram corpus.",
        "Given the concept vector representation of two name observations oi and oj, their similarity is computed as:",
        "SIM(oi, oj) = S S wliwjkSiklS S wilwjk",
        "which is the weighted average of all the structural semantic relatedness between the concepts in the contexts of the two name observations.",
        "3.2 Grouping Name Observations through Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering",
        "Given the computed similarities, name observations are disambiguated by grouping them according to their represented entities.",
        "In this paper, we group name observations using the hierarchical agglomerative clustering(HAC) algorithm, which is widely used in prior disambiguation research and evaluation task (WePS1 and WePS2).",
        "The HAC produce clusters in a bottom-up way as follows: Initially, each name observation is an individual cluster; then we iteratively merge the two clusters with the largest similarity value to form a new cluster until this similarity value is smaller than a preset merging threshold or all the observations reside in one common cluster.",
        "The merging threshold can be determined through cross-validation.",
        "We employ the single-link method to compute the similarity between two clusters, which has been applied widely in prior research (Bagga and Baldwin (1998);",

        "2) By leveraging the semantic knowledge from multiple knowledge sources, we can obtain a better named entity disambiguation performance: compared with the SSR-NE's 0% improvement, the SSR-WordNefs 2.3% improvement and the SSR-Wikipedia's 3.7% improvement, the SSR gets 6.3% improvement over the SSR-NoKnowledge baseline, which is larger than all the SSR methods with only one type of semantic knowledge integrated.",
