        "Although modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) takes several cues from the biological perception of speech, it rarely models its biological production.",
        "The result is that speech is treated as a surface acoustic phenomenon with lexical or phonetic hidden dynamics but without any physical constraints in between.",
        "This omission leads to some untenable assumptions.",
        "For example, speech is often treated out of convenience as a sequence of discrete, non-overlapping packets, such as phonemes, despite the fact that some major difficulties in ASR, such as co-articulation, are by definition the result of concurrent physiological phenomena (Hardcastle and Hewlett, 1999).",
        "Many acoustic ambiguities can be resolved with knowledge of the vocal tract's configuration (O'Shaughnessy, 2000).",
        "For example, the three nasal sonorants, /m/, /n/, and /ng/, are acoustically similar (i.e., they have large concentrations of energy at the same frequencies) but uniquely and reliably involve bilabial closure, tongue-tip elevation, and tongue-dorsum elevation, respectively.",
        "Having access to the articulatory goals of the speaker would, in theory, make the identification of linguistic intent almost trivial.",
        "Although we don't typically have access to the vocal tract during speech recognition, its configuration can be estimated reasonably well from acoustics alone within adequate models or measurements of the vocal tract (Richmond et al., 2003; Toda et al., 2008).",
        "Evidence that such inversion takes place naturally in humans during speech perception suggests that the discriminability of speech sounds depends powerfully on their production (Liberman and Mattingly, 1985; D'Ausilio et al., 2009).",
        "This paper describes the use of explicit models of physical speech production within recognition systems.",
        "Initially, we augment traditional models of ASR with probabilistic relationships between acoustics and articulation learned from appropriate data.",
        "This leads to the incorporation of a highlevel, goal-oriented, and control-based theory of speech production within a novel ASR system."

        "The use of theoretical (phonological) features of the vocal tract has provided some improvement over traditional acoustic ASR systems in phoneme recognition with neural networks (Kirchhoff, 1999; Roweis, 1999), but there has been very little work in ASR informed by direct measurements of the vocal tract.",
        "Recently, Markov et al.",
        "(2006) have augmented hidden Markov models with Bayes networks trained to describe articulatory constraints from a small amount of Japanese vocal tract data, resulting in a small phoneme-error reduction.",
        "This work has since been expanded upon to inform ASR systems sensitive to physiological speech disorders (Rudzicz, 2009).",
        "Common among previous efforts is an interpretation of speech as a sequence of short, instantaneous observations devoid of long-term dynamics.",
        "Articulatory phonology bridges the divide between the physical manifestation of speech and its underlying lexical intentions.",
        "Within this discipline, the theory of task dynamics is a combined model of physical articulator motion and the planning of abstract vocal tract configurations (Saltz-man, 1986).",
        "This theory introduces the notion that all observed patterns of speech are the result of overlapping gestures, which are abstracted goal-oriented reconfigurations of the vocal tract, such as bilabial closure or velar opening (Saltzman and Munhall, 1989).",
        "Each gesture occurs within one of the following tract variables (TVs): velar opening (VEL), lip aperture (LA) and protrusion (LP), tongue tip constriction location (TTCL) and degree (TTCD) , tongue body constriction location (TBCL) and degree (TBCD), lower tooth height (LTH), and glottal vibration (GLO).",
        "For example, the syllable pub consists of an onset (/p/), a nucleus (/ah/), and a coda (/b/).",
        "Four gestural goals are associated with the onset, namely the shutting of GLO and of VEL, and the closure and release of LA.",
        "Similarly, the nucleus of the syllable consists of three goals, namely the relocation of TBCD and TBCL, and the opening of GLO.",
        "The presence and extent of these gestural goals are represented by filled rectangles in figure 1.",
        "Inter-gestural timings between these goals are specified relative to one another according to human data as described by Nam and Saltzman (2003).",
        "open open",
        "closed open",
        "and Munhall (1989).",
        "The presence of these discrete goals influences the vocal tract dynamically and continuously as modelled by the following non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equation:",
        "Here, z is a continuous vector representing the instantaneous positions of the nine tract variables, z* is the target (equilibrium) positions of those variables, and vectors z' and z\" represent the first and second derivatives of z with respect to time (i.e., velocity and acceleration), respectively.",
        "The matrices M, B, and K are syllable-specific coefficients describing the inertia, damping, and stiffness, respectively, of the virtual gestures.",
        "Generally, this theory assumes that the tract variables are mutually independent, and that the system is critically damped (i.e., the tract variables do not oscillate around their equilibrium positions) (Nam and Saltzman, 2003).",
        "The continuous state, z, of equation (1) is exemplified by black curves in figure 1.",
        "Tract variables provide the dimensions of an abstract gestural space independent of the physical characteristics of the speaker.",
        "In order to complete our articulatory model, however, we require physical data from which to infer these high-level articulatory goals.",
        "Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is a method to measure the motion of the vocal tract during speech.",
        "In EMA, the speaker is placed within a low-amplitude electromagnetic field produced within a cube of a known geometry.",
        "Tiny sensors within this field induce small electric currents whose energy allows the inference of articulator positions and velocities to within 1 mm of error (Yunusova et al., 2009).",
        "We derive data for the following study from two EMA sources:",
        "• The University of Edinburgh's MOCHA database, which provides phonetically-balanced sentences repeated from TIMIT (Zue et al., 1989) uttered by a male and a female speaker (Wrench, 1999), and",
        "• The University of Toronto's TORGO database, from which we select sentences repeated from TIMIT from two females and three males (Rudzicz et al., 2008).",
        "(Cerebrally palsied speech, which is the focus of this database, is not included here).",
        "For the following study we use the eight 2D positions common to both databases, namely the upper lip (UL), lower lip (LL), upper incisor (UI), lower incisor (LI), tongue tip (TT), tongue blade (TB), and tongue dorsum (TD).",
        "Since these positions are recorded in 3D in TORGO, we project these onto the midsagittal plane.",
        "(Additionally, the MOCHA database provides velum (V) data on this plane, and TORGO provides the left and right lip corners (LL and RL) but these are excluded from study except where noted).",
        "All articulatory data is aligned with its associated acoustic data, which is transformed to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).",
        "Since the 2D EMA system in MOCHA and the 3D EMA system in TORGO differ in their recording rates, the length of each MFCC frame in each database must differ in order to properly align acoustics with articulation in time.",
        "Therefore, each MFCC frame covers 16 ms in the TORGO database, and 32 ms in MOCHA.",
        "Phoneme boundaries are determined automatically in the MOCHA database by forced alignment, and by a speech-language pathologist in the TORGO database.",
        "We approximate the tract variable space from the physical space of the articulators, in general, through principal component analysis (PCA) on the latter, and subsequent sigmoid normalization on [0,1].",
        "For example, the LTH tract variable is inferred by calculating the first principal component of the two-dimensional lower incisor (LI) motion in the midsagittal plane, and by normalizing the resulting univariate data through a scaled sigmoid.",
        "The VEL variable is inferred similarly from velum (V) EMA data.",
        "Tongue tip constriction location and degree (TTCL and TTCD, respectively) are inferred from the 1 stand 2nd principal components of tongue tip (TT) EMA data, with TBCL and",
        "TBCD inferred similarly from tongue body (TB) data.",
        "Finally, the glottis (GLO) is inferred by voicing detection on acoustic energy below 150 Hz (O'Shaughnessy, 2000), lip aperture (LA) is the normalized Euclidean distance between the lips, and lip protrusion (LP) is the normalized 2nd principal component of the midpoint between the lips.",
        "All PCA is performed without segmentation of the data.",
        "The result is a low-dimensional set of continuous curves describing goal-relevant articulatory variables.",
        "Figure 2, for example, shows the degree of the lip aperture (LA) over time for all instances of the /b/phoneme in the MOCHA database.",
        "The relevant articulatory goal of lip closure is evident."

        "The second baseline model is the articulatory dynamic Bayes network (DBN-A).",
        "This augments the standard acoustic HMM by replacing hidden indices, Mt , with discrete observations of the vocal tract, Kt, as shown in figure 3(b).",
        "The pattern of acoustics within each phoneme is dependent on a relatively restricted set of possible articulatory configurations (Roweis, 1999).",
        "To find these discrete positions, we obtain k vectors that best describe the articulatory data according to k-means clustering with the sum-of-squares error function.",

        "The training of DBNs involves a specialized version of expectation-maximization, as described in the literature (Murphy, 2002; Ghahra-mani, 1998).",

        "Namely, we input the known orthography for each test utterance into TADA, obtain the predicted canonical tract variables TV, and transform these according to our trained SKF.",
        "The resulting predicted and transformed sequences are aligned with our measurements derived from EMA with dynamic time warping.",
        "Finally, we measure the average difference between the observed data and the predicted (canonical and transformed) tract variables.",
        "Table 3 shows these differences according to the phonological manner of articulation.",
        "In all cases the transformed tract variable motion is more accurate, and significantly so at the 95% confidence level for nasal and retroflex phonemes, and at 99% for fricatives.",
        "The practical utility of the transformation component is evaluated in its effect on recognition rates, as described below.",

        "Although systems whose rankings are weighted solely by the articulatory component perform better than the exclusively acoustic systems, the lists available to the former are procured from standard acoustic ASR.",
        "Interestingly, the gap between systems trained to the two databases increases as a approaches 1.0.",
        "Although this gap is not significant, it may be the result of increased inter-speaker articulatory variation in the TORGO database, which includes more than twice as many speakers as MOCHA.",

        "The articulatory medium of speech rarely informs modern speech recognition.",
        "We have demonstrated that the use of direct articulatory knowledge can substantially reduce phoneme and word errors in speech recognition, especially if that knowledge is motivated by high-level abstractions of vocal tract behaviour.",
        "Task dynamic theory provides a coherent and biologically plausible model of speech production with consequences for phonology (Browman and Goldstein, 1986), neu-rolinguistics (Guenther and Perkell, 2004), and the evolution of speech and language (Goldstein et al., 2006).",
        "We have shown that it is also useful within speech recognition.",
        "We have overcome a conceptual impediment in integrating task dynamics and ASR, which is the former's deterministic nature.",
        "This integration is accomplished by stochastically transforming predicted articulatory dynamics and by calculating the likelihoods of these dynamics according to speaker data.",
        "However, there are several new avenues for exploration.",
        "For example, task dynamics lends itself to more general applications of control theory, including automated self-correction, rhythm, co-ordination, and segmentation (Friedland, 2005).",
        "Other high-level questions also remain, such as whether discrete gestures are the correct biological and practical paradigm, whether a purely continuous representation would be more appropriate, and whether this approach generalizes to other languages.",
        "In general, our experiments have revealed very little difference between the use of MOCHA and TORGO EMA data.",
        "An ad hoc analysis of some of the errors produced by the TD-ASR system found no particular difference between how systems trained to each of these databases recognized nasal phonemes, although only those trained with MOCHA considered velum motion.",
        "Other errors common to both sources of data include phoneme insertion errors, normally vowels, which appear to co-occur with some spurious motion of the tongue between segments, especially for longer N-best lists.",
        "Despite the relative slow motion of the articulators relative to acoustics, there remains some intermittent noise.",
        "As more articulatory data becomes available and as theories of speech production become more refined, we expect that their combined value to speech recognition will become indispensable."
