        "Automated summarization systems which enable user to quickly digest the important information conveyed by either a single or a cluster of documents are indispensible for managing the rapidly growing amount of textual information and multimedia content (Mani and Maybury, 1999).",
        "On the other hand, due to the maturity of text summarization, the research paradigm has been extended to speech summarization over the years (Furui et al., 2004; McKeown et al., 2005).",
        "Speech summarization is expected to distill important information and remove redundant and incorrect information caused by recognition errors from spoken documents, enabling user to efficiently review spoken documents and understand the associated topics quickly.",
        "It would also be useful for improving the efficiency of a number of potential applications like retrieval and mining of large volumes of spoken documents.",
        "A summary can be either abstractive or extractive.",
        "In abstractive summarization, a fluent and concise abstract that reflects the key concepts of a document is generated, whereas in extractive summarization, the summary is usually formed by selecting salient sentences from the original document (Mani and Maybury, 1999).",
        "The former requires highly sophisticated natural language processing techniques, including semantic representation and inference, as well as natural language generation, while this would make abstractive approaches difficult to replicate or extend from constrained domains to more general domains.",
        "In addition to being extractive or abstractive, a summary may also be generated by considering several other aspects like being generic or query-oriented summarization, single-document or multi-document summarization, and so forth.",
        "The readers may refer to (Mani and Maybury, 1999) for a comprehensive overview of automatic text summarization.",
        "In this paper, we focus exclusively on generic, single-document extractive summarization which forms the building block for many other summarization tasks.",
        "Aside from traditional ad-hoc extractive summarization methods (Mani and Maybury, 1999), machine-learning approaches with either supervised or unsupervised learning strategies have gained much attention and been applied with empirical success to many summarization tasks (Kupiec et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2009).",
        "For supervised learning strategies, the summarization task is usually cast as a two-class (summary and non-summary) sentence-classification problem: A sentence with a set of indicative features is input to the classifier (or summarizer) and a decision is then returned from it on the basis of these features.",
        "In general, they usually require a training set, comprised of several documents and their corresponding handcrafted summaries (or labeled data), to train the classifiers.",
        "However, manual labeling is expensive in terms of time and personnel.",
        "The other potential problem is the so-called \"bag-of-sentences\" assumption implicitly made by most of these summarizers.",
        "That is, sentences are classified independently of each other, without leveraging the dependence relationships among the sentences or the global structure of the document (Shen et al., 2007).",
        "Another line of thought attempts to conduct document summarization using unsupervised machine-learning approaches, getting around the need for manually labeled training data.",
        "Most previous studies conducted along this line have their roots in the concept of sentence centrality (Gong and Liu, 2001; Erkan and Radev, 2004; Radev et al., 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005).",
        "Put simply, sentences more similar to others are deemed more salient to the main theme of the document; such sentences thus will be selected as part of the summary.",
        "Even though the performance of unsupervised summarizers is usually worse than that of supervised summarizers, their domain-independent and easy-to-implement properties still make them attractive.",
        "Building on these observations, we expect that researches conducted along the above-mentioned two directions could complement each other, and it might be possible to inherit their individual merits to overcome their inherent limitations.",
        "In this paper, we present a probabilistic summarization framework stemming from Bayes decision theory (Berger, 1985) for speech summarization.",
        "This framework can not only naturally integrate the above-mentioned two modeling paradigms but also provide a flexible yet systematic way to render the redundancy and coherence relationships among sentences and between sentences and the whole document, respectively.",
        "Moreover, we also illustrate how the proposed framework can unify several existing summarization models.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "We start by reviewing related work on extractive summarization.",
        "In Section 3 we formulate the extractive summarization task as a risk minimization problem, followed by a detailed elucidation of the proposed methods in Section 4.",
        "Then, the experimental setup and a series of experiments and associated discussions are presented in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.",
        "Finally, Section 7 concludes our presentation and discusses avenues for future work."

        "Speech summarization can be conducted using either supervised or unsupervised methods (Furui 2008).",
        "In the following, we briefly review a few celebrated methods that have been applied to extractive speech summarization tasks with good success.",
        "Extractive speech summarization can be treated as a two-class (positive/negative) classification problem.",
        "A spoken sentence Si is characterized by set of T indicative features Xi ={xi1, â€“ ,xiT}, and they may include lexical features (Koumpis and Renals, 2000), structural features (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003), acoustic features (Inoue et al., 2004), discourse features (Zhang et al., 2007) and relevance features (Lin et al., 2009).",
        "Then, the corresponding feature vector Xi of Siis taken as the input to the classifier.",
        "If the output (classification) score belongs to the positive class, Si will be selected as part of the summary; otherwise, it will be excluded (Kupiec et al., 1999).",
        "Specifically, the problem can be formulated as follows: Construct a sentence ranking model that assigns a classification score (or a posterior probability) of being in the summary class to each sentence of a spoken document to be summarized; important sentences are subsequently ranked and selected according to these scores.",
        "To this end, several popular machine-learning methods could be utilized, like Bayesian classifier (BC) (Kupiec et al., 1999), Gaussian mixture",
        "Markov model (HMM) (Conroy and O'leary, 2001), support vector machine (SVM) (Kolcz et al., 2001), maximum entropy (ME) (Ferrier, 2001), conditional random field (CRF) (Galley, 2006; Shen et al., 2007), to name a few.",
        "Although such supervised summarizers are effective, most of them (except CRF) usually implicitly assume that sentences are independent of each other (the so-called \"bag-of-sentences\" assumption) and classify each sentence individually without leveraging the relationship among the sentences (Shen et al., 2007).",
        "Another major shortcoming of these summarizers is that a set of handcrafted document-reference summary exemplars are required for training the summarizers; however, such summarizers tend to limit their generalization capability and might not be readily applicable for new tasks or domains.",
        "The related work conducted along this direction usually relies on some heuristic rules or statistical evidences between each sentence and the document, avoiding the need of manually labeled training data.",
        "For example, the vector space model (VSM) approach represents each sentence of a document and the document itself in vector space (Gong and Liu, 2001), and computes the relevance score between each sentence and the document (e.g., the cosine measure of the similarity between two vectors).",
        "Then, the sentences with the highest relevance scores are included in the summary.",
        "A natural extension is to represent each document or each sentence vector in a latent semantic space (Gong and Liu, 2001), instead of simply using the literal term information as that done by VSM.",
        "On the other hand, the graph-based methods, such as TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005) and LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004), conceptualize the document to be summarized as a network of sentences, where each node represents a sentence and the associated weight of each link represents the lexical or topical similarity relationship between a pair of nodes.",
        "Document summarization thus relies on the global structural information conveyed by such conceptualized network, rather than merely considering the local features of each node (sentence).",
        "However, due to the lack of document-summary reference pairs, the performance of the unsupervised summarizers is usually worse than that of the supervised summarizers.",
        "Moreover, most of the unsupervised summarizers are constructed solely on the basis of the lexical information without considering other sources of information cues like discourse features, acoustic features, and so forth."

        "extractive summarization",
        "Extractive summarization can be viewed as a decision making process in which the summarizer attempts to select a representative subset of sentences or paragraphs from the original documents.",
        "Among the several analytical methods that can be employed for the decision process, the Bayes decision theory, which quantifies the tradeoff between various decisions and the potential cost that accompanies each decision, is perhaps the most suited one that can be used to guide the summarizer in choosing a course of action in the face of some uncertainties underlying the decision process (Berger, 1985).",
        "Stated formally, a decision problem may consist of four basic elements: 1) an observation O from a random variable O , 2) a set of possible decisions (or actions) a e A, 3) the state of nature 0 e 0 , and 4) a loss function l(ai,0) which specifies the cost associated with a chosen decision ai given that 0 is the true state of nature.",
        "The expected risk (or conditional risk) associated with taking decision ai is given by where p{e{O) is the posterior probability of the state of nature being 0 given the observation O .",
        "Bayes decision theory states that the optimum decision can be made by contemplating each action ai , and then choosing the action for which the expected risk is minimum:",
        "The notion of minimizing the Bayes risk has gained much attention and been applied with success to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (Goel and Byrne, 2000), statistical machine translation (Kumar and Byrne, 2004) and statistical information retrieval (Zhai and Lafferty, 2006).",
        "Following the same spirit, we formulate the extractive summarization task as a Bayes risk minimization problem.",
        "Without loss of generality, let us denote ne n as one of possible selection strategies (or state of nature) which comprises a set of indicators used to address the importance of each sentence Si in a document D to be summarized.",
        "A feasible selection strategy can be fairly arbitrary according to the underlying principle.",
        "For example, it could be a set of binary indicators denoting whether a sentence should be selected as part of summary or not.",
        "On the contrary, it may also be a ranked list used to address the significance of each individual sentence.",
        "Moreover, we refer to the k -th action ak as choosing the k -th selection strategy nk, and the observation O as the document D to be summarized.",
        "As a result, the expected risk of a certain selection strategy nk is given by",
        "Consequently, the ultimate goal of extractive summarization could be stated as the search of the best selection strategy from the space of all possible selection strategies that minimizes the expected risk defined as follows:",
        "Although we have described a general formulation for the extractive summarization problem on the grounds of the Bayes decision theory, we consider hereafter a special case of it where the selection strategy is represented by a binary decision vector, of which each element corresponds to a specific sentence Si in the document D and designates whether it should be selected as part of the summary or not, as the first such attempt.",
        "More concretely, we assume that the summary sentences of a given document can be iteratively chosen (i.e., one at each iteration) from the document until the aggregated summary reaches a predefined target summarization ratio.",
        "It turns out that the binary vector for each possible action will have just one element equal to 1 and all others equal to zero (or the so-called \"one-of-n\" coding).",
        "For ease of notation, we denote the binary vector by Si when the i -th element has a value of 1.",
        "Therefore, the risk minimization framework can be reduced to where p(d | Sj ) is the sentence generative probability, i.e., the likelihood of D being generated by Sj ; p(Sj ) is the prior probability of Sj being important; and the evidence p(D) is the marginal probability of D , which can be approximated by p(p)Â» E~p(^|sot)p(Sm).",
        "By substituting (6) and (7) into (5), we obtain the following final selection strategy for extractive summarization:",
        "p(D\\sj Hsj)",
        "YP(Dlsm )p(sâ€ž ).",
        "A remarkable feature of this framework lies in that a sentence to be considered as part of the summary is actually evaluated by three different fundamental factors: (1) p(s.) is the sentence prior probability that addretsses the importance of sentence Sj itself; (2) p(d | Sj ) is the sentence generative probability that captures the degtree of relevance of Sjto the residual document D ; and (3) l(si, Sj) is the loss function that characterizes the relationship between sentence Si and any other sentence Sj.",
        "As we will soon see, such a framework can be regarded as a generalization of several existing summarization methods.",
        "A detailed account on the construction of these three component models in the framework will be given in the following section."

      "heading": "4. Proposed Methods",
      "text": [
        "There are many ways to construct the above mentioned three component tmodels, i.e., the sentence generative model p(d | Sj ), the sentence prior model P(Sj ), and the loss function l(si, Sj ).",
        "In what follows, we will shed light on one possible attempt that can accomplish this goal elegantly.",
        "In order to estimate the sentence generative probability, we explore the language modeling (LM) approach, which has been introduced to a wide spectrum of IR tasks and demonstrated with good empirical success, to predict the sentence generative probability.",
        "In the LM approach, each sentence in a document can be simply regarded as a probabilistic generative model consisting of a unigram distribution (the so-called \"bag-of-words\" assumption) for generating the document (Chen et al., 2009):",
        "P(D|Sj ) if it occurs more frequently in D .",
        "Note that the sentence model P(wis. ) is simply estimated on the basis of the frequency of index term w occurring in the sentence S j with the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion.",
        "In a sense, (9) belongs to a kind of literal term matching strategy (Chen, 2009) and may suffer the problem of unreliable model estimation owing particularly to only a few sampled index terms present in the sentence (Zhai, 2008).",
        "To mitigate this potential defect, a unigram probability estimated from a general collection, which models the general distribution of words in the target language, is often used to smooth the sentence model.",
        "Interested readers may refer to (Zhai, 2008; Chen et al., 2009) for a thorough discussion on various ways to construct the sentence generative model.",
        "The sentence prior probability P(Sj ) can be regarded as the likelihood of a sentence being important without seeing the whole document.",
        "It could be assumed uniformly distributed over sentences or estimated from a wide variety of factors, such as the lexical information, the structural information or the inherent prosodic properties of a spoken sentence.",
        "A straightforward way is to assume that the sentence prior probability P(Sj ) is in proportion to the posterior probability of a sentence Sj bewhere D denotes the remaining sentences that have not been selected into the sum~mary yet (i.e., the \"residual\" document); P\\Sj | D) is the posterior probability of a sentence Sj given D .",
        "Ac further exwhere c(w, D ) is the number of times that index term (or word) w occurs in D , reflecting that w contribute more in the calculation of ing included in the summary class when observing a set of indicative features Xj of Sj derived from such factors or other sentence importance measures (Kupiec et al., 1999).",
        "These features can be integrated in a systematic way into the proposed framework by taking the advantage of the learning capability of the supervised machine-learning methods.",
        "Specifically, the prior probability P{Sj ) can be approximated by:",
        "where p(xj | s) and p(xj | s) are the likelihoods that a sentence Sj with features xj are generated by the summary class s and the non-summary class s , respectively; the prior probability p(s) and p(s ) are set to be equal in this research.",
        "To estimate p(xj | s) and p(xj | s) , several popular supervised classifiers (or summa-rizers), like BC or SVM, can be leveraged for this purpose.",
        "The loss function introduced in the proposed summarization framework is to measure the relationship between any pair of sentences.",
        "Intuitively, when a given sentence is more dissimilar from most of the other sentences, it may incur higher loss as it is taken as the representative sentence (or summary sentence) to represent the main theme embedded in the other ones.",
        "Consequently, the loss function can be built on the notion of the similarity measure.",
        "In this research, we adopt the cosine measure (Gong and Liu, 2001) to fulfill this goal.",
        "We first represent each sentence si in vector form where each dimension specifies the weighted statistic ztii , e.g., the product of the term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) scores, associated with an index term wt in sentence si.",
        "Then, the cosine similarity between any given two sentences (Si , Sj ) is",
        "The loss function is thus defined by",
        "Once the sentence generative model p(d| Sj ), the sentence prior model p(Sj ) and the loss function L(Si, Sj) have been properly estimated, the summary sentences can be selected iteratively by (8) according to a predefined target summarization ratio.",
        "However, as can be seen from (8), a new summary sentence is selected without considering the redundant information that is also contained in the already selected summary sentences.",
        "To alleviate this problem, the concept of maximum marginal relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), which performs sentence selection iteratively by striking the balance between topic relevance and coverage, can be incorporated into the loss function:",
        "where Summ represents the set of sentences that have already been included into the summary and the novelty factor ÃŸ is used to trade off between relevance and redundancy.",
        "In this subsection, we briefly illustrate the relationship between our proposed summarization framework and a few existing summarization approaches.",
        "We start by considering a special case where a 0-1 loss function is used in (8), namely, the loss function will take value 0 if the two sentences are identical, and 1 otherwise.",
        "Then, (8) can be alternatively represented by which actually provides a natural integration of the supervised and unsupervised summarizers (Lin et al., 2009), as mentioned previously.",
        "If we further assume the prior probability p(Sj ) is uniformly distributed, the important (or summary) sentence selection problem has now been reduced to the pro~blem of measuring the document-likelihood p(d | Sj ), or the relevance between the document and the sentence.",
        "Alone a similar vein, the important sentences of a document can be selected (or ranked) solely based on the prior probability p(Sj ) with the assumption of an equal document-likelihood p(d | Sj )."

        "In order to get rid of the cofounding effect of this factor, it is assumed that the selected summary sentences can also be presented in speech form (besides text form) such that users can directly listen to the audio segments of the summary sentences to bypass the problem caused by speech recognition errors.",

        "As can be seen from the first row of Table 4, such a combination can give about 4% to 5% absolute improvements as compared to the results of BC illustrated in Table 3.",

        "If we further compare the results achieved by MMR with those of BC and LM as shown in Table 3, we can find significant improvements both for the TD and SD cases.",
        "By and large, for the TD case, the proposed summarization method offers relative performance improvements of about 19%, 23% and and ROUGE-L measures as compared to the BC baseline; while the relative improvements are 29%, 46% and 31%, respectively, in the same measurements for the SD case.",
        "On the other hand, the performance gap between the TD and SD cases are reduced to a good extent by using the proposed summarization framework.",

        "The importance of a given sentence is thus considered from two angles: 1) the relationship between a sentence and the whole document, and 2) the relationship between the sentence and the other individual sentences.",
        "The corresponding results are illustrated in the lower part of Table 4 (denoted by Uniform).",
        "We can see that the additional consideration of the sentence-sentence relationship appears to be beneficial as compared to that only considering the document-sentence relevance information (cf. the second row of Table 3).",

        "In the final set of experiments, we compare our proposed summarization methods with a few existing summarization methods that have been widely used in various summarization tasks, including LEAD, VSM, LexRank and CRF; the corresponding results are shown in Table 5.",
        "It should be noted that the LEAD-based method simply extracts the first few sentences in a document as the summary.",
        "To our surprise, CRF does not provide superior results as compared to the other summarization methods.",
        "One possible explanation is that the structural evidence of the spoken documents in the test set is not strong enough for CRF to show its advantage of modeling the local structural information among sentences.",
        "On the other hand, LexRank gives a very promising performance in spite that it only utilizes lexical information in an unsupervised manner.",
        "This somewhat reflects the importance of capturing the global relationship for the sentences in the spoken document to be summarized.",
        "As compared to the results shown in the \"BC\" part of Table 4, we can see that our proposed methods significantly outperform all the conventional summarization methods compared in this paper, especially for the SD case."
