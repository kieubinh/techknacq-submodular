        "However, these methods cannot determine the correct word correspondences sufficiently because they fail to focus solely on phrase correspondences.",
        "Moreover, various methods using syntactic analytical tools(Pozar and Charniak, 2006; Mutton et al., 2007; Mehay and Brew, 2007) are proposed to address the sentence structure.",
        "Nevertheless, those methods depend strongly on the quality of the syntactic analytical tools.",

        "Evaluation experiments using MT outputs obtained by 12 machine translation systems in NTCIR-7(Fujii et al., 2008) demonstrate that the scores obtained using our system yield the highest correlation with the human judgments among the automatic evaluation methods in both sentence-level adequacy and fluency.",
