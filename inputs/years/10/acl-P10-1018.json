        "An important challenge for natural language processing is how to learn not only basic linguistic meanings but also how those meanings are systematically enriched when expressed in context.",
        "For instance, answers to polar (yes/no) questions do not always explicitly contain a 'yes' or 'no', but rather give information that the hearer can use to infer such an answer in a context with some degree of certainty.",
        "Hockey et al.",
        "(1997) find that 27% of answers to polar questions do not contain a direct 'yes' or 'no' word, 44% of which they regard as failing to convey a clear 'yes' or 'no' response.",
        "In some cases, interpreting the answer is straightforward (Was it bad?",
        "It was terrible.",
        "), but in others, what to infer from the answer is unclear (Was it good?",
        "It was provocative.).",
        "It is even common for the speaker to explicitly convey his own uncertainty with such answers.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the interpretation of answers to a particular class of polar questions: ones in which the main predication involves a gradable modifier (e.g., highly unusual, not good, little) and the answer either involves another gradable modifier or a numerical expression (e.g., seven years old, twenty acres of land).",
        "Interpreting such question-answer pairs requires dealing with modifier meanings, specifically, learning context-dependent scales of expressions (Horn, 1972; Fauconnier, 1975) that determine how, and to what extent, the answer as a whole resolves the issue raised by the question.",
        "We propose two methods for learning the knowledge necessary for interpreting indirect answers to questions involving gradable adjectives, depending on the type of predications in the question and the answer.",
        "The first technique deals with pairs of modifiers: we hypothesized that online, informal review corpora in which people's comments have associated ratings would provide a general-purpose database for mining scales between modifiers.",
        "We thus use a large collection of online reviews to learn orderings between adjectives based on contextual entailment (good < excellent), and employ this scalar relationship to infer a yes/no answer (subject to negation and other qualifiers).",
        "The second strategy targets numerical answers.",
        "Since it is unclear what kind of corpora would contain the relevant information, we turn to the Web in general: we use distributional information retrieved via Web searches to assess whether the numerical measure counts as a positive or negative instance of the adjective in question.",
        "Both techniques exploit the same approach: using texts (the Web) to learn meanings that can drive pragmatic inference in dialogue.",
        "This paper demonstrates to some extent that meaning can be grounded from text in this way."

        "In the computational literature, Green and Carberry (1994, 1999) provide an extensive model that interprets and generates indirect answers to polar questions.",

        "However, to adequately interpret indirect answers, the uncertainty inherent in some answers needs to be captured (de Marneffe et al., 2009).",

        "As proposed by Zeevat (1994) in his work on partial answers, the speaker's indirect answer might indicate that he is deliberately leaving the original question only partially addressed, while giving a fully resolving answer to another one.",
        "The hearer must then interpret the answer to work out the other question.",
        "In (2) in context, we get a sense that the speaker would resolve the issue to 'no', but that he is definitely not committed to that in any strong sense.",
        "Uncertainty can thus reside both on the speaker and the hearer sides, and the four following scenarios are attested in conversation:",

        "d. The speaker is uncertain of 'yes' or 'no', but the hearer infers one of those with confidence.",
        "The uncertainty is especially pressing for predications built around scalar modifiers, which are inherently vague and highly context-dependent (Kamp and Partee, 1995; Kennedy and McNally, 2005; Kennedy, 2007).",
        "For example, even if we fix the basic sense for little to mean 'young for a human', there is a substantial amount of gray area between the clear instances (babies) and the clear non-instances (adults).",

        "In this section, we present the methods we propose for grounding the meanings of scalar modifiers.",
        "The first technique targets items such as the ones in category I of our corpus.",
        "Our central hypothesis is that, in polar question dialogues, the semantic relationship between the main predication PQ in the question and the main predication PA in the answer is the primary factor in determining whether, and to what extent, 'yes' or 'no' was intended.",
        "If PA is at least as strong as PQ, the intended answer is 'yes'; if PA is weaker than PQ , the intended answer is 'no'; and, where no reliable entailment relationship exists between PA and PQ, the result is uncertainty.",
        "For example, good is weaker (lower on the relevant scale) than excellent, and thus speakers infer that the reply in example (1) above is meant to convey 'yes'.",
        "In contrast, if we reverse the order of the modifiers – roughly, Is it a great idea?",
        "; It's a good idea – then speakers infer that the answer conveys 'no'.",
        "Had B replied with It's a complicated idea in (1), then uncertainty would likely have resulted, since good and complicated are not in a reliable scalar relationship.",
        "Negation reverses scales (Horn, 1972; Levinson, 2000), so it flips 'yes' and 'no' in these cases, leaving 'uncertain' unchanged.",
        "When both the question and the answer contain a modifier (such as in (9-11)), the yes/no response should correlate with the extent to which the pair of modifiers can be put into a scale based on contextual entailment.",
        "To ground such scales from text, we collected a large corpus of online reviews from IMDB.",
        "Each of the reviews in this collection has an associated star rating: one star (most negative) to ten stars (most positive).",
        "Table 3 summarizes the distribution of reviews as well as the number of words and vocabulary across the ten rating categories.",
        "As is evident from table 3, there is a significant bias for ten-star reviews.",
        "This is a common feature of such corpora of informal, user-provided reviews (Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006; since we do not want to incorporate the linguistically uninteresting fact that people tend to write a lot of ten-star reviews, we assume uniform priors for the rating categories.",
        "Let count(w, r) be the number of tokens of word w in reviews in rating category r, and let count(r) be the total word count for all words in rating category r. The probability of w given a rating category r is simply Pr(w|r) = count(w, r)/ count(r).",
        "Then under the assumption of uniform priors, we get Pr(r|w) = Pr(w|r)/ Zr'eR Pr(w|r').",
        "In reasoning about our dialogues, we rescale the rating categories by subtracting 5.5 from each, to center them at 0.",
        "This yields the scale R =",

        "Each group forms its own qualitatively different scale (Kennedy and McNally, 2005).",
        "Rescaling allows us to make a basic positive vs. negative distinction.",
        "Once we have done that, an increase in absolute value is an increase in strength.",
        "In our experiments, we use expected rating values to characterize the polarity and strength of modifiers.",
        "The expected rating value for a word w is ER(h;) = XreÄ r Pr(r\\w).",
        "Figure 2 plots these values for a number of scalar terms, both positive and negative, across the rescaled ratings, with the vertical lines marking their ER values.",
        "The weak scalar modifiers all the way on the left are most common near the middle of the scale, with a slight positive bias in the top row and a slight negative bias in the bottom row.",
