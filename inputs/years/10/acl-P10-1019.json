        "As spoken dialogue systems are designed to perform ever more elaborate tasks, the need for mixed-initiative interaction necessarily grows.",
        "Mixed-initiative interaction, where agents (both artificial and human) may freely contribute to reach a solution efficiently, has long been a focus of dialogue systems research (Allen et al., 1999; Guinn, 1996).",
        "Simple slot-filling tasks might not require the flexible environment that mixed-initiative interaction brings but those of greater complexity, such as collaborative task completion or long-term planning, certainly do (Ferguson et al., 1996).",
        "However, translating this interaction into working systems has proved problematic (Walker et al., 1997), in part to issues surrounding turn-taking: the transition from one speaker to another.",
        "Many computational turn-taking approaches seek to minimize silence and utterance overlap during transitions.",
        "This leads to the speaker controlling the turn transition.",
        "For example, systems using the Keep-Or-Release approach will not attempt to take the turn unless it is sure the user has released it.",
        "One problem with this approach is that the system might have important information to give but will be unable to get the turn.",
        "The speaker-centric nature of current approaches does not enable mixed-initiative interaction and results in inefficient dialogues.",
        "Primarily, these approaches have been motivated by smooth transitions reported in the human turn-taking studies of Sacks et al.",
        "(1974) among others.",
        "Sacks et al.",
        "also acknowledge the negotiative nature of turn-taking, stating that the \"the turn as unit is interactively determined\"(p. 727).",
        "Other studies have supported this, suggesting that humans negotiate the turn assignment through the use of cues and that these cues are motivated by the importance of what the conversant wishes to contribute (Duncan and Niederehe, 1974; Yang this, any dialogue system hoping to interact with humans efficiently and naturally should have a negotiative and importance-driven quality to its turn-taking protocol.",
        "We believe that, by focusing on the rationale of human turn-taking behavior, a more effective turn-taking system may be achieved.",
        "We propose the Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding (IDTB) model where conversants bid for the turn based on the importance of their utterance.",
        "We use Reinforcement Learning to map a given situation to the optimal utterance and bidding behavior.",
        "By allowing conversants to bid for the turn, the IDTB model enables negotiative turn-taking and supports true mixed-initiative interaction, and with it, greater dialogue efficiency.",
        "We compare the IDTB model to current turn-taking approaches.",
        "Using an artificial collaborative dialogue task, we show that the IDTB model enables the system and user to complete the task more efficiently than the other approaches.",
        "Though artificial dialogues are not ideal, they allow us to test the validity of the IDTB model before embarking on costly and time-consuming human studies.",
        "Since our primary evaluation criteria is model comparison, consistent user simulations provide a constant needed for such measures and increase the external validity of our results."

        "Current dialogue systems focus on the release-turn as the most important aspect of turn-taking, in which a listener will only take the turn after the speaker has released it.",
        "The simplest of these approaches only allows a single utterance per turn, after which the turn necessarily transitions to the next speaker.",
        "This Single-Utterance (SU) model has been extended to allow the speaker to keep the turn for multiple utterances: the Keep-Or-Release (KR) approach.",
        "Since the KR approach gives the speaker sole control of the turn, it is overwhelmingly speaker-centric, and so necessarily unnego-tiative.",
        "This restriction is meant to encourage smooth turn-transitions, and is inspired by the order, smoothness, and predictability reported in human turn-taking studies (Duncan, 1972; Sacks et al., 1974).",
        "Systems using the KR approach differ on how they detect the user's release-turn.",
        "Turn releases are commonly identified in two ways: either using a silence-threshold (Sutton et al., 1996), or the predictive nature of turn endings (Sacks et al., 1974) and the cues associated with them (e.g. Gra-vano and Hirschberg, 2009).",
        "Raux and Eskenazi (2009) used decision theory with lexical cues to predict appropriate places to take the turn.",
        "Similarly, Jonsdottir, Thorisson, and Nivel (2008) used Reinforcement Learning to reduce silences between turns and minimize overlap between utterances by learning the specific turn-taking patterns of individual speakers.",
        "Skantze and Schlangan (2009) used incremental processing of speech and prosodic turn-cues to reduce the reaction time of the system, finding that that users rated this approach as more human-like than a baseline system.",
        "In our view, systems built using the KR turn-taking approach suffer from two deficits.",
        "First, the speaker-centricity leads to inefficient dialogues since the speaker may continue to hold the turn even when the listener has vital information to give.",
        "In addition, the lack of negotiation forces the turn to necessarily transition to the listener after the speaker releases it.",
        "The possibility that the dialogue may be better served if the listener does not get the turn is not addressed by current approaches.",
        "Barge-in, which generally refers to allowing users to speak at any time (Str√∂m and Seneff, 2000), has been the primary means to create a more flexible turn-taking environment.",
        "Yet, since barge-in recasts speaker-centric systems as user-centric, the system's contributions continue to be limited.",
        "System barge-in has also been investigated.",
        "Sato et al.",
        "(2002) used decision trees to determine whether the system should take the turn or not when the user pauses.",
        "An incremental method by DeVault, Sagae, and Traum (2009) found possible points that a system could interrupt without loss of user meaning, but failed to supply a reasonable model as to when to use such information.",
        "Despite these advances, barge-in capable systems lack a negotiative turn-taking method, and continue to be deficient for reasons similar to those described above."

        "Importance may be broadly defined as how well the utterance leads to some predetermined conversational success, be it solely task completion or encompassing a myriad of social etiquette components.",
        "Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding is motivated by empirical studies of human turn-conflict resolution.",

        "Duncan and",
        "Niederehe (1974) found that turn-cue strength was the best predictor of who won the turn, and this finding is consistent with the use of volume to win turns found by Yang and Heeman (2010).",
        "The IDTB model uses turn-cue strength to bid for the turn based on the importance of the utterance.",
        "Stronger turn-cues should be used when the intended utterance is important to the overall success of the dialogue, and weaker ones when it is not.",
        "In the prototype described in Section 5, both the system and user agents bid for the turn after every utterance and the bids are conceptualized here as utterance onset: conversants should be quick to speak important utterances but slow with less important ones.",
        "This is relatively consistent with Yang and Heeman (2010).",
        "A mature version of our work will use cues in addition to utterance onset, such as those recently detailed in Gravano and",

        "It has been shown that using RL to learn dialogue polices is generally more effective than \"hand crafted\" dialogue policies since the learning algorithm may capture environmental dynamics that are unattended to by human designers (Levin et al., 2000).",
        "Reinforcement Learning learns an optimal policy, a mapping between a state s and action a, where performing a in s leads to the lowest expected cost for the dialogue (we use minimum cost instead of maximum reward).",

        "The state space should be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for Q-learning to update Q-scores properly.",
        "An MDP relies on a first-order Markov assumption in that the transition and reward probability from some st, at pair is completely contained by that pair and is unaffected by the history st_iat_i, st_2at_2,____For this assumption to be met, care is required when deciding which features to include for learning.",

        "These transitions are distinctly different than KR transitions in that there is information inherent in the users bids.",
        "A user that has a stronger belief strength is more likely to be have a higher bid and inform an available iller.",
        "Policy analysis shows that the IDTB system takes advantage of this information by using moderate bids ‚Äì neither highest nor lowest bids ‚Äì to filter users based on their turn behavior.",
        "The distribution of bids used over the ten learned policies is shown in Table 4.",
        "The initial position refers to the first bid of the dialogue; final position, the last bid of the dialogue; and medial position, all other bids.",
        "Notice that the system uses either the low or mid bids as its initial policy and that 67.2% of dialogue medial bids are moderate.",
        "These distributions show that the system has learned to use the entire bid range to ilter the users, and is not seeking to win or lose the turn outright.",
        "This behavior is impossible in the KR approach.",
        "In our domain, performance is measured by dialogue length and solution quality.",
        "However, since solution quality never affects the dialogue cost for a trained system, dialogue length is the only component influencing the mean policy cost.",
        "The primary cause of longer dialogues are unavailable filler inform and query (UFI-Q) utterances by the user, which are easily identiied.",
        "These utterances lengthen the dialogue since the system must inform the user of the available fillers (the user would otherwise not know that the iller was unavailable) and then the user must then inform the system of its second choice.",
        "The mean number of UFI-Q utterance for each dialogue over the ten learned policies are shown for all user conditions in Table 5.",
        "Notice that these numbers are inversely related to performance: the more UFI-Q utterances, the worse the performance.",
        "For example, in the combined condition the IDTB users perform 0.38 UFI-Q utterances per dialogue (u/d) compared to the 0.94 UFI-Q u/d for KR users.",
        "While a KR user will release the turn if its planned utterance has a weak belief, it may select that weak utterance when irst getting the turn (either after a system utterance or at the start of the dialogue).",
        "This may lead to a UFI-Q utterance.",
        "The IDTB system, however, will outbid the same user, resulting in a shorter dialogue.",
        "This situation is shown in Tables 6 and 7.",
        "The dialogue is the same until utterance 3, where the IDTB system wins the turn with a mid bid over the user's low bid.",
        "In the KR environment however, the user gets the turn and performs an unavailable iller inform, which the system must react to.",
        "This is an instance of the second deiciency of the KR approach, where the speaking system should not have released the turn.",
        "The user has the same belief in both scenarios, but the negotiative nature of IDTB enables a shorter dialogues.",

        "Usually, this situation presents itself when the user releases the turn, having randomly chosen the weaker of the two unilled slots.",
        "The system then has the turn for more than one utterance, informing the available illers for two slots.",
        "However, the user already had a strong belief and available top iller for one of those slots, and the system has increased the dialogue length unnecessarily.",
        "In the combined condition, the KR system produces 0.06 unnecessary informs per dialogue, whereas the IDTB system produces 0.045 per dialogue.",
        "The novice and intermediate conditions mirror this (IDTB: 0.009, 0.076 ; KR: 0.019, 0.096 respectfully), but the expert condition does not (IDTB: 0.011, KR: 0.0014).",
        "In this case, the IDTB system wins the turn initially using a low bid and informs one of the strong slots, whereas the expert user initiates the dialogue for the KR environment and unnecessary informs are rarer.",
        "In general, however, the KR approach has more unnecessary informs since the KR system can only infer that one of the user's beliefs was probably weak, otherwise the user would not have released the turn.",
        "The IDTB system handles this situation by using a high bid, allowing the user to outbid the system as its contribution is more important.",

        "This paper presented the Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding model of turn-taking.",
        "The IDTB model is motivated by turn-conflict studies showing that the interest in holding the turn influences conversant turn-cues.",
        "A computational prototype using Reinforcement Learning to choose appropriate turn-bids performs better than the standard KR and SU approaches in an artiicial collaborative dialogue domain.",
        "In short, the Importance-Driven Turn-Bidding model provides a negotiative turn-taking framework that supports mixed-initiative interactions.",
        "In the previous section, we showed that the KR approach is deicient for two reasons: the speaking system might not keep the turn when it should have, and might release the turn when it should not have.",
        "This is driven by KR's speaker-centric nature; the speaker has no way of judging the potential contribution of the listener.",
        "The IDTB approach however, due to its negotiative quality, does not have this problem.",
        "Our performance differences arise from situations when the system is the speaker and the user is the listener.",
        "The IDTB model also excels in the opposite situation, when the system is the listener and the user is the speaker, though our domain is not sophisticated enough for this situation to occur.",
        "In the future we hope to develop a domain with more realistic speech acts and a more difi-cult dialogue task that will, among other things, highlight this situation.",
        "We also plan on implementing a fully functional IDTB system, using an incremental processing architecture that not only detects, but generates, a wide array of turn-cues."
