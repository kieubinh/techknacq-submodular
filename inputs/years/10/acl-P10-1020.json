        "One type of coherence modelling that has captured recent research interest is local coherence modelling, which measures the coherence of a document by examining the similarity between neighbouring text spans.",
        "The entity-based approach, in particular, considers the occurrences of noun phrase entities in a document (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008).",
        "Local coherence modelling has been shown to be useful for tasks like natural language generation and summarization, (Barzilay and Lee, 2004) and genre classification (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008).",
        "Previous work on English, a language with relatively fixed word order, has identified factors that contribute to local coherence, such as the grammatical roles associated with the entities.",
        "There is good reason to believe that the importance of these factors vary across languages.",
        "For instance, freer-word-order languages exhibit word order patterns which are dependent on discourse factors relating to information structure, in addition to the grammatical roles of nominal arguments of the main verb.",
        "We thus expect word order information to be particularly important in these languages in discourse analysis, which includes coherence modelling.",
        "For example, Strube and Hahn (1999) introduce Functional Centering, a variant of Centering Theory which utilizes information status distinctions between hearer-old and hearer-new entities.",
        "They apply their model to pronominal anaphora resolution, identifying potential antecedents of subsequent anaphora by considering syntactic and word order information, classifying constituents by their familiarity to the reader.",
        "They find that their approach correctly resolves more pronominal anaphora than a grammatical role-based approach which ignores word order, and the difference between the two approaches is larger in German corpora than in English ones.",
        "Unfortunately, their criteria for ranking potential antecedents require complex syntactic information in order to classify whether proper names are known to the hearer, which makes their algorithm hard to automate.",
        "Indeed, all evaluation is done manually.",
        "We instead use topological fields, a model of clausal structure which is indicative ofinformation structure in German, but shallow enough to be automatically parsed at high accuracy.",
        "We test the hypothesis that they would provide a good complement or alternative to grammatical roles in local coherence modelling.",
        "We show that they are superior to grammatical roles in a sentence ordering experiment, and in fact outperforms simple word-order information as well.",

      "text": [
        "Topological fields are sequences of one or more contiguous phrases found in an enclosing syntactic region, which is the clause in the case of the German topological field model (Höhle, 1983).",
        "These fields may have constraints on the number of words or phrases they contain, and do not necessarily form a semantically coherent constituent.",
        "In German, the topology serves to identify all of the components of the verbal head of a clause, as well as clause-level structure such as complementizers and subordinating conjunctions.",
        "Topological fields are a useful abstraction of word order, because while Germanic word order is relatively free with respect to grammatical functions, the order of the topological fields is strict and unvarying.",
        "A German clause can be considered to be anchored by two \"brackets\" which contain modals, verbs and complementizers.",
        "The left bracket (linke Klammer, LK) may contain a complementizer, subordinating conjunction, or a finite verb, depending on the clause type, and the right bracket contains the verbal complex (VC).",
        "The other topological fields are defined in relation to these two brackets, and contain all other parts of the clause such as verbal arguments, adjuncts, and discourse cues.",
        "The VF (Vorfeld or \"pre-field\") is so-named because it occurs before the left bracket.",
        "As the first constituent of most matrix clauses in declarative sentences, it has special significance for the coherence of a passage, which we will further discuss below.",
        "The MF (Mittelfeld or \"middle field\") is the field bounded by the two brackets.",
        "Most verb arguments, adverbs, and prepositional phrases are found here, unless they have been fronted and put in the VF, or are prosodically heavy and postposed to the NF field.",
        "The NF (Nachfeld or \"post-field\") contains prosodically heavy elements such as post-posed prepositional phrases or relative clauses, and occasionally postposed noun phrases.",
        "One of the reasons that we use topological fields for local coherence modelling is the role that the VF plays in signalling the information structure of German clauses, as it often contains the topic of the sentence.",
        "In fact, its role is much more complex than being simply the topic position.",
        "Dipper and Zinsmeister (2009) distinguish multiple uses of the VF depending on whether it contains an element related to the surrounding discourse.",
        "They find that 45.1% of VFs are clearly related to the previous context by a reference or discourse relation, and a further 21.9% are deictic and refer to the situation described in the passage in a corpus study.",
        "They also run a sentence insertion experiment where subjects are asked to place an extracted sentence in its original location in a passage.",
        "The authors remark that extracted sentences with VFs that are referentially related to previous context (e.g., they contain a coreferential noun phrase or a discourse relation like \"therefore\") are reinserted at higher accuracies.",
        "Table 1: a) An example of a document from TüBa-D/Z, b) an abbreviated entity grid representation of it, and c) the feature vector representation of the abbreviated entity grid for transitions of length two.",

        "nom: nominative, acc: accusative, oth: dative, oblique, and other arguments",
        "Filippova and Strube (2007c) also examine the role of the VF in local coherence and natural language generation, focusing on the correlation between VFs and sentential topics.",
        "They follow Jacobs (2001) in distinguishing the topic of addres-sation, which is the constituent for which the proposition holds, and frame-setting topics, which is the domain in which the proposition holds, such as a temporal expression.",
        "They show in a user study that frame-setting topics are preferred to topics of addressation in the VF, except when a constituent needs to be established as the topic of ad-dressation.",
        "Coherence",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2008) introduce the entity grid as a method ofrepresenting the coherence ofa document.",
        "Entity grids indicate the location of the occurrences of an entity in a document, which is important for coherence modelling because mentions of an entity tend to appear in clusters of neighbouring or nearby sentences in coherent documents.",
        "This last assumption is adapted from Centering Theory approaches to discourse modelling.",
        "In Barzilay and Lapata (2008), an entity grid is constructed for each document, and is represented as a matrix in which each row represents a sentence, and each column represents an entity.",
        "Thus, a cell in the matrix contains information about an entity in a sentence.",
        "The cell is marked by the presence or absence of the entity, and can also be augmented with other information about the entity in this sentence, such as the grammatical role of the noun phrase representing that entity in that sentence, or the topological field in which the noun phrase appears.",
        "Consider the document in Table 1.",
        "An entity grid representation which incorporates the syntactic role of the noun phrase in which the entity appears is also shown (not all entities are listed for brevity).",
        "We tabulate the transitions of entities between different syntactic positions (or their non-occurrence) in sentences, and convert the frequencies of transitions into a feature vector representation of transition probabilities in the document.",

        "The first 100 articles are used for testing, the next 200 for development, and the rest for training.",
        "The baseline generation system already incorporates topological field information into the constituent ordering process.",
        "The system operates in two steps.",
        "First, in main clauses, one constituent is selected as the Vorfeld (VF).",

        "Significantly, Filippova and Strube (2007b) found that selecting the VF first, and then ordering the remaining constituents results in a 9% absolute improvement over the corresponding model where the selection is performed in one step by the sorting algorithm alone.",
        "The maximum entropy model for both steps rely on the following features:",
        "• features on the voice, valency, and identity of the main verb of the clause",
        "• features on the morphological and syntactic status of the constituent to be ordered",
        "• whether the constituent occurs in the preceding sentence",
        "• features for whether the constituent contains a determiner, an anaphoric pronoun, or a relative clause",
        "• the size of the constituent in number of modifiers, in depth, and in number of words",
        "• the semantic class of the constituent (person, temporal, location, etc.)",
        "The biographee, in particular, is marked by its own semantic class.",
        "In the first VF selection step, MAXENT simply produces a probability of each constituent being a VF, and the constituent with the highest probability is selected.",
        "In the second step, MAXENT2 takes the featural representation of two constituents, and produces an output probability of the first constituent preceding the second constituent.",
        "The final ordering is achieved by first randomizing the order of the constituents in a clause (besides the first one, which is selected to be the VF), then sorting them according to the precedence probabilities.",
        "Specifically, a constituent A is put before a constituent B if MAXENT2(A,B) > 0.5.",
        "Because this precedence relation is not antisymmetric (i.e., MAXENT2(A,B) > 0.5 and MAXENT2(B,A) > 0.5 may be simultaneously true or simultaneously false), different initializations of the order produce different sorted results.",
        "In our experiments, we correct this by defining the precedence relation to be A precedes B iff MAXENT2(A,B) > MAXENT2 (B,A).",
        "This change does not greatly impact the performance, and removes the randomized element ofthe algorithm.",
        "The baseline system does not directly model the context when ordering constituents.",
        "All of the features but one in the original maximum entropy models rely on local properties of the clause.",

        "Specifically, we add features indicating the topological fields in which entities occur in the previous sentences.",
        "We found that looking back up to two sentences produces the best results (by tuning on the development set).",
        "Because this corpus does not come with general coreference information except for the coreference chain of the biographee, we use the semantic classes instead.",
        "So, all constituents in the same semantic class are treated as one coreference chain.",
        "An example ofa feature may be biog-last2, which takes on a value such as 'v – ', meaning that this constituent refers to the biographee, and the biographee occurs in the VF two clauses ago (v), but does not appear in the previous clause ( – ).",
        "For a constituent which is not the biographee, this feature would be marked",

        "Table 5 shows the results of adding these contextual features into the maximum entropy models.",
        "We see that we obtain a small improvement in the accuracy of VF selection, and in the accuracy of correctly ordering the entire clause.",
        "These improvements are not statistically significant by Mc-Nemar's test.",

        "We have shown that topological fields are a useful source of information for local coherence modelling.",

        "Applying our local coherence model in another setting, we have embedded topological field transitions of entities into an NLG system which orders constituents in German clauses.",
        "We find that the coherence-enhanced model slightly outperforms the baseline system, but this was not statistically significant.",
        "We suggest that the utility of topological fields in local coherence modelling comes from the interaction between word order and information structure in freer-word-order languages.",
        "Crucially, topological fields take into account issues such as coordination, appositives, sentential fragments and differences in clause types, which word order alone does not.",
        "They are also shallow enough to be accurately parsed automatically for use in resource-poor applications.",
        "Further refinement of the topological field annotations to take advantage of the fact that they do not correspond neatly to any single information status such as topic or focus could provide additional performance gains.",
