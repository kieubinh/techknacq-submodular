        "It also encourages us to approach related problems as discrete tasks, when a new data set that adds deeper information establishes a new incompatible evaluation.",
        "Direct comparison has been central to progress in statistical parsing, but it has also caused problems.",
        "Treebanking is a difficult engineering task: coverage, cost, consistency and granularity are all competing concerns that must be balanced against each other when the annotation scheme is developed.",
        "The difficulty of the task means that we ought to view treebanking as an ongoing process akin to grammar development, such as the many years of work on the erg (Flickinger, 2000).",
        "This paper demonstrates how a treebank can be rebanked to incorporate novel analyses and information from existing resources.",
        "We chose to work on CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007), a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000) treebank acquired from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",

        "Our first changes integrate four previously suggested improvements to CCGbank.",
        "We then describe a novel ccg analysis of NP predicate-argument structure, which we implement using NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004).",
        "Our analysis allows the distinction between core and peripheral arguments to be represented for predicate nouns.",
        "With this distinction, an entailment recognition system could recognise that Google's acquisition ofYouTube entailed Google acquired YouTube, because equivalent predicate-argument structures are built for both.",

        "Formalisms like hpsg (Pollard and Sag, 1994), lfg (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982), and ccg (Steed-man, 2000) are linguistically motivated in the sense that they attempt to explain and predict the limited variation found in the grammars of natural languages.",
        "They also attempt to specify how grammars construct semantic representations from surface strings, which is why they are sometimes referred to as deep grammars.",
        "Analyses produced by these formalisms can be more detailed than those produced by skeletal phrase-structure parsers, because they produce fully specified predicate-argument structures.",
        "Unfortunately, statistical parsers do not take advantage of this potential detail.",
        "Statistical parsers induce their grammars from corpora, and the corpora for linguistically motivated formalisms currently do not contain high quality predicate-argument annotation, because they were derived from the Penn Treebank (ptb Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Manually written grammars for these formalisms, such as the erg hpsg grammar (Flickinger, 2000) and the xle lfg grammar (Butt et al., 2006) produce far more detailed and linguistically correct analyses than any English statistical parser, due to the comparatively coarse-grained annotation schemes of the corpora statistical parsers are trained on.",
        "While rule-based parsers use grammars that are carefully engineered (e.g. Oepen et al., 2004), and can be updated to reflect the best linguistic analyses, statistical parsers have so far had to take what they are given.",
        "What we suggest in this paper is that a treebank's grammar need not last its lifetime.",
        "For a start, there have been many annotations of the ptb that add much of the extra information needed to produce very high quality analyses for a linguistically motivated grammar.",
        "There are also other transformations which can be made with no additional information.",
        "That is, sometimes the existing trees allow transformation rules to be written that improve the quality of the grammar.",
        "Linguistic theories are constantly changing, which means that there is a substantial lag between what we (think we) understand of grammar and the annotations in our corpora.",
        "The grammar engineering process we describe, which we dub rebanking, is intended to reduce this gap, tightening the feedback loop between formal and computational linguistics.",
        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccg; Steed-man, 2000) is a lexicalised grammar, which means that all grammatical dependencies are specified in the lexical entries and that the production of derivations is governed by a small set of rules.",
        "Lexical categories are either atomic (S, NP, PP, N), or a functor consisting of a result, directional slash, and argument.",
        "For instance, in might head a PP-typed constituent with one NP-typed argument, written as PP / NP.",
        "A category can have a functor as its result, so that a word can have a complex valency structure.",
        "For instance, a verb phrase is represented by the category S \\NP : it is a function from a leftward NP (a subject) to a sentence.",
        "A transitive verb requires an object to become a verb phrase, producing the category (S\\NP)/NP.",
        "A ccg grammar consists of a small number of schematic rules, called combinators.",

        "In wide-coverage descriptions, categories are generally modelled as typed-feature structures (Shieber, 1986), rather than atomic symbols.",

        "The structure of such compound noun phrases is left underspecified in the Penn Treebank (ptb), because the annotation procedure involved stitching together partial parses produced by the Fid-ditch parser (Hindle, 1983), which produced flat brackets for these constructions.",
