        "The distinction between core arguments (henceforth, cores) and adjuncts is included in most theories on argument structure (Dowty, 2000).",
        "The distinction can be viewed syntactically, as one between obligatory and optional arguments, or semantically, as one between arguments whose meanings are predicate dependent and independent.",
        "The latter (cores) are those whose function in the described event is to a large extent determined by the predicate, and are obligatory.",
        "Adjuncts are optional arguments which, like adverbs, modify the meaning of the described event in a predictable or predicate-independent manner.",

        "roles are more predicate-specific, e.g., [on his colleague] has a different meaning with the verbs 'operate' and 'count'.",
        "Sometimes the same argument plays a different role in different sentences.",
        "In (3), [in the park] places a well-defined situation (Yuri playing football) in a certain location.",
        "However, in \"The troops are based [in the park]\", the same argument is obligatory, since being based requires a place to be based in.",
        "Distinguishing between the two argument types has been discussed extensively in various formulations in the NLP literature, notably in PP attachment, semantic role labeling (SRL) and subcatego-rization acquisition.",
        "However, no work has tackled it yet in a fully unsupervised scenario.",
        "Unsupervised models reduce reliance on the costly and error prone manual multilayer annotation (POS tagging, parsing, core-adjunct tagging) commonly used for this task.",

        "PropBank (PB) (Palmer et al., 2005) is a widely used corpus, providing SRL annotation for the entire WSJ Penn Treebank.",
        "Its core labels are predicate specific, while adjunct (or modifiers under their terminology) labels are shared across predicates.",
        "The adjuncts are subcategorized into several classes, the most frequent of which are locative, temporal and manner.",
        "The organization of PropBank is based on the notion of diathesis alternations, which are (roughly) defined to be alternations between two subcategorization frames that preserve meaning or change it systematically.",
        "The frames in which each verb appears were collected and sets of alternating frames were defined.",
        "Each such set was assumed to have a unique set of roles, named 'role-set'.",
        "These roles include all roles appearing in any of the frames, except of those defined as adjuncts.",
        "Adjuncts are defined to be optional arguments appearing with a wide variety of verbs and frames.",
        "They can be viewed as fixed points with respect to alternations, i.e., as arguments that do not change their place or slot when the frame undergoes an alternation.",
        "This follows the notions of optionality and compositionality that define adjuncts.",
        "Detecting diathesis alternations automatically is difficult (McCarthy, 2001), requiring an initial acquisition of a subcategorization lexicon.",
        "This alone is a challenging task tackled in the past using supervised parsers (see below).",
        "FrameNet.",
        "FrameNet (FN) (Baker et al., 1998) is a large-scale lexicon based on frame semantics.",
        "It takes a different approach from PB to semantic roles.",
        "Like PB, it distinguishes between core and non-core arguments, but it does so for each and every frame separately.",
        "It does not commit that a semantic role is consistently tagged as a core or a non-core across frames.",
        "For example, the semantic role 'path' is considered core in the 'Self Motion' frame, but as non-core in the 'Placing' frame.",
        "Another difference is that FN does not allow any type of non-core argument to attach to a given frame.",
        "For instance, while the 'Getting' frame allows a 'Duration' non-core argument, the 'Active Perception' frame does not.",
        "PB and FN tend to agree in clear (prototypical) cases, but to differ in others.",
        "For instance, both schemes would tag \"Yuri played football [in the park]\" as an adjunct and \"The commander placed a guard [in the park]\" as a core.",
        "However, in \"He walked [into his office]\", the marked argument is tagged as a directional adjunct in PB but as a 'Direction' core in FN.",
        "Under both schemes, non-cores are usually confined to a few specific semantic domains, notably time, place and manner, in contrast to cores that are not restricted in their scope of applicability.",
        "This approach is quite common, e.g., the",
        "COBUILD English grammar (Willis, 2004) categorizes adjuncts to be of manner, aspect, opinion, place, time, frequency, duration, degree, extent, emphasis, focus and probability.",
        "Semantic Role Labeling.",
        "Work in SRL does not tackle the core-adjunct task separately but as part of general argument classification.",
        "Supervised approaches obtain an almost perfect score in distinguishing between the two in an in-domain scenario.",
        "For instance, the confusion matrix in (Toutanova et al., 2008) indicates that their model scores 99.5% accuracy on this task.",
        "However, adaptation results are lower, with the best two models in the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005) achieving 95.3% (Pradhan et al., 2008) and 95.6% (Punyakanok et al., 2008) accuracy in an adaptation between the relatively similar corpora WSJ and Brown.",
        "Despite the high performance in supervised scenarios, tackling the task in an unsupervised manner is not easy.",
        "The success ofsupervised methods stems from the fact that the predicate-slot combination (slot is represented in this paper by its preposition) strongly determines whether a given argument is an adjunct or a core (see Section 3.4).",
        "Supervised models are provided with an annotated corpus from which they can easily learn the mapping between predicate-slot pairs and their core/adjunct label.",
        "However, induction of the mapping in an unsupervised manner must be based on inherent core-adjunct properties.",
        "In addition, supervised models utilize supervised parsers and POS taggers, while the current state-of-the-art in unsupervised parsing and POS tagging is considerably worse than their supervised counterparts.",
        "This challenge has some resemblance to unsupervised detection of multiword expressions (MWEs).",
        "An important MWE subclass is that of phrasal verbs, which are also characterized by verb-preposition pairs (Li et al., 2003; Sporleder and Li, 2009) (see also (Boukobza and Rappoport, 2009)).",
        "Both tasks aim to determine semantic compositionality, which is a highly challenging task.",
        "Few works addressed unsupervised SRL-related tasks.",
        "The setup of (Grenager and Manning, 2006), who presented a Bayesian Network model for argument classification, is perhaps closest to ours.",
        "Their work relied on a supervised parser and a rule-based argument identification (both during training and testing).",
        "Swier and Stevenson (2004, 2005), while addressing an unsupervised SRL task, greatly differ from us as their algorithm uses the VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) verb lexicon, in addition to supervised parses.",
        "Finally, Abend et al.",
        "(2009) tackled the argument identification task alone and did not perform argument classification of any sort.",
        "PP attachment.",
        "PP attachment is the task of determining whether a prepositional phrase which immediately follows a noun phrase attaches to the latter or to the preceding verb.",
        "This task's relation to the core-adjunct distinction was addressed in several works.",
        "For instance, the results of (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) indicate that their PP attachment system works better for cores than for adjuncts.",
        "Merlo and Esteve Ferrer (2006) suggest a system that jointly tackles the PP attachment and the core-adjunct distinction tasks.",
        "Unlike in this work, their classifier requires extensive supervision including WordNet, language-specific features and a supervised parser.",
        "Their features are generally motivated by common linguistic considerations.",
        "Features found adaptable to a completely unsupervised scenario are used in this work as well.",
        "Syntactic Parsing.",
        "The core-adjunct distinction is included in many syntactic annotation schemes.",
        "Although the Penn Treebank does not explicitly annotate adjuncts and cores, a few works suggested mapping its annotation (including function tags) to core-adjunct labels.",
        "Such a mapping was presented in (Collins, 1999).",
        "In his Model 2, Collins modifies his parser to provide a core-adjunct prediction, thereby improving its performance.",
        "The Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) formulation models the core-adjunct distinction explicitly.",
        "Therefore, any CCG parser can be used as a core-adjunct classifier (Hockenmaier, 2003).",
        "Subcategorization Acquisition.",
        "This task specifies for each predicate the number, type and order of obligatory arguments.",
        "Determining the allowable subcategorization frames for a given predicate necessarily involves separating its cores from its allowable adjuncts (which are not framed).",
        "Notable works in the field include (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Sarkar and Zeman, 2000; Korhonen, 2002).",
        "All these works used a parsed corpus in order to collect, for each predicate, a set of hypothesized subcategorization frames, to be filtered by hypothesis testing methods.",
        "This line of work differs from ours in a few aspects.",
        "First, all works use manual or supervised syntactic annotations, usually including a POS tagger.",
        "Second, the common approach to the task focuses on syntax and tries to identify the entire frame, rather than to tag each argument separately.",
        "Finally, most works address the task at the verb type level, trying to detect the allowable frames for each type.",
        "Consequently, the common evaluation focuses on the quality of the allowable frames acquired for each verb type, and not on the classification of specific arguments in a given corpus.",
        "Such a token level evaluation was conducted in a few works (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Sarkar and Zeman, 2000), but often with a small number of verbs or a small number of frames.",
        "A discussion of the differences between type and token level evaluation can be found in (Reichart et al., 2010).",
        "The core-adjunct distinction task was tackled in the context of child language acquisition.",
        "Villav-icencio (2002) developed a classifier based on preposition selection and frequency information for modeling the distinction for locative prepositional phrases.",
        "Her approach is not entirely corpus based, as it assumes the input sentences are given in a basic logical form.",
        "The study of prepositions is a vibrant research area inNLP.",
        "A special issue of Computational Linguistics, which includes an extensive survey of related work, was recently devoted to the field (Baldwin et al., 2009)."

        "The length of test sentences is not bounded.",
        "Our results will show that the training data accounts well for the argument realization phenomena in the test set, despite the length bound on its sentences.",

        "Our approach makes use of both aspects of the distinction - obligatoriness and compositionality.",
        "We define three measures, one quantifying the obligatoriness of the slot, another quantifying the selectional preference of the verb to the argument and a third that quantifies the association between the head word and the slot irrespective of the predicate (Section 3.3).",
        "The measures' predictions are expected to coincide in clear cases, but may be less successful in others.",
        "Therefore, an ensemble-based method is used to combine the three measures into a single classifier.",

        "A self-training step is now performed to increase coverage with only a minor deterioration in accuracy (Section 3.4).",
        "We focus on prepositional arguments.",
        "Non-prepositional arguments in English tend to be cores (e.g., in more than 85% of the cases in PB sections 2-21), while prepositional arguments tend to be equally divided between cores and adjuncts.",
        "The difficulty of the task thus lies in the classification of prepositional arguments.",
        "The statistical measures used by our classifier are based on the (predicate, slot, argument head) (PSH) joint distribution.",
        "This section details the process of extracting samples from this joint distribution given a raw text corpus.",
        "We start by parsing the corpus using the Seginer parser (Seginer, 2007).",
        "This parser is unique in its ability to induce a bracketing (unlabeled parsing) from raw text (without even using POS tags) with strong results.",
        "Its high speed (thousands of words per second) allows us to use millions ofsentences, a prohibitive number for other parsers.",
        "We continue by tagging the corpus using Clark's unsupervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) and the unsupervised Prototype Tagger (Abend et al., 2010).",
        "The classes corresponding to prepositions and to verbs are manually selected from the induced clusters.",
        "A preposition is defined to be any word which is the first word of an argument and belongs to a prepositions cluster.",
        "A verb is any word belonging to a verb cluster.",
        "This manual selection requires only a minute, since the number of classes is very small (34 in our experiments).",
        "In addition, knowing what is considered a preposition is part of the task definition itself.",
        "Argument identification is hard even for supervised models and is considerably more so for unsupervised ones (Abend et al., 2009).",
        "We therefore confine ourselves to sentences of length not greater than 10 (excluding punctuation) which contain a single verb.",
        "A sequence of words will be marked as an argument of the verb if it is a constituent that does not contain the verb (according to the unsupervised parse tree), whose parent is an ancestor of the verb.",
        "This follows the pruning heuristic of (Xue and Palmer, 2004) often used by SRL algorithms.",
        "The corpus is now tagged using an unsupervised POS tagger.",
        "Since the sentences in question are short, we consider every word which does not belong to a closed class cluster as a head word (an argument can have several head words).",
        "A closed class is a class of function words with relatively few word types, each of which is very frequent.",
        "Typical examples include determiners, prepositions and conjunctions.",
        "A class which is notclosed is open.",
        "In this paper, we define closed classes to be clusters in which the ratio between the number of word tokens and the number of word types exceeds a threshold T.",

        "In case an argument has several head words, each of them is considered as an independent sample.",

        "We now compute the following measures.",
        "Selectional Preference (SP).",

        "The similarity measure we use is based on the slot distributions of the arguments.",
        "That is, two arguments are considered similar if they tend to appear in the same slots.",
        "Each head word h is assigned a vector where each coordinate corresponds to a slot s. The value ofthe coordinate is the number of times h appeared in s, i.e. Ep-N(p', s, h) (p is summed over all predicates).",
        "The similarity measure between two head words is then defined as the cosine measure of their vectors.",
        "Since arguments in the test set can be quite long, not every open class word in the argument is taken to be a head word.",
        "Instead, only those appearing in the top level (depth = 1) of the argument under its unsupervised parse tree are taken.",
        "In case there are no such open class words, we take those appearing in depth 2.",
        "The selectional preference of the whole argument is then defined to be the arithmetic mean of this measure over all of its head words.",

        "We use the Pointwise Mutual Information measure (PMI) to capture the slot and the predicate's collocation tendency.",
        "Let p be a predicate and s a slot, then:",
        "Since there is only a meager number of possible slots (that is, of prepositions), estimating the (predicate, slot) distribution can be made by the maximum likelihood estimator with manageable sparsity.",
        "In order not to bias the counts towards predicates which tend to take more arguments, we define here N(p,s) to be the number of times the ( p, s) pair occurred in the training corpus, irrespective of the number of head words the argument had (and not e.g., ZhN(p,s,h)).",
        "Arguments with no prepositions are included in these counts as well (with s = NULL), so not to bias against predicates which tend to have less non-prepositional arguments.",
        "Argument-Slot Collocation.",
        "Adjuncts tend to belong to one of a few specific semantic domains (see Section 2).",
        "Therefore, if an argument tends to appear in a certain slot in many of its instances, it is an indication that this argument tends to have a consistent semantic flavor in most of its instances.",
        "In this case, the argument and the preposition can be viewed as forming a unit on their own, independent of the predicate with which they appear.",
        "We therefore expect such arguments to be adjuncts.",
        "We formalize this notion using the following measure.",
        "Let p, s, h be a predicate, a slot and a head word respectively.",

        "In order to turn these measures into classifiers, we set a threshold below which arguments are marked as adjuncts and above which as cores.",
        "In order to avoid tuning a parameter for each of the measures, we set the threshold as the median value of this measure in the test set.",
        "That is, we find the threshold which tags half of the arguments as cores and half as adjuncts.",
        "This relies on the prior knowledge that prepositional arguments are roughly equally divided between cores and adjuncts.",
        "The algorithm proceeds to integrate the predictions of the weak classifiers into a single classifier.",
        "We use an ensemble method (Breiman, 1996).",
        "Each of the classifiers may either classify an argument as an adjunct, classify it as a core, or abstain.",
        "In order to obtain a high accuracy classifier, to be used for self-training below, the ensemble classifier only tags arguments for which none of the classifiers abstained, i.e., when sufficient information was available to make all three predictions.",
        "The prediction is determined by the majority vote.",
        "The ensemble classifier has high precision but low coverage.",
        "In order to increase its coverage, a self-training step is performed.",
        "We observe that a predicate and a slot generally determine whether the argument is a core or an adjunct.",
        "For instance, in our development data, a classifier which assigns all arguments that share a predicate and a slot their most common label, yields 94.3% accuracy on the pairs appearing at least 5 times.",
        "This property of the core-adjunct distinction greatly simplifies the task for supervised algorithms (see Section 2).",
