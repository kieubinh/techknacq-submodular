        "The availability of large scale semantic lexicons, such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), allowed the adoption of a wide family of learning paradigms in the automation of semantic parsing.",
        "Building upon the so called frame semantic model (Fillmore, 1985), the Berkeley FrameNet project has developed a semantic lexicon for the core vocabulary of English, since 1997.",
        "A frame is evoked in texts through the occurrence of its lexical units (LU), i.e. predicate words such verbs, nouns, or adjectives, and specifies the participants and properties of the situation it describes, the so called frame elements (FEs).",
        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of automatic recognition of individual predicates together with their major roles (e.g. frame elements) as they are grammatically realized in input sentences.",
        "It has been a popular task since the availability of the PropBank and FrameNet annotated corpora (Palmer et al., 2005), the seminal work of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) and the successful CoNLL evaluation campaigns (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "Statistical machine learning methods, ranging from joint probabilistic models to support vector machines, have been successfully adopted to provide very accurate semantic labeling, e.g. (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "SRL based on FrameNet is thus not a novel task, although very few systems are known capable of completing a general frame-based annotation process over raw texts, noticeable exceptions being discussed for example in (Erk and Pado, 2006), (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) and (Coppola et al., 2009).",
        "Some critical limitations have been outlined in literature, some of them independent from the underlying semantic paradigm.",
        "Parsing Accuracy.",
        "Most of the employed learning algorithms are based on complex sets of syntagmatic features, as deeply investigated in (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b).",
        "The resulting recognition is thus highly dependent on the accuracy of the underlying parser, whereas wrong structures returned by the parser usually imply large misclassification errors.",
        "Annotation costs.",
        "Statistical learning approaches applied to SRL are very demanding with respect to the amount and quality of the training material.",
        "The complex SRL architectures proposed (usually combining local and global, i.e. joint, models of argument classification, e.g. (Toutanova et al., 2008)) require a large number of annotated examples.",
        "The amount and quality of the training data required to reach a significant accuracy is a serious limitation to the exploitation of SRL in many NLP applications.",
        "Limited Linguistic Generalization.",
        "Several studies showed that even when large training sets exist the corresponding learning exhibits poor generalization power.",
        "Most of the CoNLL 2005 systems show a significant performance drop when the tested corpus, i.e. Brown, differs from the training one (i.e. Wall Street Journal), e.g. (Toutanova et al., 2008).",
        "More recently, the state-of-art frame-based semantic role labeling system discussed in (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) reports a 19% drop in accuracy for the argument classification task when a different test domain is targeted (i.e. NTI corpus).",
        "Out-of-domain tests seem to suggest the models trained on BNC do not generalize well to novel grammatical and lexical phenomena.",
        "As also suggested in (Pradhan et al., 2008), the major drawback is the poor generalization power affecting lexical features.",
        "Notice how this is also a general problem ofstatistical learning processes, as large fine grain feature sets are more exposed to the risks of overfitting.",
        "The above problems are particularly critical for frame-based shallow semantic parsing where, as opposed to more syntactic-oriented semantic labeling schemes (as Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005)), a significant mismatch exists between the semantic descriptors and the underlying syntactic annotation level.",
        "In (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) an upper bound of about 83.9% for the accuracy of the argument identification task is reported, it is due to the complexity in projecting frame element boundaries out from the dependency graph: more than 16% of the roles in the annotated material lack of a clear grammatical status.",
        "The limited level of linguistic generalization outlined above is still an open research problem.",
        "Existing solutions have been proposed in literature along different lines.",
        "Learning from richer linguistic descriptions of more complex structures is proposed in (Toutanova et al., 2008).",
        "Limiting the cost required for developing large domain-specific training data sets has been also studied, e.g., (Fürstenau and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Finally, the application of semi-supervised learning is attempted to increase the lexical expressiveness of the model, e.g. (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2009).",
        "In this paper, this last direction is pursued.",
        "A semi-supervised statistical model exploiting useful lexical information from unlabeled corpora is proposed.",
        "The model adopts a simple feature space by relying on a limited set of grammatical properties, thus reducing its learning capacity.",
        "Moreover, it generalizes lexical information about the annotated examples by applying a geometrical model, in a Latent Semantic Analysis style, inspired by a distributional paradigm (Padó and Lapata, 2007).",
        "As we will see, the accuracy reachable through a restricted feature space is still quite close to the state-of-art, but interestingly the performance drops in out-of-domain tests are avoided.",
        "In the following, after discussing existing approaches to SRL (Section 2), a distributional approach is defined in Section 3.",
        "Section 3.2 discusses the proposed HMM-based treatment of joint inferences in argument classification.",

        "SRL proceeds through two main steps: the localization of arguments in a sentence, called boundary detection (BD), and the assignment of the proper role to the detected constituents, that is the argument classification, (AC) step.",
        "In (Toutanova et al., 2008) a SRL model over Propbank that effectively exploits the semantic argument frame as a joint structure, is presented.",
        "It incorporates strong dependencies within a comprehensive statistical joint model with a rich set of features over multiple argument phrases.",
        "This approach effectively introduces a new step in SRL, also called Joint Re-ranking, (RR), e.g. (Toutanova et al., 2008) or (Moschitti et al., 2008).",
        "First local models are applied to produce role labels over individual arguments, then the joint model is used to decide the entire argument sequence among the set of the n-best competing solutions.",
        "While these approaches increase the expressive power of the models to capture more general linguistic properties, they rely on complex feature sets, are more demanding about the amount of training information and increase the overall exposure to overfitting effects.",
        "In (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) the impact of different grammatical representations on the task of frame-based shallow semantic parsing is studied and the poor lexical generalization problem is outlined.",
        "An argument classification accuracy of 89.9% over the FrameNet (i.e. BNC) dataset is shown to decrease to 71.1% when a different test domain is evaluated (i.e. the Nuclear Threat Initiative corpus).",
        "The argument classification component is thus shown to be heavily domain-dependent whereas the inclusion of grammatical function features is just able to mitigate this sensitivity.",
        "In line with (Pradhan et al., 2008), it is suggested that lexical features are domain specific and their suitable generalization is not achieved.",
        "The lack of suitable lexical information is also discussed in (Fürstenau and Lapata, 2009) through an approach aiming to support the creation of novel annotated resources.",
        "Accordingly a semi-supervised approach for reducing the costs of the manual annotation effort is proposed.",
        "Through a graph alignment algorithm triggered by annotated resources, the method acquires training instances from an unlabeled corpus also for verbs not listed as existing FrameNet predicates.",
        "It is widely accepted that lexical information (as features directly derived from word forms) is crucial for training accurate systems in a number of NLP tasks.",
        "Indeed, all the best systems in the CoNLL shared task competitions (e.g. Chunking (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000)) make extensive use of lexical information.",
        "Also lexical features are beneficial in SRL usually either for systems on Propbank as well as for FrameNet-based annotation.",
        "In (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2009), a different strategy to incorporate lexical features into classification models is proposed.",
        "A more expressive training algorithm (i.e. anchored SVM) coupled with an aggressive feature pruning strategy is shown to achieve high accuracy over a chunking and named entity recognition task.",
        "The suggested perspective here is that effective semantic knowledge can be collected from sources external to the annotated corpora (very large unanno-tated corpora or on manually constructed lexical resources) rather than learned from the raw lexical counts of the annotated corpus.",
        "Notice how this is also the strategy pursued in recent work on deep learning approaches to NLP tasks.",
        "In (Col-lobert and Weston, 2008) a unified architecture for Natural Language Processing that learns features relevant to the tasks at hand given very limited prior knowledge is presented.",
        "It embodies the idea that a multitask learning architecture coupled with semi-supervised learning can be effectively applied even to complex linguistic tasks such as SRL.",
        "In particular, (Collobert and Weston, 2008) proposes an embedding of lexical information using Wikipedia as source, and exploiting the resulting language model within the multitask learning process.",
        "The idea of (Collobert and Weston, 2008) to obtain an embedding of lexical information by acquiring a language model from unlabeled data is an interesting approach to the problem of performance degradation in out-of-domain tests, as already pursued by (Deschacht and Moens, 2009).",
        "The extensive use of unlabeled texts allows to achieve a significant level of lexical generalization that seems better capitalize the smaller annotated data sets."
