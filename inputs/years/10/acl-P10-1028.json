        "Search queries present a particular challenge for traditional spelling correction methods for three main reasons (Ahmad and Kondrak, 2004).",
        "First, spelling errors are more common in search queries than in regular written text: roughly 10-15% of queries contain misspelled terms (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004).",
        "Second, most search queries consist of a few key words rather than grammatical sentences, making a grammar-based approach inappropriate.",
        "Most importantly, many queries contain search terms, such as proper nouns and names, which are not well established in the language.",
        "For example, Chen et al.",
        "(2007) reported that 16.5% of valid search terms do not occur in their 200K-entry spelling lexicon.",
        "Therefore, recent research has focused on the use of Web corpora and query logs, rather than human-compiled lexicons, to infer knowledge about misspellings and word usage in search queries (e.g., Whitelaw et al., 2009).",
        "Another important data source that would be useful for this purpose is clickthrough data.",
        "Although it is well-known that clickthrough data contain rich information about users' search behavior, e.g., how a user (re-) formulates a query in order to find the relevant document, there has been little research on exploiting the data for the development of a query speller system.",
        "In this paper we present a novel method of extracting large amounts of query-correction pairs from the clickthrough data.",
        "These pairs, implicitly judged by millions of users, are used to train a set of spelling error models.",
        "Among these models, the most effective one is a phrase-based error model that captures the probability of transforming one multi-term phrase into another multi-term phrase.",
        "Comparing to traditional error models that account for transformation probabilities between single characters (Kernighan et al., 1990) or sub-word strings (Brill and Moore, 2000), the phrase-based model is more powerful in that it captures some contextual information by retaining inter-term dependencies.",
        "We show that this information is crucial to detect the correction of a query term, because unlike in regular written text, any query word can be a valid search term and in many cases the only way for a speller system to make the judgment is to explore its usage according to the contextual information.",

        "query-correction pairs.",
        "Results show that the error models learned from clickthrough data lead to significant improvements on the task of query spelling correction.",
        "In particular, the speller system incorporating a phrase-based error model significantly outperforms its baseline systems.",

        "Spelling correction for regular written text is a long standing research topic.",
        "Previous researches can be roughly grouped into two categories: correcting non-word errors and real-word errors.",
        "In non-word error spelling correction, any word that is not found in a pre-compiled lexicon is considered to be misspelled.",
        "Then, a list of lexical words that are similar to the misspelled word are proposed as candidate spelling corrections.",
        "Most traditional systems use a manually tuned similarity function (e.g., edit distance function) to rank the candidates, as reviewed by Kukich (1992).",
        "During the last two decades, statistical error models learned on training data (i.e., query-correction pairs) have become increasingly popular, and have proven more effective (Kernighan et al., 1990; Brill and Moore, 2000; Tou-tanova and Moore, 2002; Okazaki et al., 2008).",
        "Real-word spelling correction is also referred to as context sensitive spelling correction (CSSC).",
        "It tries to detect incorrect usages of a valid word based on its context, such as \"peace\" and \"piece\" in the context \"a _ of cake\".",
        "A common strategy in CSSC is as follows.",
        "First, a predefined confusion set is used to generate candidate corrections, then a scoring model, such as a trigram language model or naïve Bayes classifier, is used to rank the candidates according to their context (e.g.,",
        "Church et al., 2007).",
        "When designed to handle regular written text, both CSSC and non-word error speller systems rely on a predefined vocabulary (i.e., either a lexicon or a confusion set).",
        "However, in query spelling correction, it is impossible to compile such a vocabulary, and the boundary between the non-word and real-word errors is quite vague.",
        "Therefore, recent research on query spelling correction has focused on exploiting noisy Web data and query logs to infer knowledge about misspellings and word usage in search queries.",
        "Cucerzan and Brill (2004) discuss in detail the challenges of query spelling correction, and suggest the use of query logs.",
        "Ahmad and Kon-drak (2005) propose a method of estimating an error model from query logs using the EM algorithm.",

        "(2006) extend the error model by capturing word-level similarities learned from query logs.",
        "Chen et al.",

        "Whitelaw et al.",
        "(2009) present a query speller system in which both the error model and the language model are trained using Web data.",
        "Compared to Web corpora and query logs, clickthrough data contain much richer information about users' search behavior.",
        "Although there has been a lot of research on using clickthrough data to improve Web document retrieval (e.g., Joachims, 2002; Agichtein et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2009), the data have not been fully explored for query spelling correction.",
        "This study tries to learn error models from clickthrough data.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first such attempt using clickthrough data.",
        "Most of the speller systems reviewed above are based on the framework of the source channel model.",
        "Typically, a language model (source model) is used to capture contextual information, while an error model (channel model) is considered to be context free in that it does not take into account any contextual information in modeling word transformation probabilities.",
        "In this study we argue that it is beneficial to capture contextual information in the error model.",
        "To this end, inspired by the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), we propose a phrase-based error model where we assume that query spelling correction is performed at the phrase level.",
        "In what follows, before presenting the phrase-based error model, we will first describe the clickthrough data and the query speller system we used in this study."

        "This section describes the way the query-correction pairs are extracted from clickthrough data.",
        "Two types of clickthrough data are explored in our experiment.",
        "The clickthrough data of the first type has been widely used in previous research and proved to be useful for Web search (Joachims, 2002; Agichtein et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2009) and query reformulation (Wang and Zhai, 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009).",
        "We start with this same data with the hope of achieving similar improvements in our task.",
        "The data consist of a set of query sessions that were extracted from one year of log files from a commercial Web search engine.",
        "A query session contains a query issued by a user and a ranked list of links (i.e., URLs) returned to that same user along with records of which URLs were clicked.",
        "Following Suzuki et al.",
        "(2009), we extract query-correction pairs as follows.",
        "First, we extract pairs of queries Q1 and Q2 such that (1) they are issued by the same user; (2) Q2 was issued within 3 minutes of Q1; and (3) Q2 contained at least one clicked URL in the result page while Qi did not result in any clicks.",
        "We then scored each query pair (Q1, Q2) using the edit distance between Q1and Q2, and retained those with an edit distance score lower than a pre-set threshold as query correction pairs.",
        "Unfortunately, we found in our experiments that the pairs extracted using the method are too noisy for reliable error model training, even with a very tight threshold, and we did not see any significant improvement.",
        "Therefore, in Section 6 we will not report results using this dataset.",
        "The clickthrough data of the second type consists of a set of query reformulation sessions extracted from 3 months of log files from a commercial Web browser.",
        "A query reformulation session contains a list of URLs that record user behaviors that relate to the query reformulation functions, provided by a Web search engine.",
        "For example, almost all commercial search engines offer the \"did you mean\" function, suggesting a possible alternate interpretation or spelling of a user-issued query.",
        "Figure 1 shows a sample of the query reformulation sessions that record the \"did you mean\" sessions from three of the most popular search engines.",

        "Compared to the pairs extracted from the clickthrough data of the first type (query sessions), this data set is much cleaner because all these spelling corrections are actually clicked, and thus judged implicitly, by many users.",
        "In addition to the \"did you mean\" function, recently some search engines have introduced two new spelling suggestion functions.",
        "One is the \"auto-correction\" function, where the search engine is confident enough to automatically apply the spelling correction to the query and execute it to produce search results for the user.",
        "The other is the \"split pane\" result page, where one half portion of the search results are produced using the original query, while the other half, usually visually separate portion of results are produced using the auto-corrected query.",
        "In neither of these functions does the user ever receive an opportunity to approve or disapprove of the correction.",
        "Since our extraction approach focuses on user-approved spelling suggestions, we ignore the query reformulation sessions recording either of the two functions.",
        "Although by doing so we could miss some basic, obvious spelling corrections, our experiments show that the negative impact on error model training is negligible.",
        "One possible reason is that our baseline system, which does not use any error model learned from the clickthrough data, is already able to correct these basic, obvious spelling mistakes.",
        "Thus, including these data for training is unlikely to bring any further improvement.",
        "We found that the error models trained using the data directly extracted from the query reformulation sessions suffer from the problem of underestimating the self-transformation probability of a query P(Q2=Q1\\Q1), because we only included in the training data the pairs where the query is different from the correction.",
        "To deal with this problem, we augmented the training data by including correctly spelled queries, i.e., the pairs (Qi, Q2) where Qi = Q2.",
        "First, we extracted a set of queries from the sessions where no spell suggestion is presented or clicked on.",
        "Second, we removed from the set those queries that were recognized as being auto-corrected by a search engine.",
        "We do so by running a sanity check of the queries against our baseline spelling correction system, which will be described in Section 6.",
        "If the system thinks an input query is misspelled, we assumed it was an obvious misspelling, and removed it.",
