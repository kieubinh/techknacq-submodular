      "text": [
        "The goal of our research is to create semantic class taggers that can assign a semantic class label to every noun phrase in a sentence.",
        "For example, consider the sentence: \"The lab mix was diagnosed with parvo and given abx\".",
        "A semantic tagger should identify the \"the lab mix\" as an ANIMAL, \"parvo\" as a disease, and \"abx\" (antibiotics) as a DRUG.",
        "Accurate semantic tagging could be beneficial for many NLP tasks, including coref-erence resolution and word sense disambiguation, and many NLP applications, such as event extraction systems and question answering technology.",
        "Semantic class tagging has been the subject of previous research, primarily under the guises of named entity recognition (NER) and mention detection.",
        "Named entity recognizers perform semantic tagging on proper name noun phrases, and sometimes temporal and numeric expressions as well.",
        "The mention detection task was introduced in recent ACE evaluations (e.g., (ACE, 2007; ACE, 2008)) and requires systems to identify all noun phrases (proper names, nominals, and pronouns) that correspond to 5-7 semantic classes.",
        "Despite widespread interest in semantic tagging, nearly all semantic taggers for comprehensive NP tagging still rely on supervised learning, which requires annotated data for training.",
        "A few annotated corpora exist, but they are relatively small and most were developed for broad-coverage NLP.",
        "Many domains, however, are replete with specialized terminology and jargon that cannot be adequately handled by general-purpose systems.",
        "Domains such as biology, medicine, and law are teeming with specialized vocabulary that necessitates training on domain-specific corpora.",
        "Our research explores the idea of inducing domain-specific semantic taggers using a small set of seed words as the only form of human supervision.",
        "Given an (unannotated) collection of domain-specific text, we automatically generate training instances by labelling every instance of a seed word with its designated semantic class.",
        "We then train a classifier to do semantic tagging using these seed-based annotations, using bootstrapping to iteratively improve performance.",
        "On the surface, this approach appears to be a contradiction.",
        "The classifier must learn how to assign different semantic tags to different instances of the same word based on context (e.g., \"lab\" may refer to an animal in one context but a laboratory in another).",
        "And yet, we plan to train the classifier using standalone seed words, making the assumption that every instance ofthe seed belongs to the same semantic class.",
        "We resolve this apparent contradiction by using semantically unambiguous seeds and by introducing an initial context-only training phase before bootstrapping begins.",
        "First, we train a strictly contextual classifier that only has access to contextual features and cannot see the seed.",
        "Then we apply the classifier to the corpus to automatically label new instances, and combine these new instances with the seed-based instances.",
        "This process expands and diversifies the training set to fuel subsequent bootstrapping.",
        "Another challenge is that we want to use a small set of seeds to minimize the amount of human effort, and then use bootstrapping to fully exploit the domain-specific corpus.",
        "Iterative self-training, however, often has difficulty sustaining momentum or it succumbs to semantic drift (Komachi et al., 2008; Mcintosh and Curran, 2009).",
        "To address these issues, we simultaneously induce a suite of classifiers for multiple semantic categories, using the positive instances of one semantic category as negative instances for the others.",
        "As bootstrapping progresses, the classifiers gradually improve themselves, and each other, over many iterations.",
        "We also explore a one-semantic-class-per-discourse (OSCPD) heuristic that infuses the learning process with fresh training instances, which may be substantially different from the ones seen previously, and we use the labels produced by the classifiers to dynamically create semantic features.",
        "We evaluate our approach by creating six semantic taggers using a collection ofmessage board posts in the domain of veterinary medicine.",
        "Our results show this approach produces high-quality semantic taggers after a sustained bootstrapping cycle that maintains good precision while steadily increasing recall over many iterations."

      "text": [
        "Semantic class tagging is most closely related to named entity recognition (NER), mention detection, and semantic lexicon induction.",
        "NER systems (e.g., (Bikel et al., 1997; Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999; Fleischman and Hovy, 2002) identify proper named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations.",
        "Several bootstrapping methods for NER have been previously developed (e.g., (Collins and Singer, 1999; Niu et al., 2003)).",
        "NER systems, however, do not identify nominal NP instances (e.g., \"a software manufacturer\" or \"the beach\"), or handle semantic classes that are not associated with proper named entities (e.g., symptoms).",
        "ACE mention detection systems (e.g., see (ACE, 2005; ACE, 2007; ACE, 2008)) require tagging of NPs that correspond to 5-7 general semantic classes.",
        "These systems are typically trained with supervised learning using annotated corpora, although techniques have been developed to use resources for one language to train systems for different languages (e.g., (Zitouni and Florian, 2009)).",
        "Another line of relevant work is semantic class induction (e.g., (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Ng, 2007; McIntosh and Curran, 2009), where the goal is to induce a standalone dictionary ofwords with semantic class labels.",
        "These techniques are often designed to learn specialized terminology from unannotated domain-specific texts via bootstrapping.",
        "Our work, however, focuses on classification of NP instances in context, so the same phrase may be assigned to different semantic classes in different contexts.",
        "Consequently, our classifier can also assign semantic class labels to pronouns.",
        "There has also been work on extracting semantically related terms or category members from the Web (e.g., (PaÂ§ca, 2004; Etzioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008; Carlson et al., 2009)).",
        "These techniques harvest broad-coverage semantic information from the Web using patterns and statistics, typically for the purpose of knowledge acquisition.",
        "Importantly, our goal is to classify instances in context, rather than generate lists of terms.",
        "In addition, the goal of our research is to learn specialized terms and jargon that may not be common on the Web, as well as domain-specific usages that may differ from the norm (e.g., \"mix\" and \"lab\" are usually animals in our domain).",
        "The idea of simulataneously learning multiple semantic categories to prevent semantic drift has been explored for other tasks, such as semantic lexicon induction (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; McIntosh and Curran, 2009) and pattern learning (Yan-garber, 2003).",
        "Our bootstrapping model can be viewed as a form of self-training (e.g., (Ng and 2006)), and cross-category training is similar in spirit to co-training (e.g., (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Riloff and Jones, 2002)).",
        "But, importantly, our classifiers all use the same feature set so they do not represent independent views of the data.",
        "They do, however, offer slightly different perspectives because each is attempting to recognize a different semantic class.",
        "3 Bootstrapping an Instance-based Semantic Class Tagger from Seeds",
        "Our goal is to create a bootstrapping model that can rapidly create semantic class taggers using just a small set of seed words and an unanno-tated domain-specific corpus.",
        "Our motivation comes from specialized domains that cannot be adequately handled by general-purpose NLP systems.",
        "As an example of such a domain, we have been working with a collection of message board posts in the field of veterinary medicine.",
        "Given a document, we want a semantic class tagger to label every NP with a semantic category, for example:",
        "[A 14yo doxy]animal owned by [a reputable breeder] human is being treated for [YBD]djsease with [pred] drug .",
        "When we began working with these texts, we were immediately confronted by a dizzying array of non-standard words and word uses.",
        "In addition to formal veterinary vocabulary (e.g., animal diseases), veterinarians often use informal, shorthand terms when posting on-line.",
        "For example, they frequently refer to breeds using \"nicknames\" or shortened terms (e.g., gshepfor German shepherd, doxyfor dachsund, bxr for boxer, labx for labrador cross).",
        "Often, they refer to animals based solely on their physical characteristics, for example \"a dlh\" (domestic long hair), \"a m/n \" (male, neutered), or \"a 2yo\" (2 year old).",
        "This phenomenon occurs with other semantic categories as well, such as drugs and medical tests (e.g., pred for prednisone, and rads for radiographs).",
        "Nearly all semantic class taggers are trained using supervised learning with manually annotated data.",
        "However, annotated data is rarely available for specialized domains, and it is expensive to obtain because domain experts must do the annotation work.",
        "So we set out to create a bootstrapping model that can rapidly create domain-specific semantic taggers using just a few seed words and a domain-specific text collection.",
        "Our bootstrapping model consists of two distinct phases.",
        "First, we train strictly contextual classifiers from the seed annotations.",
        "We then apply the classifiers to the unlabeled data to generate new annotated instances that are added to the training set.",
        "Second, we employ a cross-category bootstrapping process that simultaneously trains a suite of classifiers for multiple semantic categories, using the positive instances for one semantic class as negative instances for the others.",
        "This cross-category training process gives the learner sustained momentum over many bootstrapping iterations.",
        "Finally, we explore two additional enhancements: (1) a one-semantic-class-per-discourse heuristic to automatically generate new training instances, and (2) dynamically created semantic features produced by the classifiers themselves.",
        "In the following sections, we explain each of these steps in detail.",
        "The main challenge that we faced was how to train an instance-based classifier using seed words as the only form of human supervision.",
        "First, the user must provide a small set of seed words that are relatively unambiguous (e.g., \"dog\" will nearly always refer to an animal in our domain).",
        "But even so, training a traditional classifier from seed-based instances would likely produce a classifier that learns to recognize the seeds but is unable to classify new examples.",
        "We needed to force the classifier to generalize beyond the seed words.",
        "Our solution was to introduce an initial training step that induces a strictly contextual classifier.",
        "First, we generate training instances by automatically labeling each instance of a seed word with its designated semantic class.",
        "However, when we create feature vectors for the classifier, the seeds themselves are hidden and only contextual features are used to represent each training instance.",
        "By essentially \"masking\" the seed words so the classifier can only see the contexts around them, we force the classifier to generalize.",
        "We create a suite of strictly contextual classifiers, one for each semantic category.",
        "Each classifier makes a binary decision as to whether a noun phrase belongs to its semantic category.",
        "We use the seed words for category Ck to generate positive training instances for the Ck classifier, and the seed words for all other categories to generate the negative training instances for Ck.",
        "We use an in-house sentence segmenter and NP chunker to identify the base NPs in each sentence and create feature vectors that represent each constituent in the sentence as either an NP or an individual word.",
        "For each seed word, the feature vector captures a context window of 3 constituents (word or NP) to its left and 3 constituents (word or NP) to its right.",
        "Each constituent is represented with a lexical feature: for NPs, we use its head noun; for individual words, we use the word itself.",
        "The seed word, however, is discarded so that the classifier is essentially blindfolded and cannot see the seed that produced the training instance.",
        "We also create a feature for every modifier that precedes the head noun in the target NP, except for articles which are discarded.",
        "As an example, consider the following sentence:",
        "Fluffy was diagnosed with FELV after a blood test showed that he tested positive.",
        "Suppose that \"FELV\" is a seed for the disease category and \"test\" is a seed for the test category.",
        "Two training instances would be created, with feature vectors that look like this, where M represents a modifier inside the target NP:",
        "was-s diagnosed-2 with-i after\\ test2showed3 == disease with-s FELV-2 after-i bloodM showedithat2 hes == test",
        "The contextual classifiers are then applied to the corpus to automatically label new instances.",
        "We use a confidence score to label only the instances that the classifiers are most certain about.",
        "We compute a confidence score for instance i with respect to semantic class Ck by considering both the score of the Ck classifier as well as the scores of the competing classifiers.",
        "Intuitively, we have confidence in labeling an instance as category Ck if the Ck classifier gave it a positive score, and its score is much higher than the score of any other classifier.",
        "We use the following scoring function:",
        "Confidence(i,Ck ) =",
        "We employ support vector machines (SVMs) (Joachims, 1999) with a linear kernel as our classifiers, using the SVMlin software (Keerthi and De-Coste, 2005).",
        "We use the value produced by the decision function (essentially the distance from the hyperplane) as the score for a classifier.",
        "We specify a threshold 9cf and only assign a semantic tag Ck to an instance i if Confidence(i,Ck) > 9cf.",
        "All instances that pass the confidence threshold are labeled and added to the training set.",
        "This process greatly enhances the diversity of the training data.",
        "In this initial learning step, the strictly contextual classifiers substantially increase the number of training instances for each semantic category, producing a more diverse mix ofseed-generated instances and context-generated instances.",
        "The next phase of the learning process is an iterative bootstrapping procedure.",
        "The key challenge was to design a bootstrapping model that would not succumb to semantic drift and would have sustained momentum to continue learning over many iterations.",
        "Figure 1 shows the design of our cross-category bootstrapping model.",
        "We simultaneously train a suite of binary classifiers, one for each semantic category, Ci ... Cn.",
        "After each training cycle, all of the classifiers are applied to the remaining unlabeled instances and each classifier labels the (positive) instances that it is most confident about (i.e., the instances that it classifies with a confidence score > 6cf ).",
        "The set of instances positively labeled by classifier Ck are shown as C+ in Figure 1.",
        "All of the new instances produced by classifier Ck are then added to the set of positive training instances for Ck and to the set of negative training instances for all of the other classifiers.",
        "One potential problem with this scheme is that some categories are more prolific than others, plus we are collecting negative instances from a set of competing classifiers.",
        "Consequently, this approach can produce highly imbalanced training sets.",
        "Therefore we enforced a 3:1 ratio of negatives to positives by randomly selecting a subset of the possible negative instances.",
        "We discuss this issue further in Section 4.4.",
        "unlabeled labeled -*",
        "Cross-category training has two advantages over independent self-training.",
        "First, as others have shown for pattern learning and lexicon induction (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Yangarber, 2003; McIntosh and Curran, 2009), simultaneously training classifiers for multiple categories reduces semantic drift because each classifier is deterred from encroaching on another one's territory (i.e., claiming the instances from a competing class as its own).",
        "Second, similar in spirit to co-training, this approach allows each classifier to obtain new training instances from an outside source that has a slightly different perspective.",
        "While independent self-training can quickly run out ofsteam, cross-category training supplies each classifier with a constant stream of new (negative) instances produced by competing classifiers.",
        "In Section 4, we will show that cross-category bootstrapping performs substantially better than an independent self-training model, where each classifier is bootstrapped separately.",
        "The feature set for these classifiers is exactly the same as described in Section 3.2, except that we add a new lexical feature that represents the head noun of the target NP (i.e., the NP that needs to be tagged).",
        "This allows the classifiers to consider the local context as well as the target word itself when making decisions.",
        "We also explored the idea of using a one semantic class per discourse (OSCPD) heuristic to generate additional training instances during bootstrapping.",
        "Inspired by Yarowsky's one sense per discourse heuristic for word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), we make the assumption that multiple instances of a word in the same discourse will nearly always correspond to the same semantic class.",
        "Since our data set consists of message board posts organized as threads, we consider all posts in the same thread to be a single discourse.",
        "After each training step, we apply the classifiers to the unlabeled data to label some new instances.",
        "For each newly labeled instance, the OS-CPD heuristic collects all instances with the same head noun in the same discourse (thread) and unilaterally labels them with the same semantic class.",
        "This heuristic serves as meta-knowledge to label instances that (potentially) occur in very different contexts, thereby infusing the bootstrapping process with \"fresh\" training examples.",
        "In early experiments, we found that OSCPD can be aggressive, pulling in many new instances.",
        "If the classifier labels a word incorrectly, however, then the OSCPD heuristic will compound the error and mislabel even more instances incorrectly.",
        "Therefore we only apply this heuristic to instances that are labeled with extremely high confidence (Ãcf > 2.5) and that pass a global sanity check, gsc(w) > 0.2, which ensures that a relatively high proportion of labeled instances with the same head noun have been assigned to the same semantic class.",
        "Specifically, gsc(w) = 0.1*^+0.9*^ where wi and wu are the # of labeled and unlabeled instances, respectively, wi/c is the # of instances labeled as c, and wu/c is the # of unlabeled instances that receive a positive confidence score for c when given to the classifier.",
        "The intuition behind the second term is that most instances are initially unlabeled and we want to make sure that many of the unlabeled instances are likely to belong to the same semantic class (even though the classifier isn't ready to commit to them yet).",
        "For many NLP tasks, classifiers use semantic features to represent the semantic class of words.",
        "These features are typically obtained from external resources such as Wordnet (Miller, 1990).",
        "Our bootstrapping model incrementally trains semantic class taggers, so we explored the idea of using the labels assigned by the classifiers to create enhanced feature vectors by dynamically adding semantic features.",
        "This process allows later stages of bootstrapping to directly benefit from earlier stages.",
        "For example, consider the sentence:",
        "He started the doxy on Vetsulin today.",
        "If \"Vetsulin\" was labeled as a drug in a previous bootstrapping iteration, then the feature vector representing the context around \"doxy\" can be enhanced to include an additional semantic feature identifying Vetsulin as a drug, which would look like this:",
        "He-2 started-i oni Vetsulin2 DRUG2 todays",
        "Intuitively, the semantic features should help the classifier identify more general contextual patterns, such as \"started <X> on DRUG\".",
        "To create semantic features, we use the semantic tags that have been assigned to the current set oflabeled instances.",
        "When a feature vector is created for a target NP, we check every noun instance in its context window to see if it has been assigned a semantic tag, and if so, then we add a semantic feature.",
        "In the early stages of bootstrapping, however, relatively few nouns will be assigned semantic tags, so these features are often missing.",
        "When new instances are automatically labeled during bootstrapping, it is critically important that most of the labels are correct or performance rapidly deteriorates.",
        "This suggests that we should only label instances in which the classifier has high confidence.",
        "On the other hand, a high threshold often yields few new instances, which can cause the bootstrapping process to sputter and halt.",
        "To balance these competing demands, we used a sliding threshold that begins conservatively but gradually loosens the reins as bootstrapping progresses.",
        "Initially, we set 9cf = 2.0, which only labels instances that the classifier is highly confident about.",
        "When fewer than min new instances can be labeled, we automatically decrease 9cf by 0.2, allowing another batch of new instances to be labeled, albeit with slightly less confidence.",
        "We continue decreasing the threshold, as needed, until 9cf < 1.0, when we end the bootstrapping process.",
        "In Section 4, we show that this sliding threshold outperforms fixed threshold values."

        "One reason for the disparity is that the self-training model ended after just 13 bootstrapping cycles (I.13), given the same threshold values.",
        "To see if we could push it further, we lowered the confidence threshold to 0 and it continued learning through 35 iterations.",

        "The sliding threshold produces the best F score, achieving the best balance of high recall and precision.",
        "As mentioned in Section 3.3, we used 3 times as many negative instances as positive instances for every semantic category during bootstrapping.",
        "This ratio was based on early experiments where we needed to limit the number of negative instances per category because the cross-category framework naturally produces an extremely skewed negative/positive training set.",

        "The table below shows recall, precision, and F score results when we vary the ratio from 1:1 to 5:1.",

        "However the difference in performance between the other ratios is small.",
        "Our conclusion is that a 1:1 ratio is too restrictive but, in general, the cross-category bootstrapping process is relatively insensitive to the specific negative/positive ratio used.",
        "Our observation from preliminary experiments, however, is that the negative/positive ratio does need to be controlled, or else the dominant categories overwhelm the less frequent categories with negative instances.",

        "So while it failed to recognize most of the (relatively few) gendered pronouns that refer to a person, it was highly effective at identifying the animal references and it was always correct when it did assign a human tag to a pronoun."
