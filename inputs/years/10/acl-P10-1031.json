        "However, progress has been difficult.",
        "The earliest approaches were manual, but the sheer amount of coding and knowledge engineering needed makes them very costly and limits them to well-circumscribed domains.",
        "More recently, machine learning approaches to a number of key subproblems have been developed (e.g., Snow et al.",
        "(2006)), but to date there is no sufficiently automatic end-to-end solution.",
        "Most saliently, supervised learning requires labeled data, which itselfis costly and infeasible for large-scale, open-domain knowledge acquisition.",
        "Ideally, we would like to have an end-to-end unsupervised (or lightly supervised) solution to the problem of knowledge acquisition from text.",
        "The TextRunner system (Banko et al., 2007) can extract a large number of ground atoms from the Web using only a small number of seed patterns as guidance, but it is unable to extract non-atomic formulas, and the mass of facts it extracts is unstructured and very noisy.",
        "The USP system (Poon and Domingos, 2009) can extract formulas and appears to be fairly robust to noise.",
        "However, it is still limited to extractions for which there is substantial evidence in the corpus, and in most corpora most pieces of knowledge are stated only once or a few times, making them very difficult to extract without supervision.",
        "Also, the knowledge extracted is simply a large set of formulas without ontological structure, and the latter is essential for compact representation and efficient reasoning (Staab and Studer, 2004).",
        "We propose OntoUSP (Ontological USP), a system that learns an ISA hierarchy over clusters of logical expressions, and populates it by translating sentences to logical form.",
        "OntoUSP is encoded in a few formulas of higher-order Markov logic (Domingos and Lowd, 2009), and can be viewed as extending USP with the capability to perform hierarchical (as opposed to flat) clustering.",
        "This clustering is then used to perform hierarchical smoothing (a.k.a.",
        "shrinkage), greatly increasing the system's capability to generalize from sparse data.",

        "In general, ontology induction (constructing an ontology) and ontology population (mapping textual expressions to concepts and relations in the ontology) remain difficult open problems (Staab and Studer, 2004).",
        "Recently, ontology learning has attracted increasing interest in both NLP and semantic Web communities (Cimiano, 2006; Maedche, 2002), and a number of machine learning approaches have been developed (e.g., Snow et al.",
        "(2006), Cimiano (2006), Suchanek et al.",
        "(2008,2009), Wu & Weld (2008)).",
        "However, they are still limited in several aspects.",
        "Most approaches induce and populate a deterministic ontology, which does not capture the inherent uncertainty among the entities and relations.",
        "Besides, many of them either bootstrap from heuristic patterns (e.g., Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992)) or build on existing structured or semi-structured knowledge bases (e.g., WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and Wikipedia ), thus are limited in coverage.",
        "Moreover, they often focus on inducing ontology over individual words rather than arbitrarily large meaning units (e.g., idioms, phrasal verbs, etc.).",
        "Most importantly, existing approaches typically separate ontology induction from population and knowledge extraction, and pursue each task in a standalone fashion.",
        "While computationally efficient, this is suboptimal.",
        "The resulted ontology is disconnected from text and requires additional effort to map between the two (Tsujii, 2004).",
        "In addition, this fails to leverage the intimate connections between the three tasks for joint inference and mutual disambiguiation.",
        "Our approach differs from existing ones in two main aspects: we induce a probabilistic ontology from text, and we do so by jointly conducting ontology induction, population, and knowledge extraction.",
        "Probabilistic modeling handles uncertainty and noise.",
        "A joint approach propagates in-",
        "!http : //www.wikipedia.org",
        "formation among the three tasks, uncovers more implicit information from text, and can potentially work well even in domains not well covered by existing resources like WordNet and Wikipedia.",
        "Furthermore, we leverage the ontology for hierarchical smoothing and incorporate this smoothing into the induction process.",
        "This facilitates more accurate parameter estimation and better generalization.",
        "Our approach can also leverage existing ontologies and knowledge bases to conduct semi-supervised ontology induction (e.g., by incorporating existing structures as hard constraints or penalizing deviation from them).",
        "Combining uncertainty handling and joint inference is the hallmark of the emerging field of statistical relational learning (a.k.a.",
        "structured prediction), where a plethora of approaches have been developed (Getoor and Taskar, 2007; Bakir et al., 2007) .",
        "In this paper, we use Markov logic (Domingos and Lowd, 2009), which is the leading unifying framework, but other approaches can be used as well.",
        "Markov logic is a probabilistic extension of first-order logic and can compactly specify probability distributions over complex relational domains.",
        "It has been successfully applied to unsupervised learning for various NLP tasks such as coreference resolution (Poon and Domingos, 2008) and semantic parsing (Poon and Domingos, 2009) .",
        "A Markov logic network (MLN) is a set of weighted first-order clauses.",
        "Together with a set of constants, it defines a Markov network with one node per ground atom and one feature per ground clause.",
        "The weight of a feature is the weight of the first-order clause that originated it.",
        "The probability of a state x in such a network is given by the log-linear model P(x) = Z exPE% wini(x)), where Z is a normalization constant, w% is the weight of the ith formula, and n% is the number of satisfied groundings.",
        "Semantic parsing aims to obtain a complete canonical meaning representation for input sentences.",
        "It can be viewed as a structured prediction problem, where a semantic parse is formed by partitioning the input sentence (or a syntactic analysis such as a dependency tree) into meaning units and assigning each unit to the logical form representing an entity or relation (Figure 1).",

        "The second formula states that if the ISA relation holds for a pair of object clusters, it also holds between their corresponding property clusters.",
        "Both are hard constraints.",
        "Third, we introduce hierarchical smoothing into the model by replacing the USP mixture formula x G +p A HasValue(x, +v) with a new formula",
        "Intuitively, for each p2, the weight corresponds to the delta in log-probability of v comparing to the prediction according to all ancestors of p2.",
        "The effect of this change is that now the value v of a subexpression x is not solely determined by its property cluster p1, but is also smoothed by statistics of all p2 that are super clusters of p1.",

        "The ISA hierarchy in OntoUSP is not known in advance, but needs to be learned as well.",

        "Therefore, we used the same methodology and dataset as the USP paper to evaluate OntoUSP on its capability in knowledge acquisition.",
        "Specifically, we applied OntoUSP to extract knowledge from the GE-NIA dataset (Kim et al., 2003) and answer questions, and we evaluated it on the number of extracted answers and accuracy.",
        "GENIA contains l999 PubMed abstracts.",
        "The question set contains 2000 questions which were created by sampling verbs and entities according to their frequencies in GENIA.",
        "Sample questions include \"What regulates MIP-lalpha?",
        "\", \"What does anti-STAT l inhibit?\".",
        "These simple question types were used to focus the evaluation on the knowledge extraction aspect, rather than engineering for handling special question types and/or reasoning.",
        "OntoUSP is the first unsupervised approach that synergistically conducts ontology induction, population, and knowledge extraction.",
        "The system closest in aim and capability is USP.",
        "We thus compared OntoUSP with USP and all other systems evaluated in the USP paper (Poon and Domingos, 2009).",
        "Below is a brief description of the systems.",
        "(For more details, see Poon & Domingos (2009).)",
        "Keyword is a baseline system based on keyword matching.",
        "It directly matches the question substring containing the verb and the available argument with the input text, ignoring case and morphology.",
        "Given a match, two ways to derive the answer were considered: KW simply returns the rest of sentence on the other side of the verb, whereas KW-SYN is informed by syntax and extracts the answer from the subject or object of the verb, depending on the question (if the expected argument is absent, the sentence is ignored).",
        "TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007) is the state-of-the-art system for open-domain information extraction.",
        "It inputs text and outputs relational triples in the form (R, A1,A2), where R is the relation string, and A1, A2 the argument strings.",
        "To answer questions, each triple-question pair is considered in turn by first matching their relation strings, and then the available argument strings.",
        "If both match, the remaining argument string in the triple is returned as an answer.",
        "Results were reported when exact match is used (TR-EXACT), or when the triple strings may contain the question ones as substrings (TR-SUB).",
        "RESOLVER (Yates and Etzioni, 2009) inputs",
        "TextRunner triples and collectively resolves coref-erent relation and argument strings.",
        "To answer questions, the only difference from TextRunner is that a question string can match any string in its cluster.",
        "As in TextRunner, results were reported for both exact match (RS-EXACT) and substring (RS-SUB).",
        "DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 200l) resolves binary rela-",
        "Table 1: Comparison of question answering results on the GENIA dataset.",
        "Results for systems other than OntoUSP are from Poon & Domingos (2009).",
        "lions by inputting a dependency path that signifies the relation and returns a set of similar paths.",
        "To use DIRT in question answering, it was queried to obtain similar paths for the relation of the question, which were then used to match sentences.",
        "USP (Poon and Domingos, 2009) parses the input text using the Stanford dependency parser (Klein and Manning, 2003; de Marneffe et al., 2006), learns an MLN for semantic parsing from the dependency trees, and outputs this MLN and the MAP semantic parses of the input sentences.",
        "These MAP parses formed the knowledge base (KB).",
        "To answer questions, USP first parses the questions (with the question slot replaced by a dummy word), and then matches the question parse to parses in the KB by testing subsumption.",
        "OntoUSP uses a similar procedure as USP for extracting knowledge and answering questions, except for two changes.",
        "First, USP's learning and parsing algorithms are replaced with OntoUSP-Learn and OntoUSP-Parse, respectively.",
        "Second, when OntoUSP matches a question to its KB, it not only considers the lambda-form cluster of the question relation, but also all its sub-clusters.",
        "Table 1 shows the results comparing OntoUSP with other systems.",
        "While USP already greatly outperformed other systems in both precision and recall, OntoUSP further substantially improved on the recall of USP, without any loss in precision.",
        "In particular, OntoUSP extracted 140 more correct answers than USP, for a gain of 47% in absolute",
        "REGULATE INDUCE INHIBIT",
        "Figure 3: A fragment of the induced ISA hierarchy, showing the core forms for each cluster (the cluster labels are added by the authors for illustration purpose).",
        "recall.",
        "Compared to TextRunner (TR-SUB), OntoUSP gained on precision by 38 points and extracted more than five times of correct answers.",
        "Manual inspection shows that the induced ISA hierarchy is the key for the recall gain.",
        "Like USP, OntoUSP discovered the following clusters (in core forms) that represent some of the core concepts in biomedical research:",
        "{regulate, control, govern, modulate} {induce, enhance, trigger, augment, up-regulate}",
        "{inhibit, block, suppress, prevent, abolish, abrogate, down-regulate}",
        "However, USP formed these as separate clusters, whereas OntoUSP in addition induces ISA relations from the INDUCE and INHIBIT clusters to the REGULATE cluster (Figure 3).",
        "This allows OntoUSP to answer many more questions that are asked about general regulation events, even though the text states them with specific regulation directions like \"induce\" or \"inhibit\".",
        "Below is an example question-answer pair output by OntoUSP; neither USP nor any other system were able to extract the necessary knowledge.",
        "Q: What does IL-2 control?",
        "A: The DEX-mediated IkappaBalpha induction.",
        "Sentence: Interestingly, the DEX-mediated IkappaBalpha induction was completely inhibited by IL-2, but not IL-4, in Thl cells, while the reverse profile was seen in Th2 cells.",
        "OntoUSP also discovered other interesting commonalities among the clusters.",
        "For example, both USP and OntoUSP formed a singleton cluster with core form \"activate\".",
        "Although this cluster may appear similar to the INDUCE cluster, the data in GENIA does not support merging the two.",
        "However, OntoUSP discovered that the ACTIVATE cluster, while not completely resolvent with INDUCE, shared very similar distributions in their agent arguments.",
        "In fact, they are so similar that OntoUSP merges them into a single property cluster.",
        "It found that the patient arguments of INDUCE and INHIBIT are very similar and merged them.",
        "In turn, OntoUSP formed ISA links from these three object clusters to REGULATE, as well as among their property clusters.",
        "Intuitively, this makes sense.",
        "The positive-and negative-regulation events, as signified by INDUCE and INHIBIT, often target similar object entities or processes.",
        "However, their agents tend to differ since in one case they are inducers, and in the other they are inhibitors.",
        "On the other hand, ACTIVATE and INDUCE share similar agents since they both signify positive regulation.",
        "However, \"activate\" tends to be used more often when the patient argument is a concrete entity (e.g., cells, genes, proteins), whereas \"induce\" and others are also used with processes and events (e.g., expressions, inhibition, pathways).",

        "The active-passive alternation is captured in these clusters, and is inherited by all descendant clusters, including many rare verbs like \"super-induce\" which only occur once in GENIA and for which there is no way that USP could have learned about their active-passive alternations.",

        "While OntoUSP induced meaningful ISA relations among relation clusters like REGULATE, INDUCE, etc., it was less successful in inducing ISA relations among entity clusters such as specific genes and proteins.",
        "This is probably due to the fact that our model only considers local features such as the parent and arguments.",
