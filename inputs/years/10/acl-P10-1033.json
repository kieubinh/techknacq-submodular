        "For this reason ITG has gained more and more attention recently in the word alignment community (Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2006; Haghighi et al., 2009).",
        "A major obstacle in ITG alignment is speed.",
        "The original (unsupervised) ITG algorithm has complexity of O(n).",
        "When extended to supervised/discriminative framework, ITG runs even more slowly.",

        "For example, Haghighi et al.",
        "(2009) do pruning based on the probabilities of links from a simpler alignment model (viz. HMM); Zhang and Gildea (2005) propose Tic-tac-toe pruning, which is based on the Model 1 probabilities of word pairs inside and outside a pair of spans.",
        "As all the principles behind these techniques have certain contribution in making good pruning decision, it is tempting to incorporate all these features in ITG pruning.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative pruning framework for discriminative ITG.",
        "The pruning model uses no more training data than the discriminative ITG parser itself, and it uses a log-linear model to integrate all features that help identify the correct span pair (like Model 1 probability and HMM posterior).",
        "On top of the discriminative pruning method, we also propose a discriminative ITG alignment system using hierarchical phrase pairs.",
        "In the following, some basic details on the ITG formalism and ITG parsing are first reviewed (Sections 2 and 3), followed by the definition of pruning in ITG (Section 4).",

        "The simplest formulation of ITG contains three types of rules: terminal unary rules X – e/f, where e and / represent words (possibly a null word, s) in the English and foreign language respectively, and the binary rules X – [X, X] and X – (X, X), which refer to that the component English and foreign phrases are combined in the same and inverted order respectively.",
        "From the viewpoint of word alignment, the terminal unary rules provide the links of word pairs, whereas the binary rules represent the reordering factor.",
        "One of the merits of ITG is that it is less biased towards short-distance reordering.",
        "Such a formulation has two drawbacks.",
        "First of all, it imposes a 1-to-1 constraint in word alignment.",
        "That is, a word is not allowed to align to more than one word.",
        "This is a strong limitation as no idiom or multi-word expression is allowed to align to a single word on the other side.",
        "In fact there have been various attempts in relaxing the 1-to-1 constraint.",
        "Both ITG alignment approaches with and without this constraint will be elaborated in Section 6.",
        "Secondly, the simple ITG leads to redundancy if word alignment is the sole purpose of applying ITG.",
        "For instance, there are two parses for three consecutive word pairs, viz. [a/a' [b/b' c/ c'] ] and [[a/a' b/b'] c/c'] .",

        "We will first evaluate pruning regarding the pruning decisions themselves.",
        "That is, the first evaluation metric, pruning error rate (henceforth PER), measures how many correct E-spans are discarded.",
        "The major drawback of PER is that not all decisions in pruning would impact on alignment quality, since certain F-spans are of little use to the entire ITG parse tree.",
        "An alternative criterion is the upper bound on alignment F-score, which essentially measures how many links in annotated alignment can be kept in ITG parse.",
        "The calculation of F-score upper bound is done in a bottom-up way like ITG parsing.",
        "All leaf hypernodes which contain a correct link are assigned a score (known as hit) of 1.",

        "Figure 6 illustrates the calculation of the hit score for the example in Section 5.1/Figure 2.",
        "The upper bound of recall is the hit score divided by the total number of golden links.",
        "The upper bound of precision, which should be defined as the hit score divided by the number of links produced by the system, is almost always 1.0 in practice.",
        "The upper bound of alignment F-score can thus be calculated as well.",
        "Finally, we also do end-to-end evaluation using both F-score in alignment and Bleu score in translation.",
