        "Combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) is a variant of categorial grammar which has attracted interest for both theoretical and practical reasons.",
        "On the theoretical side, we know that it is mildly context-sensitive (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994) and that it can elegantly analyze a wide range of linguistic phenomena (Steedman, 2000).",
        "On the practical side, we have corpora with CCG derivations for each sentence (Hockenmaier and Steed-man, 2007), a wide-coverage parser trained on that corpus (Clark and Curran, 2007) and a system for converting CCG derivations into semantic representations (Bos et al., 2004).",
        "However, despite being treated as a single unified grammar formalism, each of these authors use variations of CCG which differ primarily on which combinators are included in the grammar and the restrictions that are put on them.",
        "These differences are important because they affect whether the mild context-sensitivity proof of Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994) applies.",
        "We will provide a generalized framework for CCG within which the full variation of CCG seen in the literature can be defined.",
        "Then, we prove that for a wide range of CCGs there is a context-free grammar (CFG) that has exactly the same derivations.",
        "Included in this class of strongly context-free CCGs are a grammar including all the derivations in CCGbank and the grammar used in the Clark and Curran parser.",
        "Due to this insight, we investigate the potential of using tools from the probabilistic CFG community to improve CCG parsing results.",
        "The Petrov parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) uses latent variables to refine the grammar extracted from a corpus to improve accuracy, originally used to improve parsing results on the Penn treebank (PTB).",
        "We train the Petrov parser on CCGbank and achieve the best results to date on sentences from section 23 in terms of supertagging accuracy, PARSEVAL measures and dependency accuracy.",
        "These results should not be interpreted as proof that grammars extracted from the Penn treebank and from CCGbank are equivalent.",
        "Bos's system for building semantic representations from CCG derivations is only possible due to the categorial nature of CCG.",
        "Furthermore, the long distance dependencies involved in extraction and coordination phenomena have a more natural representation in CCG."

        "The context-freeness of a number of CCGs should not be considered evidence that there is no advantage to CCG as a grammar formalism.",
        "Unlike the context-free grammars extracted from the Penn treebank, these allow for the categorial semantics that accompanies any categorial parse and for a more elegant analysis of linguistic structures such as extraction and coordination.",
        "However, because we now know that the CCG defined by CCGbank is strongly context-free, we can use tools from the CFG parsing community to improve CCG parsing.",
        "To illustrate this point, we train the Petrov parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) on CCGbank.",
        "The Petrov parser uses latent variables to refine a coarse-grained grammar extracted from a training corpus to a grammar which makes much more fine-grained syntactic distinctions.",
        "For example, in Petrov's experiments on the Penn treebank, the syntactic category NP was refined to the more fine-grained NP and NP roughly corresponding to NP s in subject and object positions.",
        "Rather than requiring such distinctions to be made in the corpus, the Petrov parser hypothesizes these splits automatically.",
        "The Petrov parser operates by performing a fixed number of iterations of splitting, merging and smoothing.",
        "The splitting process is done by performing Expectation-Maximization to determine a likely potential split for each syntactic category.",
        "Then, during the merging process some of the splits are undone to reduce grammar size and avoid overfitting according to the likelihood of the split against the training data.",
        "The Petrov parser was chosen for our experiments because it refines the grammar in a mathematically principled way without altering the nature of the derivations that are output.",
        "This is important because the input to the semantic backend and the system that converts CCG derivations to dependencies requires CCG derivations as they appear in CCGbank.",
        "Our experiments use CCGbank as the corpus and we use sections 02-21 for training (39603 sentences), 00 for development (1913 sentences) and 23 for testing (2407 sentences).",

        "For this reason, the word to word dependencies of categorial grammar parsers are often evaluated.",
        "This evaluation is aided by the fact that in addition to the CCG derivation for each sentence, CCG-bank also includes a set of dependencies.",
        "Furthermore, extracting dependencies from a CCG derivation is well-established (Clark et al., 2002).",
        "A CCG derivation can be converted into dependencies by, first, determining which arguments go with which functors as specified by the CCG derivation.",
        "This can be represented as in figure 10.",
        "Although this is not difficult, some care must be taken with respect to punctuation and the conjunction rules.",
        "Next, we reorient some of the edges according to information in the lexical categories.",
        "A language for specifying these instructions using variables and indices is given in Clark et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "This process is shown in figures 1, 10 and 11 with the directions of the dependencies reversed from Clark et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "We used the CCG derivation to dependency converter generate included in the C&C tools package to convert the output of the Petrov parser to dependencies.",
        "Other than a CCG derivation, their system requires only the lexicon of edge reorientation instructions and methods for converting the unrestricted rules of CCGbank into the argument-functor relations.",
        "Important for the purpose of comparison, this system does not depend on their parser.",
        "An unlabeled dependency is correct if the ordered pair of words is correct.",
        "A labeled dependency is correct if the ordered pair of words is correct, the head word has the correct category and the position of the category that is the source of that edge is correct.",
        "Figure 12 shows accuracies from the Petrov parser trained on CCGbank along with accuracies for the Clark and Curran parser.",
        "We only show accuracies for the Petrov parser trained on the original version of CCGbank because the dependency converter cannot currently generate dependencies for featureless derivations.",
        "The relatively poor coverage of the Petrov parser is due to the failure of the dependency converter to output dependencies from valid CCG derivations.",
        "However, the coverage of the dependency converter is actually lower when run on the gold standard derivations indicating that this coverage problem is not indicative of inaccuracies in the Petrov parser.",
        "Due to the difference in coverage, we again evaluate the top two parsers on only those sentences that they both generate dependencies for and report those results in figures 13 and 14.",
        "The Petrov parser has better results by a statistically significant margin for both labeled and unlabeled recall and unlabeled F-score.",
        "As a final evaluation, we compare the resources that are required to both train and parse with the Petrov parser on the Penn Treebank, the Petrov parser on the original version of CCGbank, the Petrov parser on CCGbank without features and the Clark and Curran parser using the two models.",
        "All training and parsing was done on a 64-bit machine with 8 dual core 2.8 Ghz Opteron 8220 CPUs and 64GB of RAM.",
        "Our training times are much larger than those reported in Clark and Curran (2007) because we report the cumulative time spent on all CPUs rather than the maximum time spent on a CPU.",
        "Figure 15 shows the results.",
        "As can be seen, the Clark and Curran parser has similar training times, although significantly greater RAM requirements than the Petrov parsers.",
        "In contrast, the Clark and Curran parser is significantly faster than the Petrov parsers, which we hypothesize to be attributed to the degree to which Clark and Curran have optimized their code, their use of C++ as opposed to Java and their use of a supertagger to prune the lexicon."
