        "Enhanced word decomposition by calibrating the decision threshold of probabilistic models and using a model ensemble",
        "Intelligent Systems Laboratory, University of Bristol, U.K.",
        "This paper demonstrates that the use of ensemble methods and carefully calibrating the decision threshold can significantly improve the performance of machine learning methods for morphological word decomposition.",
        "We employ two algorithms which come from a family of generative probabilistic models.",
        "The models consider segment boundaries as hidden variables and include probabilities for letter transitions within segments.",
        "The advantage of this model family is that it can learn from small datasets and easily generalises to larger datasets.",
        "The first algorithm Promodes, which participated in the Morpho Challenge 2009 (an international competition for unsupervised morphological analysis) employs a lower order model whereas the second algorithm Promodes-H is a novel development of the first using a higher order model.",
        "We present the mathematical description for both algorithms, conduct experiments on the morphologically rich language Zulu and compare characteristics of both algorithms based on the experimental results."

        "Words are often considered as the smallest unit of a language when examining the grammatical structure or the meaning of sentences, referred to as syntax and semantics, however, words themselves possess an internal structure denominated by the term word morphology.",
        "It is worthwhile studying this internal structure since a language description using its morphological formation is more compact and complete than listing all possible words.",
        "This study is called morphological analysis.",
        "According to Goldsmith (2009) four tasks are assigned to morphological analysis: word decomposition into morphemes, building morpheme dictionaries, defining morphosyn-tactical rules which state how morphemes can be combined to valid words and defining mor-phophonological rules that specify phonological changes morphemes undergo when they are combined to words.",
        "Results of morphological analysis are applied in speech synthesis (Sproat, 1996) and recognition (Hirsimaki et al., 2006), machine translation (Amtrup, 2003) and information retrieval (Kettunen, 2009).",
        "In the past years, there has been a lot of interest and activity in the development of algorithms for morphological analysis.",
        "All these approaches have in common that they build a morphological model which is then applied to analyse words.",
        "Models are constructed using rule-based methods (Mooney and Califf, 1996; Muggleton and Bain, 1999), connectionist methods (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986; Gasser, 1994) or statistical or probabilistic methods (Harris, 1955; Hafer and Weiss, 1974).",
        "Another way of classifying approaches is based on the learning aspect during the construction of the morphological model.",
        "If the data for training the model has the same structure as the desired output of the morphological analysis, in other words, if a morphological model is learnt from labelled data, the algorithm is classified under supervised learning.",
        "An example for a supervised algorithm is given by Oflazer et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "If the input data has no information towards the desired output of the analysis, the algorithm uses unsupervised learning.",
        "Unsupervised algorithms for morphological analysis are Lin-guistica (Goldsmith, 2001), Morfessor (Creutz, 2006) and Paramor (Monson, 2008).",
        "Minimally or semi-supervised algorithms are provided with partial information during the learning process.",
        "This has been done, for instance, by Shalonova et al.",
        "(2009) who provided stems in addition to a word list in order to find multiple pre-and suffixes.",
        "A comparison of different levels of supervision for morphology learning on Zulu has been carried out by Spiegler et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Our two algorithms, PROMODES and Promodes-H, perform word decomposition and are based on probabilistic methods by incorporating a probabilistic generative model.",
        "Their parameters can be estimated from either labelled data, using maximum likelihood estimates, or from unlabelled data by expectation maximization which makes them either supervised or unsupervised algorithms.",
        "The purpose of this paper is an analysis of the underlying probabilistic models and the types of errors committed by each one.",
        "Furthermore, it is investigated how the decision threshold can be calibrated and a model ensemble is tested.",
        "The remainder is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we introduce the probabilistic generative process and show in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 how we incorporate this process in PROMODES and PROMODES-H. We start our experiments with examining the learning behaviour of the algorithms in 3.1.",
        "Subsequently, we perform a position-wise comparison of predictions in 3.2, show how we find a better decision threshold for placing morpheme boundaries in 3.3 and combine both algorithms using a model ensemble to leverage individual strengths in 3.4.",
        "In 3.5 we examine how the single algorithms contribute to the result of the ensemble.",
        "In Section 4 we will compare our approaches to related work and in Section 5 we will draw our conclusions."

        "Intuitively, we could say that our models describe the process of word generation from the left to the right by alternately using two dice, the first for deciding whether to place a morpheme boundary in the current word position and the second to get a corresponding letter transition.",
        "We are trying to reverse this process in order to find the underlying sequence of tosses which determine the morpheme boundaries.",
        "We are applying the notion of a prob- abilistic generative process consisting of words as observed variables X and their hidden segmentation as latent variables Y.",
        "If a generative model is fully parameterised it can be reversed to find the underlying word decomposition by forming the conditional probability distribution Pr(Y|X).",
        "Let us first define the model-independent components.",
        "A given word wj G W with 1 < j < |W| consists of n letters and has m = n – 1 positions for inserting boundaries.",
        "A word's segmentation is depicted as a boundary vector bj = (bj1,..., bjm) consisting of boundary values bji G {0,1} with 1 < i < m which disclose whether or not a boundary is placed in position i.",
        "A letter precedes the position i in wj and a letter lji follows it.",

        "The first component of the equation above is the probability distribution over non-/boundaries Pr(bji).",
        "We assume that a boundary in i is inserted independently from other boundaries (zero-order) and the graphemic representation of the word, however, is conditioned on the length of the word mj which means that the probability distribution is in fact Pr(bji| mj).",
        "We guarantee Ej=0Pr(bji=rlmj) = 1.",
        "To simplify the notation in later explanations, we will refer to Pr(bji| mj) as Pr(bji).",
        "The second component is the letter transition probability distribution Pr(tjilbji).",
        "We suppose a first-order Markov chain consisting of transitions tji from letter G Ab to letter lji G A where A is a regular letter alphabet and Ab =A U{B} includes B as an abstract morpheme start symbol which can occur in For instance, the suffix 's' of the verb form gets, marking 3rd person singular, would be modelled as B – s whereas a morpheme internal transition could be g – e. We guarantee X^eA Pr(tji \\bß)=l with tji being a transition from a certain e Ab to The advantage of the model is that instead of evaluating an exponential number of possible segmentations (2m), the best segmentation bj=(bj1,...,bjm) is found with 2m position-wise evaluations using",

        "The simplifying assumptions made, however, reduce the expressive power of the model by not allowing any dependencies on preceding boundaries or letters.",
        "This can lead to over-segmentation and therefore influences the performance of Promodes.",
        "For this reason, we have extended the model which led to Promodes-H, a higher-order probabilistic model.",
        "In contrast to the original Promodes model, we also consider the boundary value bj;i-1 and modify our transition assumptions for Promodes-H in such a way that the new algorithm applies a first-order boundary model and a second-order transition model.",
        "A transition tji is now defined as a transition from an abstract symbol in e {N, B} to a letter in lji e A.",
        "The abstract symbol is N or B depending on whether bji is 0 or 1.",
        "This holds equivalently for letter transitions tj;i-1.",

        "This suggests that to some extent fewer morpheme boundaries are discovered but the ones which are found are more likely to be correct.",
        "We believe that this effect is caused by the limited memory of the model which uses order zero for the occurrence of a boundary and order one for letter transitions.",

        "We have presented two probabilistic generative models for word decomposition, Promodes and Promodes-H. Another generative model for morphological analysis has been described by Snover and Brent (2001) and Snover et al.",
        "(2002), however, they were interested in finding paradigms as sets of mutual exclusive operations on a word form whereas we are describing a generative process using morpheme boundaries and resulting letter transitions.",
        "Moreover, our probabilistic models seem to resemble Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) by having certain states and transitions.",
        "The main difference is that we have dependencies between states as well as between emissions whereas in HMMs emissions only depend on the underlying state.",
        "Combining different morphological analysers has been performed, for example, by Atwell and approaches, though, used majority vote to decide whether a morpheme boundary is inserted in a certain word position or not.",
        "The algorithms themselves were treated as black-boxes.",
        "Monson et al.",
        "(2009) described an indirect approach to probabilistically combine ParaMor (Monson, 2008) and Morfessor (Creutz, 2006).",
        "They used a natural language tagger which was trained on the output of ParaMor and Morfes-sor.",
        "The goal was to mimic each algorithm since ParaMor is rule-based and there is no access to Morfessor's internally used probabilities.",
        "The tagger would then return a probability for starting a new morpheme in a certain position based on the original algorithm.",
        "These probabilities in combination with a threshold, learnt on a different dataset, were used to merge word analyses.",
        "In contrast, our ensemble algorithm Promodes-E directly accesses the probabilistic framework of each algorithm and combines them based on an optimal threshold learnt on a validation set."

        "We compared the performance on increasing training set sizes and analysed for each word position whether their boundary prediction agreed or disagreed.",
        "We found out that Promodes was better in predicting non-boundaries and Promodes-H gave better results for morpheme boundaries at a default decision threshold.",
        "At an optimal decision threshold, however, both yielded a similar f-measure result.",
        "We then performed a further analysis based on relative word positions and found out that the calibrated Promodes-H predicted non-boundaries better for initial word positions whereas the calibrated Promodes for mid-and final word positions.",
        "For boundaries, the calibrated algorithms had a similar behaviour.",
        "subsequently, we showed that a model ensemble of both algorithms in conjunction with finding an optimal threshold exceeded the performance of the single algorithms at their individually optimal threshold."
