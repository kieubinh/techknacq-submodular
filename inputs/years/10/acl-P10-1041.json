        "One of the limitations of their method is that it requires a large corpus of text to achieve good performance.",
        "They use several corpora, the size of the best performing dataset is roughly one hundred billion words (Tur-ney and Littman, 2003).",

        "Esuli and Sebas-tiani (2005; 2006) use a textual representation of words by collating all the glosses of the word as found in some dictionary.",

        "We also notice that after 1000, varying k has very little, if any, effect on performance.",

        "We now measure the performance of the proposed method when the system is allowed to abstain from classifying the words for which it have low conidence.",
        "We regard the ratio between the hitting time to positive words and hitting time to negative words as a conidence measure and evaluate the top words with the highest conidence level at different values of threshold.",

        "Disambiguating the sense of words given their context before trying to predict their polarity should solve this problem.",
        "The second reason is that some words have very few connection in thesaurus.",

        "Predicting the semantic orientation of words is a very interesting task in Natural Language Processing and it has a wide variety of applications.",
        "We proposed a method for automatically predicting the semantic orientation of words using random walks and hitting time.",
        "The proposed method is based on the observation that a random walk starting at a given word is more likely to hit another word with the same semantic orientation before hitting a word with a different semantic orientation.",
        "The proposed method can be used in a semi-supervised setting where a training set of labeled words is used, and in an unsupervised setting where only a handful of seeds is used to deine the two polarity classes.",
        "We predict semantic orientation with high accuracy.",
        "The proposed method is fast, simple to implement, and does not need any corpus."
