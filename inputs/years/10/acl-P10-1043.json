        "As a special task of text classification, sentiment classification aims to classify a text according to the expressed sentimental polarities of opinions such as 'thumb up' or 'thumb down' on the movies (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "This task has recently received considerable interests in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to its wide applications.",
        "In general, the objective of sentiment classification can be represented as a kind of binary relation R, defined as an ordered triple (X, Y, G), where Xis an object set including different kinds of people (e.g. writers, reviewers, or users), Y is another object set including the target objects (e.g. products, events, or even some people), and G is a subset of the Cartesian product X X Y .",
        "The concerned relation in sentiment classification is X 's evaluation on Y, such as 'thumb up\\ 'thumb down', 'favorable'', and 'unfavorable'.",
        "Such relation is usually expressed in text by stating the information involving either a person (one element in X) or a target object itself (one element in Y ).",
        "The first type of statement called personal view, e.g. 'I am so happy with this book', contains X 's \"subjective\" feeling and preference towards a target object, which directly expresses sentimental evaluation.",
        "This kind of information is normally domain-independent and serves as highly relevant clues to sentiment classification.",
        "The latter type of statement called impersonal view, e.g. ' it is too small', contains Y 's \"objective\" (i.e. or at least criteria-based) evaluation of the target object.",
        "This kind of information tends to contain much domain-specific classification knowledge.",
        "Although such information is sometimes not as explicit as personal views in classifying the sentiment of a text, speaker's sentiment is usually implied by the evaluation result.",
        "It is well-known that sentiment classification is very domain-specific (Blitzer et al., 2007), so it is critical to eliminate its dependence on a large-scale labeled data for its wide applications.",
        "Since the unlabeled data is ample and easy to collect, a successful semi-supervised sentiment classification system would significantly minimize the involvement of labor and time.",
        "Therefore, given the two different views mentioned above, one promising application is to adopt them in co-training algorithms, which has been proven to be an effective semi-supervised learning strategy of incorporating unlabeled data to further improve the classification performance (Zhu, 2005).",
        "In addition, we would show that personal/impersonal views are linguistically marked and mining them in text can be easily performed without special annotation.",
        "In this paper, we systematically employ personal/impersonal views in supervised and semi-supervised sentiment classification.",
        "First, an unsupervised bootstrapping method is adopted to automatically separate one document into personal and impersonal views.",
        "Then, both views are employed in supervised sentiment classification via an ensemble of individual classifiers generated by each view.",
        "Finally, a co-training algorithm is proposed to incorporate unlabeled data for semi-supervised sentiment classification.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the related work of sentiment classification.",
        "Section 3 presents our unsupervised approach for mining personal and impersonal views.",
        "Section 4 and Section 5 propose our supervised and semi-supervised methods on sentiment classification respectively.",
        "Experimental results are presented and analyzed in Section 6.",
        "Section 7 discusses on the differences between personal/impersonal and subjective/objective.",
        "Finally, Section 8 draws our conclusions and outlines the future work."

        "Recently, a variety of studies have been reported on sentiment classification at different levels: word level (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), phrase level (Wilson et al., 2009), sentence level (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Liu et al., 2005), and document level (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002).",
        "This paper focuses on the document-level sentiment classification.",
        "Generally, document-level sentiment classification methods can be categorized into three types: unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised.",
        "Unsupervised methods involve deriving a sentiment classifier without any labeled documents.",
        "Most of previous work use a set of labeled sentiment words called seed words to perform unsupervised classification.",
        "Turney (2002) determines the sentiment orientation of a document by calculating point-wise mutual information between the words in the document and the seed words of 'excellent and 'poof.",
        "Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) use a term-counting method with a set of seed words to determine the sentiment.",
        "Zagibalov and Carroll (2008) first propose a seed word selection approach and then apply the same term-counting method for Chinese sentiment classifications.",
        "These unsupervised approaches are believed to be domain-independent for sentiment classification.",
        "Supervised methods consider sentiment classification as a standard classification problem in which labeled data in a domain are used to train a domain-specific classifier.",
        "Pang et al.",
        "(2002) are the first to apply supervised machine learning methods to sentiment classification.",
        "Subsequently, many other studies make efforts to improve the performance of machine learning-based classifiers by various means, such as using subjectivity summarization (Pang and Lee, 2004), seeking new superior textual features (Riloff et al., 2006), and employing document subcomponent information (McDonald et al., 2007).",
        "As far as the challenge of domain-dependency is concerned, Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) present a domain adaptation approach for sentiment classification.",
        "Semi-supervised methods combine unlabeled data with labeled training data (often small-scaled) to improve the models.",
        "Compared to the supervised and unsupervised methods, semi-supervised methods for sentiment classification are relatively new and have much less related studies.",
        "Dasgupta and Ng (2009) integrate various methods in semi-supervised sentiment classification including spectral clustering, active learning, transductive learning, and ensemble learning.",
        "They achieve a very impressive improvement across five domains.",

        "As mentioned in Section 1, the objective of sentiment classification is to classify a specific binary relation: X's evaluation on Y, where X is an object set including different kinds of persons and Y is another object set including the target objects to be evaluated.",
        "First of all, we focus on an analysis on sentences in product reviews regarding the two views: personal and impersonal views.",
        "The personal view consists of personal sentences (i.e. X 's sentences) exemplified below:",

        "E10: The product is a waste of time and money.",
        "III.",
        "Impersonal actions: E11: This product not even worth a penny.",
        "E12: It broke down again and again.",
        "We find that the subject of a sentence presents important cues for personal/impersonal views, even though a formal and computable definition of this contrast cannot be found.",
        "Here, subject refers to one of the two main constituents in the traditional English grammar (the other constituent being the predicate) (Crystal, 2003).",
        "For example, the subjects in the above examples of E1, E7 and E11 are ' I', ' they', and ' this product' respectively.",
        "For automatic mining the two views, personal/impersonal sentences can be defined according to their subjects:",
        "Personal sentence: the sentence whose subject is (or represents) a person.",
        "Impersonal sentence: the sentence whose subject is not (does not represent) a person.",
        "In this study, we mainly focus on product review classification where the target object in the set Y is not a person.",
        "The definitions need to be adjusted when the evaluation target itself is a person, e.g. the political sentiment classification by Durant and Smith (2007).",
        "Our unsupervised mining approach for mining personal and impersonal sentences consists of two main steps.",
        "First, we extract an initial set of personal and impersonal sentences with some heuristic rules: If the first word of one sentence is (or implies) a personal pronoun including ' I', 'we', and 'do', then the sentence is extracted as a personal sentence; If the first word of one sentence is an impersonal pronoun including 'it', 'they', 'this', and 'these', then the sentence is extracted as an impersonal sentence.",
        "Second, we apply the classifier which is trained with the initial set of personal and impersonal sentences to classify the remaining sentences.",
        "This step aims to classify the sentences without pronouns (e.g. E3).",
        "Figure 1 shows the unsupervised mining algorithm.",

        "4 Employing Personal/Impersonal Views in Supervised Sentiment Classification",
        "After unsupervised mining of personal and impersonal sentences, the training data is divided into two views: the personal view, which contains personal sentences, and the impersonal view, which contains impersonal sentences.",
        "Obviously, these two views can be used to train two different classifiers, f1 and f2 , for sentiment classification respectively.",
        "Since our mining approach is unsupervised, there inevitably exist some noises.",
        "In addition, the sentences of different views may share the same information for sentiment classification.",
        "For example, consider the following two sentences: 'It is a waste of money.'",
        "and 'Do not waste your money.'",
        "Apparently, the first one belongs to the impersonal view while the second one belongs to personal view, according to our heuristic rules.",
        "However, these two sentences share the same word, 'waste', which conveys strong negative sentiment information.",
        "This suggests that training a single-view classifier f3with all sentences should help.",
        "Therefore, three base classifiers, f1, f2 , and f3, are eventually derived from the personal view, the impersonal Procedure:",
        "view and the single view, respectively.",
        "Each base classifier provides not only the class label outputs but also some kinds of confidence measurements, e.g. posterior probabilities of the testing sample belonging to each class.",
        "Formally, each base classifier f (l = 1,2,3) assigns a test sample (denoted as xi ) a posterior probability vector P(xt ):",
        "P(x, )=< p(cj x, ), p(c2| x, ) >twhere p(c11 x, ) denotes the probability that the l-th base classifier considers the sample belonging to c1.",
        "In the ensemble learning literature, various methods have been presented for combining base classifiers.",
        "The combining methods are categorized into two groups (Duin, 2002): fixed rules such as voting rule, product rule, and sum rule (Kittler et al., 1998), and trained rules such as weighted sum rule (Fumera and Roli, 2005) and meta-learning approaches (Vilalta and Drissi, 2002).",
        "In this study, we choose a fixed rule and a trained rule to combine the three base classifiers fx, f2, and f3.",
        "The chosen fixed rule is product rule which combine base classifiers by multiplying the posterior possibilities and using the multiplied possibility for decision, i.e.",
        "assign y ® cj where j = arg max Y\\ p(ct | xl )",
        "The chosen trained rule is stacking (Vilalta and Drissi, 2002; Dzeroski and Zenko, 2004) where a meta-classifier is trained with the output of the base classifiers as the input.",

        "Figure 5 also shows that our approach is rather robust and achieves excellent performances in different training data sizes, although our approach fails on two domains, i.e. book and DVD, when only 5% of the labeled data are used.",
        "This failure may be due to that some of the samples in these two domains are too ambiguous and hard to classify.",
        "Manual checking shows that quite a lot of samples on these two domains are even too difficult for professionals to give a high-confident label.",
        "Another possible reason is that there exist too many objective descriptions in these two domains, thus introducing too much noisy information for semi-supervised learning.",
        "The effectiveness of different sizes of chosen samples in each iteration is also evaluated like n1 = n2 = n3 = 6 and n1 = 3, n2 = n3 = 6 (This assignment is considered because the personal view classifier performs worse than the other two classifiers).",

        "One main reason for the effectiveness of our approach on supervised learning is the way how personal and impersonal views are dealt with.",
        "As personal and impersonal views have different ways of expressing opinions, splitting them into two separations can filter some classification noises.",

        "Although the words 'amazing' and 'good' convey strong positive sentiment information, the whole text is negative.",
        "If we get the bag-of-words from the whole text, the classification result will be wrong.",
        "Rather, splitting the text into two parts based on different views allows correct classification as the personal view rarely contains impersonal words such as 'amazing' and 'good'.",
        "The classification result will thus be influenced by the impersonal view.",
        "In addition, a document may contain both personal and impersonal sentences, and each of them, to a certain extent, , provides classification evidence.",
        "In fact, we randomly select 50 documents in the domain of kitchen appliances and find that 80% of the documents take both personal and impersonal sentences in which both of them express explicit opinions.",
        "That is to say, the two views provide different, complementary information for classification.",

        "As mentioned in Section 1, personal view contains X 's \"subjective\" feeling, and impersonal view contains Y 's \"objective\" (i.e. or at least criteria-based) evaluation of the target object.",
        "However, our technically-defined concepts of personal/impersonal are definitely different from subjective/objective: Personal view can certainly contain many objective expressions, e.g. 'I bought this electric kettle' and impersonal view can contain many subjective expressions, e.g. 'It is disappointing'.",
        "Our technically-defined personal/impersonal views are two different ways to describe opinions.",
        "Personal sentences are often used to express opinions in a direct way and their target object should be one of X. Impersonal ones are often used to express opinions in an indirect way and their target object should be one of Y.",
        "The ideal definition of personal (or impersonal) view given in Section 1 is believed to be a subset of our technical definition of personal (or impersonal) view.",
        "Thus impersonal view may contain both Y 's objective evaluation (more likely to be domain independent) and subjective Y's description.",
        "In addition, simply splitting text into subjective/objective views is not particularly helpful.",
        "Since a piece of objective text provides rather limited implicit classification information, the classification abilities of the two views are very unbalanced.",
        "This makes the co-training process unfeasible.",
        "Therefore, we believe that our technically-defined personal/impersonal views are more suitable for two-view learning compared to subjective/objective views."

        "In this paper, we propose a robust and effective two-view model for sentiment classification based on personal/impersonal views.",
        "Here, the personal view consists of subjective sentences whose subject is a person, whereas the impersonal view consists of objective sentences whose subject is not a person.",
        "Such views are lexically cued and can be obtained without pre-labeled data and thus we explore an unsupervised learning approach to mine them.",
        "Combination methods and a co-training algorithm are proposed to deal with supervised and semi-supervised sentiment classification respectively.",
        "Evaluation on product reviews from eight domains shows that our approach significantly improves the performance across all eight domains on supervised sentiment classification and greatly outperforms the baseline with more than 7% accuracy improvement on the average across seven of eight domains (except the DVD domain) on semi-supervised sentiment classification.",
        "In the future work, we will integrate the subjectivity summarization strategy (Pang and Lee, 2004) to help discard noisy objective sentences.",
        "Moreover, we need to consider the cases when both X and Y appear in a sentence.",
        "For example, the sentence \"I think they're poor\" should be an impersonal view but wrongly classified as a personal one according to our technical rules.",
        "We believe that these will help improve our approach and hopefully are applicable to the DVD domain.",
        "Another interesting and practical idea is to integrate active learning (Settles, 2009), another popular but principally different kind of semi-supervised learning approach, with our two-view learning approach to build high-performance systems with the least labeled data."
