        "Selectional Preferences encode the set of admissible argument values for a relation.",
        "For example, locations are likely to appear in the second argument of the relation X is headquartered in Y and companies or organizations in the first.",
        "A large, high-quality database of preferences has the potential to improve the performance of a wide range of NLP tasks including semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), pronoun resolution (Bergsma et al., 2008), textual inference (Pantel et al., 2007), word-sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1997), and many more.",
        "Therefore, much attention has been focused on automatically computing them based on a corpus of relation instances.",
        "Resnik (1996) presented the earliest work in this area, describing an information-theoretic approach that inferred selectional preferences based on the WordNet hypernym hierarchy.",
        "Recent work (Erk, 2007; Bergsma et al., 2008) has moved away from generalization to known classes, instead utilizing distributional similarity between nouns to generalize beyond observed relation-argument pairs.",
        "This avoids problems like WordNet's poor coverage of proper nouns and is shown to improve performance.",
        "These methods, however, no longer produce the generalized class for an argument.",
        "In this paper we describe a novel approach to computing selectional preferences by making use of unsupervised topic models.",
        "Our approach is able to combine benefits of both kinds of methods: it retains the generalization and human-interpretability of class-based approaches and is also competitive with the direct methods on predictive tasks.",
        "Unsupervised topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and its variants are characterized by a set of hidden topics, which represent the underlying semantic structure of a document collection.",
        "For our problem these topics offer an intuitive interpretation they represent the (latent) set of classes that store the preferences for the different relations.",
        "Thus, topic models are a natural fit for modeling our relation data.",
        "In particular, our system, called Lda-sp, uses LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004), an extension of LDA that simultaneously models two sets of distributions for each topic.",
        "These two sets represent the two arguments for the relations.",
        "Thus, lda-sp is able to capture information about the pairs of topics that commonly co-occur.",
        "This information is very helpful in guiding inference.",
        "We run Lda-sp to compute preferences on a massive dataset of binary relations r (01,02) extracted from the Web by textrunner (Banko and Etzioni, 2008).",
        "Our experiments demonstrate that lda-sp significantly outperforms state of the art approaches obtaining an 85% increase in recall at precision 0.9 on the standard pseudo-disambiguation task.",
        "Additionally, because Lda-sp is based on a formal probabilistic model, it has the advantage that it can naturally be applied in many scenarios.",
        "For example, we can obtain a better understanding of similar relations (Table 1), filter out incorrect inferences based on querying our model (Section 4.3), as well as produce a repository of class-based preferences with a little manual effort as demonstrated in Section 4.4.",
        "In all these cases we obtain high quality results, for example, massively outperforming Pantel et al.",

      "text": [
        "Previous work on selectional preferences can be broken into four categories: class-based approaches (Resnik, 1996; Li and Abe, 1998; Clark and Weir, 2002; Pantel et al., 2007), similarity based approaches (Dagan et al., 1999; Erk, 2007), discriminative (Bergsma et al., 2008), and generative probabilistic models (Rooth et al., 1999).",
        "Class-based approaches, first proposed by Resnik (1996), are the most studied of the four.",
        "They make use of a predefined set of classes, either manually produced (e.g. WordNet), or automatically generated (Pantel, 2003).",
        "For each relation, some measure of the overlap between the classes and observed arguments is used to identify those that best describe the arguments.",
        "These techniques produce a human-interpretable output, but often suffer in quality due to an incoherent taxonomy, inability to map arguments to a class (poor lexical coverage), and word sense ambiguity.",
        "Because of these limitations researchers have investigated non-class based approaches, which attempt to directly classify a given noun-phrase as plausible/implausible for a relation.",
        "Of these, the similarity based approaches make use of a distributional similarity measure between arguments and evaluate a heuristic scoring function:",
        "arg'€Seeii(rel)",
        "!Our repository of selectional preferences is available at http ://www.",
        "cs.Washington.edu/research/ ldasp.",
        "Erk (2007) showed the advantages of this approach over Resnik's information-theoretic class-based method on a pseudo-disambiguation evaluation.",
        "These methods obtain better lexical coverage, but are unable to obtain any abstract representation of selectional preferences.",
        "Our solution fits into the general category of generative probabilistic models, which model each relation/argument combination as being generated by a latent class variable.",
        "These classes are automatically learned from the data.",
        "This retains the class-based flavor of the problem, without the knowledge limitations of the explicit class-based approaches.",
        "Probably the closest to our work is a model proposed by Rooth et al.",
        "(1999), in which each class corresponds to a multinomial over relations and arguments and EM is used to learn the parameters of the model.",
        "In contrast, we use a LinkLDA framework in which each relation is associated with a corresponding multinomial distribution over classes, and each argument is drawn from a class-specific distribution over words; LinkLDA captures co-occurrence of classes in the two arguments.",
        "Additionally we perform full Bayesian inference using collapsed Gibbs sampling, in which parameters are integrated out (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "Recently, Bergsma et.",
        "al.",
        "(2008) proposed the first discriminative approach to selectional preferences.",
        "Their insight that pseudo-negative examples could be used as training data allows the application of an SVM classifier, which makes use of many features in addition to the relation-argument co-occurrence frequencies used by other methods.",
        "They automatically generated positive and negative examples by selecting arguments having high and low mutual information with the relation.",
        "Since it is a discriminative approach it is amenable to feature engineering, but needs to be retrained and tuned for each task.",
        "On the other hand, generative models produce complete probability distributions of the data, and hence can be integrated with other systems and tasks in a more principled manner (see Sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.1).",
        "Additionally, unlike lda-sp Bergsma et al.",
        "'s system doesn't produce human-interpretable topics.",
        "Finally, we note that lda-sp and Bergsma's system are potentially complimentary - the output of Lda-sp could be used to generate higher-quality training data for Bergsma, potentially improving their results.",
        "Topic models such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and its variants have recently begun to see use in many NLP applications such as summarization (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006), document alignment and segmentation (Chen et al., 2009), and inferring class-attribute hierarchies (Reisinger and Paşca, 2009).",
        "Our particular model, LinkLDA, has been applied to a few NLP tasks such as simultaneously modeling the words appearing in blog posts and users who will likely respond to them (Yano et al., 2009), modeling topic-aligned articles in different languages (Mimno et al., 2009), and word sense induction (Brody and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Finally, we highlight two systems, developed independently of our own, which apply LDA-style models to similar tasks.",
        "O Séaghdha (2010) proposes a series of LDA-style models for the task of computing selectional preferences.",
        "This work learns selectional preferences between the following grammatical relations: verb-object, noun-noun, and adjective-noun.",
        "It also focuses on jointly modeling the generation of both predicate and argument, and evaluation is performed on a set of human-plausibility judgments obtaining impressive results against Keller and Lapata's (2003) Web hit-count based system.",
        "Van Durme and Gildea (2009) proposed applying LDA to general knowledge templates extracted using the Knext system (Schubert and Tong, 2003).",
        "In contrast, our work uses LinkLDA and focuses on modeling multiple arguments of a relation (e.g., the subject and direct object of a verb).",
        "3 Topic Models for Selectional Prefs.",
        "We present a series of topic models for the task of computing selectional preferences.",
        "These models vary in the amount of independence they assume between a\\ and ci2- At one extreme is Indepen-dentLDA, a model which assumes that both a\\ and Ü2 are generated completely independently.",
        "On the other hand, JointLDA, the model at the other extreme (Figure 1) assumes both arguments of a specific extraction are generated based on a single hidden variable z. LinkLDA (Figure 2) lies between these two extremes, and as demonstrated in Section 4, it is the best model for our relation data.",
        "We are given a set R of binary relations and a corpus V = {r(ai, 02)} of extracted instances for these relations.",
        "Our task is to compute, for each argument of each relation r, a set of usual argument values (noun phrases) that it takes.",
        "For example, for the relation is headquartered in the first argument set will include companies like Microsoft, Intel, General Motors and second argument will favor locations like New York, California, Seattle.",
        "We first describe the straightforward application of LDA to modeling our corpus of extracted relations.",
        "In this case two separate LDA models are used to model a\\ and 02 independently.",
        "In the generative model for our data, each relation r has a corresponding multinomial over topics 6r, drawn from a Dirichlet.",
        "For each extraction, a hidden topic z is first picked according to 9r, and then the observed argument a is chosen according to the multinomial ßz.",
        "Readers familiar with topic modeling terminology can understand our approach as follows: we treat each relation as a document whose contents consist of a bags of words corresponding to all the noun phrases observed as arguments of the relation in our corpus.",
        "Formally, LDA generates each argument in the corpus of relations as follows: for each topic t = 1... T do",
        "Generate ßt according to symmetric Dirichlet distribution Dir(r?).",
        "end for",
        "Generate 6r according to Dirichlet distribution Dir(a).",
        "for each tuple i = 1... Nr do",
        "Generate zr,% from Multinomial^).",
        "Generate the argument ar^ from multinomial ßZri.",
        "end for end for",
        "One weakness of IndependentLDA is that it doesn't jointly model a\\ and 02 together.",
        "Clearly this is undesirable, as information about which topics one of the arguments favors can help inform the topics chosen for the other.",
        "For example, class pairs such as {team, game), {politician, political issue) form much more plausible selectional preferences than, say, {team, political issue), {politician, game).",
        "As a more tightly coupled alternative, we first propose JointLDA, whose graphical model is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "The key difference in JointLDA (versus LDA) is that instead of one, it maintains two sets of topics (latent distributions over words) denoted by ß and 7, one for classes of each argument.",
        "A topic id k represents a pair of topics, ßk and 7fc, that co-occur in the arguments of extracted relations.",
        "Common examples include (Person, Location), (Politician, Political issue), etc.",
        "The hidden variable z = k indicates that the noun phrase for the first argument was drawn from the multinomial ßk, and that the second argument was drawn from 7^.",
        "The per-relation distribution 6r is a multinomial over the topic ids and represents the selectional preferences, both for arg Is and arg2s of a relation r.",
        "Although JointLDA has many desirable properties, it has some drawbacks as well.",
        "Most notably, in JointLDA topics correspond to pairs of multinomials (ßk, 7fc); this leads to a situation in which multiple redundant distributions are needed to represent the same underlying semantic class.",
        "For example consider the case where we we need to represent the following selectional preferences for our corpus of relations: (person, location), (person, organization), and (person, crime).",
        "Because JointLDA requires a separate pair of multinomials for each topic, it is forced to use 3 separate multinomials to represent the class person, rather than learning a single distribution representing person and choosing 3 different topics for ci2- This results in poor generalization because the data for a single class is divided into multiple topics.",
        "In order to address this problem while maintaining the sharing of influence between a\\ and 02, we next present LinkLDA, which represents a compromise between IndependentLDA and JointLDA.",
        "LinkLDA is more flexible than JointLDA, allowing different topics to be chosen for a\\, and 02, however still models the generation of topics from the same distribution for a given relation.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the LinkLDA model in the plate notation, which is analogous to the model in (Erosheva et al., 2004).",
        "In particular note that each cii is drawn from a different hidden topic Zi, however the Zi's are drawn from the same distribution 6r for a given relation r. To facilitate learning related topic pairs between arguments we employ a sparse prior over the per-relation topic distributions.",
        "Because a few topics are likely to be assigned most of the probability mass for a given relation it is more likely (although not necessary) that the same topic number k will be drawn for both arguments.",
        "When comparing LinkLDA with JointLDA the better model may not seem immediately clear.",
        "On the one hand, JointLDA jointly models the generation of both arguments in an extracted tuple.",
        "This allows one argument to help disambiguate the other in the case of ambiguous relation strings.",
        "LinkLDA, however, is more flexible; rather than requiring both arguments to be generated from one of\\Z\\ possible pairs of multinomials (ßz, 7^), LinkLDA allows the arguments of a given extraction to be generated from \\Z\\ possible pairs.",
        "Thus, instead of imposing a hard constraint that Z\\ = Z2 (as in JointLDA), LinkLDA simply assigns a higher probability to states in which z\\ = Z2, because both hidden variables are drawn from the same (sparse) distribution 6r.",
        "LinkLDA can thus reuse argument classes, choosing different combinations of topics for the arguments if it fits the data better.",
        "In Section 4 we show experimentally that LinkLDA outperforms JointLDA (and IndependentLDA) by wide margins.",
        "We use LDA-SP to refer to LinkLDA in all the experiments below."

        "This produces robust parameter estimates, as it allows computation of expectations over the posterior distribution as opposed to estimating maximum likelihood parameters.",
