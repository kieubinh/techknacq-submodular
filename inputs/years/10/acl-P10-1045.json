        "Language researchers have long been aware that many words place semantic restrictions on the words with which they can co-occur in a syntactic relationship.",
        "Violations of these restrictions make the sense of a sentence odd or implausible:",
        "(1) Colourless green ideas sleep furiously.",
        "(2) The deer shot the hunter.",
        "Recognising whether or not a selectional restriction is satisfied can be an important trigger for metaphorical interpretations (Wilks, 1978) and also plays a role in the time course of human sentence processing (Rayner et al., 2004).",
        "A more relaxed notion of selectional preference captures the idea that certain classes of entities are more likely than others to fill a given argument slot of a predicate.",
        "In Natural Language Processing, knowledge about probable, less probable and wholly infelicitous predicate-argument pairs is of value for numerous applications, for example semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Zapirain et al., 2009).",
        "The notion of selectional preference is not restricted to surface-level predicates such as verbs and modifiers, but also extends to semantic frames (Erk, 2007) and inference rules (Pantel et al., 2007).",
        "The fundamental problem that selectional preference models must address is data sparsity: in many cases insufficient corpus data is available to reliably measure the plausibility of a predicate-argument pair by counting its observed frequency.",
        "A rarely seen pair may be fundamentally implausible (a carrot laughed) or plausible but rarely expressed (a manservant laughed).",
        "In general, it is beneficial to smooth plausibility estimates by integrating knowledge about the frequency of other, similar predicate-argument pairs.",
        "The task thus share some of the nature of language modelling; however, it is a task less amenable to approaches that require very large training corpora and one where the semantic quality of a model is of greater importance.",
        "This paper takes up tools (\"topic models\") that have been proven successful in modelling document-word co-occurrences and adapts them to the task of selectional preference learning.",
        "Advantages of these models include a well-defined generative model that handles sparse data well, the ability to jointly induce semantic classes and predicate-specific distributions over those classes, and the enhanced statistical strength achieved by sharing knowledge across predicates.",
        "Section 2 surveys prior work on selectional preference modelling and on semantic applications of topic models.",
        "Section 3 describes the models used in our experiments.",
        "Section 4 provides details of the experimental design.",
        "Section 5 presents results for our models on the task of predicting human plausibility judgements for predicate-argument combinations; we show that performance is generally competitive with or superior to a number of other models, including models using Web-scale resources, especially for low-frequency examples.",
        "In Section 6 we wrap up by summarising the paper's conclusions and sketching directions for future research."

        "The representation (and latterly, learning) of selectional preferences for verbs and other predicates has long been considered a fundamental problem in computational semantics (Resnik, 1993).",
        "Many approaches to the problem use lexical taxonomies such as WordNet to identify the semantic classes that typically fill a particular argument slot for a predicate (Resnik, 1993; Clark and Weir, 2002; Schulte im Walde et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, however, we focus on methods that do not assume the availability of a comprehensive taxonomy but rather induce semantic classes automatically from a corpus of text.",

        "The discovery of these predicate-argument clusters and the estimation of distributions on latent and observed variables are performed simultaneously via an Expectation Maximisation procedure.",

        "They demonstrate that noisy counts from a Web search engine can yield estimates of plausibility for predicate-argument pairs that are superior to models learned from a smaller parsed corpus.",
        "The assumption inherent in this approach is that given sufficient text, all plausible predicate-argument pairs will be observed with frequency roughly correlated with their degree of plausibility.",
        "While the model is undeniably straightforward and powerful, it has a number of drawbacks: it presupposes an extremely large corpus, the like of which will only be available for a small number of domains and languages, and it is only suitable for relations that are identifiable by searching raw text for specific lexical patterns.",
        "The task of inducing coherent semantic clusters is common to many research areas.",
        "In the field of document modelling, a class of methods known as \"topic models\" have become a de facto standard for identifying semantic structure in documents.",

        "The combination of a well-defined probabilistic model and Gibbs sampling procedure for estimation guarantee (eventual) convergence and the avoidance of degenerate solutions.",
        "As a result of intensive research in recent years, the behaviour of topic models is well-understood and computationally efficient implementations have been developed.",
        "The tools provided by this research are used in this paper as the building blocks of our selectional preference models.",
        "Hierarchical Bayesian modelling has recently gained notable popularity in many core areas of natural language processing, from morphological segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2009) to opinion modelling (Lin et al., 2006).",
        "Yet so far there have been relatively few applications to traditional lexical semantic tasks.",
        "Boyd-Graber et al.",

        "Brody and Lapata (2009) adapt the basic LDA model for application to unsupervised word sense induction; in this context, the topics learned by the model are assumed to correspond to distinct senses of a particular lemma.",

        "Griffiths et al.",

        "(2010) have also investigated the use of topic models for selectional preference learning.",
        "Their goal is slightly different to ours in that they wish to model the probability of a binary predicate taking two specified arguments, i.e., P(m, n2|v), whereas we model the joint and conditional probabilities of a predicate taking a single specified argument.",
        "The model architecture they propose, LinkLDA, falls somewhere between our LDA and DUAL-LDA models.",
        "Hence LinkLDA could be adapted to estimate P(n, v|r) as DUAL-LDA does, but aprelimi-nary investigation indicates that it does not perform well in this context.",
        "The most likely explanation is that LinkLDA generates its two arguments independently, which may be suitable for distinct argument positions of a given predicate but is unsuitable when one of those \"arguments\" is in fact the predicate.",
        "The models developed in this paper, though intended for semantic modelling, also bear some similarity to the internals of generative syntax models such as the \"infinite tree\" (Finkel et al., 2007).",
        "In some ways, our models are less ambitious than comparable syntactic models as they focus on specific fragments of grammatical structure rather than learning a more general representation of sentence syntax.",
        "It would be interesting to evaluate whether this restricted focus improves the quality of the learned model or whether general syntax models can also capture fine-grained knowledge about combinatorial semantics."

        "One important point is that the smoothing effects of the Dirichlet priors on 6vand $z are greatest for predicates and arguments that are rarely seen, reflecting an intuitive lack of certainty.",
        "We assume an asymmetric Dirichlet prior on 6v (the a parameters can differ for each class) and a symmetric prior on $z (all ß parameters are equal); this follows the recommendations of Wallach et al.",

This could potentially lead to a loss of model quality, but in practice the ability to induce \"tighter\" clusters seems to counteract any deterioration this causes.",

        "To compare plausibility scores for different predicates, we require the joint probability P(n, v| r); as LDA does not provide this, we approximate PLDA(n,v|r) = Pbnc(v|r)PLDA(n|v, r), where PBNC (v|r) is proportional to the frequency with which predicate v is observed as an instance of relation r in the BNC.",
