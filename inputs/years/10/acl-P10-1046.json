        "For many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly those involving meaning, creating labeled test data is difficult or expensive.",
        "One way to mitigate this problem is with pseudo-words, a method for automatically creating test corpora without human labeling, originally proposed for word sense disambiguation (Gale et al., 1992; Schütze, 1992).",
        "While pseudo-words are now less often used for word sense disambigation, they are a common way to evaluate selectional preferences, models that measure the strength of association between a predicate and its argument filler, e.g., that the noun lunch is a likely object of eat.",
        "Selectional preferences are useful for NLP tasks such as parsing and semantic role labeling (Zapirain et al., 2009).",
        "Since evaluating them in isolation is difficult without labeled data, pseudoword evaluations can be an attractive evaluation framework.",
        "Pseudo-word evaluations are currently used to evaluate a variety of language modeling tasks (Erk, 2007; Bergsma et al., 2008).",
        "However, evaluation design varies across research groups.",
        "This paper studies the evaluation itself, showing how choices can lead to overly optimistic results if the evaluation is not designed carefully.",
        "We show in this paper that current methods of applying pseudo-words to selectional preferences vary greatly, and suggest improvements.",
        "A pseudo-word is the concatenation of two words (e.g. house/car).",
        "One word is the original in a document, and the second is the con-founder.",
        "Consider the following example of applying pseudo-words to the selectional restrictions of the verb focus:",
        "Original: This story focuses on the campaign.",
        "Test: This story/part focuses on the campaign/meeting.",
        "In the original sentence, focus has two arguments: a subject story and an object campaign.",
        "In the test sentence, each argument of the verb is replaced by pseudo-words.",
        "A model is evaluated by its success at determining which of the two arguments is the original word.",
        "Two problems exist in the current use of pseudo-words to evaluate selectional preferences.",
        "First, selectional preferences historically focus on subsets of data such as unseen words or words in certain frequency ranges.",
        "While work on unseen data is important, evaluating on the entire dataset provides an accurate picture of a model's overall performance.",
        "Most other NLP tasks today evaluate all test examples in a corpus.",
        "We will show that seen arguments actually dominate newspaper articles, and thus propose creating test sets that include all verb-argument examples to avoid artificial evaluations.",
        "Second, pseudo-word evaluations vary in how they choose confounders.",
        "Previous work has attempted to maintain a similar corpus frequency to the original, but it is not clear how best to do this, nor how it affects the task's difficulty.",
        "We argue in favor of using nearest-neighbor frequencies and show how using random confounders produces overly optimistic results.",
        "Finally, we present a surprisingly simple baseline that outperforms the state-of-the-art and is far less memory and computationally intensive.",
        "It outperforms current similarity-based approaches by over 13% when the test set includes all of the data.",
        "We conclude with a suggested backoffmodel based on this baseline."

        "Rooth et al.",
        "(1999) tested 3000 random (v,n) pairs, but required the verbs and nouns to appear between 30 and 3000 times in training.",
        "They also chose confounders randomly so that the new pair was unseen.",
        "Keller and Lapata (2003) specifically addressed the impact of unseen data by using the web to first 'see' the data.",
        "They evaluated unseen pseudo-words by attempting to first observe them in a larger corpus (the Web).",
        "One modeling difference was to disambiguate the nouns as selectional preferences instead of the verbs.",
        "Given a test pair (v,n) and its confounder (v,n'), they used web searches such as \"v Det n\" to make the decision.",
        "Results beat or matched current results at the time.",
        "We present a similarly motivated, but new web-based approach later.",
        "Very recent work with pseudo-words (Erk, 2007; Bergsma et al., 2008) further blurs the lines between what is included in training and test data, using frequency-based and semantic-based reasons for deciding what is included.",
        "We discuss this further in section 5.",
        "As can be seen, there are two main factors when devising a pseudo-word evaluation for selectional preferences: (1) choosing (v, n) pairs from the test set, and (2) choosing the confounding n' (or v').",
        "The confounder has not been looked at in detail and as best we can tell, these factors have varied significantly.",

        "Confounder Choice: Performance is strongly influenced by the method used when choosing confounders.",
        "This is consistent with findings for WSD that corpus frequency choices alter the task (Gaustad, 2001; Nakov and Hearst, 2003).",
        "Our results show the gradation of performance as one moves across the spectrum from completely random to closest in frequency.",
        "The Erk model dropped 27%, Google 15%, and our baseline 12%.",
        "The overly optimistic performance on random data suggests using the nearest neighbor approach for experiments.",
        "Nearest neighbor avoids evaluating on 'easy' datasets, and our baseline (at 79.5%) still provides room for improvement.",
        "But perhaps just as important, the nearest neighbor approach facilitates the most reproducibile results in experiments since there is little ambiguity in how the confounder is selected.",
        "Realistic Confounders: Despite its over-optimism, the random approach to confounder selection may be the correct approach in some circumstances.",
        "For some tasks that need selectional preferences, random confounders may be more realistic.",
        "It's possible, for example, that the options in a PP-attachment task might be distributed more like the random rather than nearest neighbor models.",
        "In any case, this is difficult to decide without a specific application in mind.",
        "Absent such specific motiviation, a nearest neighbor approach is the most conservative, and has the advantage of creating a reproducible experiment, whereas random choice can vary across design.",
        "Training Size: Training data improves the conditional probability baseline, but does not help the smoothing model.",
        "Figure 5 shows a lack of improvement across training sizes for both jaccard and cosine implementations of the Erk model.",
        "The Train x1 size is approximately the same size used in Erk (2007), although on a different corpus.",
        "We optimized argument cutoffs for each training size, but the model still appears to suffer from additional noise that the conditional probability baseline does not.",
        "This may suggest that observing a test argument with a verb in training is more reliable than a smoothing model that compares all training arguments against that test example.",
        "High Precision Baseline: Our conditional probability baseline is very precise.",
        "It outperforms the smoothed similarity based Erk model and gives high results across tests.",
        "The only combination when Erk is better is when the training data includes just one year (one twelfth of the NYT section) and the confounder is chosen com-",

        "Our reported 93.9% for Erk-Jaccard is also significantly higher than their reported 81.4%, but this could be due to the random choices we made for confounders, or most likely corpus differences between Gigaword and the subset of FrameNet they evaluated.",
        "Ultimately we have found that complex models for selectional preferences may not be necessary, depending on the task.",
        "The higher computational needs of smoothing approaches are best for backing off when unseen data is encountered.",

        "It is crucially important to be clear during evaluations about how the confounder was generated.",
