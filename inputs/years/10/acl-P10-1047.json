        "Statistical machine translation into a morphologically complex language such as Turkish, Finnish or Arabic, involves the generation of target words with the proper morphology, in addition to properly ordering the target words.",
        "Earlier work on translation from English to Turkish (Oflazer and",
        "El-Kahlout and Oflazer, 2010) has used an approach which relied on identifying the contextually correct parts-of-speech, roots and any morphemes on the English side, and the complete sequence of roots and overt derivational and inflectional morphemes for each word on the Turkish side.",
        "Once these were identified as separate tokens, they were then used as \"words\" in a standard phrase-based framework (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "They have reported that, given the typical complexity of Turkish words, there was a substantial percentage of words whose morphological structure was incorrect: either the morphemes were not applicable for the part-of-speech category of the root word selected, or the morphemes were in the wrong order.",
        "The main reason given for these problems was that the same statistical translation, reordering and language modeling mechanisms were being employed to both determine the morphological structure of the words and, at the same time, get the global order of the words correct.",
        "Even though a significant improvement of a standard word-based baseline was achieved, further analysis hinted at a direction where morphology and syntax on the Turkish side had to be dealt with using separate mechanisms.",
        "Motivated by the observation that many local and some nonlocal syntactic structures in English essentially map to morphologically complex words in Turkish, we present a radically different approach which does not segment Turkish words into morphemes, but uses a representation equivalent to the full word form.",
        "On the English side, we rely on a full syntactic analysis using a dependency parser.",
        "This analysis then lets us abstract and encode many local and some nonlocal syntactic structures as complex tags (dynamically, as opposed to the static complex tags as proposed by Birch et al.",
        "(2007) and Hassan et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "Thus we can bring the representation of English syntax closer to the Turkish morphosyntax.",
        "Such an approach enables the following: (i) Driven by the pattern of morphological structures of full word forms on the Turkish side represented as root words and complex tags, we can identify and reorganize phrases on the English side, to \"align\" English syntax to Turkish morphology wherever possible.",
        "(ii) Continuous and discontinuous variants of certain (syntactic) phrases can be conflated during the SMT phrase extraction process.",
        "(iii) The length of the English sentences can be dramatically reduced, as most function words encoding syntax are now abstracted into complex tags.",
        "(iv) The representation of both the source and the target sides of the parallel corpus can now be mostly normalized.",
        "This facilitates the use of factored phrase-based translation that was not previously applicable due to the morphological complexity on the target side and mismatch between source and target morphologies.",
        "We find that with the full set of syntax-to-morphology transformations and some additional techniques we can get about 39% relative improvement in BLEU scores over a word-based baseline and about 28% improvement of a factored baseline, all experiments being done over 10 training and test sets.",
        "We also find that further constituent reordering taking advantage of the syntactic analysis of the source side, does not provide tangible improvements when averaged over the 10 data sets.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basic idea behind syntax-to-morphology alignment.",
        "Section 3 describes our experimental set-up and presents results from a sequence of incremental syntax-to-morphology transformations, and additional techniques.",
        "Section 4 summarizes our constituent reordering experiments and their results.",
        "Section 5 presents a review of related work and situates our approach.",
        "We assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003) and factored statistical machine translation (Koehn and Hoang, 2007)."

        "In this section, we describe how we map between certain source language syntactic structures and target words with complex morphological structures.",
        "At the top of Figure 1, we see a pair of (syntactic) phrases, where we have (positionally) aligned the words that should be translated to each other.",
        "We can note that the function words on and",

        "their are not really aligned to any of the Turkish words as they really correspond to two of the morphemes of the last Turkish word.",
        "When we tag and syntactically analyze the English side into dependency relations, and morphologically analyze and disambiguate the Turkish phrase, we get the representation in the middle of Figure 1, where we have co-indexed components that should map to each other, and some of the syntactic relations that the function words are involved in are marked with dependency links.",
        "The basic idea in our approach is to take various function words on the English side, whose syntactic relationships are identified by the parser, and then package them as complex tags on the related content words.",
        "So, in this example, if we move the first two function words from the English side and attach as syntactic tags to the word they are in dependency relation with, we get the aligned representation at the bottom of Figure 1. '",
        "Here we can note that all root words and tags that correspond to each other are nicely structured and are in the same relative order.",
        "In fact, we can treat each token as being composed of two factors: the roots and the accompanying tags.",
        "The tags on the Turkish side encode morphosyntactic information encoded in the morphology of the words, while the (complex) tags on the English side encode local (and sometimes, non-local) syntactic information.",
        "Furthermore, we can see that before the transformations, the English side has 4 words, while afterwards it has only 2 words.",
        "We find (and elaborate later) that this reduction in the English side of the training corpus, in general, is about 30%, and is correlated with improved BLEU scores.",
        "We believe the removal of many function words and their folding into complex tags (which do not get involved in GIZA++ alignment - we only align the root words) seems to improve alignment as there are less number of \"words\" to worry about during that process.",
        "Another interesting side effect of this representation is the following.",
        "As the complex syntactic tags on the English side are based on syntactic relations and not necessarily positional proximity, the tag for relations in a phrase like in their cultural, historical and economic relations would be exactly the same as above.",
        "Thus phrase extraction algorithms can conflate all constructs like in their .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "economic relations as one phrase, regardless of the intervening modifiers, assuming that parser does its job properly.",
        "Not all cases can be captured as cleanly as the example above, but most transformations capture local and nonlocal syntax involving many function words and then encode syntax with complex tags resembling full morphological tags on the Turkish side.",
        "These transformations, however, are not meant to perform sentence level constituent reordering on the English side.",
        "We explore these later.",
        "We developed set of about 20 linguistically-motivated syntax-to-morphology transformations which had variants parameterized depending on what, for instance, the preposition or the adverbial was, and how they map to morphological structure on the Turkish side.",
        "For instance, one general rule handles cases like while .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "verb and if .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "verb etc., mapping these to appropriate complex tags.",
        "It is also possible that multiple transformations can apply to generate a single English complex tag: a portion of the tag can come from a verb complex transformation, and another from an adverbial phrase transformation involving a marked such as while.",
        "Our transformations handle the following cases:",
        "• Prepositions attach to the headword of their",
        "to help with alignment in German to English and reverse translation.",
        "complement noun phrase as a component in its complex tag.",
        "• Possessive pronouns attach to the headword they specify.",
        "• The possessive markers following a noun (separated by the tokenizer) attached to the noun.",
        "• Auxiliary verbs and negation markers attach to the lexical verb that they form a verb complex with.",
        "• Modals attach to the lexical verb they modify.",
        "• Forms of be used as predicates with adjectival or nominal dependents attach to the dependent.",
        "• Forms of be or have used to form passive voice with past participle verbs, and forms of be used with -ing verbs to form present continuous verbs, attach to the verb.",
        "• Various adverbial clauses formed with if, while, when, etc., are reorganized so that these markers attach to the head verb of the clause.",
        "As stated earlier, these rules are linguistically motivated and are based on the morphological structure of the target language words.",
        "Hence for different target languages these rules will be different.",
        "The rules recognize various local and nonlocal syntactic structures in the source side parse tree that correspond to complex morphological of target words and then remove source function words folding them into complex tags.",
        "For instance, the transformations in Figure 1 are handled by scripts that process Malt Parser's dependency structure output and that essentially implement the following sequence of rules expressed as pseudo code:",
        "Here <x>, <y> and <z> can be considered as Prolog like-variables that bind to patterns (mostly root words), and the conditions check for specified dependency relations (e.g., PMOD) between the left and the right sides.",
        "When the condition is satisfied, then the part matching the function word is removed and its syntactic information is appended to form the complex tag on the noun (<TAG> would either match null string or any previously appended function word markers.)",
        "There are several other rules that handle more mundane cases of date and time constructions (for which, the part of the date construct which the parser attaches a preposition, is usually different than the part on the Turkish side that gets inflected with case markers, and these have to be reconciled by overriding the parser output.)",

        "com/moses-support@mit.edu/msg01012.html indicated that MERT was not tested on multiple factors.",
        "The discussion thread at http://www.mail-archive.",
        "com/moses-support@mit.edu/msg0 02 62.html claimed that MERT does not help very much with factored models.",
        "With these observations, we opted not to experiment with MERT with the multiple factor approach we employed, given that it would be risky and time consuming to run MERT needed for 10 different models and then not necessarily see any (consistent) improvements.",
        "MERT however is orthogonal to the improvements we achieve here and can always be applied on top of the best model we get.",
        "As a baseline system, we built a standard phrase-based system, using the surface forms of the words without any transformations, and with a 3-gram LM in the decoder.",
        "We also built a second baseline system with a factored model.",
        "Instead of using just the surface form of the word, we included the root, part-of-speech and morphological tag information into the corpus as additional factors alongside the surface form.",
        "Thus, a token is represented with three factors as Surface|Root|Tags where Tags are complex tags on the English side, and morphological tags on the Turkish side.",

        "We aligned our training sets using only the root factor to conflate statistics from different forms of the same root.",
        "The rest of the factors are then automatically assumed to be aligned, based on the root alignment.",
        "Furthermore, in factored models, we can employ different language models for different factors.",
        "For the initial set of experiments we used 3-gram LMs for all the factors.",
        "For factored decoding, we employed a model whereby we let the decoder translate a surface form directly, but if/when that fails, the decoder can back-off with a generation model that builds a target word from independent translations of the root and tags.",
        "The results of our baseline models are given in top two rows of Table 1.",
        "As expected, the word-based baseline performs worse than the factored baseline.",
        "We believe that the use of multiple language models (some much less sparse than the surface LM) in the factored baseline is the main reason for the improvement.",
        "To gauge the effects of transformations separately, we first performed them in batches on the English side.",
        "These batches were (i) transformations involving nouns and adjectives (Noun+Adj), (ii) transformations involving verbs (Verb), (iii) transformations involving adverbs (Adv), and (iv) transformations involving verbs and adverbs (Verb+Adv).",
        "We also performed one set of transformations on the Turkish side.",
        "In general, English prepositions translate as case markers on Turkish nouns.",
        "However, there are quite a number of lexical postpositions in Turkish which also correspond to English prepositions.",
        "To normalize these with the handling of case-markers, we treated these postpositions as if they were case-markers and attached them to the immediately preceding noun, and then aligned the resulting training data (PostP).",
        "The results of these experiments are presented in Table 1.",
        "We can observe that the combined syntax-to-morphology transformations on the source side provide a substantial improvement by themselves and a simple target side transformation on top of those provides a further boost to 21.96 BLEU which represents a 28.57% relative improvement over the word-based baseline and a 18.00% relative improvement over the factored baseline.",
        "We can see that every transformation improves the baseline system and the highest performance is attained when all transformations are performed.",
        "However when we take a closer look at the individual transformations performed on English side, we observe that not all of them have the same effect.",
        "While Noun+Adj transformations give us an increase of 2.73 BLEU points, Verbs improve the result by only 0.8 points and improvement with Adverbs is even lower.",
        "To understand why we get such a difference, we investigated the correlation of the decrease in the number of tokens on both sides of the parallel data, with the change in BLEU scores.",
        "The graph in Figure 3 plots the BLEU scores and the number of tokens in the two sides of the training data as the data is modified with transformations.",
        "We can see that as the number of tokens in English decrease, the BLEU score increases.",
        "In order to measure the relationship between these two variables statistically, we performed a correlation analysis and found that there is a strong negative correlation of -0.99 between the BLEU score and the number of English tokens.",
        "We can also note that the largest reduction in the number of tokens comes with the application of the Noun+Adj transformations, which correlates with the largest increase in BLEU score.",
        "It is also interesting to look at the n-gram precision components of the BLEU scores (again averaged).",
        "In Table 2, we list these for words (actual BLEU), roots (BLEU-R) to see how effective we are in getting the root words right, and morphological tags, (BLEU-M), to see how effective we are in getting just the morphosyntax right.",
        "It seems we are getting almost 69% of the root words and 68% of the morphological tags correct, but not necessarily getting the combination equally as good, since only about 56% of the full word forms are correct.",
        "One possible way to address is to use longer distance constraints on the morphological tag factors, to see if we can select them better.",
        "Factored phrase-based SMT allows the use of multiple language models for the target side, for different factors during decoding.",
        "Since the number of possible distinct morphological tags (the morphological tag vocabulary size) in our training data (about 3700) is small compared to distinct number of surface forms (about 52K) and distinct roots (about 15K including numbers), it makes sense to investigate the contribution of higher order n-gram language models for the morphological tag factor on the target side, to see if we can address the observation in the previous section.",

Among these phrase table entries, those with p(e|t) œ p(t|e) and p(t|e) + p(e|t) larger than some threshold, can be considered as reliable mutual translations, in that they mostly translate to each other and not much to others.",

      "heading": "6. Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "We have presented a novel way to incorporate source syntactic structure in English-to-Turkish phrase-based machine translation by parsing the source sentences and then encoding many local and nonlocal source syntactic structures as additional complex tag factors.",
        "Our goal was to obtain representations of source syntactic structures that parallel target morphological structures, and enable us to extend factored translation, in applicability, to languages with very disparate morphological structures.",
        "In our experiments over a limited amount training data, but repeated with 10 different training and test sets, we found that syntax-to-morphology mapping transformations on the source side sentences, along with a very small set of transformations on the target side, coupled with some additional techniques provided about 39% relative improvement in BLEU scores over a word-based baseline and about 28% improvement of a factored baseline.",
        "We also experimented with numerous additional syntactic reordering transformation on the source to further bring the constituent order in line with the target order but found that these did not provide any tangible improvements when averaged over the 10 different data sets.",
        "It is possible that the techniques presented in this paper may be less effective if the available data is much larger, but we have reasons to believe that they will still be effective then also.",
        "The reduction in size of the source language side of the training corpus seems to be definitely effective and there no reason why such a reduction (if not more) will not be observed in larger data.",
        "Also, the preprocessing of English prepositional phrases and many adverbial phrases usually involve rather long distance relations in the source side syntactic structure and when such structures are coded as complex tags on the nominal or verbal heads, such long distance syntax is effectively \"localized\" and thus can be better captured with the limited window size used for phrase extraction.",
        "One limitation of the approach presented here is that it is not directly applicable in the reverse direction.",
        "The data encoding and set-up can directly be employed to generate English \"translation\" expressed as a sequence of root and complex tag combinations, but then some of the complex tags could encode various syntactic constructs.",
        "To finalize the translation after the decoding step, the function words/tags in the complex tag would then have to be unattached and their proper positions in the sentence would have to be located.",
        "The problem is essentially one of generating multiple candidate sentences with the unattached function words ambiguously positioned (say in a lattice) and then use a second language model to rerank these sentences to select the target sentence.",
        "This is an avenue of research that we intend to look at in the very near future."
