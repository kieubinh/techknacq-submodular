        "To investigate the generative models, we replace the two phrase translation probabilities and keep the other features identical to the baseline.",

        "We used a 4-gram language model with modified Kneser-Ney discounting for all experiments.",

        "We have shown that the technique is superior to limiting phrase lengths and smoothing with lexical probabilities alone.",
        "While models trained from Viterbi alignments already lead to good results, we have demonstrated that considering the 100-best alignments allows to better model the ambiguities in phrase segmentation.",
        "The proposed techniques are shown to be superior to previous approaches that only used lexical probabilities to smooth phrase tables or imposed limits on the phrase lengths.",
        "On the WMT08 Eu-roparl task we show improvements of 0.9 Bleu points with the trained phrase table and 1.4 Bleu points when interpolating the newly trained model with the original, heuristically extracted phrase table.",
        "In TER, improvements are 0.4 and 1.7 points.",
        "In addition to the improved performance, the trained models are smaller leading to faster and smaller translation systems."
