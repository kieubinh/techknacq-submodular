        "In the past decade, sequence labeling algorithms such as HMMs, CRFs, and Collins' perceptrons have been extensively studied in the field of NLP (Rabiner, 1989; Lafferty et al., 2001; Collins, 2002).",
        "Now they are indispensable in a wide range of NLP tasks including chunking, POS tagging, NER and so on (Sha and Pereira, 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005; Lin and Wu, 2009).",
        "One important task in sequence labeling is how to find the most probable label sequence from among all possible ones.",
        "This task, referred to as decoding, is usually carried out using the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967).",
        "The Viterbi algorithm has O(NL) time complexity, where N is the input size and L is the number of labels.",
        "Although the Viterbi algorithm is generally efficient, it becomes prohibitively slow when dealing with a large number of labels, since its computational cost is quadratic in L (Dietterich et al., 2008).",
        "Unfortunately, several sequence-labeling problems in NLP involve a large number of labels.",
        "For example, there are more than 40 and 2000 labels in POS tagging and supertagging, respectively (Brants, 2000; Matsuzaki et al., 2007).",
        "These tasks incur much higher computational costs than simpler tasks like NP chunking.",
        "What is worse, the number oflabels grows drastically ifwe jointly perform multiple tasks.",
        "As we shall see later, we need over 300 labels to reduce joint POS tagging and chunking into the single sequence labeling problem.",
        "Although joint learning has attracted much attention in recent years, how to perform decoding efficiently still remains an open problem.",
        "In this paper, we present a new decoding algorithm that overcomes this problem.",
        "The proposed algorithm has three distinguishing properties: (1) It is much more efficient than the Viterbi algorithm when dealing with a large number of labels.",
        "(2) It is an exact algorithm, that is, the optimality of the solution is always guaranteed unlike approximate algorithms.",
        "(3) It is automatic, requiring no task-dependent hyperparameters that have to be manually adjusted.",
        "Experiments evaluate our algorithm on three tasks: POS tagging, joint POS tagging and chunking, and supertagging .",
        "The results demonstrate that our algorithm is up to several orders of magnitude faster than the basic Viterbi algorithm and a state-of-the-art algorithm (Esposito and Radicioni, 2009); it makes exact decoding practical even in labeling problems with a large label set."
