        "Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs) have been introduced by Vijay-Shanker et al.",
        "(1987) for modeling the syntax of natural language.",
        "The formalism extends the generative capacity of context-free grammars, still remaining far below the class of context-sensitive grammars.",
        "An important feature of LCFRSs is their ability to generate discontinuous phrases.",
        "This has been recently exploited for modeling phrase structure treebanks with discontinuous constituents (Maier and Sogaard, 2008), as well as non-projective dependency treebanks (Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009).",
        "The maximum number f of tuple components that can be generated by an LCFRS G is called the fanout of G, and the maximum number r of nonterminals in the right-hand side ofa production is called the rank of G. As an example, context-free grammars are LCFRSs with f = 1 and r given by the maximum length of a production right-hand side.",
        "Tree adjoining grammars (Joshi and Levy, 1977) can also be viewed as a special kind of LCFRS with f = 2, since each auxiliary tree generates two strings, and with r given by the maximum number of adjunction and substitution sites in an elementary tree.",
        "Beyond tree adjoining languages, LCFRSs with f = 2 can also generate languages in which pair of strings derived from different nonterminals appear in so-called crossing configurations.",
        "It has recently been observed that, in this way, LCFRSs with f = 2 can model the vast majority of data in discontinuous phrase structure treebanks and non-projective dependency treebanks (Maier and Lichte, 2009; Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009).",
        "Under a theoretical perspective, the parsing problem for LCFRSs with f = 2 is NP-complete (Satta, 1992), and in known parsing algorithms the running time is exponentially affected by the rank r of the grammar.",
        "Nonetheless, in natural language parsing applications, it is possible to achieve efficient, polynomial parsing if we succeed in reducing the rank r (number of nonterminals in the right-hand side) of individual LCFRSs' productions (Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009).",
        "This process is called production factorization.",
        "Production factorization is very similar to the reduction of a context-free grammar production into Chomsky normal form.",
        "However, in the LCFRS case some productions might not be reducible to r = 2, and the process stops at some larger value for r, which in the worst case might as well be the rank of the source production (Rambow and Satta, 1999).",
        "Motivated by parsing efficiency, the factorization problem for LCFRSs with f = 2 has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years.",
        "Most of the literature has been focusing on binarization algorithms, which attempt to find a reduction to r = 2 and return a failure if this is not possible.",
        "Gomez-Rodriguez et al.",
        "(2009) report a general binarization algorithm for LCFRS which, in the case of f = 2, works in time O(|p|), where |p| is the size of the input production.",
        "A more efficient binarization algorithm for the case f = 2 is presented in (Gomez-Rodriguez and Satta, 2009), working in time",
        "In this paper we are interested in general factorization algorithms, i.e., algorithms that find factorizations with the smallest possible rank (not necessarily r = 2).",
        "We present a novel technique that solves the general factorization problem in time O(|p|) for LCFRSs with f = 2.",
        "Strong generative equivalence results between LCFRS and other finite copying parallel rewriting systems have been discussed in (Weir, 1992) and in (Rambow and Satta, 1999).",
        "Through these equivalence results, we can transfer the factorization techniques presented in this article to other finite copying parallel rewriting systems."

        "In what follows we are interested in functions mapping several tuples of strings in ST into tuples of strings in ST. Let r and f be two integers, r > 0 and f > 1.",

        "For a mathematical definition of LCFRS we refer the reader to (Weir, 1992, p. 137).",

Productions in a LCFRS have the form where p(p) > 0, A and Bt, 1 < i < p(p), are nonterminal symbols, and g is a linear regular function having rank p(p) and fanout <£>(A), defined on (ST)^Bl) x • • • x (ST)v(bpM) and taking values in (ST.",

        "To optimize running time, one can then recast the source grammar in such a way that the value of the above function is kept to a minimum.",
        "One way to achieve this is by factorizing the productions of a LCFRS, as we now explain.",

        "= (y10,...,y1dl ,y20 ,...,y/df ).",
        "Note that productions p1 and p2 have rank strictly smaller than the source production p. Furthermore, if it is possible to choose set C in such a way that f=0 dt < f, then the fanout of p1 and p2 will be no greater than the fanout ofp.",
        "We can iterate the procedure above as many times as possible, under the condition that the fanout of the productions does not increase.",

        "gA2 ((X11 ,X12), (X21 ,X22)) = (XnX21,X12X22).",
        "The factorization procedure above should be applied to all productions of a LCFRS with rank larger than two.",

        "The factorization technique we have discussed can also be viewed as a generalization of well-known techniques for casting context-free grammars into binary forms.",
        "These are forms where no more than two nonterminal symbols are found in the right-hand side ofproductions ofthe grammar; see for instance (Harrison, 1978).",
        "One important difference is that, while production factorization into binary form is always possible in the context-free case, for LCFRS there are worst case grammars in which rank reduction is not possible at all, as shown in (Rambow and Satta, 1999)."
