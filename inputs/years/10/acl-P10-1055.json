        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steed-man, 2001; Steedman and Baldridge, 2010) is an expressive grammar formalism with formal roots in combinatory logic (Curry et al., 1958) and links to the type-logical tradition of categorial grammar (Moortgat, 1997).",
        "It has been successfully used for a wide range of practical tasks, such as data-driven parsing (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2007), wide-coverage semantic construction (Bos et al., 2004), and the modelling of syntactic priming (Reitter et al., 2006).",
        "It is well-known that CCG can generate languages that are not context-free (which is necessary to capture natural languages), but can still be parsed in polynomial time.",
        "Specifically, Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994) identified a version of CCG that is weakly equivalent to Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Joshi and Schabes, 1997) and other mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms, and can generate non-context-free languages such as anbncn.",
        "The generative capacity of CCG is commonly attributed to its flexible composition rules, which allow it to model more complex word orders that context-free grammar can.",
        "The discussion of the (weak and strong) generative capacity of CCG and TAG has recently been revived (Hockenmaier and Young, 2008; Koller and Kuhlmann, 2009).",
        "In particular, Koller and Kuhlmann (2009) have shown that CCGs that are pure (i.e., they can only use generalized composition rules, and there is no way to restrict the instances of these rules that may be used) and first-order (i.e., all argument categories are atomic) can not generate anbncn.",
        "This shows that the generative capacity of at least first-order CCG crucially relies on its ability to restrict rule instantiations, and is at odds with the general conception of CCG as a fully lexicalized formalism, in which all grammars use one and the same set of universal rules.",
        "A question then is whether the result carries over to pure CCG with higher-order categories.",
        "In this paper, we answer this question to the positive: We show that the weak generative capacity of general pure CCG is still strictly smaller than that of the formalism considered by Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994); composition rules can only achieve their full expressive potential if their use can be restricted.",
        "Our technical result is that every language L that can be generated by a pure CCG has a context-free sublanguage L ç L such that every string in L is a permutation of a string in L, and vice versa.",
        "This means that anbncn, for instance, cannot be generated by pure CCG, as it does not have any (non-trivial) permutation-equivalent sublanguages.",
        "Conversely, we show that there are still languages that can be generated by pure CCG but not by context-free grammar.",
        "We then show that our permutation language lemma also holds for pure multi-modal CCG as defined by Baldridge and Kruijff (2003), in which the use of rules can be controlled through the lexicon entries by assigning types to slashes.",
        "Since this extension was intended to do away with the need for grammar-specific rule restrictions, it comes as quite a surprise that pure multi-modal",
        "CCG in the style of Baldridge and Kruijff (2003) is still less expressive than the CCG formalism used by Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994).",
        "This means that word order in CCG cannot be fully lexicalized with the current formal tools; some ordering constraints must be specified via language-specific combination rules and not in lexicon entries.",
        "On the other hand, as pure multi-modal CCG has been successfully applied to model the syntax of a variety of natural languages, another way to read our results is as contributions to a discussion about the exact expressiveness needed to model natural language.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce the formalism of pure CCG that we consider in this paper, and illustrate the relevance of rule restrictions.",
        "We then study the generative capacity of pure CCG in Section 3; this section also presents our main result.",
        "In Section 4, we show that this result still holds for multi-modal CCG.",
        "Section 5 concludes the paper with a discussion of the relevance of our findings."

A category x/y represents a function that seeks a string with category y to the right (indicated by the forward slash) and returns a new string with category x; a category x\\y instead seeks its argument to the left (indicated by the backward slash).",

        "Proposition 1 The class of languages generated by pure CCG properly includes the class ofcontext-free languages.",
        "Proof.",
        "To see the inclusion, it suffices to note that pure CCG when restricted to application rules is the same as AB-grammar, the classical categorial formalism investigated by Ajdukiewicz and Bar-Hillel (Bar-Hillel et al., 1964).",
        "This formalism is weakly equivalent to context-free grammar.",
        "To see that the inclusion is proper, we can go back to the grammar G1 that we gave in Section 2.5.",

        "■",
        "Two things are worth noting.",
        "First, our result shows that the ability of CCG to generate non-context-free languages does not hinge on the availability of substitution and type-raising rules: The derivations of G1 only use generalized compositions.",
        "Neither does it require the use of functional argument categories: The grammar G1 is first-order in the sense of Koller and Kuhlmann (2009).",
        "Second, it is important to note that if the composition degree n is restricted to 0 or 1, pure CCG actually collapses to context-free expressive power.",
        "This is clear for n = 0 because of the equivalence to AB grammar.",
        "For n = 1 , observe that the arity of the result of a composition is at most as high as that of each premise.",
        "This means that the arity of any derived category is bounded by the maximal arity of lexical categories in the grammar, which together with Lemma 1 implies that there is only a finite set of derivable categories.",
        "The set of all valid derivations can then be simulated by a context-free grammar.",
        "In the presence of rules with n > 2, the arities of derived categories can grow unboundedly.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we will develop the proof of Theorem 1, and use it to show that the generative capacity of PCCG is strictly smaller than that of CCG with rule restrictions.",
        "For the proof, we adopt a certain way to view the information flow in CCG derivations.",
        "Consider the following instance of forward harmonic composition:",
        "This rule should be understood as obtaining its conclusion a/c from the primary premise a/b by the removal of the argument /b and the subsequent transfer of the argument /c from the secondary premise.",
        "With this picture in mind, we will view the two occurrences of /c in the secondary premise and in the conclusion as two occurrences of one and the same argument.",
        "Under this perspective, in a given derivation, an argument has a lifespan that starts in a lexical category and ends in one of two ways: either in the primary or in the secondary premise of a composition rule.",
        "If it ends in a primary premise, it is because it is matched against a subcategory of the corresponding secondary premise; this is the case for the argument /b in the example above.",

        "Conversely, any derivation that still contains a category with at least two active arguments can be transformed into a new derivation that brings us closer to the special property just characterized.",

        "Thus, each step decreases the value of a derivation tree under our assignment by the amount 1 C 2x.",

        "The number of inactive arguments in the primary premise of a rule does not exceed the number of inactive arguments in the conclusion.",
        "In a transformed derivation, a symmetric property holds for active arguments: Since each secondary premise contains at most one active argument, the number of active arguments in the conclusion of a rule is not greater than the number of active arguments in its primary premise.",
        "Taken together, this implies that the arity of a category that occurs in a transformed derivation is bounded by the sum of the maximal arity of a lexical category (which bounds the number of active arguments), and the maximal arity of a secondary premise (which bounds the number of inactive arguments).",
        "Both of these values are bounded in G. ■ Lemma 8 The yields corresponding to the set of all transformed derivations of a pure CCG form a context-free language.",

To form the set of nonterminals, we take all categories that can occur in a transformed derivation of G, and mark each argument as either 'active' (C) or 'inactive' ( – ), in all possible ways that respect the segmentation property stated in Lemma 3.",

        "The remaining productions encode all valid instantiations of composition rules, keeping track of active and inactive arguments to prevent derivations with critical nodes.",
        "More specifically, they have the form where the arguments in the y-part of the secondary premise are all marked as inactive, the sequence ß contains at most one argument marked as active, and the annotations of the left-hand side nonterminal are copied over from the corresponding annotations on the right-hand side.",
        "The correctness of the construction of Gt can be proved by induction on the length of a transformed derivation of G on the one hand, and the length of a derivation of Gt on the other hand.",

        "Theorem 1 Every language that can be generated by a pure CCG grammar has a Parikh-equivalent context-free sublanguage.",

        "Let G be a pure CCG, and let Lt be the set of yields of the transformed derivations of G. Inspecting the rewriting rules, it is clear that every string of L(G) is the permutation of a string in Lt : the transformation only rearranges the yields.",

        "We now extend Theorem 1 to multi-modal CCG.",
        "We will see that at least for a popular version of multi-modal CCG, the B&K-CCG formalism presented by Baldridge and Kruijff (2003), the proof can be adapted quite straightforwardly.",
        "This means that even B&K-CCG becomes less expressive when rule restrictions are disallowed.",
        "The term 'multi-modal CCG' (MM-CCG) refers to a family of extensions to CCG which attempt to bring some of the expressive power of Categorial Type Logic (Moortgat, 1997) into CCG.",
        "Slashes in MM-CCG have slash types, and rules can be restricted to only apply to arguments that have slashes of the correct type.",
        "The idea behind this extension is that many constraints that in ordinary CCG can only be expressed in terms of rule restrictions can now be specified in the lexicon entries by giving the slashes the appropriate types.",
        "The most widely-known version of multi-modal CCG is the formalism defined by Baldridge and Kruijff (2003) and used by Steedman and Baldridge (2010); we refer to it as B&K-CCG.",
        "This formalism uses an inventory of four slash types, { ?, x, o, • }, arranged in a simple type hierarchy: ?",
        "is the most general type, • the most specific, and x and o are in between.",
        "Every slash in a B&K-CCG lexicon is annotated with one of these slash types.",
        "The combinatory rules in B&K-CCG, given in Figure 4, are defined to be sensitive to the slash types.",
        "In particular, slashes with the types o and x can only be eliminated by harmonic and crossed compositions, respectively.",
        "Thus, a grammar writer can constrain the application of harmonic and crossed composition rules to certain categories by assigning appropriate types to the slashes of this category in the lexicon.",
        "Application rules apply to slashes of any type.",

        "We will now see what happens to the proof of Theorem 1 in the context of pure B&K-CCG.",
        "There is only one point in the entire proof that could be damaged by the introduction of slash types, and that is the result that if a transformation rule from Figure 3 is applied to a correct derivation, then the result is also grammatical.",
        "For this, it must not only be the case that the degree on the composition operations is preserved (Lemma 6), but also that the transformed derivation remains consistent with the slash types.",
        "Slash types make the derivation process sensitive to word order by restricting the use of compositions to categories with the appropriate type, and the transformation rules permute the order of the words in the string.",
        "There is a chance therefore that a transformed derivation might not be grammatical in B&K-CCG.",
        "We now show that this does not actually happen, for rule R3; the other three rules are analogous.",
        "Using s1, s2, s3 as variables for the relevant slash types, rule R3 appears in B&K-CCG as follows:",
        "Because the original derivation is correct, we know that, if the slash of w is forward, then s1 and s2 are subtypes of o; if the slash is backward, they are subtypes of x.",
        "A similar condition holds for s3 and the first slash in y ; if y is empty, then s3 can be anything because the second rule is an application.",
        "After the transformation, the argument /siy is used to compose with y| s2wßy.",
        "The direction of the slash in front of the w is the same as before, so the (harmonic or crossed) composition is still compatible with the slash types s1 and s2.",
        "An analogous argument shows that the correctness of combining \\s3z with y carries over from the left to the right-hand side.",
        "Thus the transformation maps grammatical derivations into grammatical derivations.",
        "The rest of the proof in Section 3 continues to work literally, so we have the following result:",
        "Theorem 2 Every language that can be generated by a pure B&K-CCG grammar contains a Parikh-equivalent context-free sublanguage.",
        "This means that pure B&K-CCG is just as unable to generate L3 as pure CCG is.",
        "In other words, the weak generative capacity of CCG with rule restrictions, and in particular that of the formalism considered by Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994), is strictly greater than the generative capacity of pure B&K-CCG – although we conjecture (but cannot prove) that pure B&K-CCG is still more expressive than pure non-modal CCG.",
        "To put the result of Theorem 2 into perspective, we will now briefly consider ways in which B&K-CCG might be modified in order to obtain a pure multimodal CCG that is weakly equivalent to CCG in the style of Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994).",
        "Such a modification would have to break the proof in Section 4.2, which is harder than it may seem at first glance.",
        "For instance, simply assuming a more complex type system will not do it, because the arguments \\s3z and /si y are eliminated using the same rules in the original and the transformed derivations, so if the derivation step was valid before, it will still be valid after the transformation.",
        "Instead, we believe that it is necessary to make the composition rules sensitive to the categories inside ß and y instead of only the arguments \\s3z and /siy, and we can see two ways how to do this.",
        "First, one could imagine a version of multimodal CCG with unary modalities that can be used to mark certain category occurrences.",
        "In such an MM-CCG, the composition rules for a certain slash type could be made sensitive to the presence or absence of unary modalities in ß.",
        "Say for instance that the slash type s1 in the modalized version of R3 in Section 4.2 would require that no category in the secondary argument is marked with the unary modality but ß contains a category marked with Then the transformed derivation would be ungrammatical.",
        "A second approach concerns the precise definition of the generalized composition rules, about which there is a surprising degree of disagreement.",
        "We have followed Hockenmaier and Young (2008) in classifying instances of generalized forward composition as harmonic if the innermost slash of the secondary argument is forward and crossed if it is backward.",
        "However, generalized forward composition is sometimes only accepted as harmonic if all slashes of the secondary argument are forward (see e.g. Baldridge (2002) (40, 41), Steedman (2001) (19)).",
        "At the same time, based on the principle that CCG rules should be derived from proofs of Categorial Type Logic as Baldridge (2002) does, it can be argued that generalized composition rules of the form x/y y/z\\w ) x/z\\w, which we have considered as harmonic, should actually be classified as crossed, due to the presence of a slash of opposite directionality in front of the w. This definition would break our proof.",
        "Thus our result might motivate further research on the 'correct' definition of generalized composition rules, which might then strengthen the generative capacity of pure MM-CCG.",
        "5 Conclusion",
        "In this paper, we have shown that the weak generative capacity of pure CCG and even pure B&K-CCG crucially depends on the ability to restrict the application of individual rules.",
        "This means that these formalisms cannot be fully lexicalized, in the sense that certain languages can only be described by selecting language-specific rules.",
        "Our result generalizes Koller and Kuhlmann's (2009) result for pure first-order CCG.",
        "Our proof is not as different as it looks at first glance, as their construction of mapping a CCG derivation to a valency tree and back to a derivation provides a different transformation on derivation trees.",
        "Our transformation is also technically related to the normal form construction for CCG parsing presented by Eisner (1996).",
        "Of course, at the end of the day, the issue that is more relevant to computational linguistics than a formalism's ability to generate artificial languages such as L3 is how useful it is for modeling natural languages.",
        "CCG, and multi-modal CCG in particular, has a very good track record for this.",
        "In this sense, our formal result can also be understood as a contribution to a discussion about the expressive power that is needed to model natural languages."
