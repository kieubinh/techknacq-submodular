        "Summarization is the process of condensing a source text into a shorter version while preserving its information content.",
        "Humans summarize on a daily basis and effortlessly, but producing high quality summaries automatically remains a challenge.",
        "The difficulty lies primarily in the nature of the task which is complex, must satisfy many constraints (e.g., summary length, informativeness, coherence, grammaticality) and ultimately requires wide-coverage text understanding.",
        "Since the latter is beyond the capabilities of current NLP technology, most work today focuses on extractive summarization, where a summary is created simply by identifying and subsequently concatenating the most important sentences in a document.",
        "Without a great deal of linguistic analysis, it is possible to create summaries for a wide range of documents.",
        "Unfortunately, extracts are often documents of low readability and text quality and contain much redundant information.",
        "This is in marked contrast with handwritten summaries which often combine several pieces of information from the original document (Jing, 2002) and exhibit many rewrite operations such as substitutions, insertions, deletions, or reorderings.",
        "Sentence compression is often regarded as a promising first step towards ameliorating some of the problems associated with extractive summarization.",
        "The task is commonly expressed as a word deletion problem.",
        "It involves creating a short grammatical summary of a single sentence, by removing elements that are considered extraneous, while retaining the most important information (Knight and Marcu, 2002).",
        "Interfacing extractive summarization with a sentence compression module could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries and render them more informative (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003; Zajic et al., 2007).",
        "Despite the bulk of work on sentence compression and summarization (see Clarke and Lapata 2008 and Mani 2001 for overviews) only a handful of approaches attempt to do both in a joint model (Daumé III and Marcu, 2002; Daumé III, 2006; Lin, 2003; Martins and Smith, 2009).",
        "One reason for this might be the performance of sentence compression systems which falls short ofattaining grammaticality levels of human output.",
        "For example, Clarke and Lapata (2008) evaluate a range of state-of-the-art compression systems across different domains and show that machine generated compressions are consistently perceived as worse than the human gold standard.",
        "Another reason is the summarization objective itself.",
        "If our goal is to summarize news articles, then we may be better off selecting the first n sentences of the document.",
        "This \"lead\" baseline may err on the side of verbosity but at least will be grammatical, and it has indeed proved extremely hard to outperform by more sophisticated methods (Nenkova, 2005).",
        "In this paper we propose a model for summarization that incorporates compression into the task.",
        "A key insight in our approach is to formulate summarization as a phrase rather than sentence extraction problem.",
        "Compression falls naturally out of this formulation as only phrases deemed important should appear in the summary.",
        "Obviously, our output summaries must meet additional requirements such as sentence length, overall length, topic coverage and, importantly, grammaticality.",
        "We combine phrase and dependency information into a single data structure, which allows us to express grammaticality as constraints across phrase dependencies.",
        "We encode these constraints through the use of integer linear programming (ILP), a well-studied optimization framework that is able to search the entire solution space efficiently.",
        "We apply our model to the task of generating highlights for a single document.",
        "Examples of CNN news articles with human-authored highlights are shown in Table 1.",
        "Highlights give a brief overview of the article to allow readers to quickly gather information on stories, and usually appear as bullet points.",
        "Importantly, they represent the gist of the entire document and thus often differ substantially from the first n sentences in the article (Svore et al., 2007).",
        "They are also highly compressed, written in a telegraphic style and thus provide an excellent testbed for models that generate compressed summaries.",
        "Experimental results show that our model's output is comparable to handwritten highlights both in terms of grammaticality and informativeness."

        "To solve the ILP model we used the ZIB Optimization Suite software (Achterberg, 2007; Koch, 2004; Wunderling, 1996).",
        "The solution was converted into highlights by concatenating the chosen leaf nodes in order.",
        "The ILP problems we created had on average 290 binary variables and 380 constraints.",
        "The mean solve time was 0.03 seconds.",
        "Summarization In order to examine the generality of our model and compare with previous work, we also evaluated our system on a vanilla summarization task.",
        "Specifically, we used the same model (trained on the CNN corpus) to generate summaries for the DUC-2002 corpus.",
        "We report results on the entire dataset and on a subset containing 140 documents.",
        "This is the same partition used by Martins and Smith (2009) to evaluate their ILP model.",
        "Baselines We compared the output of our model to two baselines.",
        "The first one simply selects the \"leading\" three sentences from each document (without any compression).",
        "The second baseline is the output of a sentence-based ILP model, similar to our own, but simpler.",
        "The model is given in (2).",
        "The binary decision variables x G {0,1}'S' now represent sentences, and fi the salience score for each sentence.",
        "The objective again is to maximize the total score, but now subject only to tf.idf coverage (2b) and a limit on the number of highlights (2c) which we set to 3.",
        "There are no sentence length or grammaticality constraints, as there is no sentence compression.",
        "The SVM was trained with the same features used to obtain phrase-based salience scores, but with sentence-level labels (labels (1) and (2) positive, (3) negative).",
        "Evaluation We evaluated summarization quality using Rouge (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "For the highlight generation task, the original CNN highlights were used as the reference.",
        "We report unigram overlap (Rouge-1) as a means of assessing informativeness and the longest common subsequence (Rouge-L) as a means of assessing fluency.",
        "In addition, we evaluated the generated highlights by eliciting human judgments.",
        "Participants were presented with a news article and its corresponding highlights and were asked to rate the latter along three dimensions: informativeness (do the highlights represent the article's main topics?",
        "), grammaticality (are they fluent?",
        "), and verbosity (are they overly wordy and repetitive?).",
        "The subjects used a seven point rating scale.",
        "An ideal system would receive high numbers for grammaticality and informativeness and a low number for verbosity.",
        "We randomly selected nine documents from the test set and generated highlights with our model and the sentence-based ILP baseline.",
        "We also included the original highlights as a gold standard.",
        "We thus obtained ratings for 27 (9 x 3) document-highlights pairs.",
        "The study was conducted over the Internet using WebExp (Keller et al., 2009) and was completed by 34 volunteers, all self reported native English speakers.",
        "With regard to the summarization task, following Martins and Smith (2009), we used Rouge-1 and Rouge-2 to evaluate our system's output.",

        "In this paper we proposed a joint content selection and compression model for single-document summarization.",

        "Future extensions are many and varied.",
        "An obvious next step is to examine how the model generalizes to other domains and text genres.",
        "Although coherence is not so much of an issue for highlights, it certainly plays a role when generating standard summaries.",
        "The ILP model can be straightforwardly augmented with discourse constraints similar to those proposed in Clarke and Lapata (2007).",
        "We would also like to generalize the model to arbitrary rewrite operations, as our results indicate that compression rates are likely to improve with more sophisticated paraphrasing."
