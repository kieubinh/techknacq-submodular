        "In the area of media analysis, one of the key tasks is collecting detailed information about opinions and attitudes toward specific topics from various sources, both offline (traditional newspapers, archives) and online (news sites, blogs, forums).",
        "Specifically, media analysis concerns the following system task: given a topic and list of documents (discussing the topic), find all instances of attitudes toward the topic (e.g., positive/negative sentiments, or, if the topic is an organization or person, support/criticism of this entity).",
        "For every such instance, one should identify the source of the sentiment, the polarity and, possibly, subtopics that this attitude relates to (e.g., specific targets of criticism or support).",
        "Subsequently, a (human) media analyst must be able to aggregate the extracted information by source, polarity or subtopics, allowing him to build support/criticism networks etc.",
        "(Altheide, 1996).",
        "Recent advances in language technology, especially in sentiment analysis, promise to (partially) automate this task.",
        "Sentiment analysis is often considered in the context of the following two tasks:",
        "• sentiment extraction: given a set of textual documents, identify phrases, clauses, sentences or entire documents that express attitudes, and determine the polarity of these attitudes (Kim and Hovy, 2004); and",
        "• sentiment retrieval: given a topic (and possibly, a list of documents relevant to the topic), identify documents that express attitudes toward this topic (Ounis et al., 2007).",
        "How can technology developed for sentiment analysis be applied to media analysis?",
        "In order to use a sentiment extraction system for a media analysis problem, a system would have to be able to determine which of the extracted sentiments are actually relevant, i.e., it would not only have to identify specific targets of all extracted sentiments, but also decide which of the targets are relevant for the topic at hand.",
        "This is a difficult task, as the relation between a topic (e.g., a movie) and specific targets of sentiments (e.g., acting or special effects in the movie) is not always straightforward, in the face of ubiquitous complex linguistic phenomena such as referential expressions (\"... this beautifully shot documentary\") or bridging anaphora (\"the director did an excellent jobs\").",
        "In sentiment retrieval, on the other hand, the topic is initially present in the task definition, but it is left to the user to identify sources and targets of sentiments, as systems typically return a list of documents ranked by relevance and opinionatedness.",
        "To use a traditional sentiment retrieval system in media analysis, one would still have to manually go through ranked lists of documents returned by the system.",
        "To be able to support media analysis, we need to combine the specificity of (phrase- or word-level) sentiment analysis with the topicality provided by sentiment retrieval.",
        "Moreover, we should be able to identify sources and specific targets of opinions.",
        "Another important issue in the media analysis context is evidence for a system's decision.",
        "If the output of a system is to be used to inform actions, the system should present evidence, e.g., highlighting words or phrases that indicate a specific attitude.",
        "Most modern approaches to sentiment analysis, however, use various flavors of classification, where decisions (typically) come with confidence scores, but without explicit support.",
        "In order to move towards the requirements of media analysis, in this paper we focus on two of the problems identified above: (1) pinpointing evidence for a system's decisions about the presence of sentiment in text, and (2) identifying specific targets of sentiment.",
        "We address these problems by introducing a special type of lexical resource: a topic-specific subjectivity lexicon that indicates specific relevant targets for which sentiments may be expressed; for a given topic, such a lexicon consists of pairs (syntactic clue, target).",
        "We present a method for automatically generating a topic-specific lexicon for a given topic and query-biased set of documents.",
        "We evaluate the quality of the lexicon both manually and in the setting of an opinionated blog post retrieval task.",
        "We demonstrate that such a lexicon is highly focused, allowing one to effectively pinpoint evidence for sentiment, while being com-petetive with traditional subjectivity lexicons consisting of (a large number of) clue words.",
        "Unlike other methods for topic-specific sentiment analysis, we do not expand a seed lexicon.",
        "Instead, we make an existing lexicon more focused, so that it can be used to actually pinpoint subjectivity in documents relevant to a given topic."

        "Sentiment analysis is often seen as two separate steps for determining subjectivity and polarity.",
        "Most approaches first try to identify subjective units (documents, sentences), and for each ofthese determine whether it is positive or negative.",

        "First, the lexicon is constructed from WordNet: from several seed words, the structure of WordNet is used to expand this seed to a full lexicon.",
        "Next, this lexicon is used to measure the distance between unseen words and words in the positive and negative classes.",
        "Based on word sentiments, a decision is made at the sentence level.",
        "A similar approach is taken by Wilson et al.",
        "(2005): a classifier is learnt that distinguishes between polar and neutral sentences, based on a prior polarity lexicon and an annotated corpus.",
        "Among the features used are syntactic features.",
        "After this initial step, the sentiment sentences are classified as negative or positive; again, a prior polarity lexicon and syntactic features are used.",
        "The authors later explored the difference between prior and contextual polarity (Wilson et al., 2009): words that lose polarity in context, or whose polarity is reversed because of context.",
        "Riloff and Wiebe (2003) describe a bootstrapping method to learn subjective extraction patterns that match specific syntactic templates, using a high-precision sentence-level subjectivity classifier and a large unannotated corpus.",
        "In our method, we bootstrap from a subjectivity lexi-cion rather than a classifier, and perform a topic-specific analysis, learning indicators of subjectivity toward a specific topic.",
        "The way authors express their attitudes varies with the domain: An unpredictable movie can be positive, but unpredictable politicians are usually something negative.",
        "Since it is unrealistic to construct sentiment lexicons, or manually annotate text for learning, for every imaginable domain or topic, automatic methods have been developed.",
        "Godbole et al.",
        "(2007) aim at measuring overall subjectivity or polarity towards a certain entity; they identify sentiments using domain-specific lexicons.",
        "The lexicons are generated from manually selected seeds for a broad domain such as Health or Business, following an approach similar to (Kim and Hovy, 2004).",
        "All named entites in a sentence containing a clue from a lexicon are considered targets of sentiment for counting.",
        "Because of the data volume, no expensive linguistic processing is performed.",
        "Choi et al.",
        "(2009) advocate a joint topic-sentiment analysis.",
        "They identify \"sentiment topics,\" noun phrases assumed to be linked to a sentiment clue in the same expression.",
        "They address two tasks: identifying sentiment clues, and classifying sentences into positive, negative, or neutral.",
        "They start by selecting initial clues from Sen-tiWordNet, based on sentences with known polarity.",
        "Next, the sentiment topics are identified, and based on these sentiment topics and the current list of clues, new potential clues are extracted.",
        "The clues can be used to classifiy sentences.",
        "Fahrni and Klenner (2008) identify potential targets in a given domain, and create a target-specific polarity adjective lexicon.",
        "To this end, they find targets using Wikipedia, and associated adjectives.",
        "Next, the target-specific polarity of adjectives is detemined using Hearst-like patterns.",
        "Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) introduce polar atoms: minimal human-understandable syntactic structures that specify polarity of clauses.",
        "The goal is to learn new domain-specific polar atoms, but these are not target-specific.",
        "They use manually-created syntactic patterns to identify atoms and coherency to determine polarity.",
        "In contrast to much of the work in the literature, we need to specialize subjectivity lexicons not for a domain and target, but for \"topics.\"",
        "Much work has been carried out for the task of mining product reviews, where the goal is to identify features of specific products (such as picture, zoom, size, weight for digital cameras) and opinions about these specific features in user reviews.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2005) describe a system that identifies such features via rules learned from a manually annotated corpus of reviews; opinions on features are extracted from the structure of reviews (which explicitly separate positive and negative opinions).",
        "Popescu and Etzioni (2005) present a method that identifies product features for using corpus statistics, WordNet relations and morphological cues.",
        "Opinions about the features are extracted using a hand-crafted set of syntactic rules.",
        "Targets extracted in our method for a topic are similar to features extracted in review mining for products.",
        "However, topics in our setting go beyond concrete products, and the diversity and generality of possible topics makes it difficult to apply such supervised or thesaurus-based methods to identify opinion targets.",
        "Moreover, in our method we directly use associations between targets and opinions to extract both.",
        "At TREC, the Text REtrieval Conference, there has been interest in a specific type of sentiment analysis: opinion retrieval.",
        "This interest materialized in 2006 (Ounis et al., 2007), with the opinionated blog post retrieval task.",
        "Finding blog posts that are not just about a topic, but also contain an opinion on the topic, proves to be a difficult task.",
        "Performance on the opinion-finding task is dominated by performance on the underlying document retrieval task (the topical baseline).",
        "Opinion finding is often approached as a two-stage problem: (1) identify documents relevant to the query, (2) identify opinions.",
        "In stage (2) one commonly uses either a binary classifier to distinguish between opinionated and non-opinionated documents or applies reranking of the initial result list using some opinion score.",
        "Opinion add-ons show only slight improvements over relevance-only baselines.",
        "The best performing opinion finding system at TREC 2008 is a two-stage approach using rerank-ing in stage (2) (Lee et al., 2008).",
        "The authors use SentiWordNet and a corpus-derived lexicon to construct an opinion score for each post in an initial ranking of blog posts.",
        "This opinion score is combined with the relevance score, and posts are reranked according to this new score.",
        "We detail this approach in Section 6.",
        "Later, the authors use domain-specific opinion indicators (Na et al., 2009), like \"interesting story\" (movie review), and \"light\" (notebook review).",
        "This domain-specific lexicon is constructed using feedback-style learning: retrieve an initial list of documents and use the top documents as training data to learn an opinion lexicon.",
        "Opinion scores per document are then computed as an average of opinion scores over all its words.",
        "Results show slight improvements (+3%) on mean average precision."

        "In our experiments we use the method described above, and plug in the MPQA polarity lexicon.",
        "We compare the results of using this topic-independent lexicon to the topic-dependent lexicons our method generates, which are also plugged into the reranking of Lee et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "In addition to using Okapi BM25 for opinion scoring, we also consider a simpler method.",

        "Note that a does not affect the lexicon creation, but only how the lexicon is used in reranking.",
        "Since we want to assess the quality of lexicons, not in the opinionated retrieval performance as such, we factor out a by selecting the best setting for each lexicon (including the topic-independent) and each evaluation measure.",
        "In Table 4 we present the results of evaluation of several lexicons in the context of opinionated blog post retrieval.",
        "First, we note that reranking using all lexicons in Table 4 significantly improves over the relevance-only baseline for all evaluation measures.",
        "When comparing topic-specific lexicons to the topic-independent one, most of the differences are not statistically significant, which is surprising given the fact that most topic-specific lexicons we evaluated are substantially smaller (see the two rightmost columns in the table).",
        "The smallest lexicon in Table 4 is seven times more selective than the general one, in terms of the number of lexicon matches per document.",
        "The only evaluation measure where the topic-independent lexicon consistently outperforms topic-specific ones, is Mean Reciprocal Rank that depends on a single relevant opinionated document high in a ranking.",
        "A possible explanation",
        "Table 4: Evaluation of topic-specific lexicons applied to the opinion retrieval task, compared to the topic-independent lexicon.",
        "The two rightmost columns show the number of lexicon entries (average per topic) and the number of matches of lexicon entries in blog posts (average for top 1,000 posts).",
        "is that the large general lexicon easily finds a few \"obviously subjective\" posts (those with heavily used subjective words), but is not better at detecting less obvious ones, as indicated by the recall-oriented MAP and R-precision.",
        "Interestingly, increasing the number of syntactic contexts considered for a clue word (parameter D) and the number of selected targets (parameter T) leads to substantially larger lexicons, but only gives marginal improvements when lexicons are used for opinion retrieval.",
        "This shows that our bootstrapping method is effective at filtering out non-relevant sentiment targets and syntactic clues.",
        "The evaluation results also show that the choice of opinion scoring function (Okapi or raw counts) depends on the lexicon size: for smaller, more focused lexicons unnormalized counts are more effective.",
        "This also confirms our intuition that for small, focused lexicons simple presence of a sentiment clue in text is a good indication of subjectivity, while for larger lexicons an overall subjectivity scoring of texts has to be used, which can be hard to interpret for (media analysis) users.",
        "In this section we evaluate the quality of targets extracted as part of the lexicons by using them for query expansion.",
        "Query expansion is a commonly used technique in information retrieval, aimed at getting a better representation of the user's information need by adding terms to the original retrieval query; for user-generated content, selective query expansion has proved very beneficial (Weerkamp et al., 2009).",
        "We hypothesize that if our method manages to identify targets that correspond to issues, subtopics or features associated",
        "Table 5: Query expansion using relevance models and topic-specific subjectivity targets.",
        "Significance tested against the baseline.",
        "with the topic, the extracted targets should be good candidates for query expansion.",
        "The experiments described below test this hypothesis.",
        "For every test topic, we select the 20 top-scoring targets as expansion terms, and use Indri to return 1,000 most relevant documents for the expanded query.",
        "We evaluate the resulting ranking using both topical retrieval and opinionated retrieval measures.",
        "For the sake of comparison, we also implemented a well-known query expansion method based on Relevance Models (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001): this method has been shown to work well in many settings.",
        "Table 5 shows evaluation results for these two query expansion methods, compared to the baseline retrieval run.",
        "The results show that on topical retrieval query expansion using targets significantly improves retrieval performance, while using relevance models actually hurts all evaluation measures.",
        "The failure of the latter expansion method can be attributed to the relatively large amount of noise in user-generated content, such as boilerplate material, timestamps of blog posts, comments etc.",
        "(Weerkamp and de Rijke, 2008).",
        "Our method uses full syntactic parsing of the retrieved documents, which might substantially reduce the amount of noise since only (relatively) well-formed English sentences are used in lexicon generation.",
