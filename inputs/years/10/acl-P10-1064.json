        "Recent years have witnessed rapid developments in statistical machine translation (SMT), with considerable improvements in translation quality.",
        "For certain language pairs and applications, automated translations are now beginning to be considered acceptable, especially in domains where abundant parallel corpora exist.",
        "However, these advances are being adopted only slowly and somewhat reluctantly in professional localization and post-editing environments.",
        "Post-editors have long relied on translation memories (TMs) as the main technology assisting translation, and are understandably reluctant to give them up.",
        "There are several simple reasons for this: 1) TMs are useful; 2) TMs represent considerable effort and investment by a company or (even more so) an individual translator; 3) the fuzzy match score used in TMs offers a good approximation of post-editing effort, which is useful both for translators and translation cost estimation and, 4) current SMT translation confidence estimation measures are not as robust as TM fuzzy match scores and professional translators are thus not ready to replace fuzzy match scores with SMT internal quality measures.",
        "There has been some research to address this issue, see e.g. (Specia et al., 2009a) and (Specia et al., 2009b).",
        "However, to date most of the research has focused on better confidence measures for MT, e.g. based on training regression models to perform confidence estimation on scores assigned by post-editors (cf. Section 2).",
        "In this paper, we try to address the problem from a different perspective.",
        "Given that most postediting work is (still) based on TM output, we propose to recommend MT outputs which are better than TM hits to post-editors.",
        "In this framework, post-editors still work with the TM while benefiting from (better) SMT outputs; the assets in TMs are not wasted and TM fuzzy match scores can still be used to estimate (the upper bound of) postediting labor.",
        "There are three specific goals we need to achieve within this framework.",
        "Firstly, the recommendation should have high precision, otherwise it would be confusing for post-editors and may negatively affect the lower bound of the postediting effort.",
        "Secondly, although we have full access to the SMT system used in this paper, our method should be able to generalize to cases where SMT is treated as a black-box, which is often the case in the translation industry.",
        "Finally, post-editors should be able to easily adjust the recommendation threshold to particular requirements without having to retrain the model.",
        "In our framework, we recast translation recommendation as a binary classification (rather than regression) problem using SVMs, perform RBF kernel parameter optimization, employ posterior probability-based confidence estimation to support user-based tuning for precision and recall, experiment with feature sets involving MT-, TM-and system-independent features, and use automatic MT evaluation metrics to simulate post-editing effort.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we first briefly introduce related research in Section 2, and review the classification SVMs in Section 3.",
        "We formulate the classification model in Section 4 and present experiments in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6, we analyze the post-editing effort approximated by the TER metric (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "Section 7 concludes the paper and points out avenues for future research."

        "Previous research relating to this work mainly focuses on predicting the MT quality.",
        "The first strand is confidence estimation for MT, initiated by (Ueffing et al., 2003), in which posterior probabilities on the word graph or N-best list are used to estimate the quality of MT outputs.",
        "The idea is explored more comprehensively in (Blatz et al., 2004).",
        "These estimations are often used to rerank the MT output and to optimize it directly.",
        "Extensions of this strand are presented in (Quirk, 2004) and (Ueffing and Ney, 2005).",
        "The former experimented with confidence estimation with several different learning algorithms; the latter uses word-level confidence measures to determine whether a particular translation choice should be accepted or rejected in an interactive translation system.",
        "The second strand of research focuses on combining TM information with an SMT system, so that the SMT system can produce better target language output when there is an exact or close match in the TM (Simard and Isabelle, 2009).",
        "This line of research is shown to help the performance of MT, but is less relevant to our task in this paper.",
        "A third strand of research tries to incorporate confidence measures into a post-editing environment.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the first paper in this area is (Specia et al., 2009a).",
        "Instead of modeling on translation quality (often measured by automatic evaluation scores), this research uses regression on both the automatic scores and scores assigned by post-editors.",
        "The method is improved in (Specia et al., 2009b), which applies Inductive Confidence Machines and a larger set of features to model post-editors' judgement of the translation quality between 'good' and 'bad', or among three levels of post-editing effort.",
        "Our research is more similar in spirit to the third strand.",
        "However, we use outputs and features from the TM explicitly; therefore instead of having to solve a regression problem, we only have to solve a much easier binary prediction problem which can be integrated into TMs in a straightforward manner.",
        "Because of this, the precision and recall scores reported in this paper are not directly comparable to those in (Specia et al., 2009b) as the latter are computed on a pure SMT system without a TM in the background."

        "We use several features that are independent of the translation system, which are useful when a third-party translation service is used or the MT system is simply treated as a black-box.",

        "Interestingly, only using some simple system-external features as described in Section 4.3.3 can also yield a system with reasonably good performance (SI).",
        "We expect that the performance can be further boosted by adding more syntactic and semantic features.",
        "Combining all the system-internal and external features leads to limited gains in Precision and F-score compared to using only system-internal features (SYS) only.",
        "This indicates that at the default confidence level, current system-external (resp.",
        "system-internal) features can only play a limited role in informing the system when current system-internal (resp.",
        "system-external) features are available.",
        "We show in Section 5.4.2 that combing both system-internal and external features can yield higher, more stable precision when adjusting the confidence levels of the classifier.",
        "Additionally, the performance of system S I is promising given the fact that we are using only a limited number of simple features, which demonstrates a good prospect of applying our recommendation system to MT systems where we do not have access to their internal features.",
        "Table 1 shows that classification recall is very high, which suggests that precision can still be improved, even though the F-score is not low.",
        "Considering that TM is the dominant technology used by post-editors, a recommendation to replace the hit from the TM would require more confidence, i.e. higher precision.",
        "Ideally our aim is to obtain a level of 0.9 precision at the cost of some recall, if necessary.",

        "If we label both the training and test sets with this rule, the accuracy of the prediction will be maximized.",
        "We try to achieve higher precision by enforcing a larger bias towards negative examples in the training set so that some borderline positive instances would actually be labeled as negative, and the classifier would have higher precision in the prediction stage as in (8).",

        "Results are reported in Table 2.",

        "The highest accuracy and F-value is achieved by TER + 0, as all other settings are trained on biased margins.",
        "Except for a small drop in TER+0.05, other configurations all obtain higher precision than TER + 0.",
        "We note that we can obtain 0.85 precision without a big sacrifice in recall with b=0.15, but for larger improvements on precision, recall will drop more rapidly.",
        "When we use b beyond 0.25, the margin becomes less reliable, as the number of positive examples becomes too small.",
        "In particular, this causes the SVM parameters we tune on in the first fold to become less applicable to the other folds.",
        "This is one limitation of using biased margins to obtain high precision.",
        "The method presented in Section 5.4.2 is less influenced by this limitation.",
        "An alternative to using a biased margin is to output a confidence score during prediction and to threshold on the confidence score.",
        "It is also possible to add this method to the SVM model trained with a biased margin.",
        "We use the SVM confidence estimation techniques in Section 4.2 to obtain the confidence level of the recommendation, and change the confidence threshold for recommendation when necessary.",
        "This also allows us to compare directly against a simple baseline inspired by TM users.",
        "In a TM environment, some users simply ignore TM hits below a certain fuzzy match score F (usually from 0.7 to 0.8).",
        "This fuzzy match score reflects the confidence of recommending the TM hits.",
        "To obtain the confidence of recommending an SMT output, our baseline (Fm) uses fuzzy match costs hFM ~ 1-F (cf.",
        "Section 4.3.2) for the TM hits as the level of confidence.",
        "In other words, the higher the fuzzy match cost of the TM hit is (lower fuzzy match score), the higher the confidence of recommending the SMT output.",
        "We compare this baseline with the three settings in Section 5.",
        "1: Precision Changes with Confidence",
        "Figure 1 shows that the precision curve of Fm is low and flat when the fuzzy match costs are low (from 0 to 0.6), indicating that it is unwise to recommend an SMT output when the TM hit has a low fuzzy match cost (corresponding to higher fuzzy match score, from 0.4 to 1).",
        "We also observe that the precision of the recommendation receives a boost when the fuzzy match costs for the TM hits are above 0.7 (fuzzy match score lower than 0.3), indicating that SMT output should be recommended when the TM hit has a high fuzzy match cost (low fuzzy match score).",
        "With this boost, the precision of the baseline system can reach 0.85, demonstrating that a proper thresholding of fuzzy match scores can be used effectively to discriminate the recommendation of the TM hit from the recommendation of the SMT output.",
        "However, using the TM information only does not always find the easiest-to-edit translation.",
        "For example, an excellent SMT output should be recommended even if there exists a good TM hit (e.g. fuzzy match score is 0.7 or more).",
        "On the other hand, a misleading SMT output should not be recommended if there exists a poor but useful TM match (e.g. fuzzy match score is 0.2).",
        "Our system is able to tackle these complications as it incorporates features from the MT and the TM systems simultaneously.",
        "Figure 1 shows that both the Sys and the All setting consistently outperform Fm, indicating that our classification scheme can better integrate the MT output into the TM system than this naive baseline.",
        "The Si feature set does not perform well when the confidence level is set above 0.85 (cf. the descending tail of the Si curve in Figure 1).",
        "This might indicate that this feature set is not reliable enough to extract the best translations.",
        "However, when the requirement on precision is not that high, and the MT-internal features are not available, it would still be desirable to obtain translation recommendations with these black-box features.",
        "The difference between Sys and All is generally small, but All performs steadily better in [0.5, 0,8].",
        "In Table 3 we also present the recall scores at 0.85 and 0.9 precision for Sys, Si and All models to demonstrate our system's performance when there is a hard constraint on precision.",
        "Note that our system will return the TM entry when there is an exact match, so the overall precision of the system is above the precision score we set here in a mature TM environment, as a significant portion of the material to be translated will have a complete match in the TM system.",
        "In Table 3 for Model @K, the recall scores are achieved when the prediction precision is better than K with 0.95 confidence.",
        "For each model, precision at 0.85 can be obtained without a very big loss on recall.",
        "However, if we want to demand further recommendation precision (more conservative in recommending SMT output), the recall level will begin to drop more quickly.",
        "If we use only system-independent features (SI), we cannot achieve as high precision as with other models even if we sacrifice more recall.",
        "Based on these results, the users of the TM system can choose between precision and recall according to their own needs.",
        "As the threshold does not involve training of the SMT system or the SVM classifier, the user is able to determine this trade-off at runtime.",
        "In Section 4.3.3 we suggested three sets of system-independent features: features based on the source-and target-side language model (LM), the IBM Model 1 (M1) and the fuzzy matchscores on pseudo-source (PS).",
        "We compare the contribution of these features in Table 4.",
        "In sum, all the three sets of system-independent features improve the precision and F-scores of the MT and TM system features.",
        "The improvement is not significant, but improvement on every set of system-independent features gives some credit to the capability of SI features, as does the fact that Si features perform close to Sys features in Table 1."

        "By providing them with the TM output, the MT output and the one recommended to edit, we can measure the true accuracy of our recommendation, as well as the post-editing time we save for the post-editors;",
        "• Apply the presented method on open domain data and evaluate it using crowd-sourcing.",
        "It has been shown that crowd-sourcing tools, such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk (Callison-Burch, 2009), can help developers to obtain good human judgements on MT output quality both cheaply and quickly.",
        "Given that our problem is related to MT quality estimation in nature, it can potentially benefit from such tools as well."

        "In this paper we present a classification model to integrate SMT into a TM system, in order to facilitate the work of post-editors.",
        "Insodoing we handle the problem of MT quality estimation as binary prediction instead of regression.",
        "From the posteditors' perspective, they can continue to work in their familiar TM environment, use the same cost-estimation methods, and at the same time benefit from the power of state-of-the-art MT.",
        "We use SVMs to make these predictions, and use grid search to find better RBF kernel parameters.",
        "We explore features from inside the MT system, from the TM, as well as features that make no assumption on the translation model for the binary classification.",
        "With these features we make glass-box and black-box predictions.",
        "Experiments show that the models can achieve 0.85 precision at a level of 0.89 recall, and even higher precision if we sacrifice more recall.",
        "With this guarantee on precision, our method can be used in a TM environment without changing the upper-bound of the related cost estimation.",
        "Finally, we analyze the characteristics of the integrated outputs.",
        "We present results to show that, if measured by number, type and content of edits in TER, the recommended sentences produced by the classification model would bring about less post-editing effort than the TM outputs.",
        "This work can be extended in the following ways.",
        "Most importantly, it is useful to test the model in user studies, as proposed in Section 6.3.",
        "A user study can serve two purposes: 1) it can validate the effectiveness of the method by measuring the amount of edit effort it saves; and 2) the byproduct of the user study - post-edited sentences - can be used to generate HTER scores to train a better recommendation model.",
        "Furthermore, we want to experiment and improve on the adaptability of this method, as the current experiment is on a specific domain and language pair."
