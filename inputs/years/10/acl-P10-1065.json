        "In trans-lingual language processing tasks, such as machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval, named entity (NE) translation is essential.",
        "Bilingual NE alignment, which links source NEs and target NEs, is the first step to train the NE translation model.",
        "Since NE alignment can only be conducted after its associated NEs have first been identified, the including-rate of the first recognition stage significantly limits the final alignment performance.",
        "To alleviate the above error accumulation problem, two strategies have been proposed in the literature.",
        "The first strategy (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Moore, 2003; Feng et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2006) identifies NEs only on the source side and then finds their corresponding NEs on the target side.",
        "In this way, it avoids the NE recognition errors which would otherwise be brought into the alignment stage from the target side; however, the NE errors from the source side still remain.",
        "To further reduce the errors from the source side, the second strategy (Huang et al., 2003) expands the NE candidate-sets in both languages before conducting the alignment, which is done by treating the original results as anchors, and then regenerating further candidates by enlarging or shrinking those anchors' boundaries.",
        "Of course, this strategy will be in vain if the NE anchor is missed in the initial detection stage.",
        "In our data-set, this strategy significantly raises the NE-pair type-insensitive including-rate from 83.9% to 96.1%, and is thus adopted in this paper.",
        "Although the above expansion strategy has substantially alleviated the error accumulation problem, the final alignment accuracy is still not good (type-sensitive F-score only 68.4%, as indicated in Table 2 in Section 4.2).",
        "After having examined the data, we found that: (1) How a given NE is translated, either semantically (called translation) or phonetically (called transliteration), depends greatly on its associated entity type.",
        "The mapping type ratio, which is the percentage of NE internal tokens which are translated semantically, can help with the recognition of the associated NE type; (2) Entities within an aligned pair should share the same type, and this restriction should be integrated into NE alignment as a constraint; (3) Those initially identified monolingual NEs can act as anchors to give monolingual candidate certainty scores (preference weightings) for the regenerated candidates.",
        "Based on the above observation, a new joint model which adopts the mapping type ratio, enforces the entity type consistency constraint, and also utilizes the monolingual candidate certainty factors is proposed in this paper to jointly identify and align bilingual NEs under an integrated framework.",
        "This framework is decomposed into three subtasks: Initial Detection, Expansion, and Alignment&Re-identification.",
        "The Initial Detection subtask first locates the initial NEs and their associated NE types inside both the Chinese and English sides.",
        "Afterwards, the Expansion subtask regenerates the candidate-sets in both languages to recover those initial NE recognition errors.",
        "Finally, the Alignment&Re-identification subtask jointly recognizes and aligns bilingual NEs via the proposed joint model presented in Section 3.",
        "With this new approach, 41.8% imperfection reduction in type-sensitive F-score, from 68.4% to 81.6%, has been observed in our Chinese-English NE alignment task."

        "The problem of NE recognition requires both boundary identification and type classification.",
        "However, the complexity of these tasks varies with different languages.",
        "For example, Chinese NE boundaries are especially difficult to identify because Chinese is not a tokenized language.",
        "In contrast, English NE boundaries are easier to identify due to capitalization clues.",
        "On the other hand, classification of English NE types can be more challenging (Ji et al., 2006).",
        "Since alignment would force the linked NE pair to share the same semantic meaning, the NE that is more reliably identified in one language can be used to ensure its counterpart in another language.",
        "This benefits both the NE boundary identification and type classification processes, and it hints that alignment can help to re-identify those initially recognized NEs which had been less reliable.",
        "As shown in the following example, although the desired NE \"jk^ + ^iWfi\" is recognized partially as in the initial recognition stage, it would be more preferred if its English counterpart \"North Korean's Central News Agency\" is given.",
        "The reason for this is that \"News Agency\" would prefer to be linked to \"i Wïi\", rather than to be deleted (which would happen if \" is chosen as the corresponding Chinese NE).",

        "As mentioned in the introduction section, given a Chinese-English sentence-pair (CS, ES), with its initially recognized Chinese NEs < CNEt, CTypet >SS=1, S > 1 and English NEs [ENEj, ETypej ]Tj=1, T > 1 ( CTypei and Etypej are original NE types assigned to CNEi and ENEj , respectively), we will first regenerate two NE candidate-sets from them by enlarging and shrinking the boundaries of those initially recognized NEs.",
        "Let RCNEKc and RENEK denote these two regenerated candidate sets for Chinese and English NEs respectively ( KC and KE total K pairs of final Chinese and English NEs will be picked up from the Cartesian product of RCNEf and RENE:;, according to their associated linking score, which is defined as follows.",
        "Let Score(RCNE<k>,RENE{k]) denote the associated linking score for a given candidate-pair RCNE<k> and RENE{k], where < k > and [k] are the associated indexes of the regenerated Chinese and English NE candidates, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, let RTypek be the NE type to be reassigned and shared by RCNE<k> and RENE[k] (as they possess the same meaning).",
        "Assume that RCNE k> and RENE[k] are derived from initially recognized CNEi and ENEj , respectively, and M IC denotes their internal component mapping, to be defined in Section 3.1, then Score(RCNE k>,RENE[k]) is defined as follows:",
        "<CNEt,CTypei >,CS,[ENEj,ETypej],ESy",
        "Here, the \"max\" operator varies over each possible internal component mapping M CC and reassigned type (PER, LOC, and ORG).",
        "For brevity, we will drop those associated subscripts from now on, if there is no confusion.",
        "The associated probability factors in the above linking score can be further derived as follows.",
        "M C, RType, RCNE, RENE equation, and",
        "s P (MIC \\RType, RCNE, RENE)",
        "x P (RCNE | CNE, CType, CS, RType) x P (RENE | ENE, EType, ES, RType )",
        "P (RType | CNE, ENE, CType,EType) are the Bilingual Alignment Factor and the Bilingual Type Reassignment Factor respectively, to represent the bilingual related scores (Section 3.1).",
        "Also, P (RCNE | CNE, CType,CS,RType) and P(RENE | ENE, EType, ES,RType) are Monolingual Candidate Certainty Factors (Section 3.2) used to assign preference to each selected RCNE and RENE , based on the initially recognized NEs (which act as anchors).",
        "Bilingual Related Factors",
        "The bilingual alignmentfactor mainly represents the likelihood value of a specific internal component mapping M C , given a pair of possible NE configurations RCNE and RENE and their associated RType .",
        "Since Chinese word segmentation is problematic, especially for transliterated words, the bilingual alignment factor P ( M [C\\RType, RCNE, RENE ) in Eq (2) is derived to be conditioned on RENE (i.e., starting from the English part).",
        "We define the internal component mapping M CC to be mcc [cpn<n> , ew[nP Mtypen ]N=1, > , where [cpn n>,ew[n],Mtypen] denotes a linked pair consisting of a Chinese component cpn<n>> (which might contain several Chinese characters) and an English word ew[n] within RCNE and RENE respectively, with their internal mapping type Mtypen to be either translation (abbreviated as TS) or transliteration (abbreviated as TL).",
        "In total, there are N component mappings, with Nts translation mappings [cpn<^>,ew[TS^=1 and NTL transliteration mappings [cpn<n2>,ew[TZ]NT=1, so that N = + Ntz .",
        "Moreover, since the mapping type distributions of various NE types deviate greatly from one another, as illustrated in the second footnote, the associated mapping type ratio 8 = (NTS / N) is thus an important feature, and is included in the internal component mapping configuration specified above.",
        "For example, the M CC between \"jSlir",
        "ifi^iT and \"Constance Lake\" is [JÜÄTfi^, Constance, TL] and Lake, TS], so its associated mapping type ratio will be \"0.5\" (i.e., 1/2).",
        "Therefore, the internal mapping P(M C | RType,RENE) is further deduced by introducing the internal mapping type Mtypen and the mapping type ratio 8 as follows: P(M CC | RType, RENE)",
        "In the above equation, the mappings between internal components are trained from the syllable/word alignment of NE pairs of different NE types.",
        "In more detail, for transliteration, the model adopted in (Huang et al., 2003), which first Romanizes Chinese characters and then transliterates them into English characters, is",
        "xP(Mtypen | ew[n] , RType) _",
        "x P (RType | CNE, ENE, CType, EType)",
        "In the above used for P(cpn<n> | TLn,ew[n],RType).",
        "For translation, conditional probability is directly used for P(cpn<n> | TSn , eW[n], RType) .",
        "Lastly, the bilingual type reassignment factor P (RType | CNE, ENE, CType,EType) proposed in",
        "Eq (2) is derived as follows:",
        "P (RType | RCNE, RENE, CType, EType)",
        "As Eq (4) shows, both the Chinese initial NE type and English initial NE type are adopted to jointly identify their shared NE type RType.",
        "On the other hand, the monolingual candidate certainty factors in Eq (2) indicate the likelihood that a regenerated NE candidate is the true NE given its originally detected NE.",
        "For Chinese, it is derived as follows: P(RCNE | CNE, CType, CS, RType)",
        "x P (RightD | LenC,CType,RType)",
        "xm P(ccm | ccm-v RType)",
        "Where, the subscript C denotes Chinese, and LenC is the length of the originally recognized Chinese NE CNE.",
        "LeftD and RightD denote the left and right distance (which are the numbers of Chinese characters) that RCNE shrinks/enlarges from the left and right boundary of its anchor CNE , respectively.",
        "As in the above example, assume that CNE and RCNE are \"+ and \" S + ^ifflt\" respectively, LeftD and RightD will be and \"+3\".",
        "Also, Str[RCNE] stands for the associated Chinese string of RCNE, ccm denotes the m-th Chinese character within that string, and M denotes the total number of Chinese characters within RCNE.",
        "On the English side, following Eq (5), P (RENE | ENE, EType, ES, RType) can be derived similarly, except that LeftD and RightD will be measured in number of English words.",
        "For instance, with ENE and RENE as \"Lake Constance\" and \"on Lake Constance\" respectively, LeftD and RightD will be \"+1\" and \"0\".",
        "Also, the bigram unit ccm of the Chinese NE string is replaced by the English word unit ewn.",
        "All the bilingual and monolingual factors mentioned above, which are derived from Eq (1), are weighted differently according to their contributions.",
        "The corresponding weighting coefficients are obtained using the well-known Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003; commonly abbreviated as MERT) algorithm by minimizing the number of associated errors in the development set.",
        "The above model is implemented with a three-stage framework: (A) Initial NE Recognition; (B) NE-Candidate-Set Expansion; and (C) NE Alignment&Re-identification.",
        "The Following Diagram gives the details of this framework:",
        "For each given bilingual sentence-pair:",
        "(A) Initial NE Recognition: generates the initial NE anchors with off-the-self packages.",
        "(B) NE-Candidate-Set Expansion: For each initially detected NE, several NE candidates will be regenerated from the original NE by allowing its boundaries to be shrunk or enlarged within a pre-specified range.",
        "(B.1) Create both RCNE and RENE candidate-sets, which are expanded from those initial NEs identified in the previous stage.",
        "(B.2) Construct an NE-pair candidate-set (named NE-Pair-Candidate-Set), which is the Cartesian product of the RCNE and RENE candidate-sets created above.",
        "(C) NE Alignment&Re-identification: Rank each candidate in the NE-Pair-Candidate-Set constructed above with the linking score specified in Eq (1).",
        "Afterwards, conduct a beam search process to select the top K non-overlapping NE-pairs from this set.",
        "Diagram 1.",
        "Steps to Generate the Final NE-Pairs",
        "It is our observation that, four Chinese characters for both shrinking and enlarging, two English words for shrinking and three for enlarging are enough in most cases.",
        "Under these conditions, the including-rates for NEs with correct boundaries are raised to 95.8% for Chinese and 97.4% for English; and even the NE-pair including rate is raised to 95.3%.",
        "Since the above range limitation setting has an including-rate only 0.8% lower than that can be obtained without any range limitation (which is 96.1%), it is adopted in this paper to greatly reduce the number of NE-pair-candidates."

        "To show that not only the features but also the adopted model contribute to the performance improvement, an ME approach is tested as follows for comparison.",
        "It directly adopts all those primitive features mentioned above as its inputs (including internal component mapping, initial and final NE type, NE bigram-based string, and left/right distance), without involving any related probability factors derived within the proposed model.",
        "This ME method is implemented with a public package YASMET, and is tested under various training-set sizes (400, 4,000, 40,000, and 90,412 sentence-pairs).",
        "All those training-sets are extracted from the Training-Set-I mentioned above (a total of 298,302 NE pairs included are manually labeled).",
        "Since the ME approach is unable to utilize the bilingual NE dictionary (Training-Set-II), for fair comparison, this dictionary was also not used to train our models here.",

        "The data within parentheses are relative improvements.",

        "Since a reasonably derived model not only shares the same training-set with the primitive ME version above, but also enjoys the additional knowledge introduced by the human (i.e., the assumptions/constraints implied by the model), it is not surprising to find out that a good model does help, and that it also becomes more noticeable as the training-set gets smaller."

        "(B) NE components are one-to-one linked, but the associated NE anchors generated from the initial recognition stage are either missing or spurious (24%).",
        "Although increasing the number of output candidates generated from the initial recognition stage might cover the missing problem, possible side effects might also be expected (as the complexity of the alignment task would also be increased).",
        "(C) Mapping types are not assumed by the model (27%).",

        "Linking \"M^M\" to \"GSK\" (or to the pronoun \"it\") is thus out of reach of our model.",
        "It seems an abbreviation table (or even anaphora analysis) is required to recover these kind of errors.",
        "As an example of errors resulting from loanwords; Japanese kanji \" Eß{~\" (the name of a Japanese emperor) is linked to the English word \"Akihito\".",
        "Here the Japanese kanji \"B^ffl\" is directly adopted as the corresponding Chinese characters (as those characters were originally borrowed from Chinese), which would be pronounced as \"Mingren\" in Chinese and thus deviates greatly from the English pronunciation of \"Akihito\".",
        "Therefore, it is translated neither semantically nor phonetically.",

        "Though not shown in the tables, it is also observed that the proposed approach achieves a 28.9% reduction on the spurious (false positive) and partial tags over the initial Chinese NER, as well as 16.1% relative error reduction compared with the initial English NER.",
        "In addition, total 27.2% wrong Chinese NEs and 40.7% wrong English NEs are corrected into right NE types.",

        "As Table 5 shows, with the NER model alone, the performance may even deteriorate after convergence.",
        "This is due to the fact that maximizing likelihood does not imply minimizing the error rate.",
        "However, with additional mapping constraints from the aligned sentence of another language, the alignment module could guide the searching process to converge to a more desirable point in the parameter space; and these additional constraints become more effective as the seed-corpus gets smaller."
