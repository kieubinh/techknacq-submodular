        "Comparing alternative options is one essential step in decision-making that we carry out every day.",
        "For example, if someone is interested in certain products such as digital cameras, he or she would want to know what the alternatives are and compare different cameras before making a purchase.",
        "This type of comparison activity is very common in our daily life but requires high knowledge skill.",
        "Magazines such as Consumer Reports and PC Magazine and online media such as CNet.com strive in providing editorial comparison content and surveys to satisfy this need.",
        "In the World Wide Web era, a comparison activity typically involves: search for relevant web pages containing information about the targeted products, find competing products, read reviews, and identify pros and cons.",
        "In this paper, we focus on finding a set of comparable entities given a user's input entity.",
        "For example, given an entity, Nokia N95 (a cellphone), we want to find comparable entities such as Nokia N82, iPhone and so on.",
        "In general, it is difficult to decide if two entities are comparable or not since people do compare apples and oranges for various reasons.",
        "For example, \"Ford' and ''BMW' might be comparable as \"car manufacturers\" or as \"market segments that their products are targeting\", but we rarely see people comparing \"Ford Focus\" (car model) and \"BMW 328i\".",
        "Things also get more complicated when an entity has several functionalities.",
        "For example, one might compare \"iPhone\" and \"PSP\" as \"portable game player\" while compare \"iPhone\" and \"Nokia N95\" as \"mobile phone\".",
        "Fortunately, plenty of comparative questions are posted online, which provide evidences for what people want to compare, e.g. \"Which to buy, iPod or iPhone?\".",
        "We call \"iPod\" and \"iPhone\" in this example as comparators.",
        "In this paper, we define comparative questions and comparators as:",
        "• Comparative question: A question that intends to compare two or more entities and it has to mention these entities explicitly in the question.",
        "• Comparator: An entity which is a target of comparison in a comparative question.",
        "According to these definitions, Q1 and Q2 below are not comparative questions while Q3 is.",
        "\"iPod Touch\" and \"Zune HD\" are comparators.",
        "Q1: \"Which one is better?\"",
        "Q2: \"Is Lumix GH-1 the best camera?\"",
        "Q3: \"What's the difference between iPod Touch and Zune HD?\"",
        "The goal of this work is mining comparators from comparative questions.",
        "The results would be very useful in helping users' exploration of alternative choices by suggesting comparable entities based on other users' prior requests.",
        "To mine comparators from comparative questions, we first have to detect whether a question is comparative or not.",
        "According to our definition, a comparative question has to be a question with intent to compare at least two entities.",
        "Please note that a question containing at least two entities is not a comparative question if it does not have comparison intent.",
        "However, we observe that a question is very likely to be a comparative question if it contains at least two entities.",
        "We leverage this insight and develop a weakly supervised bootstrapping method to identify comparative questions and extract comparators simultaneously.",
        "To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to specially address the problem on finding good comparators to support users' comparison activity.",
        "We are also the first to propose using comparative questions posted online that reflect what users truly care about as the medium from which we mine comparable entities.",
        "Our weakly supervised method achieves 82.5% F1-measure in comparative question identification, 83.3% in comparator extraction, and 76.8% in end-to-end comparative question identification and comparator extraction which outperform the most relevant state-of-the-art method by Jindal & Liu (2006b) significantly.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section discusses previous works.",

        "In terms of discovering related items for an entity, our work is similar to the research on recommender systems, which recommend items to a user.",
        "Recommender systems mainly rely on similarities between items and/or their statistical correlations in user log data (Linden et al., 2003).",
        "For example, Amazon recommends products to its customers based on their own purchase histories, similar customers' purchase histories, and similarity between products.",
        "However, recommending an item is not equivalent to finding a comparable item.",
        "In the case of Amazon, the purpose of recommendation is to entice their customers to add more items to their shopping carts by suggesting similar or related items.",
        "While in the case of comparison, we would like to help users explore alternatives, i.e. helping them make a decision among comparable items.",
        "For example, it is reasonable to recommend \"iPod speaker\" or \"iPod batteries\" if a user is interested in \"iPod\", but we would not compare them with \"iPod\".",
        "However, items that are comparable with \"iPod\" such as \"iPhone\" or \"PSP\" which were found in comparative questions posted by users are difficult to be predicted simply based on item similarity between them.",
        "Although they are all music players, \"iPhone\" is mainly a mobile phone, and \"PSP\" is mainly a portable game device.",
        "They are similar but also different therefore beg comparison with each other.",
        "It is clear that comparator mining and item recommendation are related but not the same.",
        "Our work on comparator mining is related to the research on entity and relation extraction in information extraction (Cardie, 1997; Califf and 2002; Carreras et al., 2003).",
        "Specifically, the most relevant work is by Jindal and Liu (2006a and 2006b) on mining comparative sentences and relations.",
        "Their methods applied class sequential rules (CSR) (Chapter 2, Liu 2006) and label sequential rules (LSR) (Chapter 2, Liu 2006) learned from annotated corpora to identify comparative sentences and extract comparative relations respectively in the news and review domains.",
        "The same techniques can be applied to comparative question identification and comparator mining from questions.",
        "However, their methods typically can achieve high precision but suffer from low recall (Jindal and Liu, 2006b) (J&L).",
        "However, ensuring high recall is crucial in our intended application scenario where users can issue arbitrary queries.",
        "To address this problem, we develop a weakly-supervised bootstrapping pattern learning method by effectively leveraging unlabeled questions.",
        "Bootstrapping methods have been shown to be very effective in previous information extraction",
        "Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Mooney and Bu-nescu, 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008).",
        "Our work is similar to them in terms of methodology using bootstrapping technique to extract entities with a specific relation.",
        "However, our task is different from theirs in that it requires not only extracting entities (comparator extraction) but also ensuring that the entities are extracted from comparative questions (comparative question identification), which is generally not required in IE task.",
        "In this subsection, we provide a brief summary of the comparative mining method proposed by Jindal and Liu (2006a and 2006b), which is used as baseline for comparison and represents the state-of-the-art in this area.",
        "We first introduce the definition of CSR and LSR rule used in their approach, and then describe their comparative mining method.",
        "Readers should refer to J&L's original papers for more details.",
        "CSR and LSR",
        "CSR is a classification rule.",
        "It maps a sequence pattern S(s1s2 ... sn) to a class C. In our problem, C is either comparative or non-comparative.",
        "Given a collection of sequences with class information, every CSR is associated to two parameters: support and confidence.",
        "Support is the proportion of sequences in the collection containing S as a subsequence.",
        "Confidence is the proportion of sequences labeled as C in the sequences containing the S. These parameters are important to evaluate whether a CSR is reliable or not.",
        "LSR is a labeling rule.",
        "It maps an input sequence pattern s2 ...s, ...sn ) to a labeled sequence S'(s1s2 ...sn) by replacing one token (Sj ) in the input sequence with a designated label (Zj ).",
        "This token is referred as the anchor.",
        "The anchor in the input sequence could be extracted if its corresponding label in the labeled sequence is what we want (in our case, a comparator).",
        "LSRs are also mined from an annotated corpus, therefore each LSR also have two parameters: support and confidence.",
        "They are similarly defined as in CSR.",
        "Supervised Comparative Mining Method",
        "J&L treated comparative sentence identification as a classification problem and comparative relation extraction as an information extraction problem.",
        "They first manually created a set of 83 keywords such as beat, exceed, and outperform that are likely indicators of comparative sentences.",
        "These keywords were then used as pivots to create part-of-speech (POS) sequence data.",
        "A manually annotated corpus with class information, i.e. comparative or non-comparative, was used to create sequences and CSRs were mined.",
        "A Naïve Bayes classifier was trained using the CSRs as features.",
        "The classifier was then used to identify comparative sentences.",
        "Given a set of comparative sentences, J&L manually annotated two comparators with labels $ES1 and $ES2 and the feature compared with label $FT for each sentence.",
        "J&L's method was only applied to noun and pronoun.",
        "To differentiate noun and pronoun that are not comparators or features, they added the fourth label $NEF, i.e. non-entity-feature.",
        "These labels were used as pivots together with special tokens li & r/ (token position), #start (beginning of a sentence), and #end (end of a sentence) to generate sequence data, sequences with single label only and minimum support greater than 1% are retained, and then LSRs were created.",
        "When applying the learned LSRs for extraction, LSRs with higher confidence were applied first.",
        "J&L's method have been proved effective in their experimental setups.",
        "However, it has the following weaknesses:",
        "• The performance of J&L's method relies heavily on a set of comparative sentence indicative keywords.",
        "These keywords were manually created and they offered no guidelines to select keywords for inclusion.",
        "It is also difficult to ensure the completeness of the keyword list.",
        "• Users can express comparative sentences or questions in many different ways.",
        "To have high recall, a large annotated training corpus is necessary.",
        "This is an expensive process.",
        "• Example CSRs and LSRs given in Jindal & Liu (2006b) are mostly a combination of POS tags and keywords.",
        "It is a surprise that their rules achieved high precision but low recall.",
        "They attributed most errors to POS tagging errors.",
        "However, we suspect that their rules might be too specific and overfit their small training set (about 2,600 sentences).",
        "We would like to increase recall, avoid overfitting, and allow rules to include discriminative lexical tokens to retain precision.",
        "In the next section, we introduce our method to address these shortcomings."

        "• If a sequential pattern can be used to extract many reliable comparator pairs, it is very likely to be an IEP.",
        "• If a comparator pair can be extracted by an IEP, the pair is reliable.",
        "Based on these two assumptions, we design our bootstrapping algorithm as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The bootstrapping process starts with a single IEP.",
        "From it, we extract a set of initial seed comparator pairs.",
        "For each comparator pair, all questions containing the pair are retrieved from a question collection and regarded as comparative questions.",
        "From the comparative questions and comparator pairs, all possible sequential patterns are generated and evaluated by measuring their reliability score defined later in the Pattern Evaluation section.",
        "Patterns evaluated as reliable ones are IEPs and are added into an IEP repository.",

        "The new comparators are added to a reliable comparator repository and used as new seeds for pattern learning in the next iteration.",
        "All questions from which reliable comparators are extracted are removed from the collection to allow finding new patterns efficiently in later iterations.",
        "The process iterates until no more new patterns can be found from the question collection.",
        "There are two key steps in our method: (1) pattern generation and (2) pattern evaluation.",
        "In the following subsections, we will explain them in details.",
        "Pattern Generation",
        "To generate sequential patterns, we adapt the surface text pattern mining method introduced in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).",
        "For any given comparative question and its comparator pairs, comparators in the question are replaced with symbol $Cs.",
        "Two symbols, #start and #end, are attached to the beginning and the end of a sentence in the question.",
        "Then, the following three kinds of sequential patterns are generated from sequences of questions:",
        "• Lexical patterns: Lexical patterns indicate sequential patterns consisting of only words and symbols ($C, #start, and #end).",
        "They are generated by suffix tree algorithm (Gusfield, 1997) with two constraints: A pattern should contain more than one $C, and its frequency in collection should be more than an empirically determined number ß.",
        "• Generalized patterns: A lexical pattern can be too specific.",
        "Thus, we generalize lexical patterns by replacing one or more words with their POS tags.",
        "2\" – 1 generalized patterns can be produced from a lexical pattern containing N words excluding $Cs.",
        "• Specialized patterns: In some cases, a pattern can be too general.",
        "For example, although a question \"ipod or zune?\"",
        "is comparative, the pattern \"< $C or $C>\" is too general, and there can be many non-comparative questions matching the pattern, for instance, \"true or false?\".",
        "For this reason, we perform pattern specialization by adding POS tags to all comparator slots.",
        "For example, from the lexical pattern \"<$C or $C>\" and the question \"ipod or zune?",
        "\", \"<$C/NN or $C/NN?>\" will be produced as a specialized pattern.",
        "Note that generalized patterns are generated from lexical patterns and the specialized patterns are generated from the combined set of generalized patterns and lexical patterns.",
        "The final set of candidate patterns is a mixture of lexical patterns, generalized patterns and specialized patterns.",
        "Pattern Evaluation",
        "According to our first assumption, a reliability score Rk (pt) for a candidate pattern pt at iteration k can be defined as follows:",
        ", where pt can extract known reliable comparator pairs cpj.",
        "CPk – 1 indicates the reliable comparator pair repository accumulated until the (k – 1)th iteration.",
        "Nq (x) means the number of questions satisfying a condition x.",
        "The condition Pi – cpj denotes that cpj can be extracted from a question by applying pattern pt while the condition Pi – * denotes any question containing pattern pt.",

        "By applying our bootstrapping method to the entire source data (60M questions), 328,364 unique comparator pairs were extracted from 679,909 automatically identified comparative questions.",
        "Table 6 lists top 10 frequently compared entities for a target item, such as Chanel, Gap, in our question archive.",
        "As shown in the table, our comparator mining method successfully discovers realistic comparators.",
        "For example, for 'Chanel', most results are high-end fashion brands such as 'Dior' or 'Louis Vuitton ', while the ranking results for 'Gap' usually contains similar apparel brands for young people, such as 'Old Navy' or 'Banana Republic'.",
        "For the basketball player 'Kobe\\ most of the top ranked comparators are also famous basketball players.",
        "Some interesting comparators are shown for 'Canon' (the company name).",
        "It is famous for different kinds of its products, for example, digital cameras and printers, so it can be compared to different kinds of companies.",
        "For example, it is compared to 'HP ', 'Lexmark', or 'Xerox', the printer manufacturers, and also compared to 'Nikon', 'Sony', or 'Kodak', the digital camera manufactures.",
        "Besides general entities such as a brand or company name, our method also found an interesting comparable entity for a specific item in the experiments.",
        "For example, our method recommends 'Nikon d40i', 'Canon rebel xti\\ Canon rebel xt', 'Nikon d3000\\ 'Pentax kl00d\\ 'Canon eos 1000d as comparators for the specific camera product 'Nikon 40d\\",
        "Table 7 can show the difference between our comparator mining and query/item recommendation.",
        "As shown in the table, 'Google related searches' generally suggests a mixed set of two kinds of related queries for a target entity: (1) queries specified with subtopics for an original query (e.g., 'Chanel handbag for 'Chanel') and (2) its comparable entities (e.g., 'Dior' for 'Chanel').",
        "It confirms one of our claims that comparator mining and query/item recommendation are related but not the same.",
        "Conclusion",
        "In this paper, we present a novel weakly supervised method to identify comparative questions and extract comparator pairs simultaneously.",
        "We rely on the key insight that a good comparative question identification pattern should extract good comparators, and a good comparator pair should occur in good comparative questions to bootstrap the extraction and identification process.",
        "By leveraging large amount of unla-beled data and the bootstrapping process with slight supervision to determine four parameters, we found 328,364 unique comparator pairs and 6,869 extraction patterns without the need of creating a set of comparative question indicator keywords.",
        "The experimental results show that our method is effective in both comparative question identification and comparator extraction.",
        "It significantly improves recall in both tasks while maintains high precision.",
        "Our examples show that these comparator pairs reflect what users are really interested in comparing.",
