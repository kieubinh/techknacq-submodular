        "NLP systems for higher-level operations or complex annotations often integrate redundant modules that provide alternative analyses for the same linguistic phenomenon in order to benefit from their respective strengths and to compensate for their respective weaknesses, e.g., in parsing (Crys-mann et al., 2002), or in machine translation (Carl et al., 2000).",
        "The current trend to parallel and distributed NLP architectures (Aschenbrenner et al., 2006; Gietz et al., 2006; Egner et al., 2007; Luis and de Matos, 2009) opens the possibility of exploring the potential of redundant parallel annotations also for lower levels of linguistic analysis.",
        "This paper evaluates the potential benefits of such an approach with respect to morphosyntax (parts of speech, pos) and morphology in German: In comparison to English, German shows a rich and polysemous morphology, and a considerable number of NLP tools are available, making it a promising candidate for such an experiment.",
        "Previous research indicates that the integration of multiple part of speech taggers leads to more accurate analyses.",
        "So far, however, this line of research focused on tools that were trained on the same corpus (Brill and Wu, 1998; Halteren et al., 2001), or that specialize to different subsets of the same tagset (Zavrel and Daelemans, 2000; Tufi§, 2000; Borin, 2000).",
        "An even more substantial increase in accuracy and detail can be expected if tools are combined that make use of different annotation schemes.",
        "For this task, ontologies of linguistic annotations are employed to assess the linguistic information conveyed in a particular annotation and to integrate the resulting ontological descriptions in a consistent and tool-independent way.",
        "The merged set of ontological descriptions is then evaluated with reference to morphosyntactic and morphological annotations of three corpora of German newspaper articles, the NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1998), the TIGER corpus (Brants et al., 2002) and the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004, PCC)."

        "Various repositories of linguistic annotation terminology have been developed in the last decades, ranging from early texts on annotation standards (Bakker et al., 1993; Leech and Wilson, 1996) over relational data base models (Bickel and more recent formalizations in OWL/RDF (or with OWL/RDF export), e.g., the General Ontology of Linguistic Description (Farrar and Langendoen,",
        "Snijders et al., 2009, DCR), the OntoTag ontology (Aguado de Cea et al., 2002), or the Typological Database System ontology (Saulwick et al., 2005, TDS).",
        "Despite their common level of representation, however, these efforts have not yet converged into a unified and generally accepted ontology of linguistic annotation terminology, but rather, different resources are maintained by different communities, so that a considerable amount of disagreement between them and their respective definitions can be observed.",
        "Such conceptual mismatches and incompatibilities between existing terminological repositories have been the motivation to develop the OLiA architecture (Chiarcos, 2008) that employs a shallow Reference Model to mediate between (onto-logical models of) annotation schemes and several existing terminology repositories, incl.",

        "The Ontologies of Linguistic Annotations -briefly, OLiA ontologies (Chiarcos, 2008) - represent an architecture of modular OWL/DL ontologies that formalize several intermediate steps of the mapping between concrete annotations, a Reference Model and existing terminology repositories ('External Reference Models' in OLiA terminology) such as the DCR.",
        "The OLiA ontologies were originally developed as part of an infrastructure for the sustainable maintenance of linguistic resources (Schmidt et al., 2006) where they were originally applied to the formal representation and documentation of annotation schemes, and for concept-based annotation queries over to multiple, heterogeneous corpora annotated with different annotation schemes applications of the OLiA ontologies include a proposal to integrate them with the OntoTag ontologies and to use them for interface specifications between modules in NLP pipeline architectures described the application of the OLiA ontologies within NLP2RDF, an OWL-based blackboard approach to assess the meaning of text from grammatical analyses and subsequent enrichment with ontological knowledge sources.",

        "With the ontology-based approach described in this paper, the performance of annotation tools can be evaluated on a conceptual basis rather than by means of a string comparison with target annotations.",
        "A formal model of linguistic concepts is extensible, finer-grained and, thus, potentially more adequate for the integration of linguistic annotations than string-based representations, especially for heterogeneous annotations, if the tagsets involved are structured according to different design principles (e.g., due to different terminological traditions, different communities involved, etc.",
        ").",
        "It has been shown that by abstracting from tool-specific representations of linguistic annotations, annotations from different tagsets can be represented with reference to the OLiA ontologies (and/or with other OWL/RDF-based terminology repositories linked as External Reference Models).",
        "In particular, it is possible to compare an existing reference annotation with annotations produced by NLP tools that use independently developed and differently structured annotation schemes (such as Connexor vs. RFTagger vs. Morphisto).",
        "Further, an algorithm for the integration of different annotations has been proposed that makes use of a majority-based confidence ranking and ontological consistency conditions.",
        "As consistency conditions are not formally defined in the OLiA Reference Model (which is expected to inherit such constraints from External Reference Models), a heuristic, structure-based definition of consistency was applied.",
        "This heuristic consistency definition is overly rigid and rules out a number of consistent alternative analyses, as it is the case for overlapping categories.",
        "Despite this rigidity, we witness an increase of recall when multiple alternative analyses are integrated.",
        "This increase of recall may result from a compensation of tool-specific deficits, e.g., with respect to annotation granularity.",
        "Also, the improved recall can be explained by a compensation of overfitting, or deficits that are inherent to a particular approach (e.g., differences in the coverage of the linguistic context).",
        "It can thus be stated that the integration of multiple alternative analyses has the potential to produce linguistic analyses that are both more robust and more detailed than those of the original tools.",
        "The primary field of application of this approach is most likely to be seen in a context where applications are designed that make direct use of OWL/RDF representations as described, for example, by Hellmann (2010).",
        "It is, however, also possible to use ontological representations to bootstrap novel and more detailed annotation schemes, cf. Zavrel and Daelemans (2000).",
        "Further, the conversion from string-based representations to ontological descriptions is reversible, so that results of ontology-based disambiguation and validation can also be reintegrated with the original annotation scheme.",
        "The idea of such a reversion algorithm was sketched by Buyko et al.",
        "(2008) where the OLiA ontologies were suggested as a means to translate between different annotation schemes."

        "(ii) Context-sensitive disambiguation of morphological features (e.g., by combination with a chunker and adjustment of confidence scores for morphological features over all tokens in the current chunk, cf. Kermes and",
        "Evert, 2002).",
        "(iii) Replacement of majority vote by more elaborate strategies to merge grammatical analyses.",
        "(iv) Application of the algorithm for the ontological processing of node labels and edge labels in syntax annotations.",
        "(v) Integration with other ontological knowledge sources in order to improve the recall of morphosyntactic and morphological analyses (e.g., for disambiguating grammatical case).",
        "Extensions (iii) and (iv) are currently pursued in an ongoing research effort described by Chiarcos et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Like morphosyntactic and morphological features, node and edge labels of syntactic trees are ontologically represented in several Annotation Models, the OLiA Reference Model, and External Reference Models, the merging algorithm as described above can thus be applied for syntax, as well.",
        "Syntactic annotations, however, involve the additional challenge to align different structures before node and edge labels can be addressed, an issue not further discussed here for reasons of space limitations.",
        "Alternative strategies to merge grammatical analyses may include alternative voting strategies as discussed in literature on classifier combination, e.g., weighted majority vote, pairwise voting (Halteren et al., 1998), credibility profiles (Tufi§, novel feature of our approach as compared to existing applications of these methods is that confidence scores are not attached to plain strings, but to ontological descriptions: Tufi§, for example, assigned confidence scores not to tools (as in a weighted majority vote), but rather, assessed the 'credibility' of a tool with respect to the predicted tag.",
        "If this approach is applied to ontological descriptions in place of tags, it allows us to consider the credibility of pieces of information regardless of the actual string representation of tags.",
        "For example, the credibility of hasCase descriptions can be assessed independently from the credibility of hasGender descriptions even if the original annotation merged both aspects in one single tag (as the RFTagger does, for example, cf. ex.",
        "5).",
        "Extension (v) has been addressed in previous research, although mostly with the opposite perspective: Already Cimiano and Reyle (2003) noted that the integration of grammatical and semantic analyses may be used to resolve ambiguity and un-derspecifications, and this insight has also motivated the ontological representation of linguistic resources such as WordNet (Gangemi et al., 2003), FrameNet (Scheffczyk et al., 2006), the linking of corpora with such ontologies (Hovy et al., 2006), the modelling of entire corpora in OWL/DL (Bur-chardt et al., 2008), and the extension of existing ontologies with ontological representations of selected linguistic features (Buitelaar et al., 2006;",
        "Davis et al., 2008).",
        "Aguado de Cea et al.",
        "(2004) sketched an architecture for the closer ontology-based integration of grammatical and semantic information using OntoTag and several NLP tools for Spanish.",
        "Aguado de Cea et al.",
        "(2008) evaluate the benefits of this approach for the Spanish particle se, and conclude for this example that the combination of multiple tools yields more detailed and more accurate linguistic analyses of particularly problematic, polysemous function words.",
        "A similar increase in accuracy has also been repeatedly reported for ensemble combination approaches, that are, however, limited to tools that produce annotations according to the same tagset (Brill and Wu, 1998; Halteren et al., 2001).",
        "These observations provide further support for our conclusion that the ontology-based integration of morphosyntactic analyses enhances both the robustness and the level of detail of morphosyntac-tic and morphological analyses.",
        "Our approach extends the philosophy of ensemble combination approaches to NLP tools that do not only employ different strategies and philosophies, but also different annotation schemes."
