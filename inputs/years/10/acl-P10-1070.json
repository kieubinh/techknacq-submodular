        "The automatic interpretation of noun-noun compounds is an important subproblem within many natural language processing applications and is an area of increasing interest.",
        "The problem is difficult, with disagreement regarding the number and nature of the relations, low inter-annotator agreement, and limited annotated data.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy of relations that integrates previous relations, the largest publicly-available annotated dataset, and a supervised classification method for automatic noun compound interpretation."

        "Noun compounds (e.g., 'maple leaf') occur very frequently in text, and their interpretation – determining the relationships between adjacent nouns as well as the hierarchical dependency structure of the NP in which they occur – is an important problem within a wide variety of natural language processing (NLP) applications, including machine translation (Baldwin and Tanaka, 2004) and question answering (Ahn et al., 2005).",
        "The interpretation of noun compounds is a difficult problem for various reasons (Spärck Jones, 1983).",
        "Among them is the fact that no set of relations proposed to date has been accepted as complete and appropriate for general-purpose text.",
        "Regardless, automatic noun compound interpretation is the focus of an upcoming SEMEVAL task (Butnariu et al., 2009).",
        "Leaving aside the problem of determining the dependency structure among strings of three or more nouns – a problem we do not address in this paper – automatic noun compound interpretation requires a taxonomy of noun-noun relations, an automatic method for accurately assigning the relations to noun compounds, and, in the case of supervised classification, a sufficiently large dataset for training.",
        "Earlier work has often suffered from using taxonomies with coarse-grained, highly ambiguous predicates, such as prepositions, as various labels (Lauer, 1995) and/or unimpressive inter-annotator agreement among human judges (Kim and Baldwin, 2005).",
        "In addition, the datasets annotated according to these various schemes have often been too small to provide wide coverage of the noun compounds likely to occur in general text.",
        "In this paper, we present a large, fine-grained taxonomy of 43 noun compound relations, a dataset annotated according to this taxonomy, and a supervised, automatic classification method for determining the relation between the head and modifier words in a noun compound.",
        "We compare and map our relations to those in other taxonomies and report the promising results of an inter-annotator agreement study as well as an automatic classification experiment.",
        "We examine the various features used for classification and identify one very useful, novel family of features.",
        "Our dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest noun compound dataset yet produced.",
        "We will make it available via http://www.isi.edu."

        "The relations between the component nouns in noun compounds have been the subject of various linguistic studies performed throughout the years, including early work by Jespersen (1949).",
        "The taxonomies they created are varied.",
        "Lees created an early taxonomy based primarily upon grammar (Lees, 1960).",
        "Levi's influential work postulated that complex nominals (Levi's name for noun compounds that also permits certain adjectival modifiers) are all derived either via nominalization or by deleting one of nine predicates (i.e., cause, from an underlying sentence construction (Levi, 1978).",
        "Of the taxonomies presented by purely linguistic studies, our categories are most similar to those proposed by Warren (1978), whose categories (e.g., material+artefact, obj+part) are generally less ambiguous than Levi's.",
        "In contrast to studies that claim the existence of a relatively small number of semantic relations, Downing (1977) presents a strong case for the existence of an unbounded number of relations.",
        "While we agree with Downing's belief that the number of relations is unbounded, we contend that the vast majority of noun compounds fits within a relatively small set of categories.",
        "The relations used in computational linguistics vary much along the same lines as those proposed earlier by linguists.",
        "Several lines of work (Finin, 1980; Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov, 2008) assume the existence of an unbounded number of relations.",
        "Others use categories similar to Levi's, such as Lauer's (1995) set of prepositional paraphrases (i.e., of, for, in, on, at, from, with, about) to analyze noun compounds.",
        "Some work (e.g., Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju et al., 2005; Kim and Baldwin, 2005) use sets of categories that are somewhat more similar to those proposed by Warren (1978).",
        "While most of the noun compound research to date is not domain specific, Rosario and Hearst (2001) create and experiment with a taxonomy tailored to biomedical text.",
        "The approaches used for automatic classification are also varied.",
        "Vanderwende (1994) presents one of the first systems for automatic classification, which extracted information from online sources and used a series of rules to rank a set of most likely interpretations.",
        "Lauer (1995) uses corpus statistics to select a prepositional paraphrase.",
        "Several lines of work, including that of Barker and Szpakowicz (1998), use memory-based methods.",
        "Kim and Baldwin (2005) and Turney (2006) use nearest neighbor approaches based upon WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and Turney's Latent Relational Analysis, respectively.",

        "We collected 17509 noun pairs and over a period of 10 months assigned one or more relations to each, gradually building and refining our taxonomy.",
        "More details regarding the dataset are provided in Section 4.",
        "The relations we produced were then compared to those present in other taxonomies (e.g., Levi, 1978; Warren, 1978; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Girju et al., 2005), and they were found to be fairly similar.",
        "We present a detailed comparison in Section 3.4.",
        "We tested the relation set with an initial inter-annotator agreement study (our latest inter-annotator agreement study results are presented in Section 6).",

        "The categories were substantially modified during this process.",
        "They are shown in Table 1 along with examples and an approximate mapping to several other taxonomies.",
        "Our categories are defined with sentences.",

        "Our location category's definition reads ni is the location / geographic scope where n2 is at, near, from, generally found, or occurs.",
        "Defining the categories with sentences is advantageous because it is possible to create straightforward, explicit defintions that humans can easily test examples against.",
        "In addition to influencing the category definitions, some taxonomy groupings were altered with the hope that this would improve inter-annotator agreement for cases where Turker disagreement was systematic.",
        "For example, location and whole + part/member of were commonly disagreed upon by Turkers so they were placed within their own taxonomic subgroup.",
        "The ambiguity between these categories has previously been observed by Girju (2009).",
        "Turkers also tended to disagree between the categories related to composition and containment.",
        "Due this apparent similarity they were also grouped together in the taxonomy.",
        "The attribute categories are positioned near the topic group because some Turkers chose a topic category when an attribute category was deemed more appropriate.",

        "(2005).",
        "The results, shown in Table 1, demonstrate that our taxonomy is similar to several taxonomies used in other work.",
        "However, there are three main differences and several less important ones.",
        "The first major difference is the absence of a significant theme or object category.",
        "The second main difference is that our taxonomy does not include a purpose category and, instead, has several smaller categories.",
        "Finally, instead of possessing a single topic category, our taxonomy has several, finer-grained topic categories.",
        "These differences are significant because theme/object, purpose, and topic are typically among the most frequent categories.",
        "theme/object is typically the category to which other researchers assign noun compounds whose head noun is a nominalized verb and whose modifier noun is the theme/object of the verb.",
        "This is typically done with the justification that the relation/predicate (the root verb of the nominaliza-tion) is overtly expressed.",
        "While including a theme/object category has the advantage of simplicity, its disadvantages are significant.",
        "This category leads to a significant ambiguity in examples because many compounds fitting the theme/object category also match some other category as well.",
        "Warren (1978) gives the examples of soup pot and soup container to illustrate this issue, and Girju (2009) notes a substantial overlap between theme and make-produce.",
        "Our results from Mechanical Turk showed significant overlap between purpose and object categories (present in an earlier version of the taxonomy).",
        "For this reason, we do not include a separate theme/object category.",
        "If it is important to know whether the modifier also holds a theme/object relationship, we suggest treating this as a separate classification task.",
        "The absence of a single purpose category is another distinguishing characteristic of our taxonomy.",
        "Instead, the taxonomy includes a number of finer-grained categories (e.g., per-form/engage_in), which can be conflated to create a purpose category if necessary.",
        "During our Mechanical Turk-based refinement process, our now-defunct purpose category was found to be ambiguous with many other categories as well as difficult to define.",
        "This problem has been noted by others.",
        "For example, Warren (1978) points out that tea in tea cup qualifies as both the content and the purpose of the cup.",
        "Similarly, while whole+part/member was selected by most Turkers for bike tire, one individual chose purpose.",
        "Our investigation identified five main purpose-like relations that most of our purpose examples can be divided into, including activity performance (perform/engage_in), creation/provision (create/provide/cause of), obtainment/access (obtain/access/seek), supervision/management (orga-",
        "nize/supervise/authority), and opposition (mitigate/oppose/destroy).",
        "The third major distinguishing different between our taxonomy and others is the absence of a single topic/about relation.",
        "Instead, our taxonomy has several finer-grained categories that can be conflated into a topic category.",
        "Unlike the previous two distinguishing characteristics, which were motivated primarily by Turker annotations, this separation was largely motivated by author dissatisfaction with a single topic category.",
        "Two differentiating characteristics of less importance are the absence of beneficiary or source categories (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju et al., 2005).",
        "Our employer, consumer, and user/recipient categories combined more or less cover beneficiary.",
        "Since source is ambiguous in multiple ways including causation (tsunami injury), provision (government grant), ingredients (rice wine), and locations (north wind), we chose to exclude it."

        "To assess the quality of our taxonomy and classification method, we performed an inter-annotator agreement study using 150 noun compounds extracted from a random subset of articles taken from New York Times articles dating back to 1987 (Sandhaus, 2008).",
        "The terms were selected based upon their frequency (i.e., a compound occurring twice as often as another is twice as likely to be selected) to label for testing purposes.",
        "Using a heuristic similar to that used by Lauer (1995), we only extracted binary noun compounds not part of a larger sequence.",
        "Before reaching the 150 mark, we discarded 94 of the drawn examples because they were included in the training set.",
        "Thus, our training set covers roughly 38.5% of the binary noun compound instances in recent New York Times articles.",
        "Due to the relatively high speed and low cost of Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, we chose to use Mechanical Turkers as our annotators.",
        "Using Mechanical Turk to obtain inter-annotator agreement figures has several drawbacks.",
        "The first and most significant drawback is that it is impossible to force each Turker to label every data point without putting all the terms onto a single web page, which is highly impractical for a large taxonomy.",
        "Some Turkers may label every compound, but most do not.",
        "Second, while we requested that Turkers only work on our task if English was their first language, we had no method of enforcing this.",
        "Third, Turker annotation quality varies considerably.",
        "To overcome the shortfalls of using Turkers for an inter-annotator agreement study, we chose to request ten annotations per noun compound and then combine the annotations into a single set of selections using a weighted voting scheme.",
        "To combine the results, we calculated a \"quality\" score for each Turker based upon how often he/she agreed with the others.",
        "This score was computed as the average percentage of other Turkers who agreed with his/her annotations.",
        "The score for each label for a particular compound was then computed as the sum of the Turker quality scores of the Turkers who annotated the compound.",
        "Finally, the label with the highest rating was selected.",
