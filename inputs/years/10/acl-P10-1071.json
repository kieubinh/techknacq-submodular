        "Our production and comprehension of language is a multi-layered computational process.",
        "Humans carry out high-level semantic tasks effortlessly by subconsciously employing a vast inventory of complex linguistic devices, while simultaneously integrating their background knowledge, to reason about reality.",
        "An ideal model of language understanding would also be capable ofper-forming such high-level semantic tasks.",
        "However, a great deal of NLP research to date focuses on processing lower-level linguistic information, such as e.g. part-of-speech tagging, discovering syntactic structure of a sentence (parsing), coreference resolution, named entity recognition and many others.",
        "Another cohort of researchers set the goal of improving application-based statistical inference (e.g. for recognizing textual entailment or automatic summarization).",
        "In contrast, there have been fewer attempts to bring the state-of-the-art NLP technologies together to model the way humans use language to frame high-level reasoning processes, such as for example, creative thought.",
        "The majority of computational approaches to figurative language still exploit the ideas articulated three decades ago (Wilks, 1978; Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Fass, 1991) and often rely on task-specific hand-coded knowledge.",
        "However, recent work on lexical semantics and lexical acquisition techniques opens many new avenues for creation of fully automated models for recognition and interpretation of figurative language.",
        "In this paper I will focus on the phenomenon of metaphor and describe the most prominent computational approaches to metaphor, as well the issues of resource creation and metaphor annotation.",
        "Metaphors arise when one concept is viewed in terms of the properties of the other.",
        "In other words it is based on similarity between the concepts.",
        "Similarity is a kind of association implying the presence of characteristics in common.",
        "Here are some examples of metaphor.",
        "(1) Hillary brushed aside the accusations.",
        "(3) I invested myself fully in this relationship.",
        "(4) And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.",
        "In metaphorical expressions seemingly unrelated features of one concept are associated with another concept.",
        "In the example (2) the computational process is viewed as something alive and, therefore, its forced termination is associated with the act of killing.",
        "Metaphorical expressions represent a great variety, ranging from conventional metaphors, which we reproduce and comprehend every day, e.g. those in (2) and (3), to poetic and largely novel ones, such as (4).",
        "The use of metaphor is ubiquitous in natural language text and it is a serious bottleneck in automatic text understanding.",
        "In order to estimate the frequency of the phenomenon, Shutova (2010) conducted a corpus study on a subset of the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) representing various genres.",
        "They manually annotated metaphorical expressions in this data and found that 241 out of 761 sentences contained a metaphor.",

      "text": [
        "Four different views on metaphor have been broadly discussed in linguistics and philosophy: the comparison view (Gentner, 1983), the interaction view (Black, 1962), (Hesse, 1966), the selectional restrictions violation view (Wilks, 1975; Wilks, 1978) and the conceptual metaphor view (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980).",
        "All of these approaches share the idea of an interconceptual mapping that underlies the production of metaphorical expressions.",
        "In other words, metaphor always involves two concepts or conceptual domains: the target (also called topic or tenor in the linguistics literature) and the source (or vehicle).",
        "Consider the examples in (5) and (6).",
        "(5) He shot down all of my arguments.",
        "(Lakoff",
        "(6) He attacked every weak point in my argument.",
        "(Lakoff and Johnson, 1980)",
        "According to Lakoff and Johnson (1980), a mapping of a concept of argument to that of war is employed here.",
        "The argument, which is the target concept, is viewed in terms of a battle (or a war), the source concept.",
        "The existence of such a link allows us to talk about arguments using the war terminology, thus giving rise to a number of metaphors.",
        "However, Lakoff and Johnson do not discuss how metaphors can be recognized in the linguistic data, which is the primary task in the automatic processing of metaphor.",
        "Although humans are highly capable of producing and comprehending metaphorical expressions, the task of distinguishing between literal and non-literal meanings and, therefore, identifying metaphor in text appears to be challenging.",
        "This is due to the variation in its use and external form, as well as a not clear-cut semantic distinction.",
        "Gibbs (1984) suggests that literal and figurative meanings are situated at the ends of a single continuum, along which metaphoricity and idiomaticity are spread.",
        "This makes demarcation of metaphorical and literal language fuzzy.",
        "So far, the most influential account of metaphor recognition is that of Wilks (1978).",
        "According to Wilks, metaphors represent a violation of selectional restrictions in a given context.",
        "Selectional restrictions are the semantic constraints that a verb places onto its arguments.",
        "Consider the following example.",
        "The verb drink normally takes an animate subject and a liquid object.",
        "Therefore, drink taking a car as a subject is an anomaly, which may in turn indicate the metaphorical use of drink."

      "text": [
        "One of the first attempts to identify and interpret metaphorical expressions in text automatically is the approach of Fass (1991).",
        "It originates in the work of Wilks (1978) and utilizes hand-coded knowledge.",
        "Fass (1991) developed a system called met*, capable of discriminating between literalness, metonymy, metaphor and anomaly.",
        "It does this in three stages.",
        "First, literalness is distinguished from non-literalness using selectional preference violation as an indicator.",
        "In the case that non-literalness is detected, the respective phrase is tested for being a metonymic relation using hand-coded patterns (such as CONTAINER-for-CONTENT).",
        "If the system fails to recognize metonymy, it proceeds to search the knowledge base for a relevant analogy in order to discriminate metaphorical relations from anomalous ones.",
        "E.g., the sentence in (7) would be represented in this framework as (car,drink,gasoline), which does not satisfy the preference (animal,drink,liquid), as car is not a hyponym of animal.",
        "met* then searches its knowledge base for a triple containing a hypernym of both the actual argument and the desired argument and finds (thing,use,energysource), which represents the metaphorical interpretation.",
        "However, Fass himself indicated a problem with the selectional preference violation approach applied to metaphor recognition.",
        "The approach detects any kind of non-literalness or anomaly in language (metaphors, metonymies and others), and not only metaphors, i.e., it overgenerates.",
        "The methods met* uses to differentiate between those are mainly based on hand-coded knowledge, which implies a number of limitations.",
        "Another problem with this approach arises from the high conventionality of metaphor in language.",
        "This means that some metaphorical senses are very common.",
        "As a result the system would extract selectional preference distributions skewed towards such conventional metaphorical senses of the verb or one of its arguments.",
        "Therefore, although some expressions may be fully metaphorical in nature, no selectional preference violation can be detected in their use.",
        "Another counterargument is bound to the fact that interpretation is always context dependent, e.g. the phrase all men are animals can be used metaphorically, however, without any violation of selectional restrictions.",
        "Goatly (1997) addresses the phenomenon of metaphor by identifying a set of linguistic cues indicating it.",
        "He gives examples of lexical patterns indicating the presence of a metaphorical expression, such as metaphorically speaking, utterly, completely so to speak and, surprisingly, literally.",
        "Such cues would probably not be enough for metaphor extraction on their own, but could contribute to a more complex system.",
        "The work of Peters and Peters (2000) concentrates on detecting figurative language in lexical resources.",
        "They mine WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) for the examples of systematic polysemy, which allows to capture metonymic and metaphorical relations.",
        "The authors search for nodes that are relatively high up in the WordNet hierarchy and that share a set of common word forms among their descendants.",
        "Peters and Peters found that such nodes often happen to be in metonymic (e.g. publication - publisher) or metaphorical (e.g. supporting structure - theory) relation.",
        "The CorMet system discussed in (Mason, 2004) is the first attempt to discover source-target domain mappings automatically.",
        "This is done by \"finding systematic variations in domain-specific selectional preferences, which are inferred from large, dynamically mined Internet corpora\".",
        "For example, Mason collects texts from the LAB domain and the FINANCE domain, in both of which pour would be a characteristic verb.",
        "In the LAB domain pour has a strong selectional preference for objects of type liquid, whereas in the FINANCE domain it selects for money.",
        "From this Mason's system infers the domain mapping FINANCE - LAB and the concept mapping money - liquid.",
        "He compares the output of his system against the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff et al., 1991) containing hand-crafted metaphorical mappings between concepts.",
        "Mason reports an accuracy of 77%, although it should be noted that as any evaluation that is done by hand it contains an element of subjectivity.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) present a sentence clustering approach for non-literal language recognition implemented in the TroFi system (Trope Finder).",
        "This idea originates from a similarity-based word sense disambiguation method developed by Karov and Edelman (1998).",
        "The method employs a set of seed sentences, where the senses are annotated; computes similarity between the sentence containing the word to be disambiguated and all of the seed sentences and selects the sense corresponding to the annotation in the most similar seed sentences.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) adapt this algorithm to perform a two-way classification: literal vs. non-literal, and they do not clearly define the kinds of tropes they aim to discover.",
        "They attain a performance of 53.8% in terms of f-score.",
        "The method of Gedigan et al.",
        "(2006) discriminates between literal and metaphorical use.",
        "They trained a maximum entropy classifier for this purpose.",
        "They obtained their data by extracting the lexical items whose frames are related to MOTION and CURE from FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003).",
        "Then they searched the PropBank Wall Street Journal corpus (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) for sentences containing such lexical items and annotated them with respect to metaphoric-ity.",
        "They used PropBank annotation (arguments and their semantic types) as features to train the classifier and report an accuracy of 95.12%.",
        "This result is, however, only a little higher than the performance of the naive baseline assigning majority class to all instances (92.90%).",
        "These numbers can be explained by the fact that 92.00% of the verbs of MOTION and CURE in the Wall Street",
        "Journal corpus are used metaphorically, thus making the dataset unbalanced with respect to the target categories and the task notably easier.",
        "Both Birke and Sarkar (2006) and Gedigan et al.",
        "(2006) focus only on metaphors expressed by a verb.",
        "As opposed to that the approach of Kr-ishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) deals with verbs, nouns and adjectives as parts of speech.",
        "They use hyponymy relation in WordNet and word bigram counts to predict metaphors at a sentence level.",
        "Given an IS-A metaphor (e.g.",
        "The world is a stage) they verify if the two nouns involved are in hyponymy relation in WordNet, and if they are not then this sentence is tagged as containing a metaphor.",
        "Along with this they consider expressions containing a verb or an adjective used metaphorically (e.g.",
        "He planted good ideas in their minds or He has a fertile imagination).",
        "Hereby they calculate bigram probabilities of verb-noun and adjective-noun pairs (including the hyponyms/hypernyms of the noun in question).",
        "If the combination is not observed in the data with sufficient frequency, the system tags the sentence containing it as metaphorical.",
        "This idea is a modification of the selectional preference view of Wilks.",
        "However, by using bigram counts over verb-noun pairs Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) loose a great deal of information compared to a system extracting verb-object relations from parsed text.",
        "The authors evaluated their system on a set of example sentences compiled from the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff et al., 1991), whereby highly conventionalized metaphors (they call them dead metaphors) are taken to be negative examples.",
        "Thus they do not deal with literal examples as such: essentially, the distinction they are making is between the senses included in WordNet, even if they are conventional metaphors, and those not included in WordNet."

        "Although there is a consensus in the research community that the phenomenon of metaphor is not restricted to similarity-based extensions of meanings of isolated words, but rather involves reconceptualization of a whole area of experience in terms of another, there still has been surprisingly little interest in annotation of cross-domain mappings.",

        "Team A was asked to annotate \"interesting stretches\", whereby a phrase was considered interesting if (1) its significance in the document was non-physical, (2) it could have a physical significance in another context with a similar syntactic frame, (3) this physical significance was related to the abstract one.",
        "Team B had to annotate phrases according to their own intuitive definition of metaphor.",

        "(2003) attempted to annotate the involved source - target domain mappings.",
        "The annotators were given a set of mappings from the Master Metaphor List and were asked to assign the most suitable ones to the examples.",

        "They do not rely on predefined mappings, but instead derive independent sets of most common source and target categories.",
        "They propose a two stage procedure, whereby the metaphorical expressions are first identified using MIP, and then the source domain (where the basic sense comes from) and the target domain (the given context) are selected from the lists of categories.",

        "The eighties and nineties provided us with a wealth of ideas on the structure and mechanisms of the phenomenon of metaphor.",
        "The approaches formulated back then are still highly influential, although their use of hand-coded knowledge is becoming increasingly less convincing.",
        "The last decade witnessed a high technological leap in natural language computation, whereby manually crafted rules gradually give way to more robust corpus-based statistical methods.",
        "This is also the case for metaphor research.",
        "The latest developments in the lexical acquisition technology will in the near future enable fully automated corpus-based processing of metaphor.",
        "However, there is still a clear need in a unified metaphor annotation procedure and creation of a large publicly available metaphor corpus.",
        "Given such a resource the computational work on metaphor is likely to proceed along the following lines: (1) automatic acquisition of an extensive set of valid metaphorical associations from linguistic data via statistical pattern matching; (2) using the knowledge of these associations for metaphor recognition in the unseen unrestricted text and, finally, (3) interpretation of the identified metaphorical expressions by deriving the closest literal paraphrase (a representation that can be directly embedded in other NLP applications to enhance their performance).",
        "Besides making our thoughts more vivid and filling our communication with richer imagery, metaphors also play an important structural role in our cognition.",
        "Thus, one of the long term goals of metaphor research in NLP and AI would be to build a computational intelligence model accounting for the way metaphors organize our conceptual system, in terms of which we think and act."
