        "The European train chugged out of the station last night; for most of the day it looked as if it might be stalled there for some time.",
        "It managed to pull away at around 10:30 pm only after the Spanish prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, forced the passengers in the first class carriages into a last minute whip round to sweeten the trip for the European Community's poor four: Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.",
        "The fat controller, Helmut Kohl, beamed with satisfaction as the deal was done.",
        "The elegantly-suited Francois Mitterrand was equally satisfied.",
        "But nobody was as pleased as John Major, stationmaster for the UK presidency, for whom the agreement marked a scarce high point in a battered premiership.",
        "The departure had actually been delayed by seven months by Danes on the line.",
        "Just when that problem was solved, there was the voluble outbreak, orchestrated by Spain, from the poor four passengers demanding that they should travel free and be given spending money, too.",
        "The coupling of the carriages may not be reliably secure but the pan-European express is in motion.",
        "That few seem to agree the destination suggests that future arguments are inevitable at every set of points.",
        "Next stop: Copenhagen.",
        "Apart from an entertaining read, the extended metaphor provides an elaborate conceptual correspondence between a familiar domain of train journeys and the unfolding process of European Eyal Beigman Washington University in St. Louis integration.",
        "Carriages are likened to nation states; passengers to their peoples; treaties to stations; politicians to responsible rail company employees.",
        "In a compact form, the metaphor gives expression to both the small and the large scale of the process.",
        "It provides for the recent history: Denmark's failure to ratify the 1992 Maastricht treaty until opt-outs were negotiated later that year is compared to dissenters sabotaging the journey by laying on the tracks (Danes on the line); negotiations over the Cohesion Fund that would provide less developed regions with financial aid to help them comply with convergence criteria are likened to second class carriages with poor passengers for whom the journey had to be subsidized.",
        "At a more general level, the European integration is a purposeful movement towards some destination according to a worked out plan, getting safely through negotiation and implementation from one treaty to another, as a train moving on its rails through subsequent stations, with each nation being separate yet tied with everyone else.",
        "Numerous inferences regarding speed, timetables, stations, passengers, different classes of tickets, temporary obstacles on the tracks, and so on can be made by the reader based on the knowledge of train journeys, giving him or her a feeling of an enhanced understanding of the highly complex process of European integration.",
        "So apt was the metaphor that political fights were waged over its details (Musolff, 2000).",
        "Worries about destination were given an eloquent expression by Margaret Thatcher (Sunday Times, 20 Sept 1992):",
        "She warned EC leaders to stop their endless round of summits and take notice of their own people.",
        "\"There is a fear that the European train will thunder forward, laden with its customary cargo of gravy, towards a destination neither wished for nor understood by electorates.",
        "But the train can be stopped,\" she said.",
        "The metaphor proved flexible enough for further elaboration.",
        "John Major, a Conservative PM of Britain, spoke on June 1st, 1994 about his vision of the decision making at the EU level, saying that he had never believed that Europe must act as one on every issue, and advocating \"a sensible new approach, varying when it needs to, multitrack, multi-speed, multi-layered.\"",
        "He attempted to turn a largely negative Conservative take on the European train (see Thatcher above) into a tenable positive vision – each nation-carriage is now presumably a rather autonomous entity, waiting on a side track for the right locomotive, in a huge yet smoothly operating railroad system.",
        "Major's political opponents offered their counter-frames.",
        "In both cases, the imagery of a large transportation system was taken up, yet turned around to suggest that \"multi, for everyone\" amounts to Britain being in \"the slow lane,\" and a different image was suggested that makes the negative evaluation of Britain's opt-outs more poignant – a football metaphor, where relegation to the second division is a sign of a weak performance, and a school metaphor, where Britain is portrayed as an under-achiever:",
        "John Cunningham, Labour He has admitted that his Government would let Britain fall behind in Europe.",
        "He is apparently willing to offer voluntary relegation to the second division in Europe, and he isn't even prepared to put up a fight.",
        "I believe that in any two-speed Europe, Britain must be up with those in the fast lane.",
        "Clearly Mr Major does not.",
        "Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat Are you really saying that the best that Britain can hope for under your leadership is ... the slow lane of a two-speed Europe?",
        "Most people in this country will want to aim higher, and will reject your view of a 'drop-out' Britain.",
        "The pro-European camp rallied around the \"Britain in the slow lane\" version as a critical stance towards the government's European policy.",
        "Of the alternative metaphors, the school metaphor has some traction in the Euro discourse, where the European (mainly German) financial officers are compared to school authorities, and governments struggling to meet the strict convergence criteria to enter the Euro are compared to pupils that barely make the grade with Britain as a 'drop-out' who gave up even trying (Musolff, 2000).",
        "The fact that European policy is being communicated and negotiated via a metaphor is not surprising; after all, \"there is always someone willing to help us think by providing us with a metaphor that accords with HIS views.\"",
        "From the point of view of the dynamics of political discourse, the puzzle is rather the apparent tendency of politicians to be compelled by the rival's metaphorical framework.",
        "Thatcher tries to turn the train metaphor used by the pro-EU camp around.",
        "Yet, assuming metaphors are matters of choice, why should Thatcher feel constrained by her rival's choice, why doesn't she ignore it and merely suggest a new metaphor of her own design?",
        "As the evidence above suggests, this is not Thatcher's idiosyncrasy, as Major and his rivals acted similarly.",
        "Can this dynamic be explained?",
        "In this article, we use the explanatory framework of game theory, seeking to rationalize the observed behavior by designing a game that would produce, at equilibrium, the observed dynamics.",
        "Specifically, we formalize the notion that the price of \"locking\" the public into a metaphorical frame of reference is that a politician is coerced into staying within the metaphor as well, even if he or she is at the receiving end of a rival's rhetorical move.",
        "Since the use of game theory is not common in computational linguistics, we first explain its main attributes, justify our decision to make use of it, and draw connections to research questions that can benefit from its application (section 2).",
        "Next, we design the game of bargaining over a metaphor, and find its equilibrium (section 3), followed by a discussion (section 4)."

        "The basic construct is that of a game, that is, a model of participants in an interaction (called \"players\"), their goals (or \"utilities\") and allowable moves.",
        "Different moves yield different utilities for a player; it is assumed that each player would pick a strategy that maximizes her utility.",
        "The observable is the actual sequence of moves; importantly, these are assumed to be the optimal outcome (an equilibrium) of the relevant game.",
        "A popular notion of equilibrium is Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950).",
        "For extensive form games (the type employed in this paper), the notion of subgame perfect equilibirum is typically used, denoting a Nash equilibrium that would remain such if the players start from any stage of the evolving game (Selten (1975; 1965)).",
        "The task of a game theorist is to reverse-engineer the model for which the observed sequence of actions is an equilibrium.",
        "The resulting model is thereby able to rationalize the observed behavior as a naturally emerging dynamics between agents maximizing certain utility functions.",
        "In economics, game-theoretic models are used to explain price change, organization of production, and market failures (Mas-Colell et al., 1995; von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944); in biology – the operation of natural selection processes (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Maynard Smith and Price, 1973); in social sciences – political institutions, collective action, and conflict (Greif, 2006; Schelling, 1997; North, 1990).",
        "In recent applications in linguistics, pragmatic phenoma such as implicatures are rendered as an equilibrium outcome of a communication game (Jäger and Ebert, 2008; van Rooij, 2008; Ross, 2007; van Rooij and Schulz, 2004; Parikh, 2001; Glazer and Rubinstein, 2001; Dekker and van Rooy, 2000).",
        "Computing equilibria is simple for some games and quite evolved for others.",
        "For example, computing the equilibrium of a zero-sum game is equivalent to LP optimization (Luce and Raiffa, 1957); an equilibrium of general bimatrix games can be found using a pivoting algorithm (von Stengel, 2007; Lemke and Howson, 1964).",
        "Interesting connections have been pointed out between game theory and machine learning: Freund and Schapire (1996) present both online learning and boosting as a repeated zero-sum game; Shalev-Shwartz and Singer (2006) show similarly that loss minimization in online learning is akin to an equilibrium path in a repeated game.",
        "While game theoretic models are not much utilized in computational linguistics, they are quite attractive to tackle some of the problems computational linguists are interested in.",
        "For example, generation of referring expressions (Paraboni and Copestake, 2004; Dale and Reiter, 1995) can be rendered as a communication game with utility functions that reflect pressures to use shorter expressions while avoiding excessive ambiguity (Clark and Parikh, 2007), with corpora annotated for entity mentions informing the design of a model.",
        "Generally, computational linguistics research produces algorithms to detect entities of various kinds, be it topics, named entities, metaphors, moves in a multi-party conversations, or syntactic constructions in large corpora; such primary data can be used to trace developments not only in chronological terms (Gruhl et al., 2004; Allan, 2002), but in strategic terms, i.e. in terms that reflect agendas of the actors, such as political agendas in legislatures (Quinn et al., 2006) or activist forums (Greene and Resnik, 2009), research agendas in group meetings (Morgan et al., 2001), or social agendas in speed-dates (Jurafsky et al., 2009).",

        "In the British context, various configurations of the unfolding European reality are situated along the line between high degree of integration and complete separatism; Liberal Democrats are the most pro-European party, while United Kingdom Independence Party are at the far-right end of the scale, preferring British withdrawal from the EU.",

        "Suppose that initially any state of affairs within the interval [0,1] is assigned a uniform probability and thus merits public attention.",
        "Each in her turn, the players propose to the public to concentrate on a subset of the currently considered states of affairs, arguing that those are the likelier ones to obtain, hence merit further attention.",
        "The metaphor used to deliver the proposal describes the newly proposed subset in a way that makes those states-of-affairs that are in it aligned with the metaphor, whereas all other states are left out of the proposed metaphorical frame.",
        "As the game proceeds, the public attention is concentrated on successively smaller sets of eventualities, and these are given a more and more detailed metaphoric description, providing the educational gratification of increasingly knowing better and better what is going on.",
        "At each step, each player strives to provide maximum public gratification while leading the public to focus on the frame (i.e. subset of states of affairs) that best meets the player's preferences.",

        "We show, assuming the peak of the first mover is to the left of peak of the second, that any deviation of the first mover would enable the second to shift the public frame more to the right, to an outcome of lower utility to the first mover.",

        "This article studies some properties of frame bargaining through metaphor in political communication, where rival politicians choose how to elaborate the current metaphor to educate the public about the ongoing situation in a way most consistent with their political preferences.",
        "Modeling the public preferences as highest relative entropy subset of possible states-of-affairs, we show that strategic choices by the politicians lead to a sub-game perfect equilibrium where the less politically extreme player who moves first is at an advantage.",
        "In a democracy, such player would typically be the government, as the bulk of voters do not by definition vote for extreme views, and since the government is the agent that brings about changes in the current states of affairs, and is thus the first and most prepared to explain them to the public.",
        "Indeed, Entman's model of frame activation in political discourse is hierarchical, with the government (administration) being the topmost frame-activator, and opposition and media elites typically reacting to the administration's frame (Ent-man, 2003).",
        "The role of metaphor in communication has long been a subject of interest, with views ranging from an ornament that beautifies the argument in the ancient rhetorical traditions, to the contemporary views of conceptual metaphor as permeating every aspect of life (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980).",
        "In political communication specifically, metaphor has long been known as a framing device.",
        "Framing can be defined as \"selecting and highlighting some facets of events or issues, and making connections among them in order to promote a particular interpretation, evaluation, or solution\" (Entman, 2003).",
        "Metaphors are notorious for allowing subliminal framing, where the metaphor seems so natural that the aspects of the phenomenon in question that do not align with the metaphor are seamlessly concealed.",
        "For example, war as a competitive game metaphor emphasizes the glory of winning and the shame of defeat, but hides the death-and-suffering aspect of the war, which makes sports metaphors a strategic choice when wishing to arouse a pro-war sentiment in the audience (Lakoff, 1991).",
        "such subliminal framing can often be effectively contested by merely exposing the frame.",
        "our examples show a different use of metaphor.",
        "Far from being subliminal or covert, the details of the metaphor, its implications, and the evaluation promoted by any given version are an important tool in the public discussion of a complex political issue.",
        "The function of metaphorical framing here resembles a pedagogical one, where rendering an abstract theory in physics (such as electricity) in concrete commonsensical terms (such as water flow) is an effective strategy to enhance the students' understanding of the former (Gentner and Gentner, 1983).",
        "The measure of success for a given version of the frame is its ability to sway the public in the evaluative direction envisioned by the author by providing sufficient educational benefit, so-to-speak, that is, convincingly rendering a good portion of a complex reality in accessible terms.",
        "once a frame is found that provides extensive education benefit, such as the European integration as train journey above, a politician's attempt to debunk a metaphor as inappropriate risk public antagonism, as this would be akin to taking the benefit of enhanced understanding away.",
        "Thus, rather than contesting the validity of the metaphoric frame, politicians strive to find a way to turn the metaphor around, i.e. accept the general framework, but focus on a previously unexplored aspect that would lead to a different evaluative tilt.",
        "Our results show that being the first to use an effective metaphor that manages to lock the public in its framework is a strategic advantage as the need to communicate with the same public would compel the rival to take up the metaphor of your choice.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first explanation of the use of extended metaphor in political communication on a complex issue in terms of the agendas of the rival parties and the changing disposition of the public being addressed.",
        "it is an open question whether similar \"locking in\" of the public can be attained by non-metaphorical means, and whether the ensuing dynamics would be similar.",
        "This article contributes to the growing literature on modeling social linguistic behavior, like debates (somasundaran and wiebe, 2009), dating (Juraf-sky et al., 2009; Ranganath et al., 2009), collaborative authoring and editing in wikis (Leuf and cunningham, 2001) such as wikipedia (vuong et al., 2008; Kittur et al., 2007; Viegas et al., 2004).",
        "The latter literature in particular sees the social activity as an unfolding process, for example, detecting the onset and resolution of a controversy over the content of a wikipedia article through tracking article talk and deletion-and-reversion patterns.",
        "somewhat similarly to the metaphor debate discussed in this article, Viegas et al.",
        "(2004) note first-mover advantage in Wikipedia authoring, that is, the first version gives the tone for the subsequent edits and has its parts survive for relatively many editing cycles.",
        "Finding out how the initial contribution constrains and guides subsequent edits of the content of a Wikipedia article and what kind of argumentative strategies are employed in persuading others to retain one's contribution is an interesting direction for future research.",
        "A number of recent studies of the linguistic aspects of social processes are construed as if the events are taking place all-at-once – there is no differentiation between early and later stages of a debate in somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) or initial and subsequent speed-dates for the same subject in Jurafsky et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Yet adopting a dynamic perspective stands to reason in such cases.",
        "For example, somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) built a system for recognizing stance in an online debate (such as pro-iPhone or pro-Blackberry on http://www.covinceme.net).",
        "They noticed that the task was complicated by concessions – acknowledgments of some virtues of the competitor before stating own preference.",
        "This is quite possibly an instance of debate dynamics whereby as the debate evolves certain common ground emerges between the sides and the focus of the debate changes from the initial stage of elucidating which features are better in which product to a stage where the \"facts\" are settled and acknowledged by both sides and the debate moves to evaluation of the relative importance of those features.",
        "As another example, consider the construction of statistical models of various emotional and personality traits based on a corpus of speed dates such as Jurafsky et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Take the trait of intelligence.",
        "in their experiment with speed-dates, Fisman et al.",
        "(2006) found that males tend to dis-prefer females they perceive as more intelligent or ambitious than themselves.",
        "consequently, an intelligent female might choose to act less intelligent in later rounds of speed dating if she has not so far met a sufficiently intelligent male, assuming she prefers a less-intelligent male to no match at all.",
        "Better sensitivity to the dynamics of social processes underlying the observed linguistic communication will we believe result in increased interest in game-theoretic models, as these are especially well suited to handle cases where the sides have certain goals and adapt their moves based on the current situations, the other side's move, and possibly other considerations, such as the need to address effectively a wider audience, beyond the specific interlocutors.",
        "A game theoretic explanation advances the understanding of the process being modeled, and hence of the applicability, and the potential adaptation, of statistical models developed on a certain dataset to situations that differ somewhat from the original data: For example, a corpus with more rounds of speed-dates per participant might suddenly make females seem smarter, or a debate with a longer history would feature more, and perhaps more elaborate, concessions."

        "The tasks that have been addressed are explication of the reasoning behind the metaphor (Barnden et al., 2002; Narayanan, 1999; Hobbs, 1992); detection of conventional metaphors between two specific domains (Mason, 2004); classification of words, phrases or sentences as metaphoric or non-metaphoric (Krishna-kumaran and Zhu, 2007; Birke and Sarkar, 2006;",
        "Gedigian et al., 2006; Fass, 1991).",
        "We are not aware of research on automatic methods specifically geared to recognition of extended metaphors.",
        "indeed, most computational work cited above concentrates on the detection of a local incongruity due to a violation ofselectional restrictions when the verb or one of its arguments is used metaphorically (as in Protesters derailed the conference).",
        "Extended metaphors are expected to be difficult for such approaches, since many of the clauses are completely situated in the source domain and hence no local incongruities exist (see examples on the first page of this article).",
        "supervised approaches to metaphor detection need to rely on annotated data.",
        "While metaphors are ubiquitous in language, an annotation project that seeks to narrow the scope of relevant metaphors down to metaphors from a particular source domain (such as train journeys) that describe a particular target domain (such as European integration) and are uttered by certain entities (such as senior uK politicians) face the problem of sparsity of the relevant data in the larger discourse: A random sample of the size amenable to human annotation is unlikely to capture in sufficient detail material pertaining to the one metaphor ofinterest.",
        "To increase the likelihood of finding mentions of the source domain, a lexicon of words from the source domain can be used to select documents (Hardie et al., 2007; Gedigian et al., 2006).",
        "Another approach is metaphor \"harvesting\" hypothesizing that metaphors of interest would occur in close proximity to lexical items representing the target domain of the metaphor, such as the 4 word window around the lemma Europe used in Reining and Lonneker-Rodman (2007).",

        "(2008) report k=0.66 for detecting paragraphs containing metaphors from the source domains love and vehicle with multiple non-expert annotators, though other source domains that often feature highly conventionalized metaphors (like structure or foundation from buildling domain) or are more abstract and difficult to delimit (such as authority) present a more challenging annotation task.",
        "A fully empirical basis for the kind of model presented in this paper would also involve defining a metric on metaphors that would allow measuring the frame chosen by the given version of the metaphor relatively to other such frames - that is, quantifying which part of the \"integration is a train journey\" metaphor is covered by those states of affairs that also fit Thatcher's critical rendition."

        "This article addressed a specific communicative setting (rival politicians trying to \"sell\" to the public their versions of the unfolding realities and necessary policies) and a specific linguistic tool (an extended metaphor), showing that the particular use made of metaphor in such setting can be rationalized based on the characteristics of the setting.",
        "Various questions now arise.",
        "Given the central role played by the public gratification constraint in our model, would conversational situations without the need to persuade the public, such as meetings of small groups of peers or phone conversations between friends, tend less to the use of extended metaphor?",
        "Conversely, does the use of extended metaphor in other settings testify to the existence of presumed onlookers who need to be \"captured\" in a particular version of reality – as in pedagogic or poetic context?",
        "Considerations of the participants' agendas and their impact on the ensuing dynamics of the exchange would we believe lead to further interest in game theoretic models when addressing complex social dynamics in situations like collaborative authoring, debates, or dating, and will augment the existing mostly statistical approaches with a broader picture of the relevant communication.",

        "For a history h={F0,..., Ft} where Ft=[Zt,rt], let e*(h), player 1's move, be defined as choosing Ft+1=[Zt+1, rt+1] such that |Ft+1|=-^Tp-, and rt+1 is as close as possible to v1.",
        "<t| sets Zt+1 with respect to v2 in a symmetric fashion.",
        "since Ft shrinks by half every round, lim^oo lt=limt^o rt=x*, converging to a point.",
        "We now show (e*, e*) is an equilibrium by showing that neither player has a profitable deviation.",
        "Notice that after the first round the subgame is identical to the initial game with F1 replacing Fo, and the roles of players reversed.",
        "player 2 had no influence on the choice of F1, hence she has a profitable deviation iff she has a profitable deviation on the continuation subgame where she is the first mover.",
        "It thus suffices to show that the first mover (player 1) has no profitable deviations to establish that (er*, cr*) is an equilibrium.",
        "Since by definition always chooses an entropy maximizing segment, for player 1 to choose a non-entropy maximizing segment (more or less than half the length) amounts to yielding the round to player 2, which is equivalent in terms of the resulting accepted frame to a situation where player 1 chooses an entropy maximizing segment - the same one chosen by player 2.",
        "Thus we need to consider only deviations with entropy maximizing frames.",
        "Step 1: Suppose a'1 is a strategy of player 1 and let F0, F1, F2,... be the sequence of frames on the path corresponding to the pair (a^a^)- Let to be the first move deviating from the equilibrium path, namely Fto7^Ft'0.",

        "If player 2 still cannot choose [^2,r£0+1] after the deviation, she would choose the rightmost entropy maximizing segment with ^o+i – ^o+i- If this still allows player 1 to do [^0+2,^i] and hence to lead to v\\ as the outcome, it was possible in [k0+2, v\\] as well, so no profit is gained by having deviated.",
