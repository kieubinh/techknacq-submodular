        "In particular, the kernel methods could be very effective at reducing the burden of feature engineering for structured objects in NLP research (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).",

        "This proves that structural syntactic information has good predication power for discourse analysis in both explicit and implicit relations.",
        "We also observe that among the three syntactic structured features, Min-Expansion and Simple-Expansion achieve similar performances which are better than the result for Full-Expansion.",
        "This may be due to that most significant information is with the arguments and the shortest path connecting connectives and arguments.",
        "However, Full-Expansion that includes more information in other branches may introduce too many details which are rather tangential to discourse recognition.",
        "Our subsequent reports will focus on Simple-Expansion, unless otherwise specified.",
        "As described in Section 5, to compute the structural information, parse trees for different sentences are connected to form a large tree for a paragraph.",
        "It would be interesting to find how the structured information works for discourse relations whose arguments reside in different sentences.",
        "For this purpose, we test the accuracy for discourse relations with the two arguments occurring in the same sentence, one-sentence apart, and two-sentence apart.",
        "Table 3 compares the learning systems with/without the structured feature present.",
        "From the table, for all three cases, the accuracies drop with the increase of the distances between the two arguments.",
        "However, adding the structured information would bring consistent improvement against the baselines regardless of the number of sentence distance.",
        "This observation suggests that the structured syntactic information is more helpful for inter-sentential discourse analysis.",
        "We also concern about how the structured information works for identification and classification respectively.",
        "Table 4 lists the results for the two sub-tasks.",
        "As shown, with the structured information incorporated, the system (Base + Tree Kernel) can boost the performance of the two baselines (Base Features in the first row andBase + Manually selected paths in the second row), for both identification and classification respectively.",
        "We also observe that the structural syntactic information is more helpful for classification task which is generally harder than identification.",
        "This is in line with the intuition that classification is generally a much harder task.",
        "We find that due to the weak modeling of Entity relations, many Entity relations which are non-discourse relation instances are misidentified as implicit Expansion relations.",
        "Nevertheless, it clearly directs our future work.",

        "To examine the effectiveness of our temporal ordering information, we perform experiments on simultaneous identification and classification of level-1 discourse relations to compare with using only base feature set as baseline.",
        "The results are shown in Table 5.",
        "We observe that the use of temporal ordering information increases the accuracy by 3%, 3.6% and 3.2% for Explicit, Implicit and All groups respectively.",
        "We conduct chi square statistical significant test on All relations, which shows the performance improvement is statistical significant (p < 0.05).",

        "The purpose of this paper is to explore how to make use of the structural syntactic knowledge to do discourse relation recognition.",
        "In previous work, syntactic information from parse trees is represented as a set of heuristically selected flat paths or 2-level production rules.",
        "However, the features defined this way may not necessarily capture all useful syntactic information provided by the parse trees for discourse analysis.",
        "In the paper, we propose a kernel-based method to incorporate the structural information embedded in parse trees.",
        "Specifically, we directly utilize the syntactic parse tree as a structure feature, and then apply kernels to such a feature, together with other normal features.",
        "The experimental results on PDTB v2.0 show that our kernel-based approach is able to give statistical significant improvement over flat syntactic path method.",
        "In addition, we also propose to incorporate temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relations, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition, both explicit and implicit.",
        "In future, we plan to model Entity relations which constitute 24% of Implicit+Entity+No relation cases, thus to improve the accuracy of relation detection.",
