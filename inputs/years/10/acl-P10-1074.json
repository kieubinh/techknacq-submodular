        "Joint models can be particularly useful for producing analyses of sentences which are used as input for higher-level, more semantically-oriented systems, such as question answering and machine translation.",
        "These high-level systems typically combine the outputs from many low-level systems, such as parsing, named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution.",
        "When trained separately, these single-task models can produce outputs which are inconsistent with one another, such as named entities which do not correspond to any nodes in the parse tree (see Figure 1 for an example).",
        "Moreover, one expects that the different types of annotations should provide useful information to one another, and that modeling them jointly should improve performance.",
        "Because a named entity should correspond to a node in the parse tree, strong evidence about either aspect of the model should positively impact the other aspect.",
        "However, designing joint models which actually improve performance has proven challenging.",
        "The CoNLL 2008 shared task (Surdeanu et al., 2008) was on joint parsing and semantic role labeling, but the best systems (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) were the ones which completely decoupled the tasks.",

        "One significant limitation for many joint models is the lack of jointly annotated data.",

        "In this paper we presented a novel method for improving joint modeling using additional data which has not been labeled with the entire joint structure.",
        "While conventional wisdom says that adding more training data should always improve performance, this work is the first to our knowledge to incorporate singly-annotated data into a joint model, thereby providing a method for this additional data, which cannot be directly used by the non-hierarchical joint model, to help improve joint modeling performance.",
        "We built single-task models for the non-jointly labeled data, designing those single-task models so that they have features in common with the joint model, and then linked all of the different single-task and joint models via a hierarchical prior.",
        "We performed experiments on joint parsing and named entity recognition, and found that our hierarchical joint model substantially outperformed a joint model which was trained on only the jointly annotated data.",
        "Future directions for this work include automatically learning the variances, dm and d* in the hierarchical model, so that the degree ofinformation sharing between the models is optimized based on the training data available.",
        "We are also interested in ways to modify the objective function to place more emphasis on learning a good joint model, instead of equally weighting the learning of the joint and single-task models."
