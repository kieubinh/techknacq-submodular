      "heading": "1. Introduction and Motivation",
      "text": [
        "Given the need for high-quality dependency parses in applications such as statistical machine translation (Xu et al., 2009), natural language generation (Wan et al., 2009), and text summarization evaluation (Owczarzak, 2009), there is a corresponding need for high-quality dependency annotation, for the training and evaluation of dependency parsers (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "Furthermore, parsing accuracy degrades unless sufficient amounts of labeled training data from the same domain are available (e.g., Gildea, 2001; Sekine, 1997), and thus we need larger and more varied annotated treebanks, covering a wide range ofdomains.",
        "However, there is a bottleneck in obtaining annotation, due to the need for manual intervention in annotating a treebank.",
        "One approach is to develop automatically-parsed corpora (van No-ord and Bouma, 2009), but a natural disadvantage with such data is that it contains parsing errors.",
        "Identifying the most problematic parses for human post-processing could combine the benefits of automatic and manual annotation, by allowing a human annotator to efficiently correct automatic errors.",
        "We thus set out in this paper to detect errors in automatically-parsed data.",
        "If annotated corpora are to grow in scale and retain a high quality, annotation errors which arise from automatic processing must be minimized, as errors have a negative impact on training and evaluation of NLP technology (see discussion and references in Boyd et al., 2008, sec. 1).",
        "There is work on detecting errors in dependency corpus annotation (Boyd et al., 2008), but this is based on finding inconsistencies in annotation for identical recurring strings.",
        "This emphasis on identical strings can result in high precision, but many strings do not recur, negatively impacting the recall of error detection.",
        "Furthermore, since the same strings often receive the same automatic parse, the types of inconsistencies detected are likely to have resulted from manual annotation.",
        "While we can build from the insight that simple methods can provide reliable annotation checks, we need an approach which relies on more general properties of the dependency structures, in order to develop techniques which work for automatically-parsed corpora.",
        "Developing techniques to detect errors in parses in a way which is independent of corpus and parser has fairly broad implications.",
        "By using only the information available in a training corpus, the methods we explore are applicable to annotation error detection for either hand-annotated or automatically-parsed corpora and can also provide insights for parse reranking (e.g., Hall and Novak, 2005) or parse revision (Attardi and Ciaramita, 2007).",
        "Although we focus only on detecting errors in automatically-parsed data, similar techniques have been applied for hand-annotated data (Dickinson, 2008; Dickinson and Foster, 2009).",
        "Our general approach is based on extracting a grammar from an annotated corpus and comparing dependency rules in a new (automatically-annotated) corpus to the grammar.",
        "Roughly speaking, if a dependency rule – which represents all the dependents of a head together (see section 3.1) – does not fit well with the grammar, it is flagged as potentially erroneous.",
        "The methods do not have to be retrained for a given parser's output (e.g.,",
        "Campbell and Johnson, 2002), but work by comparing any tree to what is in the training grammar (cf. also approaches stacking handwritten rules on top of other parsers (Bick, 2007)).",
        "We propose to flag erroneous parse rules, using information which reflects different grammatical properties: POS lookup, bigram information, and full rule comparisons.",
        "We build on a method to detect so-called ad hoc rules, as described in section 2, and then turn to the main approaches in section 3.",
        "After a discussion of a simple way to flag POS anomalies in section 4, we evaluate the different methods in section 5, using the outputs from two different parsers.",
        "The methodology proposed in this paper is easy to implement and independent of corpus, language, or parser."

      "heading": "2. Approach",
      "text": [
        "We take as a starting point two methods for detecting ad hoc rules in constituency annotation (Dickinson, 2008).",
        "Ad hoc rules are CFG productions extracted from a treebank which are \"used for specific constructions and unlikely to be used again,\" indicating annotation errors and rules for ungram-maticalities (see also Dickinson and Foster, 2009).",
        "Each method compares a given CFG rule to all the rules in a treebank grammar.",
        "Based on the number of similar rules, a score is assigned, and rules with the lowest scores are flagged as potentially ad hoc.",
        "This procedure is applicable whether the rules in question are from a new data set – as in this paper, where parses are compared to a training data grammar – or drawn from the treebank grammar itself (i.e., an internal consistency check).",
        "The two methods differ in how the comparisons are done.",
        "First, the bigram method abstracts a rule to its bigrams.",
        "Thus, a rule such as NP – JJ NN provides support for NP – DT JJ JJ NN, in that it shares the JJ NN sequence.",
        "By contrast, in the other method, which we call the whole rule method, a rule is compared in its totality to the grammar rules, using Levenshtein distance.",
        "There is no abstraction, meaning all elements are present – e.g., NP – DT JJ JJ NN is very similar to NP – DT JJ NN because the sequences differ by only one category.",
        "While previously used for constituencies, what is at issue is simply the valency of a rule, where by valency we refer to a head and its entire set of arguments and adjuncts (cf. Przepiorkowski, 2006) – that is, a head and all its dependents.",
        "The methods work because we expect there to be regularities in valency structure in a treebank grammar; nonconformity to such regularities indicates a potential problem."

        "While many of the other rules seem rather spare, they provide useful information, showing categories which have no dependents.",
        "With a TOP rule, we have a rule for every head, including the virtual root.",
        "Thus, we can find anomalous rules such as TOP – root ROOT:AV ROOT:NN, where multiple categories have been parsed as ROOT.",
        "In comparing rules, we are trying to find evidence that a particular (parsed) rule is valid by examining the evidence from the (training) grammar.",
        "Units of comparison To determine similarity, one can compare dependency relations, POS tags, or both.",
        "Valency refers to both properties, e.g., verbs which allow verbal (POS) subjects (dependency).",
        "Thus, we use the pairs of dependency relations and POS tags as the units of comparison.",
        "Flagging individual elements Previous work scored only entire rules, but some dependencies are problematic and others are not.",

        "The head POS thus seems to be predictive of a rule's valency.",
        "But we might lose information by ignoring rules with the same left-hand side (LHS).",
        "Our approach is thus to take the greater value of scores when comparing to rules either with the same dependency relation or with the same head.",
        "A rule has multiple chances to prove its value, and low scores will only be for rules without any type of support.",
        "Taking these points together, for a given rule of interest r, we assign a score (S) to each element eiin r, where r = e\\...em by taking the maximum of scores for rules with the same head (h) or same LHS (Iks), as in (3).",

        "In practice, one way to use these methods is to start with the lowest thresholds and work upwards until there are too many non-errors.",
        "To establish a basis for comparison, we compare method performance to a parser on its own.",

        "Dependency elements with frequency below the lowest threshold have lower attachment scores (66.6% vs. 90.1% LAS), showing that simply using a complete rule helps sort dependencies.",
        "However, frequency thresholds have fairly low precision, i.e., 33.4% at their best.",
        "The whole rule and bigram methods reveal greater precision in identifying problematic dependencies, isolating elements with lower UAS and LAS scores than with frequency, along with corresponding greater precision and F-scores.",
        "The bigram method is more fine-grained, identifying small numbers of rule elements at each threshold, resulting in high error detection precision.",
        "With a threshold of 39, for example, we find over a quarter of the parser errors with 62% precision, from this one piece of information.",
        "For POS information, we flag 23.6% of the cases with over 60% precision (at 81.6).",
        "Taking all these results together, we can begin to sort more reliable from less reliable dependency tree elements, using very simple information.",
        "Additionally, these methods naturally group cases together by linguistic properties (e.g., adverbialverb dependencies within a particualr context), allowing a human to uncover the principle behind parse failure and ajudicate similar cases at the same time (cf. Wallis, 2003).",
        "Examining some of the output from the Talbanken test data by hand, we find that a prominent cause of false positives, i.e., correctly-parsed cases with low scores, stems from low-frequency dependency-POS label pairs.",
        "If the dependency rarely occurs in the training data with the particular POS, then it receives a low score, regardless of its context.",

        "For Alpino, error detection is better with frequency than, for example, bigram scores.",
        "This is likely due to the fact that Alpino has the smallest label set of any of the corpora, with only 24 dependency labels and 12 POS tags (cf. 64 and 41 in Talbanken, respectively).",
        "With a smaller label set, there are less possible bigrams that could be anomalous, but more reliable statistics about a whole rule.",
        "Likewise, with fewer possible POS tag pairs, Alpino has lower precision for the low-threshold POS scores than the other corpora.",
        "For the whole rule scores, the DDT data is worse (compare its 46.1% precision withBosque's 45.6%, with vastly different recall values), which could be due to the smaller training data.",
        "One might also consider the qualitative differences in the dependency inventory of DDT compared to the others – e.g., appositions, distinctions in names, and more types of modifiers.",
        "Turning to the results of running the methods on the output of MSTParser, we find similar but slightly worse values for the whole rule and bigram methods, as shown in tables 5-8.",
        "What is most striking are the differences in the POS-based method for Bosque and DDT (tables 7 and 8), where a large percentage of the test corpus is underneath the threshold.",
        "MSTParser is apparently positing fewer distinct head-dependent pairs, as most of them fall under the given thresholds.",
        "With the exception of the POS-based method for DDT (where LASb is actually higher than LAS«) the different methods seem to be accurate enough to be used as part of corpus post-editing.",

        "Using these methods, we demonstrated success in sorting well-formed output from erroneous output across language, corpora, and parsers.",
        "Given that the rule representations and comparison methods use both POS and dependency information, a next step in evaluating and improving the methods is to examine automatically POS-tagged data.",
        "Our methods should be able to find POS errors in addition to dependency errors.",
        "Furthermore, although we have indicated that differences in accuracy can be linked to differences in the granularity and particular distinctions of the annotation scheme, it is still an open question as to which methods work best for which schemes and for which constructions (e.g., coordination)."
