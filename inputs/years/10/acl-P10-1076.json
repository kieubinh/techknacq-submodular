        "Recent research on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has achieved substantial progress.",
        "Many SMT frameworks have been developed, including phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2005), syntax-based SMT (Eisner, 2003; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Galley et al., 2006; Cowan et al., 2006), etc.",
        "With the emergence of various structurally different SMT systems, more and more studies are focused on combining multiple SMT systems for achieving higher translation accuracy rather than using a single translation system.",
        "The basic idea of system combination is to extract or generate a translation by voting from an ensemble of translation outputs.",
        "Depending on how the translation is combined and what voting strategy is adopted, several methods can be used for system combination, e.g. sentence-level combination (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008) simply selects one from original translations, while some more sophisticated methods, such as wordlevel and phrase-level combination (Matusov et al., 2006; Rosti et al., 2007), can generate new translations differing from any of the original translations.",
        "One of the key factors in SMT system combination is the diversity in the ensemble of translation outputs (Macherey and Och, 2007).",
        "To obtain diversified translation outputs, most of the current system combination methods require multiple translation engines based on different models.",
        "However, this requirement cannot be met in many cases, since we do not always have the access to multiple SMT engines due to the high cost of developing and tuning SMT systems.",
        "To reduce the burden of system development, it might be a nice way to combine a set of translation systems built from a single translation engine.",
        "A key issue here is how to generate an ensemble of diversified translation systems from a single translation engine in a principled way.",
        "Addressing this issue, we propose a boosting-based system combination method to learn a combined translation system from a single SMT engine.",
        "In this method, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner.",

        "Given a source string f, the goal of SMT is to find a target string e by the following equation.",
        "where Pr(e | f ) is the probability that e is the translation of the given source string f To model the posterior probability Pr(e | f ) , most of the state-of-the-art SMT systems utilize the loglinear model proposed by Och and Ney (2002), as follows, where {hm( f e ) | m = 1, M} is a set of features, and Xm is the feature weight corresponding to the m-th feature.",
        "hm( f, e) can be regarded as a function that maps every pair of source string f and target string e into a non-negative value, and Xm can be viewed as the contribution of hm( f e ) to the overall score Pr(e| f) .",
        "In this paper, u denotes a log-linear model that has M fixed features {h;( f ,e ), hM( f ,e )}, X = {Xi, XM} denotes the M parameters of u, and u(X) denotes a SMT system based on u with parameters X.",
        "Generally, X is trained on a training data set to obtain an optimized weight vector X* and consequently an optimized system u(X ).",
        "3 Boosting-based System Combination for Single Translation Engine",
        "Suppose that there are T available SMT systems {u1(X 1), uT(X T)}, the task of system combination is to build a new translation system v(ui(X*i), ..... ut(X*t)) from {ui(X*i), ut(X*t)}.",
        "Here v(u1(X 1), uT(X T)) denotes the combination system which combines translations from the ensemble of the output of each ui(X i).",
        "We call ui(X i) a member system of v(u1(X 1), uT(X T)).",
        "As discussed in Section 1, the diversity among the outputs of member systems is an important factor to the success of system combination.",
        "To obtain diversified member systems, traditional methods concentrate more on using structurally different member systems, that is u1+ u2 =h uT.",
        "However, this constraint condition cannot be satisfied when multiple translation engines are not available.",
        "In this paper, we argue that the diversified member systems can also be generated from a single engine u(X ) by adjusting the weight vector X in a principled way.",
        "In this work, we assume that u1 = u2 =...= uT = u.",
        "Our goal is to find a series of X i and build a combined system from {u(X To achieve this goal, we propose a boosting-based system combination method (Figure 1).",
        "Like other boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997; Schapire, 2001), the basic idea of this method is to use weak systems (member systems) to form a strong system (combined system) by repeatedly calling weak system trainer on different distributions over the training samples.",
        "However, since most of the boosting algorithms are designed for the classification problem that is very different from the translation problem in natural language processing, several key components have to be redesigned when boosting is adapted to SMT system combination.",
        "In this work, Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) proposed by Och (2003) is used to estimate feature weights X over a series of training samples.",
        "As in other state-of-the-art SMT systems, BLEU is selected as the accuracy measure to define the error function used in MERT.",
        "Since the weights of training samples are not taken into account in BLEU, we modify the original definition of BLEU to make it sensitive to the distribution Dt(i) over the training samples.",
        "The modified version of BLEU is called weighted BLEU (WBLEU) in this paper.",
        "Let E = ei ... em be the translations produced by the system, R = r1 ... rm be the reference translations where ri = {ri1, riN}, and Dt(i) be the weight of the i-th training sample f, ri).",
        "The weighted BLEU metric has the following form:",
        "WBLEU(E, R ) where gn ( s) is the multi-set of all n-grams in a string s. In this definition, n-grams in ei and {riJ} are weighted by Dt(i).",
        "If the i-th training sample has a larger weight, the corresponding n-grams will have more contributions to the overall score WBLEU(E, R) .",
        "As a result, the i-th training sample gains more importance in MERT.",
        "Obviously the original BLEU is just a special case of WBLEU when all the training samples are equally weighted.",
        "As the weighted BLEU is used to measure the translation accuracy on the training set, the error rate is defined to be:",
        "Another key point is the maintaining of the distribution Dt(i) over the training set.",
        "Initially all the weights of training samples are set equally.",
        "On each round, we increase the weights of the samples that are relatively poorly translated by the current weak system so that the MERT-based trainer can focus on the hard samples in next round.",
        "The update rule is given in Equation 4 with two parameters at and li in it.",
        "at can be regarded as a measure of the importance that the t-th weak system gains in boosting.",
        "The definition of at guarantees that at always has a positive value.",
        "A main effect of at is to scale the weight updating (e.g. a larger at means a greater update).",
        "li is the loss on the i-th sample.",
        "For each i, let { eii, ... , ein} be the n-best translation candidates produced by the system.",
        "The loss function is defined to be:",
        "where BLEU(e j, ri) is the smoothed sentence-level BLEU score (Liang et al., 2006) of the translation e with respect to the reference translations ri, and et is the oracle translation which is selected from {ei1, ein} in terms of BLEU(eij, ri).",
        "li can be viewed as a measure of the average cost that we guess the top-k translation candidates instead of the oracle translation.",
        "The value of li counts for the magnitude of weight update, that is, a larger li means a larger weight update on Dt(i).",
        "The definition of the loss function here is similar to the one used in (Chiang et al., 2008) where only the top-1 translation candidate (i.e. k =1)is taken into account.",

        "The final translation is generated from H(v) based on the following scoring function:",
        "where <f>t (e) is the log-scaled model score of e in the t-th member system, and ßt is the corresponding feature weight.",
        "It should be noted that e e Hi may not exist in any Hi' # i.",
        "In this case, we can still calculate the model score of e in any other member systems, since all the member systems are based on the same model and share the same feature space.",
        "y(e, H (v)) is a consensus-based scoring function which has been successfully adopted in SMT system combination (Duan et al., 2009; Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008; Li et al., 2009).",

        "If more than one member systems share the same translation hypothesis, we just need to compute the corresponding feature values only once, instead of repeating the computation in individual decoders.",
        "In our experiments, we find that over 60% translation hypotheses can be shared among member systems when the number of member systems is over 4.",
        "This result indicates that promising speed improvement can be achieved by using the joint decoding and hypothesis sharing techniques.",
        "Another method to speed up the system is to accelerate n-gram language model with n-gram caching techniques.",

        "As shown in Table 1, Baseline+600best obtains stable improvements over Baseline.",
        "It indicates that the access to larger n-best lists is helpful to improve the performance of baseline systems.",
        "However, the improvements achieved by Base-line+600best are modest compared to the improvements achieved by Boosting-30Iterations.",
        "These results indicate that the SMT systems can benefit more from the diversified outputs of member systems rather than from larger n-best lists produced by a single system.",
        "We also study the change of diversity among the outputs of member systems during iterations.",
        "The diversity is measured in terms of the Translation Error Rate (TER) metric proposed in (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "A higher TER score means that more edit operations are performed if we transform one translation output into another",
        "Diversity on MT06 (test)",
        "iteration number Figure 9: Diversity on the test set of MT06",
        "translation output, and thus reflects a larger diversity between the two outputs.",
        "In this work, the TER score for a given group of member systems is calculated by averaging the TER scores between the outputs of each pair of member systems in this group.",
        "Figures 6-9 show the curves of diversity on the development and test sets, where the X-axis is the iteration number, and the Y-axis is the diversity.",
        "The points at iteration 1 stand for the diversities of baseline systems.",
        "In this work, the baseline's diversity is the TER score of the group of baseline candidates that are generated in advance (Section 5.1).",
        "We see that the diversities of all the systems increase during iterations in most cases, though a few drops occur at a few points.",
        "It indicates that our method is very effective to generate diversified member systems.",
        "In addition, the diversities of baseline systems (iteration 1) are much lower",
        "iteration number Figure 6: Diversity on the development set",
        "than those of the systems generated by boosting (iterations 2-30).",
        "Together with the results shown in Figures 2-5, it confirms our motivation that the diversified translation outputs can lead to performance improvements over the baseline systems.",
        "Also as shown in Figures 6-9, the diversity of the Hiero system is much lower than that of the phrase-based and syntax-based systems at each individual setting of iteration number.",
        "This interesting finding supports the observation that the performance of the Hiero system is relatively more stable than the other two systems as shown in Figures 2-5.",
        "The relative lack of diversity in the Hiero system might be due to the spurious ambiguity in Hiero derivations which generally results in very few different translations in translation outputs (Chiang, 2007).",
        "In this set of experiments, we evaluate the oracle performance on the «-best lists of the baseline systems and the combined systems generated by boosting-based system combination.",
        "Our primary goal here is to study the impact of our method on the upper-bound performance.",
        "Table 2 shows the results, where Base-line+600best stands for the top-600 translation candidates generated by the baseline systems, and Boosting-30iterations stands for the ensemble of30 member systems' top-20 translation candidates.",
        "As expected, the oracle performance of Boosting-30Iterations is significantly higher than that of Baseline+600best.",
        "This result indicates that our method can provide much \"better\" translation candidates for system combination than enlarging the size of n-best list naively.",
        "It also gives us a rational explanation for the significant improvements achieved by our method as shown in Section 5.3.",
        "Related Work (Freund, 1995; Freund and Schapire, 1997; Collins et al., 2002; Rudin et al., 2007), and has been successfully adopted in natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as document classification (Schapire and Singer, 2000) and named entity classification (Collins and Singer, 1999).",
        "However, most of the previous work did not study the issue of how to improve a single SMT engine using boosting algorithms.",
        "To our knowledge, the only work addressing this issue is (Lagarda and Casacuberta, 2008) in which the boosting algorithm was adopted in phrase-based SMT.",
        "However, Lagarda and Casacuberta (2008) 's method calculated errors over the phrases that were chosen by phrase-based systems, and could not be applied to many other SMT systems, such as hierarchical phrase-based systems and syntax-based systems.",
        "Differing from Lagarda and Casacuberta's work, we are concerned more with proposing a general framework which can work with most of the current SMT models and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness on various SMT systems.",
        "There are also some other studies on building diverse translation systems from a single translation engine for system combination.",
        "The first attempt is (Macherey and Och, 2007).",
        "They empirically showed that diverse translation systems could be generated by changing parameters at early-stages of the training procedure.",
        "Following Macherey and Och (2007)'s work, Duan et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a feature subspace method to build a group of translation systems from various different sub-models of an existing SMT system.",
        "However, Duan et al.",
        "(2009)'s method relied on the heuristics used in feature subspace selection.",
        "For example, they used the remove-one-feature strategy and varied the order of n-gram language model to obtain a satisfactory group of diverse systems.",
        "Compared to Duan et al.",
        "(2009)'s method, a main advantage of our method is that it can be applied to most of the SMT systems without designing any heuristics to adapt it to the specified systems.",

        "Boosting is a machine learning (ML) method that has been well studied in the ML community",
        "Actually the method presented in this paper is doing something rather similar to Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) methods.",
