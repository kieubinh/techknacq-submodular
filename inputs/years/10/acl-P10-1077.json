        "Automatic genre identification (AGI) can be traced to the mid-1990s (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997), but this research became much more active in recent years, partly because of the explosive growth of the Web, and partly because of the importance of making genre distinctions in NLP applications.",
        "In Information Retrieval, given the large number of web pages on any given topic, it is often difficult for the users to find relevant pages that are in the right genre (Vidulin et al., 2007).",
        "As for other applications, the accuracy of many tasks, such as machine translation, POS tagging (Giesbrecht and Evert, 2009) or identification of discourse relations (Webber, 2009) relies of defining the language model suitable for the genre of a given text.",
        "For example, the accuracy of POS tagging reaching 96.9% on newspaper texts drops down to 85.7% on forums (Giesbrecht and Evert, 2009), i.e., every seventh word in forums is tagged incorrectly.",
        "This interest in genres resulted in a proliferation of studies on corpus development of web genres and comparison of methods for AGI.",
        "The two corpora commonly used for this task are KI-04 (Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004) and San-tinis (Santini, 2007).",
        "The best results reported for these corpora (with 10-fold cross-validation) reach 84.1% on KI-04 and 96.5% accuracy on Santinis (Kanaris and Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "In our research (Sharoff et al., 2010) we produced even better results on these two benchmarks (85.8% and 97.1%, respectively).",
        "However, this impressive accuracy is not realistic in vivo, i.e., in classifying web pages retrieved as a result of actual queries.",
        "One reason comes from the limited number of genres present in these two collections (eight genres in KI-04 and seven in Santinis).",
        "As an example, only front pages of online newspapers are listed in San-tinis, but not actual newspaper articles, so once an article is retrieved, it cannot be assigned to any class at all.",
        "Another reason why the high accuracy is not useful concerns the limited number of sources in each collection, e.g., all FAQs in Santi-nis come from either a website with FAQs on hurricanes or another one with tax advice.",
        "In the end, a classifier built for FAQs on this training data relies on a high topic-genre correlation in this particular collection and fails to spot any other FAQs.",
        "There are other corpora, which are more diverse in the range of their genres, such as the fifteen genres of the Brown Corpus (Kucera and Francis, 1967) or the seventy genres of the BNC (Lee, 2001), but because of the number of genres in them and the diversity of documents within each genre, the accuracy of prior work on these collections is much less impressive.",
        "For example, Karl-gren and Cutting (1994) using linear discriminant analysis achieve an accuracy of 52% without using cross-validation (the entire Brown Corpus was used as both the test set and training set), with the accuracy improving to 65% when the 15 genres are collapsed into 10, and to 73% with only 4 genres (Figure 1).",
        "This result suggests the importance of the hierarchy of genres.",
        "Firstly, making a decision on higher levels might be easier than on lower levels (fiction or non-fiction rather than science fiction or mystery).",
        "Secondly, we might be able to improve the accuracy on lower levels, by taking into account the relevant position of each node in the hierarchy (distinguishing between reportage or editorial becomes easier when we know they are safely under the category of press).",
        "This paper explores a way of using information on the hierarchy of labels for improving fine-grained genre classification.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work presenting structural genre classification and distance measures for genres.",
        "In Section 2 we present a structural reformulation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that can take similarities between different genres into account.",
        "This formulation necessitates the development of distance measures between different genres in a hierarchy, of which we present three different types in Section 3, along with possible estimation procedures for these distances.",
        "We present experiments with these novel structural SVMs and distance measures on three different corpora in Section 4.",
        "Our experiments show that structural SVMs can outperform the non-structural standard.",
        "However, the improvement is only statistically significant on the Brown corpus.",
        "In Section 5 we investigate potential reasons for this, including the (im)balance of different genre hierarchies and problems with our distance measures."

        "Discriminative methods are often used for classification, with SVMs being a well-performing method in many tasks (Boser et al., 1992; Joachims, 1999).",
        "Linear SVMs on a flat list of labels achieve high efficiency and accuracy in text classification when compared to nonlinear SVMs or other state-of-the-art methods.",
        "As for structural output learning, a few SVM-based objective functions have been proposed, including margin formulation for hierarchical learning (Dekel et al., 2004) or general structural learning (Joachims et al., 2009; Tsochantaridis et al., 2005).",
        "But many implementations are not publicly available, and their scalability to real-life text classification tasks is unknown.",
        "Also they have not been applied to genre classification.",
        "Our formulation can be taken as a special instance of the structural learning framework in (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005).",
        "However, they concentrate on more complicated label structures as for sequence alignment or parsing.",
        "They proposed two formulations, slack-rescaling and margin-rescaling, claiming that margin-rescaling has two disadvantages.",
        "First, it potentially gives significant weight to output values that might not be easily confused with the target values, because every increase in the loss increases the required margin.",
        "However, they did not provide empirical evidence for this claim.",
        "Second, margin rescaling is not necessarily invariant to the scaling of the distance matrix.",
        "We still used margin-rescaling because it allows us to use the sequential dual method for large-scale implementation (Keerthi et al., 2008), which is not applicable to the slack-rescaling formulation.",
        "For web page classification we will need fast processing.",
        "In addition, we performed model calibration to address the second disadvantage (distance matrix invariance).",
        "Let x be a document and wm a weight vector associated with the genre class m in a corpus with k genres at the most fine-grained level.",
        "The predicted class is the class achieving the maximum inner product between x and the weight vector for the class, denoted as, argmax wmx, Vm.",
        "Accurate prediction requires that when a document vector is multiplied with the weight vector associated with its own class, the resulting inner product should be larger than its inner products with a weight vector for any other genre class m. This helps us to define criteria for weight vectors.",
        "Let xj be the i â€“ th training document, and yj its genre label.",
        "For its weight vector wyi, the inner product wT xj should be larger than all other products X, that is,",
        "To strengthen the constraints, the zero value on the right hand side of the inequality for the flat SVM can be replaced by a positive value, corresponding to a distance measure h(yj, m) between two genre classes, leading to the following constraint:",
        "To allow feasible models, in real scenarios such constraints can be violated, but the degree of violation is expected to be small.",
        "For each document, the maximum violation in the k constraints is of interest, as given by the following loss term:",
        "Adding up all loss terms over all training documents, and further introducing a term to penalize large values in the weight vectors, we have the following objective function (C is a user-specified nonnegative parameter).",
        "Efficient methods can be derived by borrowing the sequential dual methods in (Keerthi et al., 2008) or other optimization techniques (Crammer and",

        "The structural SVM (Section 2) requires a distance measure h between two genres.",
        "We can derive such distance measures from the genre hierarchy in a way similar to word similarity measures that were invented for lexical hierarchies such as WordNet (see (Pedersen et al., 2007) for an overview).",
        "In the following, we will first shortly summarise path-based and information-based measures for similarity.",
        "However, information-based measures are based on the information content of a node in a hierarchy.",
        "Whereas the information content of a word or concept in a lexical hierarchy has been well-defined (Resnik, 1995), it is less clear how to estimate the information content of a genre label.",
        "We will therefore discuss several different ways ofestimat-ing information content of nodes in a genre hierarchy.",
        "If genre labels are organised into a tree (Figure 1), one of the simplest ways to measure distance between two genre labels (= tree nodes) is path length (h(a, b)pien):",
        "where a and b are two nodes in the tree, LCS(a, b) is their Least Common Subsumer, and f(a, LCS(a, b)) is the number of levels passed through when traversing from a to the ancestral node LCS(a, b).",
        "In other words, the distance counts the numberofedges traversed from nodes a to b in the tree.",
        "For example, the distance between Learned and Misc in Figure 1 would be 3.",
        "As an alternative, the maximum path length h(a, b)pmax to their least common subsumer can be used to reduce the range of possible values:",
        "The Leacock & Chodorow similarity measure (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) normalizes the path length measure (6) by the maximum number of nodes D when traversing down from the root.",
        "To convert it into a distance measure, we can invert it h(a, b)pisk = 1/s(a, b)pisk.",
        "Other path-length based measures include the Wu & Palmer Similarity (Wu and Palmer, 1994).",
        "where R describes the hierarchy's root node.",
        "Here similarity is proportional to the shared path from the root to the least common subsumer of two nodes.",
        "Since the Wu & Palmer similarity is always between [0 1), we can convert it into a distance measure by h(a, b)pWUpai = 1 â€“ s(a, b)pWUpai.",
        "Path-based distance measures work relatively well on balanced hierarchies such as the one in Figure 1 but fail to treat hierarchies with different levels of granularity well.",
        "For lexical hierarchies, as a result, several distance measures based on information content have been suggested where the information content of a concept c in a hierarchy is measured by (Resnik, 1995)",
        "The frequency freq of a concept c is the sum of the frequency of the node c itself and the frequencies of all its subnodes.",
        "Since the root may be a dummy concept, its frequency is simply the sum of the frequencies of all its subnodes.",
        "The similarity between two nodes can then be defined as the information content of their least common sub-sumer:",
        "If two nodes just share the root as their subsumer, their similarity will be zero.",

        "Several other similarity measures have been proposed based on the Resnik similarity such as the one by (Lin, 1998):",

        "Genre Frequency based on Document Occurrence.",
        "We can interpret the \"frequency\" of a genre node simply as the number of all documents belonging to that genre (including any of its subgenres).",
        "Unfortunately, there are no estimates for genre frequencies on, for example, a representative sample of web documents.",
        "Therefore, we approximate genre frequencies from the document frequencies (dfs) in the training sets used in classification.",
        "Note that (i) for balanced class distributions this information will not be helpful and (ii) that this is a relatively poor substitute for an estimation on an independent, representative corpus.",
        "Genre Frequency based on Genre Labels.",
        "We can also use the labels/names of the genre nodes as the unit of frequency estimation.",
        "Then, the frequency of a genre node is the occurrence frequency of its label in a corpus plus the occurrence frequencies of the labels of all its subnodes.",
        "Note that there is no direct correspondence between this measure and the document frequency of a genre: measuring the number of times the potential genre label poem occurs in a corpus is not in any way equivalent to the number of poems in that corpus.",
        "However, the measure is still structurally aware as frequencies of labels of subnodes are included, i.e. a higher level genre label will have higher frequency (and lower information content) than a lower level genre label.",
        "For label frequency estimation, we manually expand any label abbreviations (such as \"newsp\" for BNC genre labels), delete stop words and function words and then use two search methods.",
        "For the search method word we simply search the frequency of the genre label in a corpus, using three different corpora (the BNC, Brown and Google web search).",
        "As for the BNC and Brown corpus some labels are very rarely mentioned, we for these two corpora use also a search method gram where all character 5-grams within the genre label are searched for and their frequencies aggregated.",

        "Table 3 shows the balance scores for all the corpora we use.",
        "The irst two rows for the Brown corpus have both large visual balance and distribution balance scores.",
        "As shown earlier, for those two setups the structural SVMs perform better than the flat approach.",
        "In contrast, for the tree hierarchies of Brown that we deformed or flattened, and also BNC and Syracuse, either or both of the two balance scores tend to be lower, and no improvement has been obtained over the flat approach.",
        "This may indicate that a further exploration of the relation between tree balance and the performance of structural SVMs is warranted.",
        "However, high visual balance and distribution scores do not necessarily imply high performance of structural SVMs, as very flat trees are also visually very balanced.",
        "As an example, HGC has a high visual balance score due to a shallow hierarchy and a high distributional balance score due to a roughly equal number of documents contained in each genre.",
        "However, HGC did not beneit from structural learning as it is also a very shallow hierarchy; therefore we think that a third variable depth also needs to be taken into account.",
        "A similar observation on the importance of well-balanced hierarchies comes from a recent Pascal challenge on large scale hierarchical text classification, which shows that some flat approaches perform competitively in topic classii-cation with imbalanced hierarchies.",
        "However, the participants do not explore explicitly the relation between tree balance and performance.",
        "Other methods for measuring tree balance (some of which are related to ours) are used in the field of phylogenetic research (Shao and Sokal, 1990) but they are only applicable to visual balance.",
        "In addition, the methods they used often provide conflicting results on which trees are considered as balanced (Shao and Sokal, 1990).",
        "We also scrutinise our distance measures as these are crucial for the structural approach.",
        "We notice that simple path length based measures perform well overall; again for the Brown corpus this is probably due to its balanced hierarchy which makes path length appropriate.",
        "There are other probable reasons why information content based measures do not perform better than path-length based ones.",
        "When measured via document frequency in a corpus we do not have sufi-ciently large, representative genre-annotated corpora to hand.",
        "When measured via genre label frequency, we run into at least two problems.",
        "Firstly, as mentioned in Section 3.2.1 genre label frequency does not have to correspond to class frequency of documents.",
        "Secondly, the labels used are often abbreviations (e.g. W_institut_doc, W_newsp_brdsht_nat_social in BNC Corpus), underspecified (other, misc, unclassified) or a collection of phrases (e.g. belles letters etc.",
        "in Brown).",
        "This made search for frequency very approximate and also loosens the link between label and content.",
        "We investigated in more depth how well the different distance measures are aligned.",
        "We adapt the alignment measure between kernels (Cristian-ini et al., 2002), to investigate how close the distance matrices are.",
        "For two distance matrices Hi and H2, their alignment A(H1,H2) is defined as:",
        "where < Hi,H >f = EHi(gi,gj)H(gi,gj) which is the total sum of the entry-wise products between the two distance matrices.",
        "Figure 5 shows several distance matrices on the (original) 15 genre Brown corpus.",
        "The plen matrix has clear blocks for the super genres press, informative, imaginative, etc.",
        "The IC-lin-gram-bnc matrix reines distances in the blocks, due to the introduction of information content.",
        "It keeps an alignment score that is over0.99 (the maximum is 1.00) toward the plen matrix, and still has visible block patterns.",
        "However, the IC-jng-word-bnc signiicantly adjusts the distance entries, has a much lower alignment score with the plen matrix, and doesn't reveal apparent blocks.",
        "This partially explains the bad performance of the Jiang distance measure on the Brown corpus (see Section 4).",
        "The diagrams also show the high closeness between the best performing IC measure and the simple path length based measure.",

        "To assess this, we aggregated all character 4-gram training vectors of each genre and calculated standard cosine similarities.",
        "Note that these similarities are based on the documents only and do not make use of the Brown hierarchy at all.",
        "After converting the similarities to distance, we plug the distance matrix into our structural SVM.",
        "However, accuracy on the Brown corpus (15 genres) was almost the same as for a flat SVM.",
        "Inspecting the distance matrix visually, we determined that the cosine similarity could clearly distinguish between Fiction and Non-Fiction texts but not between any other genres.",
        "This also indicates that the genre structural hierarchy clearly gives information not present in the simple character 4-gram features we use.",
        "For a more detailed discussion of the problems of the currently prevalently used character n-grams as features for genre classification, we refer the reader to (Sharoff et al., 2010)."

        "In this paper, we have evaluated structural learning approaches to genre classification using several different genre distance measures.",
        "Although we were able to improve on non-structural approaches for the Brown corpus, we found it hard to improve over flat SVMs on other corpora.",
        "As potential reasons for this negative result, we suggest that current genre hierarchies are either not of sufficient depth or are visually or distributionally imbalanced.",
        "We think further investigation into the relationship between hierarchy balance and structural learning is warranted.",
        "Further investigation is also needed into the appropriateness of n-gram features for genre identification as well as good measures of genre distance.",
        "In the future, an important task would be the refinement or unsupervised generation of new hierarchies, using information theoretic or data-driven approaches.",
        "For a full assessment of hierarchical learning for genre classification, the field of genre studies needs a testbed similar to the Reuters or 20 Newsgroups datasets used in topic-based IR with a balanced genre hierarchy and a representative corpus of reliably annotated webpages.",
        "With regard to algorithms, we are also interested in other formulations for structural SVMs and their large-scale implementation as well as the combination of different distance measures, for example in ensemble learning."
