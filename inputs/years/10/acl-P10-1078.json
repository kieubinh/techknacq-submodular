        "Community Question Answering (cQA) portals are an example of Social Media where the information need of a user is expressed in the form of a question for which a best answer is picked among the ones generated by other users.",
        "cQA websites are becoming an increasingly popular complement to search engines: overnight, a user can expect a human-crafted, natural language answer tailored to her specific needs.",
        "We have to be aware, though, that User Generated Content (UGC) is often redundant, noisy and untrustworthy (Jeon et al.,",
        "The research was conducted while the first author was visiting Tsinghua University.",
        "2006; Wang et al., 2009b; Suryanto et al., 2009).",
        "Interestingly, a great amount of information is embedded in the metadata generated as a byproduct of users' action and interaction on Social Media.",
        "Much valuable information is contained in answers other than the chosen best one (Liu et al., 2008).",
        "Our work aims to show that such information can be successfully extracted and made available by exploiting metadata to distill cQA content.",
        "To this end, we casted the problem to an instance of the query-biased multi-document summarization task, where the question was seen as a query and the available answers as documents to be summarized.",
        "We mapped each characteristic that an ideal answer should present to a measurable property that we wished the final summary could exhibit:",
        "• Quality to assess trustfulness in the source,",
        "• Coverage to ensure completeness of the information presented,",
        "• Relevance to keep focused on the user's information need and",
        "• Novelty to avoid redundancy.",
        "Quality of the information was assessed via Machine Learning (ML) techniques under best answer supervision in a vector space consisting of linguistic and statistical features about the answers and their authors.",
        "Coverage was estimated by semantic comparison with the knowledge space of a corpus of answers to similar questions which had been retrieved through the Yahoo!",
        "Answers API.",
        "Relevance was computed as information overlap between an answer and its question, while Novelty was calculated as inverse overlap with all other answers to the same question.",
        "A score was assigned to each concept in an answer according to the above properties.",
        "A score-maximizing summary under a maximum coverage model was then computed by solving an associated Integer Linear Programming problem (Gillick and Favre, 2009; McDonald, 2007).",
        "We chose to express concepts in the form of Basic Elements (BE), a semantic unit developed at ISI and modeled semantic overlap as intersection in the equivalence classes of two concepts (formal definitions will be given in section 2.3).",
        "The objective of our work was to present what we believe is a valuable conceptual framework; more advance machine learning and summarization techniques would most likely improve the performances.",

        "Quality assessing of information available on Social Media had been studied before mainly as a binary classification problem with the objective of detecting low quality content.",
        "We, on the other hand, treated it as a ranking problem and made use of quality estimates with the novel intent of successfully combining information from sources with different levels of trustfulness and writing ability.",
        "This is crucial when manipulating UGC, which is known to be subject to particularly great variance in credibility (Jeon et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009b; Suryanto et al., 2009) and may be poorly written.",
        "An answer a was given along with information about the user u that authored it, the set TAq (Total Answers) of all answers to the same question q and the set TAU of all answers by the same user.",
        "Making use of results available in the literature (Agichtein et al., 2008) , we designed a Quality feature space to capture the following syntactic, behavioral and statistical properties:",

        "• ç, number of non-stopwords in a with a corpus frequency larger than n (set to 5 in our experiments)",
        "• w, points awarded to user u according to the Yahoo!",

        "• q, ratio of best answers posted by user u",
        "The features mentioned above determined a space An answer a, in such feature space, assumed the vectorial form:",
        "Following the intuition that chosen best answers (a*) carry high quality information, we used supervised ML techniques to predict the probability of a to have been selected as a best answer a*.",
        "We trained a Linear Regression classifier to learn the weight vector W = (w\\, w2, w3, w4) that would combine the above feature.",
        "Supervision was given in the form of a training set TrQ of labeled pairs defined as:",
        "isbesta was a boolean label indicating whether a was an a* answer; the training set size was determined experimentally and will be discussed in Section 3.2.",
        "Although the value of isbesta was known for all answers, the output of the classifier offered us a real-valued prediction that could be interpreted as a quality score Q(^a):",
        "The Quality measure for an answer a was approximated by the probability of such answer to be a best answer (isbesta = 1) with respect to its author u and the sets TAU and TAq.",
        "It was calculated as dot product between the learned weight vector W and the feature vector for answer tya.",
        "Our decision to proceed in an unsupervised direction came from the consideration that any use of external human annotation would have made it impracticable to build an actual system on larger scale.",
        "An alternative, completely unsupervised approach to quality detection that has not undergone experimental analysis is discussed in Section 4.",
        "The properties that remain to be discussed, namely Coverage, Relevance and Novelty, are measures of semantic overlap between concepts; a concept is the smallest unit of meaning in a portion of written text.",
        "To represent sentences and answers we adopted an alternative approach to classical n-grams that could be defined bag-of-BEs.",
        "a BE is \"a head | modifier|relation triple representation of a document developed at ISI\" (Zhou et al., 2006).",
        "BEs are a strong theoretical instrument to tackle the ambiguity inherent in natural language that find successful practical applications in real-world query-based summarization systems.",
        "Different from n-grams, they are variant in length and depend on parsing techniques, named entity detection, part-of-speech tagging and resolution of syntactic forms such as hyponyms, pronouns, per-tainyms, abbreviation and synonyms.",
        "To each BE is associated a class of semantically equivalent BEs as result of what is called a transformation of the original BE; the mentioned class uniquely defines the concept.",
        "What seemed to us most remarkable is that this makes the concept context-dependent.",
        "A sentence is defined as a set of concepts and an answer is defined as the union between the sets that represent its sentences.",
        "The rest of this section gives formal definition of our model of concept representation and semantic overlap.",
        "From a set-theoretical point of view, each concepts c was uniquely associated with a set Ec = {c\\,c2 ... cm} such that:",
        "In our model, the \"=\" relation indicated syntactic equivalence (exact pattern matching), while the \"«L\" relation represented semantic equivalence under the convention of some language L (two concepts having the same meaning).",
        "Ec was defined as the set of semantically equivalent concepts to c, called its equivalence class; each concept ci in Ec carried the same meaning («L) of concept c without being syntactically identical (=); furthermore, no two concepts i and j in the same equivalence class were identical.",
        "\"Climbing a tree to escape a black bear is pointless because they can climb very well.\"",
        "Ec = {climb|bears, bear|go_up, climbing|animals,",
        "climber|instincts, trees|go_up, claws|climb...}",
        "Given two concepts c and k:",
        "We defined semantic overlap as occurring between c and k if they were syntactically identical or if their equivalence classes Ec and Ek had at least one element in common.",
        "In fact, given the above definition of equivalence class and the transitivity of \"=\" relation, we have that if the equivalence classes of two concepts are not disjoint, then they must bare the same meaning under the convention of some language L; in that case we said that c semantically overlapped k. It is worth noting that relation \"m\" is symmetric, transitive and reflexive; as a consequence all concepts with the same meaning are part of a same equivalence class.",
        "BE and equivalence class extraction were performed by modifying the behavior of the BEwT-E-0.3 framework .",
        "The framework itself is responsible for the operative definition of the relation and the creation of the equivalence classes.",
        "In the scenario we proposed, the user's information need is addressed in the form of a unique, summarized answer; information that is left out of the final summary will simply be unavailable.",
        "This raises the concern of completeness: besides ensuring that the information provided could be trusted, we wanted to guarantee that the posed question was being answered thoroughly.",
        "We adopted the general definition of Coverage as the portion of relevant information about a certain subject that is contained in a document (Swaminathan et al., 2009).",
        "We proceeded by treating each answer to a question q as a separate document and we retrieved through the Yahoo!",
        "Answers API a set TKq (Total Knowledge) of 50 answers to questions similar to q: the knowledge space of TKqwas chosen to approximate the entire knowledge space related to the queried question q.",
        "We calculated Coverage as a function of the portion of answers in TKq that presented semantic overlap with a.",
        "The Coverage measure for an answer a was calculated as the sum of term frequency tf(ci, a) for concepts in the answer itself, weighted by a concept importance function, Y(ci), for concepts in the total knowledge space TKq.",
        "7(c) was defined as follows:",
        "The function 7(c) of concept c was calculated as a function of the cardinality of set TKq and set TKq,c, which was the subset of all those answers d that contained at least one concept k which presented semantical overlap with c itself.",
        "A similar idea of knowledge space coverage is addressed by Swaminathan et al.",
        "(2009), from which formulas (2) and (3) were derived.",
        "A sensible alternative would be to estimate Coverage at the sentence level.",
        "To this point, we have addressed matters of trustfulness and completeness.",
        "Another widely shared concern for Information Retrieval systems is Relevance to the query.",
        "We calculated relevance by computing the semantic overlap between concepts in the answers and the question.",
        "Intuitively, we reward concepts that express meaning that could be found in the question to be answered.",
        "The Novelty measure N(c, q) of a concept c with respect to a question q was calculated as the ratio of the cardinality of set TAq,c over the cardinality of set TAq ; TAq,c was the subset of all those answers d in TAq that contained at least one concept k which presented semantical overlap with c.",
        "We have now determined how to calculate the",
        "What we needed at this point was a function S of the above vector which would assign a higher score to concepts most worthy of being included in the final summary.",
        "Our intuition was that since Quality, Coverage, Novelty and Relevance were all virtues properties, S needed to be monotonically increasing with respect to all its dimensions.",
        "We designed two such functions.",
        "Function (6), which multiplied the scores, was based on the probabilistic interpretation of each score as an independent event.",
        "Further empirical considerations, brought us to later introduce a logarithmic component that would discourage inclusion of sentences shorter then a threshold t (a reasonable choice for this parameter is a value around 20).",
        "The score for concept c appearing in sentence sc",
        "The Relevance measure R(c, q) of a concept c with respect to a question q was calculated as the ratio of the cardinality of set qc (containing all concepts in q that semantically overlapped with c) normalized by the total number of concepts in q.",
        "A second approach that made use of human annotation to learn a vector of weights V = (v1, v2, v3, v4) that linearly combined the scores was investigated.",
        "Analogously to what had been done with scoring function (6), the $ space was augmented with a dimension representing the length of the answer.",
        "4",
        "In order to learn the weight vector V that would combine the above scores, we asked three human (5) annotators to generate question-biased extractive summaries based on all answers available for a certain question.",
        "We trained a Linear Regression",
        "Coverage of a concept are the same of its answer, every concept c part of an answer a to some question q, could be assigned a score vector as follows:",
        "was calculated as:",
        "Another property we found desirable, was to minimize redundancy of information in the final summary.",
        "Since all elements in TAq (the set of all answers to q) would be used for the final summary, we positively rewarded concepts that were expressing novel meanings.",
        "classifier with a set TrS of labeled pairs defined as:",
        "include was a boolean label that indicated whether sc, the sentence containing c, had been included in the human-generated summary; length(sc) indicated the length of sentence sc.",
        "Questions and relative answers for the generation of human summaries were taken from the \"filtered dataset\" described in Section 3.1.",
        "The concept score for the same BE in two separate answers is very likely to be different because it belongs to answers with their own Quality and Coverage values: this only makes the scoring function context-dependent and does not interfere with the calculation the Coverage, Relevance and Novelty measures, which are based on information overlap and will regard two BEs with overlapping equivalence classes as being the same, regardless of their score being different.",
        "The previous sections showed how we quantitatively determined which concepts were more worthy of becoming part of the final machine summary M. The final step was to generate the summary itself by automatically selecting sentences under a length constraint.",
        "Choosing this constraint carefully demonstrated to be of crucial importance during the experimental phase.",
        "We again opted for a metadata-driven approach and designed the length constraint as a function of the lengths of all answers to q (TAq) weighted by the respective Quality measures:",
        "The intuition was that the longer and the more trustworthy answers to a question were, the more space was reasonable to allocate for information in the final, machine summarized answer M.",
        "M was generated so as to maximize the scores of the concepts it included.",
        "This was done under a maximum coverage model by solving the following Integer Linear Programming problem:",
        "yj = 1 if sj G M, Vj",
        "In the above program, M is the set of selected sentences: M = {sj : yj = 1, Vj}.",
        "The integer variables xi and yj were equals to one if the corresponding concept ci and sentence sj were included in M. Similarly occij was equal to one if concept ci was contained in sentence sj.",
        "We maximized the sum of scores S(ci) (for S equals to Sn or Ss) for each concept ci in the final summary M. We did so under the constraint that the total length of all sentences sj included in M must be less than the total expected length of the summary itself.",
        "In addition, we imposed a consistency constraint: if a concept ci was included in M, then at least one sentence sj that contained the concept must also be selected (constraint (10)).",
        "The described optimization problem was solved using lp_solve .",
        "We conclude with an empirical side note: since solving the above can be computationally very demanding for large number of concepts, we found performance-wise very fruitful to skim about one fourth of the concepts with lowest scores."
