        "Introduced a few years ago, Short Message Service (SMS) offers the possibility of exchanging written messages between mobile phones.",
        "SMS has quickly been adopted by users.",
        "These messages often greatly deviate from traditional spelling conventions.",
        "As shown by specialists (Thurlow and Brown, 2003; Fairon et al., 2006; Bieswanger, 2007), this variability is due to the simultaneous use of numerous coding strategies, like phonetic plays (2ml read 'demain', \"tomorrow\"), phonetic transcriptions (kom instead of 'comme', \"like\"), consonant skeletons (tjrs for 'toujours', \"always\"), misapplied, missing or incorrect separators (j esper for 'j'espère', \"I hope\"; j'croibilk, instead of 'je crois bien que', \"I am pretty sure that\"), etc.",
        "These deviations are due to three main factors: the small number of characters allowed per text message by the service (140 bytes), the constraints of the small phones' keypads and, last but not least, the fact that people mostly communicate between friends and relatives in an informal register.",
        "Whatever their causes, these deviations considerably hamper any standard natural language processing (NLP) system, which stumbles against so many Out-Of-Vocabulary words.",
        "For this reason, as noted by Sproat et al.",
        "(2001), an SMS normalization must be performed before a more conventional NLP process can be applied.",
        "As defined by Yvon (2008), \"SMS normalization consists in rewriting an SMS text using a more conventional spelling, in order to make it more readable for a human or for a machine.\"",
        "The SMS normalization we present here was developed in the general framework of an SMS-to-speech synthesis system.",
        "This paper, however, only focuses on the normalization process.",
        "Evaluated in French, our method shares similarities with both spell checking and machine translation.",
        "The machine translation-like module of the system performs the true normalization task.",
        "It is entirely based on models learned from an SMS corpus and its transcription, aligned at the character-level in order to get parallel corpora.",
        "Two spell checking-like modules surround the normalization module.",
        "The first one detects unambiguous tokens, like URLs or phone numbers, to keep them out of the normalization.",
        "The second one, applied on the normalized parts only, identifies non-alphabetic sequences, like punctuations, and labels them with the corresponding token.",
        "This greatly helps the system's print module to follow the basic rules of typography.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 proposes an overview of the state of the art.",

        "As highlighted by Kobus et al.",
        "(2008b), SMS normalization, up to now, has been handled through three well-known NLP metaphors: spell checking, machine translation and automatic speech recognition.",
        "In this section, we only present the pros and cons of these approaches.",
        "Their results are given in Section 5, focused on our evaluation.",
        "The spell checking metaphor (Guimier de Neef",
        "Stevenson, 2009) performs the normalization task on a word-per-word basis.",
        "On the assumption that most words should be correct for the purpose of communication, its principle is to keep In-Vocabulary words out of the correction process.",
        "Guimier de Neef et al.",
        "(2007) proposed a rule-based system that uses only a few linguistic resources dedicated to SMS, like specific lexicons of abbreviations.",
        "Choudhury et al.",
        "(2007) and Cook and Stevenson (2009) preferred to implement the noisy channel metaphor (Shannon, 1948), which assumes a communication process in which a sender emits the intended message W through an imperfect (noisy) communication channel, such that the sequence O observed by the recipient is a noisy version of the original message.",
        "On this basis, the idea is to recover the intended message W hidden behind the sequences of observations O, by maximizing:",
        "where P(O) is ignored because constant, P(O| W) models the channel's noise, and P(W) models the language of the source.",
        "Choudhury et al.",
        "(2007) implemented the noisy channel through a Hidden-Markov Model (HMM) able to handle both graphemic variants and phonetic plays as proposed by (Toutanova and Moore, 2002), while Cook and Stevenson (2009) enhanced the model by adapting the channel's noise P(O|W, wf) according to a list of predefined observed word formations {wf}: stylistic variation, word clipping, phonetic abbreviations, etc.",
        "Whatever the system, the main limitation of the spell checking approach is the excessive confidence it places in word boundaries.",
        "The machine translation metaphor, which is historically the first proposed (Bangalore et al., 2002; Aw et al., 2006), considers the process of normalizing SMS as a translation task from a source language (the SMS) to a target language (its standard written form).",
        "This standpoint is based on the observation that, on the one side, SMS messages greatly differ from their standard written forms, and that, on the other side, most of the errors cross word boundaries and require a wide context to be handled.",
        "On this basis, Aw et al.",
        "(2006) proposed a statistical machine translation model working at the phrase-level, by splitting sentences into their k most probable phrases.",
        "While this approach achieves really good results, Kobus et al.",
        "(2008b) make the assertion that a phrase-based translation can hardly capture the lexical creativity observed in SMS messages.",
        "Moreover, the translation framework, which can handle many-to-many correspondences between sources and targets, exceeds the needs of SMS normalization, where the normalization task is almost deterministic.",
        "Based on this analysis, Kobus et al.",
        "(2008b) proposed to handle SMS normalization through an automatic speech recognition (ASR) metaphor.",
        "The starting point of this approach is the observation that SMS messages present a lot of phonetic plays that sometimes make the SMS word (sré, mwa) closer to its phonetic representation ([sKe], [mwa]) than to its standard written form (serai, \"will be\", moi, \"me\").",
        "Typically, an ASR system tries to discover the best word sequence within a lattice of weighted phonetic sequences.",
        "Applied to the SMS normalization task, the ASR metaphor consists in first converting the SMS message into a phone lattice, before turning it into a word-based lattice using a phoneme-to-grapheme dictionary.",
        "A language model is then applied on the word lattice, and the most probable word sequence is finally chosen by applying a best-path algorithm on the lattice.",
        "One of the advantages of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is its intrinsic ability to handle word boundaries.",
        "However, this step also presents an important drawback, raised by the authors themselves: it prevents next normalization steps from knowing what graphemes were in the initial sequence.",
        "Our approach, which is detailed in Sections 3 and 4, shares similarities with both the spell checking approach and the machine translation principles, trying to combine the advantages of these methods, while leaving aside their drawbacks: like in spell checking systems, we detect unambiguous units of text as soon as possible and try to rely on word boundaries when they seem reliable enough; but like in the machine translation task, our method intrinsically handles word boundaries in the normalization process if needed."

        "We used our own finite-state tools: a finite-state machine library and its associated compiler (Beaufort, 2008).",
        "In conformance with the format of the library, the compiler builds finite-state machines from weighted rewrite rules, weighted regular expressions and n-gram models.",
        "We formulated four constraints before fixing the system's architecture.",
        "First, special tokens, like URLs, phones or currencies, should be identified as soon as possible, to keep them out of the normalization process.",
        "Second, word boundaries should be taken into account, as far as they seem reliable enough.",
        "The idea, here, is to base the decision on a learning able to catch frequent SMS sequences to include in a dedicated In-Vocabulary (IV) lexicon.",

        "The architecture depicted in Figure 1 directly relies on these considerations.",

        "Then, two standard NLP modules produce a morphosyntactic analysis of the normalized text.",

        "For this purpose, the first step of the algorithm consists in composing a noisy token T with an FST Sp whose task is to differentiate between sequences of IV words and sequences of OOV words, by labelling them with a special IV or OOV marker.",

        "Our normalization models were trained on a French SMS corpus of 30,000 messages, gathered in Belgium, semi-automatically anonymized and manually normalized by the Catholic University of Louvain (Fairon and Paumier, 2006).",
        "Together, the SMS corpus and its transcription constitute parallel corpora aligned at the message-level.",
        "However, in order to learn pieces of knowledge from these corpora, we needed a string alignment at the character-level.",
        "One way of implementing this string alignment is to compute the edit-distance of two strings, which measures the minimum number of operations (substitutions, insertions, deletions) required to transform one string into the other (Levenshtein, 1966).",
        "Using this algorithm, in which each operation gets a cost of 1, two strings may be aligned in different ways with the same global cost.",
        "This is the case, for instance, for the SMS form kozer ([koze]) and its standard transcription causé (\"talked\"), as illustrated by Figure 2.",
        "However, from a linguistic standpoint, alignment (1) is preferable, because corresponding graphemes are aligned on their first character.",
        "In order to automatically choose this preferred alignment, we had to distinguish the three edit-operations, according to the characters to be aligned.",
        "For that purpose, probabilities were required.",
        "Computing probabilities for each operation according to the characters to be aligned was performed through an iterative algorithm described in (Cougnon and Beaufort, 2009).",

        "For this reason, our definition of the word is far from the previous one, and originates from the string alignment.",

        "2. a rule with a longer input usually has fewer alternative normalizations than a rule with a shorter input does, because the longer SMS sequence likely occurred paired with fewer alternative normalizations in the training corpus than did the shorter SMS sequence.",
        "Among the wide set of possible sequences of 2 to 5 characters gathered from the corpus, we only kept in our list of rules the sequences that allowed at least one normalization solely made of IV words.",
        "It is important to notice that here, we refer to the standard notion of IV word: while gathering the candidate sequences from the corpus, we systematically checked each word of the normalizations against a lexicon of French standard written forms.",

        "At this point, this FST cannot be combined with our other models, because it works on lexical units and not on characters.",
        "This problem is solved by composing LMW with another FST L, which represents a lexicon mapping each input word, considered as a string of characters, onto the same output words, but considered here as a lexical unit.",

        "The performance and the efficiency of our system were evaluated on a MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU, 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM, running Mac OS X version 10.5.8.",
        "The evaluation was performed on the corpus of 30,000 French SMS presented in Section 4.2, by tenfold cross-validation (Kohavi, 1995).",
        "The principle of this method of evaluation is to split the initial corpus into 10 subsets of equal size.",
        "The system is then trained 10 times, each time leaving out one of the subsets from the training corpus, but using only this omitted subset as test corpus.",
        "The language model of the evaluation is a 3-gram.",
        "We did not try a 4-gram.",
        "This choice was motivated by the experiments of Kobus et al.",
        "(2008a), who showed on a French corpus comparable to ours that, if using a larger language model is always rewarded, the improvement quickly decreases with every higher level and is already quite small between 2-gram and 3-gram.",
        "Table 1 presents the results in terms of efficiency.",
        "The system seems efficient, while we cannot compare it with other methods, which did not provide us with this information.",
        "Table 2, part 1, presents the performance of our approach (Hybrid) and compares it to a trivial copy-paste (Copy).",
        "The system was evaluated in terms of BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001), Word Error Rate (WER) and Sentence Error Rate (SER).",
        "Concerning WER, the table presents the distribution between substitutions (Sub), deletions (Del) and insertions (Ins).",
        "The copy-paste results just inform about the real deviation of our corpus from the traditional spelling conventions, and highlight the fact that our system is still at pains to significantly reduce the SER, while results in terms of WER and BLEU score are quite encouraging.",
        "Table 2, part 2, provides the results of the state-of-the-art approaches.",
        "The only results truly comparable to ours are those of Guimier de Neef et al.",
        "(2007), who evaluated their approach on the same corpus as ours; clearly, our method outperforms theirs.",
        "Our results also seem a bit better than those of Kobus et al.",
        "(2008a), although the comparison with this system, also evaluated in French, is less easy: they combined the French corpus we used with another one and performed a single validation, using a bigger training corpus (36.704 messages) for a test corpus quite similar to one of our subsets (2.998 SMS).",
        "Other systems were evaluated in English, and results are more difficult to compare; at least, our results seem in line with them.",
        "The analysis of the normalizations produced by our system pointed out that, most often, errors are contextual and concern the gender (quel(le), \"what\"), the number (bisou(s), \"kiss\"), the person ([tu t']inquiète(s), \"you are worried\") or the tense (arrivé/arriver, \"arrived\"/\"to arrive\").",
        "That contextual errors are frequent is not surprising.",
        "In French, as mentioned by Kobus et al.",
        "(2008b), n-gram models are unable to catch this information, as it is generally out of their scope.",
        "On the other hand, this analysis confirmed our initial assumptions.",
        "First, special tokens (URLs, phones, etc.)",
        "are not modified.",
        "Second, agglutinated words are generally split (Pensa ms – Pense à mes, \"think to my\"), while misapplied separators tend to be deleted (G t – J'étais, \"I was\").",
        "Of course, we also found some errors at word boundaries ([il] l'arrange – [il] la range, \"[he] arranges\" – \"[he] pits in order\"), but they were fairly rare."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we presented an SMS normalization framework based on finite-state machines and developed in the context of an SMS-to-speech synthesis system.",
        "With the intention to avoid wrong modifications of special tokens and to handle word boundaries as easily as possible, we designed a method that shares similarities with both spell checking and machine translation.",

        "Table 2: Performance of the system.",
        "(*) Kobus 2008-1 corresponds to the ASR-like system, while Kobus 2008-2 is a combination of this system with a series of open-source machine translation toolkits.",
        "(**) Scores obtained on noisy data only, out of the sentence's context.",
        "normalization algorithm is original in two ways.",
        "First, it is entirely based on models learned from a training corpus.",
        "Second, the rewrite model applied to a noisy sequence differs depending on whether this sequence is known or not.",
        "Evaluated by tenfold cross-validation, the system seems efficient, and the performance in terms of BLEU score and WER are quite encouraging.",
        "However, the SER remains too high, which emphasizes the fact that the system needs several improvements.",
        "First of all, the model should take phonetic similarities into account, because SMS messages contain a lot of phonetic plays.",
        "The phonetic model, for instance, should know that o, au, eau, ..., aux can all be pronounced [o], while è, ais, ait, aient are often pronounced [e].",
        "However, unlike Kobus et al.",
        "(2008a), we feel that this model must avoid the normalization step in which the graphemic sequence is converted into phonemes, because this conversion prevents the next steps from knowing which graphemes were in the initial sequence.",
        "Instead, we propose to learn phonetic similarities from a dictionary of words with phonemic transcriptions, and to build graphemes-to-graphemes rules.",
        "These rules could then be automatically weighted, by learning their frequencies from our aligned corpora.",
        "Furthermore, this model should be able to allow for timbre variation, like [e]-[e], in order to allow similarities between graphemes frequently confused in French, like ai ([e]) and ais/ait/aient ([e]).",
        "Last but not least, the graphemes-to-graphemes rules should be contextualized, in order to reduce the complexity of the model.",
        "It would also be interesting to test the impact of another lexical language model, learned on non-SMS sentences.",
        "Indeed, the lexical model must be learned from sequences of standard written forms, an obvious prerequisite that involves a major drawback when the corpus is made of SMS sentences: the corpus must first be transcribed, an expensive process that reduces the amount of data on which the model will be trained.",
        "For this reason, we propose to learn a lexical model from non-SMS sentences.",
        "However, the corpus of external sentences should still share two important features with the SMS language: it should mimic the oral language and be as spontaneous as possible.",
        "With this in mind, our intention is to gather sentences from Internet forums.",
        "But not just any forum, because often forums share another feature with the SMS language: their language is noisy.",
        "Thus, the idea is to choose a forum asking its members to pay attention to spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, and to avoid the use of the SMS language."
