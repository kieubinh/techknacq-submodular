        "Letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion (also called grapheme-to-phoneme conversion) is the task of predicting the pronunciation of a word given its orthographic form by converting a sequence of letters into a sequence of phonemes.",
        "The L2P task plays a crucial role in speech synthesis systems (Schroeter et al., 2002), and is an important part of other applications, including spelling correction (Toutanova and Moore, 2001) and speech-to-speech machine translation (Engelbrecht and Schultz, 2005).",
        "Many data-driven techniques have been proposed for letter-to-phoneme conversion systems, including neural networks (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987), decision trees (Black et al., 1998), pronunciation by analogy (Marchand and Damper, 2000), Hidden Markov Models (Taylor, 2005), and constraint satisfaction (Bosch and Canisius, 2006).",

        "The training data usually consists of pairs of letter and phoneme sequences, which are not aligned.",
        "Since there is no explicit information indicating the relationships between individual letter and phonemes, these must be inferred by a letter-phoneme alignment algorithm before a prediction model can be trained.",
        "The quality of the alignment affects the accuracy of L2P conversion.",
        "Letter-phoneme alignment is closely related to transliteration alignment (Pervouchine et al., 2009), which involves graphemes representing different writing scripts.",
        "Letter-phoneme alignment may also be considered as a task in itself; for example, in the alignment of speech transcription with text in spoken corpora.",
        "Most previous L2P approaches induce the alignment between letters and phonemes with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.",
        "In this paper, we propose a number of alternative alignment methods, and compare them to the EM-based algorithms using both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.",
        "The intrinsic evaluation is conducted by comparing the generated alignments to a manually-constructed gold standard.",
        "The extrinsic evaluation uses two different generation techniques to perform letter-to-phoneme conversion on several different data sets.",
        "We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, and show that better alignments tend to improve the accuracy of the L2P systems regardless of the actual technique.",
        "In particular, one of our proposed methods advances the state of the art in L2P conversion.",

        "We define the letter-phoneme alignment task as the problem of inducing links between units that are related by pronunciation.",

        "The letter e is considered to be linked to special null phoneme.",
        "accuse accuse @kjuz_ @k_Uz_",
        "The following constraints on links are assumed by some or all alignment models:",
        "• the monotonicity constraint prevents links from crossing each other;",
        "• the representation constraint requires each phoneme to be linked to at least one letter, thus precluding nulls on the letter side;",
        "• the one-to-one constraint stipulates that each letter and phoneme may participate in at most one link.",
        "These constraints increasingly reduce the search space and facilitate the training process for the L2P generation models.",
        "We refer to an alignment model that assumes all three constraints as a pure one-to-one (1-1) model.",
        "By allowing only 1-1 and 1-0 links, the alignment task is thus greatly simplified.",
        "In the simplest case, when the number of letters is equal to the number of phonemes, there is only one possible alignment that satisfies all three constraints.",
        "When there are more letters than phonemes, the search is reduced to identifying letters that must be linked to null phonemes (the process referred to as \"epsilon scattering\" by Black et al.",
        "(1998)).",
        "In some words, however, one letter clearly represents more than one phoneme; for example, u in Figure 1.",
        "Moreover, apure 1-1 approach cannot handle cases where the number of phonemes exceeds the number of letters.",
        "A typical solution to overcome this problems is to introduce so-called double phonemes by merging adjacent phonemes that could be represented as a single letter.",
        "For example, a double phoneme U would replace a sequence of the phonemes j and u in Figure 1.",
        "This solution requires a manual extension of the set of phonemes present in the data.",
        "By convention, we regard the models that include a restricted set of 1-2 mappings as 1-1 models.",
        "Advanced L2P approaches, including the joint n-gram models (Bisani and Ney, 2008) and the joint discriminative approach (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007) eliminate the one-to-one constraint entirely, allowing for linking of multiple letters to multiple phonemes.",
