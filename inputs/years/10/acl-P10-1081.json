        "Event extraction is a particularly challenging type of information extraction (IE).",
        "Most current event extraction systems rely on local information at the phrase or sentence level.",
        "However, this local context may be insufficient to resolve ambiguities in identifying particular types of events; information from a wider scope can serve to resolve some of these ambiguities.",
        "In this paper, we use document level information to improve the performance of ACE event extraction.",
        "In contrast to previous work, we do not limit ourselves to information about events of the same type, but rather use information about other types of events to make predictions or resolve ambiguities regarding a given event.",
        "We learn such relationships from the training corpus and use them to help predict the occurrence of events and event arguments in a text.",
        "Experiments show that we can get 9.0% (absolute) gain in trigger (event) classification, and more than 8% gain for argument (role) classification in ACE event extraction."

        "The goal of event extraction is to identify instances of a class of events in text.",
        "The ACE 2005 event extraction task involved a set of 33 generic event types and subtypes appearing frequently in the news.",
        "In addition to identifying the event itself, it also identifies all of the participants and attributes of each event; these are the entities that are involved in that event.",
        "Identifying an event and its participants and attributes is quite difficult because a larger field of view is often needed to understand how facts tie together.",
        "Sometimes it is difficult even for people to classify events from isolated sentences.",
        "From the sentence:",
        "(1) He left the company.",
        "it is hard to tell whether it is a Transport event in ACE, which means that he left the place; or an End-Position event, which means that he retired from the company.",
        "However, if we read the whole document, a clue like \"he planned to go shopping before he went home\" would give us confidence to tag it as a Transport event, while a clue like \"They held a party for his retirement\" would lead us to tag it as an End-Position event.",
        "Such clues are evidence from the same event type.",
        "However, sometimes another event type is also a good predictor.",
        "For example, if we find a Start-Position event like \"he was named president three years ago\", we are also confident to tag (1) as End-Position event.",
        "Event argument identification also shares this benefit.",
        "Consider the following two sentences:",
        "(2) A bomb exploded in Bagdad; seven people died while 11 were injured.",
        "(3) A bomb exploded in Bagdad; the suspect got caught when he tried to escape.",
        "If we only consider the local context of the trigger \"exploded\", it is hard to determine that \"seven people\"\" is a likely Target of the Attack event in (2), or that the \"suspect\" is the Attacker of the Attack event, because the structures of (2) and (3) are quite similar.",
        "The only clue is from the semantic inference that a person who died may well have been a Target of the Attack event, and the person arrested is probably the Attacker of the Attack event.",
        "These may be seen as examples of a broader textual inference problem, and in general such knowledge is quite difficult to acquire and apply.",
        "However, in the present case we can take advantage of event extraction to learn these rules in a simpler fashion, which we present below.",
        "Most current event extraction systems are based on phrase or sentence level extraction.",
        "Several recent studies use high-level information to aid local event extraction systems.",
        "For example, Finkel et al.",
        "(2005), Maslennikov and Chua (2007), Ji and Grishman (2008), and Patwardhan and Riloff (2007, 2009) tried to use discourse, document, or cross-document information to improve information extraction.",
        "However, most of this research focuses on single event extraction, or focuses on high-level information within a single event type, and does not consider information acquired from other event types.",
        "We extend these approaches by introducing cross-event information to enhance the performance of multi-event-type extraction systems.",
        "Cross-event information is quite useful: first, some events co-occur frequently, while other events do not.",
        "For example, Attack, Die, and Injure events very frequently occur together, while Attack and Marry are less likely to co-occur.",
        "Also, typical relations among the arguments of different types of events can be helpful in predicting information to be extracted.",
        "For example, the Victim of a Die event is probably the Target of the Attack event.",
        "As a result, we extend the observation that \"a document containing a certain event is likely to contain more events of the same type\", and base our approach on the idea that \"a document containing a certain type of event is likely to contain instances of related events\".",

        "Ji and Grishman (2008) were inspired from the hypothesis of \"One Sense Per Discourse\"' (Yarowsky, 1995); they extended the scope from a single document to a cluster of topic-related documents and employed a rule-based approach to propagate consistent trigger classification and event arguments across sentences and documents.",
        "Combining global evidence from related documents with local decisions, they obtained an appreciable improvement in both event and event argument identification.",
        "Patwardhan and Riloff (2009) proposed an event extraction model which consists of two components: a model for sentential event recognition, which offers a probabilistic assessment of whether a sentence is discussing a domain-relevant event; and a model for recognizing plausible role fillers, which identifies phrases as role fillers based upon the assumption that the surrounding context is discussing a relevant event.",
