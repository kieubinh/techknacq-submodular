        "Making it useful and enjoyable to use a dialogue system is always important.",
        "The dialogue should be easy and intuitive, otherwise the user will not find it worth the effort and instead prefer to use manual controls or to speak to a human.",
        "However, when designing an in-vehicle dialogue system there is one more thing that needs to be taken into consideration, namely the fact that the user is performing an additional, safety critical, task - driving.",
        "The so-called 100-car study (Neale et al., 2005) revealed that secondary task distraction is the largest cause of driver inattention, and that the handling of wireless devices is the most common secondary task.",
        "Even if spoken dialogue systems enables manouvering of devices without using hands or eyes, it is crucial to adjust the interaction to the in-vehicle environment in order to minimize distraction from the interaction itself.",
        "Therefore the dialogue system should consider the cognitive load of the driver and adjust the dialogue accordingly.",
        "One way of doing this is to continously measure the cognitive workload level of the driver and, if the workload is high, determine type of workload and act accordingly.",
        "If the workload is dialogue-induced (i.e. caused by the dialogue itself), it might be necessary to rephrase or offer the user help with the task.",
        "If the workload is driving-induced (i.e. caused by the driving task), the user might need information that is crucial for the driving task (e.g. get navigation instructions), or to pause the dialogue in order to enable the user to concentrate on the driving task (Villing, 2009).",
        "Both the driver and the system should be able to initiate interruptions.",
        "When the interaction with a dialogue system has been interrupted, e.g. because the user has not answered a question, it is common that the system returns to the top menu.",
        "This means that if the user wants to finish the interrupted task she has to restart from the beginning, which is both time-consuming and annoying.",
        "Instead, the dialogue system should be able to either pause until the workload is low or change topic and/or domain, and then resume where the interruption took place.",
        "However, resumption of an interrupted topic needs to be done in a way that minimizes the risk that the cognitive workload increases again.",
        "Although a lot of research has been done regarding dialogue system output, very little work has been done regarding resumption of an interrupted topic.",
        "In this paper we will analyse human-human in-vehicle dialogue to find out how resumptions are done in human-human dialogue and propose some implications for resumption strategies in a dialogue system."

        "To study resumption behaviour, Yang (2009), carried out a data collection where the participants were switching between an ongoing task (a card game) and a real-time task (a picture game).",
        "The participants randomly had to interrupt the ongoing task to solve a problem in the real-time task.",
        "When studying the resumption behaviour after an interruption to the real-time task they found that the resuming utterance contained various amounts and types of redundant information depending on whether the interruption occured in the middle of a card discussion, at the end of a card or at the end of a card game.",
        "If the interruption occured in the middle of a card discussion it was possible to make a distinction between utterance restatement (repeat one's own utterance, repeat the dialogue partners utterance or clarification of the dialogue partners utterance) and card review (reviewing all the cards on hand although this information had already been given).",

        "A data collection has been carried out within the DICO project (see, for example, (Larsson and Villing, 2007)) to study how an additional distraction or increase in the cognitive load would affect a driver's dialogue behaviour.",
        "The goal was to elicit a natural dialogue (as opposed to giving the driver a constructed task such as for example a math task) and make the participants engage in the conversation.",
        "The participants (two female and six male) between the ages of 25 and 36 drove a car in pairs while interviewing each other.",
        "The interview questions and the driving instructions were given to the passenger, hence the driver knew neither what questions to discuss nor the route in advance.",
        "Therefore, the driver had to signal, implicitly or explicitly, when she wanted driving instructions and when she wanted a new question to discuss.",
        "The passenger too had to have a strategy for when to change topic.",
        "The reasons for this setup was to elicit a natural and fairly intense dialogue and to force the participants to frequently change topic and/or domain (e.g. to get driving instructions).",
        "The participants changed roles after 30 minutes, which meant that each participant acted both as driver and as passenger.",
        "The cognitive load of the driver was measured in two ways.",
        "The driver performed a Tactile Detection Task (TDT) (van Win-sum et al., 1999).",
        "When using a TDT, a buzzer is attached to the driver's wrist.",
        "The driver is told to push a button each time the summer is activated.",
        "Cognitive load is determined by measuring hit-rate and reaction time.",
        "Although the TDT task in itself might cause an increased workload level, the task is performed during the whole session and thereby it is possible to distinguish high workload caused by something else but the TDT task.",
        "Workload was also measured by using an IDIS system (Broström et al., 2006).",
        "IDIS determines workload based on the driver's behaviour (for example, steering wheel movements or applying the brake).",
        "What differs between the two measurements is that the TDT measures the actual workload of each driver, while IDIS makes its assumptions based on knowledge of what manouvres are usually cognitively demanding.",
        "The participants were audio-and videotaped, the recordings are transcribed with the transcription tool ELAN, using an orthographic transcription.",
        "All in all 3590 driver utterances and 4382 passenger utterances are transcribed.",
        "An annotation scheme was designed to enable analysis of utterances with respect to topic change for each domain.",
        "Domain and topic was defined as:",
        "• interview domain: discussions about the interview questions where each interview question was defined as a topic",
        "• navigation domain: navigation-related discussions where each navigation instruction was defined as a topic",

        "We therefore sorted all utterances coded as resume-topic in two categories, those which contained redundant information when comparing with the last utterance before the interruption, and those which did not contain and redundant information.",

        "When the speakers interrupts an interview topic they mostly switch to the navigation domain, see Figure 1.",

        "Hence, it seems like the driver interrupts to make clarification utterances that must be answered immediately, for example, right before a crossing when the driver has pressed the brakes or turned on the turn signal (and therefore the IDIS system signals high workload which is interpreted as driving-induced workload) while the passenger take the chance to give additional information in advance, before it is needed, and the workload therefore is low.",
        "Figure 7 shows that the driver mostly resumes to the interview domain during low or possible driving-induced workload.",
        "Since the IDIS system makes its assumption on driving behaviour, based on what the average driver finds cognitively demanding, it might sometimes be so that the system overgenerates and indicates high workload even though the driver at hand does not find the driving task cognitively demanding.",

        "In this paper we point at some of the dialogue strategies that are used in human-human dialogue during high cognitive load when resuming to an interrupted topic.",
        "These strategies should be taken under consideration when implementing an in-vehicle dialogue system.",
        "To make the dialogue natural and easy to understand the dialogue manager should consider which domain it will resume to and the number of turns between the interruption and resumption before deciding what phrase to use as output.",
        "For example, the results indicate that it might be more suitable to use a declarative phrase when resuming to a domain where the system is asking the user for information, for example when adding songs to a play list at the mp3-player (cf. the interview domain).",
        "If the number of turns are 4 or less, it probably does not have to make a redundant utterance at all, but may continue the discussion where it was interrupted.",
        "If the number of turns exceeds 4 it is probably smoother to let the system just repeat one or more keywords from the interrupted utterance to make the user understand what topic should be discussed, instead of repeating the whole utterance or even start the task from the beginning.",
        "This will make the system feel less tedious which should have a positive effect on the cognitive workload level.",
        "However, user tests are probably needed to decide how much redundant information is necessary when talking to a dialogue system, since it may well differ from talking to a human being who is able to help the listener understand by, for example, emphasizing certain words in a way that is currently impossible for a computer.",
        "When resuming to a domain where the system has information to give to the user it is suitable to make a short, informative utterance (e.g. \"turn left here\", \"traffic jam ahead, turn left instead\" ).",
        "Finally, it is also important to consider the cognitive workload level of the user to determine when - and if - to resume, and also whether the topic that is to be resumed belongs to a domain where the system has information to give to the user, or a domain where the user gives information to the system.",
        "For example, if the user is using a navigation system and he or she is experiencing driving-induced workload when approaching e.g. a crossing, it might be a good idea to give additional navigation information even though the user has not explicitly asked for it.",
        "If the user however is using a telephone application it is probably better to let the user initiate the resumption.",
        "The DICO corpus shows that it is the passenger that is most careful not to interrupt or resume when the driver's workload is high, indicating that the system should let the user decide whether it is suitable to resume during high workload, while it is more accepted to let the system interrupt and resume when the workload is low.",
        "When resuming to the interview domain the driver (i.e. the user) mostly uses declarative phrases, either as an answer to a question or as a redundant utterance to clarify what was last said before the interruption.",
        "Therefore the dialogue system should be able to store not only what has been agreed upon regarding the interrupted task, but also the last few utterances to make it possible to interpret the user utterance as a resumption.",
        "It is common that the driver utterances are incomplete, perhaps due to the fact that the driver's primary task is the driving and therefore his or her mind is not always set on the dialogue task.",
        "Lindström (2008) showed that deletions are the most common disfluency during high cognitive load, which is supported by the results in this paper.",
