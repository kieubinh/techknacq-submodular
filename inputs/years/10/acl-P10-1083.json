        "We presented a reinforcement learning system which learns to interpret natural language directions.",
        "Critically, our approach uses no semantic annotation, instead learning directly from human demonstration.",
        "It successfully acquires a subset of spatial semantics, using reinforcement learning to derive the correspondence between instruction language and features of paths.",
        "While our results are still preliminary, we believe our model represents a significant advance in learning natural language meaning, drawing its supervision from human demonstration rather than word distributions or hand-labeled semantic tags.",
        "Framing language acquisition as apprenticeship learning is a fruitful research direction which has the potential to connect the symbolic, linguistic domain to the non-symbolic, sensory aspects of cognition."
