        "This is also well known as the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954): terms occurring in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "There has been a lot of work to compute the sense similarity between terms based on their distribution in a corpus, such as (Hindle, 1990; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lin, 1998; Turney, 2001; Pantel and Lin, 2002; Padó and Lapata, 2007).",
        "In the work just cited, a common procedure is followed.",
        "Given two terms to be compared, one first extracts various features for each term from their contexts in a corpus and forms a vector space model (VSM); then, one computes their similarity by using similarity functions.",
        "The features include words within a surface window of a fixed size (Lund and Burgess, 1996), grammatical dependencies (Lin, 1998; Pantel and Linty function which has been most widely used is cosine distance (Salton and McGill, 1983); other similarity functions include Euclidean distance, City Block distance (Bullinaria and Levy; 2007), and Dice and Jaccard coefficients (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992), etc.",
        "Measures of monolingual sense similarity have been widely used in many applications, such as synonym recognizing (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), word clustering (Pantel and Lin 2002), word sense disambiguation (Yuret and Yatbaz 2009), etc.",
        "Use of the vector space model to compute sense similarity has also been adapted to the multilingual condition, based on the assumption that two terms with similar meanings often occur in comparable contexts across languages.",
        "Fung application of extracting translation pairs from comparable or even unrelated corpora.",
        "The vectors in different languages are first mapped to a common space using an initial bilingual dictionary, and then compared.",
        "However, there is no previous work that uses the VSM to compute sense similarity for terms from parallel corpora.",
        "The sense similarities, i.e. the translation probabilities in a translation model, for units from parallel corpora are mainly based on the co-occurrence counts of the two units.",
        "Therefore, questions emerge: how good is the sense similarity computed via VSM for two units from parallel corpora?",
        "Is it useful for multilingual applications, such as statistical machine translation (SMT)?",
        "In this paper, we try to answer these questions, focusing on sense similarity applied to the SMT task.",
        "For this task, translation rules are heuristically extracted from automatically word-aligned sentence pairs.",
        "Due to noise in the training corpus or wrong word alignment, the source and target sides of some rules are not semantically equivalent, as can be seen from the following real examples which are taken from the rule table built on our training data (Section 5.1):",
        "The source and target sides of the rules with (*) at the end are not semantically equivalent; it seems likely that measuring the semantic similarity from their context between the source and target sides of rules might be helpful to machine translation.",

        "Our contribution includes proposing new bilingual sense similarity algorithms and applying them to machine translation.",

        "It could be that the gains we obtained come simply from biasing the system against such rules.",
        "However, the results in table 6 show that this is unlikely to be the case: features that just count context words help very little.",
        "2) In addition to bilingual similarity, Alg2 relies on the degree of monolingual similarity between the sense of a source or target unit within a rule, and the sense of the unit in general.",
        "This has a bias in favor of less ambiguous rules, i.e. rules involving only units with closely related meanings.",
        "Although this bias is helpful on its own, possibly due to the mechanism we outline in section 6.1, it appears to have a synergistic effect when used along with the bilingual similarity feature.",
        "3) Finally, we note that many of the features we use for capturing similarity, such as the context \"the, Of for instantiations of X in the unit the X Of, are arguably more syntactic than semantic.",
