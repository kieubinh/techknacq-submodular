        "Motivation.",
        "The open community-maintained encyclopedia Wikipedia has not only turned the Internet into a more useful and linguistically diverse source of information, but is also increasingly being used in computational applications as a large-scale source of linguistic and encyclopedic knowledge.",
        "To allow cross-lingual navigation, Wikipedia offers cross-lingual interwiki links that for instance connect the Indonesian article about Albert Einstein to the corresponding articles in over 100 other languages.",
        "Such links are extraordinarily valuable for cross-lingual applications.",
        "In the ideal case, a set of articles connected directly or indirectly via such links would all describe the same entity or concept.",
        "Due to conceptual drift, different granularities, as well as mistakes made by editors, we frequently find concepts as different as economics and manager in the same connected component.",
        "Filtering out inaccurate links enables us to exploit Wikipedia's multi-linguality in a much safer manner and allows us to create a multilingual register of named entities.",
        "Contribution.",
        "Our research contributions are:",
        "1) We identify criteria to detect inaccurate connections in Wikipedia's cross-lingual link structure.",
        "2) We formalize the task of removing such links as an optimization problem.",
        "3) We introduce an algorithm that attempts to repair the cross-lingual graph in a minimally invasive way.",
        "This algorithm has an approximation guarantee with respect to optimal solutions.",
        "4) We show how this algorithm can be used to combine all editions of Wikipedia into a single large-scale multilingual register of named entities and concepts."

        "However, our framework is flexible enough to deal with more advanced weighting schemes, e.g. one could easily plug in cross-lingual measures of semantic relatedness between article texts.",
        "It turns out that an astonishing number of connected components in this graph harbour inaccurate links between articles.",
        "For instance, the Esperanto article 'Germana Imperiestro' is about German emporers and another Esperanto article 'Germana Imperiestra Regno' is about the German Empire, but, as of June 2010, both are linked to the English and German articles about the German Empire.",
        "Over time, some inaccurate links may be fixed, but in this and in large numbers of other cases, the imprecise connection has persisted for many years.",
        "In order to detect such cases, we need to have some way of specifying that two articles are likely to be distinct.",
        "Figure 1 shows a connected component that conflates the concept of television as a medium with the concept of TV sets as devices.",
        "Among other things, we would like to state that 'Television' and 'T.V.'",
        "are distinct from 'Television set' and 'TV set'.",
        "In general, we may have several sets of entities Di;1, ..., Di i., for which we assume that any two entities u,v from different sets are pairwise distinct with some degree of confidence or weight.",
        "In our example, Di;1 = {'Television','TV'} would be one set, and Di;2 = {'Television set','TV set' } would be another set, which means that we are assuming ' Television , for example, to be distinct from both ' Television set and ' TV set .",
        "Definition 1.",
        "(Distinctness Assertions) Given a set of nodes V, a distinctness assertion is a collection Di = (Di;1,..., Di;li) of pairwise disjoint (i.e. Dij n Dik = 0 for j = k) subsets Dij c V that expresses that any two nodes u G Dij, v G Dik from different subsets (j = k) are asserted to be distinct from each other with some weight w(Di) G R.",
        "We found that many components with inaccurate links can be identified automatically with the following distinctness assertions.",

        "(Distinctness between articles from the same Wikipedia edition) For each language-specific edition of Wikipedia, a separate assertion (Di;1, Di 2,... ) can be made, where each Di j contains an individual article together with its respective redirection pages.",
        "Two articles from the same Wikipedia very likely describe distinct concepts unless they are redirects of each other.",
        "For example, ' Georgia (country) is distinct from ' Georgia (U.S. State) .",
        "Additionally, there are also redirects that are clearly marked by a category or template as involving topic drift, e.g. redirects from songs to albums or artists, from products to companies, etc.",

        "Criterion 2.",

        "For instance, ' Category:Writers is distinct from ' Category:Writing .",
        "Criterion 3.",
        "(Distinctness for links with anchor identifiers) The English 'Division by zero', for instance, links to the German ' Null#Division .",
        "The latter is only a part of a larger article about the number zero in general, so we can make a distinctness assertion to separate ' Division by zero from ' Null .",
        "In general, for each interwiki link or redirection with an anchor identifier, we add an assertion (Di;1, Di 2) where Di;1 ,Di 2 represent the respective articles without anchor identifiers.",
        "These three types of distinctness assertions are instantiated for all articles and categories of all Wikipedia editions.",
        "The assertion weights are tunable; the simplest choice is using a uniform weight for all assertions (note that these weights are different from the edge weights in the graph).",
        "We will revisit this issue in our experiments.",
        "Given a graph G representing cross-lingual links between Wikipedia pages, as well as distinctness assertions D1,..., Dn with weights w(Di), we may find that nodes that are asserted to be distinct are in the same connected component.",
        "We can then try to apply repair operations to reconcile the graph s link structure with the distinctness asssertions and obtain global consistency.",
        "There are two ways to modify the input, and for each we can also consider the corresponding weights as a sort of cost that quantifies how much we are changing the original input:",
        "a) Edge cutting: We may remove an edge e G E from the graph, paying cost w(e).",
        "b) Distinctness assertion relaxation: We may remove a node v G V from a distinctness assertion Di, paying cost w(Di).",
        "Removing edges allows us to split connected components into multiple smaller components, thereby ensuring that two nodes asserted to be distinct are no longer connected directly or indirectly.",
        "In Figure 1, for instance, we could delete the edge from the Spanish ' TV set article to the Japanese ' television article.",
        "In constrast, removing nodes from distinctness assertions means that we decide to give up our claim of them being distinct, instead allowing them to share a connected component.",
        "Our reliance on costs is based on the assumption that the link structure or topology of the graph provides the best indication of which cross-lingual links to remove.",
        "In Figure 1, we have distinctness assertions between nodes in two densely connected clusters that are tied together only by a single spurious link.",
        "In such cases, edge removals can easily yield separate connected components.",
        "When, however, the two nodes are strongly connected via many different paths with high weights, we may instead opt for removing one of the two nodes from the distinctness assertion.",
        "The aim will be to balance the costs for removing edges from the graph with the costs for removing nodes from distinctness assertions to produce a consistent solution with a minimal total repair cost.",
        "We accommodate our knowledge about distinctness while staying as close as possible to what Wikipedia provides as input.",
