      "text": [
        "Many NLP systems use web-scale N-gram counts (Keller and Lapata, 2003; Nakov and Hearst, 2005; Brants et al., 2007).",
        "Lapata and Keller (2005) demonstrate good performance on eight tasks using unsupervised web-based models.",
        "They show web counts are superior to counts from a large corpus.",
        "Bergsma et al.",
        "(2009) propose unsupervised and supervised systems that use counts from Google's N-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "Web-based models perform particularly well on generation tasks, where systems choose between competing sequences of output text (such as different spellings), as opposed to analysis tasks, where systems choose between abstract labels (such as part-of-speech tags or parse trees).",
        "In this work, we address two natural and related questions which these previous studies leave open:",
        "1.",
        "Is there a benefit in combining web-scale counts with the features used in state-of-the-art supervised approaches?",
        "2.",
        "How well do web-based models perform on new domains or when labeled data is scarce?",
        "We address these questions on two generation and two analysis tasks, using both existing N-gram data and a novel web-scale N-gram corpus that includes part-of-speech information (Section 2).",
        "While previous work has combined web-scale features with other features in specific classification problems (Modjeska et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2005; Vadas and Curran, 2007b), we provide a multi-task, multi-domain comparison.",
        "Some may question why supervised approaches are needed at all for generation problems.",
        "Why not solely rely on direct evidence from a giant corpus?",
        "For example, for the task of prenominal adjective ordering (Section 3), a system that needs to describe a ball that is both big and red can simply check that big red is more common on the web than red big, and order the adjectives accordingly.",
        "It is, however, suboptimal to only use N-gram data.",
        "For example, ordering adjectives by direct web evidence performs 7% worse than our best supervised system (Section 3.2).",
        "No matter how large the web becomes, there will always be plausible constructions that never occur.",
        "For example, there are currently no pages indexed by Google with the preferred adjective ordering for bedraggled 56-year-old [professor].",
        "Also, in a particular domain, words may have a non-standard usage.",
        "Systems trained on labeled data can learn the domain usage and leverage other regularities, such as suffixes and transitivity for adjective ordering.",
        "With these benefits, systems trained on labeled data have become the dominant technology in academic NLP.",
        "There is a growing recognition, however, that these systems are highly domain dependent.",
        "For example, parsers trained on annotated newspaper text perform poorly on other genres (Gildea, 2001).",
        "While many approaches have adapted NLP systems to specific domains (Tsu-ruoka et al., 2005; McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2007; Daumé III, 2007; Rimell and Clark, 2008), these techniques assume the system knows on which domain it is being used, and that it has access to representative data in that domain.",
        "These assumptions are unrealistic in many real-world situations; for example, when automatically processing a heterogeneous collection of web pages.",
        "How well do supervised and unsupervised NLP systems perform when used uncustomized, out-of-the-box on new domains, and how can we best design our systems for robust open-domain performance?",
        "Our results show that using web-scale N-gram data in supervised systems advances the state-of-the-art performance on standard analysis and generation tasks.",
        "More importantly, when operating out-of-domain, or when labeled data is not plentiful, using web-scale N-gram data not only helps achieve good performance - it is essential."

        "We evaluate the benefit of N-gram data on multi-class classification problems.",

        "We use one in-domain and two out-of-domain test sets for each task.",
        "Statistical significance is assessed with McNemar's test, p<0.01.",
        "We provide results for unsupervised approaches and the majority-class baseline for each task.",
        "For our supervised approaches, we represent the examples as feature vectors, and learn a classifier on the training vectors.",
        "There are two feature classes: features that use N-grams (N-GM) and those that do not (Lex).",
        "N-gm features are real-valued features giving the log-count of a particular N-gram in the auxiliary web corpus.",
        "Lex features are binary features that indicate the presence or absence of a particular string at a given position in the input.",
        "The name Lex emphasizes that they identify specific lexical items.",
        "The instantiations of both types of features depend on the task and are described in the corresponding sections.",
        "Each classifier is a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), trained using LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) on the standard domain.",
        "We use the one-vs-all strategy when there are more than two classes (in Section 4).",
        "We plot learning curves to measure the accuracy of the classifier when the number of labeled training examples varies.",
        "The size of the N-gram data and its counts remain constant.",
        "We always optimize the SVM's (L2) regularization parameter on the in-domain development set.",
        "We present results with L2-SVM, but achieve similar results with L1-SVM and logistic regression.",
        "We study two generation tasks: prenominal adjective ordering (Section 3) and context-sensitive spelling correction (Section 4), followed by two analysis tasks: noun compound bracketing (Section 5) and verb part-of-speech disambiguation (Section 6).",
        "In each section, we provide references to the origin of the labeled data.",
        "For the out-of-domain Gutenberg and Medline data used in Sections 3 and 4, we generate examples our-selves.",
        "We chose Gutenberg and Medline in order to provide challenging, distinct domains from our training corpora.",
        "Our Gutenberg corpus consists of out-of-copyright books, automatically downloaded from the Project Gutenberg website.",
        "The Medline data consists of a large collection of online biomedical abstracts.",
        "We describe how labeled adjective and spelling examples are created from these corpora in the corresponding sections.",
        "The most widely-used N-gram corpus is the Google 5-gram Corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "For our tasks, we also use Google V2: a new N-gram corpus (also with N-grams of length one-to-five) that we created from the same one-trillion-word snapshot of the web as the Google 5-gram Corpus, but with several enhancements.",
        "These include: 1) Reducing noise by removing duplicate sentences and sentences with a high proportion of non-alphanumeric characters (together filtering about 80% of the source data), 2) pre-converting all digits to the 0 character to reduce sparsity for numeric expressions, and 3) including the part-of-speech (POS) tag distribution for each N-gram.",
        "The source data was automatically tagged with TnT (Brants, 2000), using the Penn Treebank tag set.",
        "Lin et al.",
        "(2010) provide more details on the",
        "provides our Gutenberg corpus, a link to Medline, and also the generated examples for both Gutenberg and Medline.",
        "N-gram data and N-gram search tools.",
        "The third enhancement is especially relevant here, as we can use the POS distribution to collect counts for N-grams of mixed words and tags.",
        "For example, we have developed an N-gram search engine that can count how often the adjective unprecedented precedes another adjective in our web corpus (113K times) and how often it follows one (11K times).",
        "Thus, even if we haven't seen a particular adjective pair directly, we can use the positional preferences of each adjective to order them.",
        "Early web-based models used search engines to collect N-gram counts, and thus could not use capitalization, punctuation, and annotations such as part-of-speech (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).",

        "In machine translation, if a noun has two adjective modifiers, they must be ordered correctly in the target language.",
        "Adjective ordering is also needed in Natural Language Generation systems that produce information from databases; for example, to convey information (in sentences) about medical patients (Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou, 1999).",
        "We focus on the task of ordering a pair of adjectives independently of the noun they modify and achieve good performance in this setting.",
        "Following the set-up of Malouf (2000), we experiment on the 263K adjective pairs Malouf extracted from the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "We use 90% of pairs for training, 5% for testing, and 5% for development.",

        "We create examples from all sequences of two adjectives followed by a noun.",
        "Like Malouf (2000), we assume that edited text has adjectives ordered fluently.",
        "We extract 13K and 9.1K out-of-domain pairs from Gutenberg and Medline, respectively.",
        "The input to the system is a pair of adjectives, (a1;a2), ordered alphabetically.",
        "The task is to classify this order as correct (the positive class) or incorrect (the negative class).",
        "Since both classes are equally likely, the majority-class baseline is around 50% on each of the three test sets.",
        "Our adjective ordering model with Lex features is a novel contribution of this paper.",
        "We begin with two features for each pair: an indicator feature for a1, which gets a feature value of +1, and an indicator feature for a2, which gets a feature value of – 1.",
        "The parameters of the model are therefore weights on specific adjectives.",
        "The higher the weight on an adjective, the more it is preferred in the first position of a pair.",
        "If the alphabetic ordering is correct, the weight on a1 should be higher than the weight on a2, so that the classifier returns a positive score.",
        "If the reverse ordering is preferred, a2 should receive a higher weight.",
        "Training the model in this setting is a matter of assigning weights to all the observed adjectives such that the training pairs are maximally ordered correctly.",
        "The feature weights thus implicitly produce a linear ordering of all observed adjectives.",
        "The examples can also be regarded as rank constraints in a discriminative ranker (Joachims, 2002).",
        "Transitivity is achieved naturally in that if we correctly order pairs a -< b and b -< c in the training set, then a -< c by virtue of the weights on a and c.",
        "While exploiting transitivity has been shown to improve adjective ordering, there are many conflicting pairs that make a strict linear ordering of adjectives impossible (Malouf, 2000).",
        "We therefore provide an indicator feature for the pair a1a2, so the classifier can memorize exceptions to the linear ordering, breaking strict order transitivity.",
        "Our classifier thus operates along the lines of rankers in the preference-based setting as described in Ailon and Mohri (2008).",
        "Finally, we also have features for all suffixes of length 1-to-4 letters, as these encode useful information about adjective class (Malouf, 2000).",
        "Like the adjective features, the suffix features receive a value of +1 for adjectives in the first position and – 1 for those in the second.",

        "We merge the counts for the adjectives occurring contiguously and separated by a comma.",
        "These are indubitably the most important N-gm features; we include them but also other, tag-based counts from Google V2.",
        "Raw counts include cases where one of the adjectives is not used as a modifier: \"the special present was\" vs. \"the present special issue.\"",
        "We include log-counts for the following, more-targeted patterns: c(a1 a2 N.*), c(a2 a1 N.*), c(DT a1 a2 N.*), c(DT a2 a1 N.*).",

        "*), c(J.",
        "* a2).",

        "The more frequent adjective occurs first 57% of the time.",
        "As in all tasks, the counts are features in a classifier, so the importance of the different patterns is weighted discriminatively during training.",
