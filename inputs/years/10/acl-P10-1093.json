        "In computational linguistics and information retrieval, Vector Space Models (Salton et al., 1975) and its variations - such as Word Space Models (Schütze, 1993), Hyperspace Analogue to Language (Lund and Burgess, 1996), or Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990) - have become a mainstream paradigm for text representation.",
        "Vector Space Models (VSMs) have been empirically justified by results from cognitive science (Gärdenfors, 2000).",
        "They embody the distributional hypothesis of meaning (Firth, 1957), according to which the meaning of words is defined by contexts in which they (co-)occur.",
        "Depending on the specific model employed, these contexts can be either local (the co-occurring words), or global (a sentence or a paragraph or the whole document).",
        "Indeed, VSMs proved to perform well in a number of tasks requiring computation of semantic relatedness between words, such as synonymy identification (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), automatic thesaurus construction (Grefenstette, 1994), semantic priming, and word sense disambiguation (Padö and Lapata, 2007).",
        "Until recently, little attention has been paid to the task of modeling more complex conceptual structures with such models, which constitutes a crucial barrier for semantic vector models on the way to model language (Widdows, 2008).",
        "An emerging area of research receiving more and more attention among the advocates of distributional models addresses the methods, algorithms, and evaluation strategies for representing compositional aspects of language within a VSM framework.",
        "This requires novel modeling paradigms, as most VSMs have been predominantly used for meaning representation of single words and the key problem of common bag-of-words-based VSMs is that word order information and thereby the structure of the language is lost.",
        "There are approaches under way to work out a combined framework for meaning representation using both the advantages of symbolic and distributional methods.",
        "Clark and Pulman (2007) suggest a conceptual model which unites symbolic and distributional representations by means of traversing the parse tree of a sentence and applying a tensor product for combining vectors of the meanings of words with the vectors of their roles.",
        "The model is further elaborated by Clark et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "To overcome the aforementioned difficulties with VSMs and work towards a tight integration of symbolic and distributional approaches, we propose a Compositional Matrix-Space Model (CMSM) which employs matrices instead of vectors and makes use of matrix multiplication as the one and only composition operation.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: We start by providing the necessary basic notions in linear algebra in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we give a formal account of the concept of compositionality, introduce our model, and argue for the plausibility of CMSMs in the light of structural and cognitive considerations.",
        "Section 4 shows how common VSM approaches to compositionality can be captured by CMSMs while Section 5 illustrates the capabilities of our model to likewise cover symbolic approaches.",
        "In Section 6, we demonstrate how several CMSMs can be combined into one model.",

        "Obviously, m-dimensional vectors can be seen as 1 x m matrices.",
        "A matrix can be transposed by exchanging columns and rows: given the n x m matrix M, its transposed version MT is a m x n matrix defined by MT(i, j) = M(j, i).",
        "Linear Mappings.",
        "Beyond being merely arraylike data structures, matrices correspond to certain type of functions, so-called linear mappings, having vectors as in-and output.",

        "Permutations.",
        "Given a natural number n, a permutation on {1... n} is a bijection (i.e., a mapping that is one-to-one and onto) O : {1... n} – {1... n}.",

        "The underlying principle of compositional semantics is that the meaning of a sentence (or a word phrase) can be derived from the meaning of its constituent tokens by applying a composition operation.",
        "More formally, the underlying idea can be described as follows: given a mapping [ • ]] : I – S from a set of tokens (words) I into some semantical space S (the elements of which we will simply call \"meanings\"), we find a semantic composition operation x: S* – S mapping sequences of meanings to meanings such that the meaning of a sequence of tokens t1t2 ■ ■ ■ cn can be obtained by applying x to the sequence [criMo^]] ■ ■ ■ [[cn]].",

        "At the first glance, the underlying encodings of word semantics as well as the composition operations differ significantly.",
        "However, we argue that a great variety of them can be incorporated - and even freely inter-combined - into a unified model where the semantics of simple tokens and complex phrases is expressed by matrices and the composition operation is standard matrix multiplication.",
        "More precisely, in Compositional Marix-Space Models, we have S = Rnxn, i.e. the semantical space consists of quadratic matrices, and the composition operator x coincides with matrix multiplication as introduced in Section 2.",
        "In the following, we will provide diverse arguments illustrating that CMSMs are intuitive and natural.",
        "Most linear-algebra-based operations that have been proposed to model composition in language models are associative and commutative.",
        "Thereby, they realize a multiset (or bag-of-words) semantics that makes them insensitive to structural differences of phrases conveyed through word order.",
        "While associativity seems somewhat acceptable and could be defended by pointing to the streamlike, sequential nature of language, commutativity seems way less justifiable, arguably.",
        "As mentioned before, matrix multiplication is associative but non-commutative, whence we propose it as more adequate for modeling compositional semantics of language.",
        "From a very abstract and simplified perspective, CMSMs can also be justified neurologically.",
        "Suppose the mental state of a person at one specific moment in time can be encoded by a vector v of numerical values; one might, e.g., think of the level of excitation of neurons.",
        "Then, an external stimulus or signal, such as a perceived word, will result in a change of the mental state.",
        "Thus, the external stimulus can be seen as a function being applied to v yielding as result the vector v' that corresponds to the persons mental state after receiving the signal.",
        "Therefore, it seems sensible to associate with every signal (in our case: token c) a respective function (a linear mapping, represented by a matrix M = [c]] that maps mental states to mental states (i.e. vectors v to vectors v' = vM).",
        "Consequently, the subsequent reception of inputs c, c' associated to matrices M and M' will transform a mental vector v into the vector (vM)M' which by associativity equals v(MM').",
        "Therefore, MM' represents the mental state transition triggered by the signal sequence cc'.",
        "Naturally, this consideration carries over to sequences of arbitrary length.",
        "This way, abstracting from specific initial mental state vectors, our semantic space S can be seen as a function space of mental transformations represented by matrices, whereby matrix multiplication realizes subsequent execution of those transformations triggered by the input token sequence.",

        "We are not the first to suggest an extension of classical VSMs to matrices.",
        "Distributional models based on matrices or even higher-dimensional arrays have been proposed in information retrieval (Gao et al., 2004; Antonellis and Gallopoulos, 2006).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, the approach of realizing compositionality via matrix multiplication seems to be entirely original.",
        "Among the early attempts to provide more compelling combinatory functions to capture word order information and the non-commutativity of linguistic compositional operation in VSMs is the work of Kintsch (2001) who is using a more sophisticated addition function to model predicate-argument structures in VSMs.",
        "Mitchell and Lapata (2008) formulate semantic composition as a function m = f (w1, w2, R, K) where R is a relation between w1 and w2 and K is additional knowledge.",
        "They evaluate the model with a number of addition and multiplication operations for vector combination on a sentence similarity task proposed by Kintsch (2001).",
        "Widdows (2008) proposes a number of more advanced vector operations well-known from quantum mechanics, such as tensor product and convolution, to model composition in vector spaces.",
        "He shows the ability of VSMs to reflect the relational and phrasal meanings on a simplified analogy task.",
        "Giesbrecht (2009) evaluates four vector composition operations (+, ©, tensor product, convolution) on the task of identifying multi-word units.",
        "The evaluation results of the three studies are not conclusive in terms of which vector operation performs best; the different outcomes might be attributed to the underlying word space models; e.g., the models of Widdows (2008) and Giesbrecht (2009) feature dimensionality reduction while that of Mitchell and Lapata (2008) does not.",
        "In the light of these findings, our CMSMs provide the benefit of just one composition operation that is able to mimic all the others as well as combinations thereof."

        "We have introduced a generic model for compo-sitionality in language where matrices are associated with tokens and the matrix representation of a token sequence is obtained by iterated matrix multiplication.",
        "We have given algebraic, neurological, and psychological plausibility indications in favor of this choice.",
        "We have shown that the proposed model is expressive enough to cover and combine a variety of distributional and symbolic aspects of natural language.",
        "This nourishes the hope that matrix models can serve as a kind of linguafranca for compositional models.",
        "This having said, some crucial questions remain before CMSMs can be applied in practice: How to acquire CMSMs for large token sets and specific purposes?",
        "We have shown the value and expressivity of CMSMs by providing carefully hand-crafted encodings.",
        "In practical cases, however, the number of token-to-matrix assignments will be too large for this manual approach.",
        "Therefore, methods to (semi-)automatically acquire those assignments from available data are required.",
        "To this end, machine learning techniques need to be investigated with respect to their applicability to this task.",
        "Presumably, hybrid approaches have to be considered, where parts of the matrix representation are learned whereas others are stipulated in advance guided by external sources (such as lexical information).",

        "In this setting, data sparsity may be overcome through tensor methods: given a set T of tokens together with the matrix assignment [[]] : T – Rnxn, this datastructure can be conceived as a 3-dimensional array (also known as tensor) of size n x n x |T| wherein the single token-matrices can be found as slices.",
        "Then tensor decomposition techniques can be applied in order to find a compact representation, reduce noise, and cluster together similar tokens (Tucker, 1966; Rendle et al., 2009).",
        "First evaluation results employing this approach to the task of free associations are reported by Gies-brecht (2010).",
        "How does linearity limit the applicability of CMSMs?",
        "In Section 3, we justified our model by taking the perspective of tokens being functions which realize mental state transitions.",
        "Yet, using matrices to represent those functions restricts them to linear mappings.",
        "Although this restriction brings about benefits in terms of computability and theoretical accessibility, the limitations introduced by this assumption need to be investigated.",
        "Clearly, certain linguistic effects (like a-posteriori disambiguation) cannot be modeled via linear mappings.",
        "Instead, we might need some in-between application of simple nonlinear functions in the spirit of quantum-collapsing of a \"superposed\" mental state (such as the winner takes it all, survival of the top-k vector entries, and so forth).",
        "Thus, another avenue of further research is to generalize from the linear approach."
