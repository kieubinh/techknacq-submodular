        "Given an aligned corpus of tree pairs, we might want to learn a mapping between the paired trees.",
        "Such induction of tree mappings has application in a variety of natural-language-processing tasks including machine translation, paraphrase, and sentence compression.",
        "The induced tree mappings can be expressed by synchronous grammars.",
        "Where the tree pairs are isomorphic, synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) may suffice, but in general, non-isomorphism can make the problem of rule extraction difficult (Galley and McKeown, 2007).",
        "More expressive formalisms such as synchronous tree-substitution (Eisner, 2003) or tree-adjoining grammars may better capture the pairings.",
        "In this work, we explore techniques for inducing synchronous tree-substitution grammars (STSG) using as a testbed application extractive sentence compression.",
        "Learning an STSG from aligned trees is tantamount to determining a segmentation of the trees into elementary trees of the grammar along with an alignment of the elementary trees (see Figure 1 for an example of such a segmentation), followed by estimation of the weights for the extracted tree pairs.",
        "These elementary tree pairs serve as the rules of the extracted grammar.",
        "For SCFG, segmentation is trivial – each parent with its immediate children is an elementary tree – but the formalism then restricts us to deriving isomorphic tree pairs.",
        "STSG is much more expressive, especially if we allow some elementary trees on the source or target side to be unsynchronized, so that insertions and deletions can be modeled, but the segmentation and alignment problems become nontrivial.",
        "Previous approaches to this problem have treated the two steps – grammar extraction and weight estimation – with a variety of methods.",
        "One approach is to use word alignments (where these can be reliably estimated, as in our testbed application) to align subtrees and extract rules (Och and Ney, 2004; Galley et al., 2004) but this leaves open the question of finding the right level of generality of the rules – how deep the rules should be and how much lexicalization they should involve – necessitating resorting to heuristics such as minimality of rules, and leading to large grammars.",
        "Once a given set of rules is extracted, weights can be imputed using a discriminative approach to maximize the (joint or conditional) likelihood or the classification margin in the training data (taking or not taking into account the derivational ambiguity).",
        "This option leverages a large amount of manual domain knowledge engineering and is not in general amenable to latent variable problems.",
        "A simpler alternative to this two step approach is to use a generative model of synchronous derivation and simultaneously segment and weight the elementary tree pairs to maximize the probability of the training data under that model; the simplest exemplar of this approach uses expectation maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "This approach has two frailties.",
        "First, EM search over the space of all possible rules is computationally impractical.",
        "Second, even if such a search were practical, the method is degenerate, pushing the probability mass towards larger rules in order to better approximate the empirical distribution of the data (Goldwater et al., 2006; DeNero et al., 2006).",
        "Indeed, the optimal grammar would be one in which each tree pair in the training data is its own rule.",
        "Therefore, proposals for using EM for this task start with a precomputed subset of rules, and with EM used just to assign weights within this grammar.",
        "In summary, previous methods suffer from problems of narrowness of search, having to restrict the space of possible rules, and overfit-ting in preferring overly specific grammars.",
        "We pursue the use of hierarchical probabilistic models incorporating sparse priors to simultaneously solve both the narrowness and overfitting problems.",
        "Such models have been used as generative solutions to several other segmentation problems, ranging from word segmentation (Goldwa-ter et al., 2006), to parsing (Cohn et al., 2009; Post and Gildea, 2009) and machine translation (DeNero et al., 2008; Cohn and Blunsom, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2009).",
        "Segmentation is achieved by introducing a prior bias towards grammars that are compact representations of the data, namely by enforcing simplicity and sparsity: preferring simple rules (smaller segments) unless the use of a complex rule is evidenced by the data (through repetition), and thus mitigating the overfitting problem.",
        "A Dirichlet process (DP) prior is typically used to achieve this interplay.",
        "Interestingly, sampling-based nonparametric inference further allows the possibility of searching over the infinite space of grammars (and, in machine translation, possible word alignments), thus sidestepping the narrowness problem outlined above as well.",
        "In this work, we use an extension of the aforementioned models of generative segmentation for STSG induction, and describe an algorithm for posterior inference under this model that is tailored to the task of extractive sentence compression.",
        "This task is characterized by the availability of word alignments, providing a clean testbed for investigating the effects of grammar extraction.",
        "We achieve substantial improvements against a number of baselines including EM, support vector machine (SVM) based discriminative training, and variational Bayes (VB).",
        "By comparing our method to a range of other methods that are subject differentially to the two problems, we can show that both play an important role in performance limitations, and that our method helps address both as well.",
        "Our results are thus not only encouraging for grammar estimation using sparse priors but also illustrate the merits of nonparametric inference over the space of grammars as opposed to sparse parametric inference with a fixed grammar.",
        "In the following, we define the task of extractive sentence compression and the Bayesian STSG model, and algorithms we used for inference and prediction.",
        "We then describe the experiments in extractive sentence compression and present our results in contrast with alternative algorithms.",
        "We conclude by giving examples of compression patterns learned by the Bayesian method."

        "Synchronous tree-substitution grammar is a formalism for synchronously generating a pair of non-isomorphic source and target trees (Eisner, 2003).",
        "Every grammar rule is a pair of elementary trees aligned at the leaf level at their frontier nodes, which we will denote using the form Cs/ct – es/et, y (indices s for source, t for target) where cs, ct are root nonterminals of the elementary trees es, et respectively and y is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the frontier nodes in es and et.",
        "For example, the rule can be used to delete a subtree rooted at PP.",
        "We use square bracketed indices to represent the alignment y of frontier nodes – NP[i aligns with NP[x], VP[2] aligns with VP[2], NP[e] aligns with the special symbol e denoting a deletion from the source tree.",
        "Symmetrically e-aligned target nodes are used to represent insertions into the target tree.",
        "Similarly, the rule can be used to continue deriving the deleted subtree.",
        "See Figure 1 for an example of how an STSG with these rules would operate in synchronously generating our example sentence pair.",
        "STSG is a convenient choice of formalism for a number of reasons.",
        "First, it eliminates the isomorphism and strong independence assumptions of SCFGs.",
        "Second, the ability to have rules deeper than one level provides a principled way of modeling lexicalization, whose importance has been emphasized (Galley and McKeown, 2007; Yamangil and Nelken, 2008).",

        "(Eisner, 2003) However, as noted earlier, EM is subject to the narrowness and overfitting problems.",
        "Both of these issues can be addressed by taking a nonparametric Bayesian approach, namely, assuming that the elementary tree pairs are sampled from an independent collection of Dirichlet process (DP) priors.",
        "We describe such a process for sampling a corpus of tree pairs t.",
        "For all pairs of root labels c = cs /ct that we consider, where up to one of cs or ct can be e (e.g., S / S, NP / e), we sample a sparse discrete distribution Gc over infinitely many elementary tree pairs e = es/et sharing the common root c from a DP where the DP has the concentration parameter accontrolling the sparsity of Gc, and the base distribution P0 (• | c) is a distribution over novel elementary tree pairs that we describe more fully shortly.",

        "Synchronous rules For the case where neither cs nor ct are the special symbol e, the base distribution first generates es and et independently, and then samples an alignment between the frontier nodes.",
        "Given a nonterminal, an elementary tree is generated by first making a decision to expand the nonterminal (with probability ßc) or to leave it as a frontier node (1 – ßc).",
        "If the decision to expand was made, we sample an appropriate rule from a PCFG which we estimate ahead of time from the training corpus.",
        "We expand the nonterminal using this rule, and then repeat the same procedure for every child generated that is a nonterminal until there are no generated nonterminal children left.",
        "This is done independently for both es and et.",
        "Finally, we sample an alignment between the frontier nodes uniformly at random out of all possible alingments.",
        "Deletion/insertion rules If ct = e, that is, we have a deletion rule, we need to generate e = es/e.",
        "(The insertion rule case is symmetric.)",
        "The base distribution generates es using the same process described for synchronous rules above.",
        "Then with probability 1 we align all frontier nodes in es with e. In essence, this process generates TSG rules, rather than STSG rules, which are used to cover deleted (or inserted) subtrees.",
        "This simple base distribution does nothing to enforce an alignment between the internal nodes of es and et.",
        "One may come up with more sophisticated base distributions.",
        "However the main point of the base distribution is to encode a controllable preference towards simpler rules; we therefore make the simplest possible assumption.",

        "The conditional prior of the i-th elementary tree pair given previously generated ones e<i = e1,...,ej_1 is given by where nei denotes the number of times ei occurs in e<i.",
        "Since the collapsed model is exchangeable in the ei, this formula forms the backbone of the inference procedure that we describe next.",
        "It also makes clear DP's inductive bias to reuse elementary tree pairs.",
        "We use Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, to sample from the posterior (3).",
        "A derivation e of the corpus t is completely specified by an alignment between the source nodes and the corresponding target nodes (as well as e on either side), which we take to be the state of the sampler.",

        "(2006).",
        "Our sampling updates are extensions of those used by Cohn and Blunsom (2009) in MT, but are tailored to our task of extractive sentence compression.",
        "In our task, no target node can align with e (which would indicate a subtree insertion), and barring unary branches no source node i can align with two different target nodes j and j' at the same time (indicating a tree expansion).",
        "Rather, the configurations of interest are those in which only source nodes i can align with e, and two source nodes i and i' can align with the same target node j.",
        "Thus, the alignments of interest are not arbitrary relations, but (partial) functions from nodes in es to nodes in et or e. We therefore sample in the direction from source to target.",
        "In particular, we visit every tree pair and each of its source nodes i, and update its alignment by selecting between and within two choices: (a) unaligned, (b) aligned with some target node j or e. The number of possibilities j in (b) is significantly limited, firstly by the word alignment (for instance, a source node dominating a deleted subspan cannot be aligned with a target node), and secondly by the current alignment of other nearby aligned source nodes.",
        "(See Cohn and Blunsom (2009) for details of matching spans under tree constraints.)",
        "More formally, let eM be the elementary tree pair rooted at the closest aligned ancestor i' of node i when it is unaligned; and let and eBbe the elementary tree pairs rooted at i' and i respectively when i is aligned with some target node j or e. Then, by exchangeability of the elementary trees sharing the same root label, and using (4), we have ncA + acA ncB + acB where the counts ne., nc.",

        "See Figure 2 for an illustration of the sampling updates.",
        "It is important to note that the sampler described can move from any derivation to any other derivation with positive probability (if only, for example, by virtue of fully merging and then resegment-ing), which guarantees convergence to the posterior (3).",
        "However some of these transition probabilities can be extremely small due to passing through low probability states with large elementary trees; in turn, the sampling procedure is prone to local modes.",
        "In order to counteract this and to improve mixing we used simulated annealing.",
        "The probability mass function (5-7) was raised to the power 1 /T with T dropping linearly from T = 5 to T = 0.",
        "Furthermore, using a final temperature of zero, we recover a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate which we denote eMAP.",

        "The VB algorithm requires a simple update to the M-step formulas for EM where the expected rule counts are normalized, such that instead of updating the rule weight in the t-th iteration as in the following where nc e represents the expected count of rule c – e, and K is the total number of ways to rewrite c, we now take into account our DP(ac,P0(- | c)) prior in (1), which, when truncated to a finite grammar, reduces to a K-dimensional Dirichlet prior with parameter acP0 (• | c).",
        "Thus in VB we perform a variational E-step with the subprobabilities given by where ^ denotes the digamma function.",
        "(Liu and Gildea, 2009) (See MacKay (1997) for details.)",
        "Hyperparameters were handled the same way as for GS.",
        "Instead of selecting a single model on the development set, here we provide the whole spectrum of models and their performances in order to better understand their comparative behavior.",
        "In Figure 3 we plot RelF1 on the test set versus compression rate and compare GS, EM, and VB (ß = 0.1 fixed, (a, 5) ranging in [10_, 10] x (1, 2]).",
        "Overall, we see that GS maintains roughly the same level of precision as EM (despite its larger compression rates) while achieving an improvement in recall, consequently performing at a higher RelF1 level.",
        "We note that VB somewhat bridges the gap between GS and EM, without quite reaching GS performance.",
        "We conclude that the mitigation of the two factors (narrowness and overfitting) both contribute to the performance gain of GS.",
        "In order to provide some insight into the grammar extracted by GS, we list in Tables (3) and (4) high probability subtree-deletion rules expanding categories ROOT / ROOT and S / S, respectively.",
        "Of especial interest are deep lexicalized rules such as a pattern of compression used many times in the BNC in sentence pairs such as \"NPR's Anne Garrels reports\" / \"Anne Garrels reports\".",
        "Such an informative rule with nontrivial collocation (between the possessive marker and the word \"reports\") would be hard to extract heuristically and can only be extracted by reasoning across the training examples."
