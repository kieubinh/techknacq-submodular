        "In recent years, there has been increasing interest in statistical approaches to semantic parsing.",
        "However, most of this research has focused on supervised methods requiring large amounts of labeled data.",
        "The supervision was either given in the form of meaning representations aligned with sentences (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Mooney, 2007) or in a somewhat more relaxed form, such as lists of candidate meanings for each sentence (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Chen and Mooney, 2008) or formal representations of the described world state for each text (Liang et al., 2009).",
        "Such annotated resources are scarce and expensive to create, motivating the need for unsupervised or semi-supervised techniques (Poon and Domingos, 2009).",
        "However, unsupervised methods have their own challenges: they are not always able to discover semantic equivalences of lexical entries or logical forms or, on the contrary, cluster semantically different or even opposite expressions (Poon and Domingos, 2009).",
        "Unsupervised approaches can only rely on distributional similarity of contexts (Harris, 1968) to decide on semantic relatedness of terms, but this information may be sparse and not reliable (Weeds and Weir, 2005).",
        "For example, when analyzing weather forecasts it is very hard to discover in an unsupervised way which ofthe expressions among \"south wind\", \"wind from west\" and \"southerly\" denote the same wind direction and which are not, as they all have a very similar distribution of their contexts.",
        "The same challenges affect the problem of identification of argument roles and predicates.",
        "In this paper, we show that groups of unanno-tated texts with overlapping and non-contradictory semantics provide a valuable source of information.",
        "This form of weak supervision helps to discover implicit clustering of lexical entries and predicates, which presents a challenge for purely unsupervised techniques.",
        "We assume that each text in a group is independently generated from a full latent semantic state corresponding to the group.",
        "Importantly, the texts in each group do not have to be paraphrases of each other, as they can verbalize only specific parts (aspects) of the full semantic state, yet statements about the same aspects must not contradict each other.",
        "Simultaneous inference of the semantic state for the non-contradictory and semantically overlapping documents would restrict the space of compatible hypotheses, and, intuitively, 'easier' texts in a group will help to analyze the 'harder' ones.",
        "As an illustration of why this weak supervision may be valuable, consider a group of two non-contradictory texts, where one text mentions \"2.2 bn GBP decrease in profit\", whereas another one includes a passage \"profit fell by 2.2 billion pounds\".",

        "the word \"fell\" before, it is likely to align these phrases to the same semantic form because of similarity of their arguments.",
        "And this alignment would suggest that \"fell\" and \"decrease\" refer to the same process, and should be clustered together.",
        "This would not happen for the pair \"fell\" and \"increase\" as similarity of their arguments would normally entail contradiction.",
        "Similarly, in the example mentioned earlier, when describing a forecast for a day with expected south winds, texts in the group can use either \"south wind\" or \"southerly\" to indicate this fact but no texts would verbalize it as \"wind from west\", and therefore these expressions will be assigned to different semantic clusters.",
        "However, it is important to note that the phrase \"wind from west\" may still appear in the texts, but in reference to other time periods, underlying the need for modeling alignment between grouped texts and their latent meaning representation.",
        "As much of the human knowledge is re-described multiple times, we believe that non-contradictory and semantically overlapping texts are often easy to obtain.",
        "For example, consider semantic analysis of news articles or biographies.",
        "In both cases we can find groups of documents referring to the same events or persons, and though they will probably focus on different aspects and have different subjective passages, they are likely to agree on the core information (Shinyama and Sekine, 2003).",
        "Alternatively, if such groupings are not available, it may still be easier to give each semantic representation (or a state) to multiple annotators and ask each of them to provide a textual description, instead of annotating texts with semantic expressions.",
        "The state can be communicated to them in a visual or audio form (e.g., as a picture or a short video clip) ensuring that their interpretations are consistent.",
        "Unsupervised learning with shared latent semantic representations presents its own challenges, as exact inference requires marginalization over possible assignments of the latent semantic state, consequently, introducing non-local statistical dependencies between the decisions about the semantic structure of each text.",
        "We propose a simple and fairly general approximate inference algorithm for probabilistic models of semantics which is efficient for the considered model, and achieves favorable results in our experiments.",
        "In this paper, we do not consider models which aim to produce complete formal meaning of text (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Mooney, 2007; Poon and Domingos, 2009), instead focusing on a simpler problem studied in (Liang et al., 2009).",
        "They investigate grounded language ac-qmsition set-up and assume that semantics (world state) can be represented as a set of records each consisting of a set of fields.",
        "Their model segments text into utterances and identifies records, fields and field values discussed in each utterance.",
        "Therefore, one can think of this problem as an extension of the semantic role labeling problem (Carreras and Marquez, 2005), where predicates (i.e. records in our notation) and their arguments should be identified in text, but here arguments are not only assigned to a specific role (field) but also mapped to an underlying equivalence class (field value).",
        "For example, in the weather forecast domain field sky cover should get the same value given expressions \"overcast\" and \"very cloudy\" but a different one if the expres-",

        "as south wind blows at about 20 mph/ The sky is heavy.-'",
        "sions are \"clear\" or \"sunny\".",
        "This model is hard to evaluate directly as text does not provide information about all the fields and does not necessarily provide it at the sufficient granularity level.",
        "Therefore, it is natural to evaluate their model on the database-text alignment problem (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), i.e. measuring how well the model predicts the alignment between the text and the observable records describing the entire world state.",
        "We follow their set-up, but assume that instead of having access to the full semantic state for every training example, we have a very small amount of data annotated with semantic states and a larger number of unannotated texts with non-contradictory semantics.",
        "We study our set-up on the weather forecast data (Liang et al., 2009) where the original textual weather forecasts were complemented by additional forecasts describing the same weather states (see figure 1 for an example).",
        "The average overlap between the verbalized fields in each group of non-contradictory forecasts was below 35%, and more than 60% of fields are mentioned only in a single forecast from a group.",
        "Our model, learned from 100 labeled forecasts and 259 groups of unanno-tated non-contradictory forecasts (750 texts in total), achieved 73.9% Fi.",
        "This compares favorably with 69.1% shown by a semi-supervised learning approach, though, as expected, does not reach the score of the model which, in training, observed semantics states for all the 750 documents (77.7%",
        "Fi).",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we describe our inference algorithm for groups of non-contradictory documents.",

        "The semantics m can be represented either as a logical formula (see, e.g., (Poon and Domingos, 2009)) or as a set of field values if database records are used as a meaning representation (Liang et al., 2009).",
        "The alignment a defines how semantics is verbalized in the text w, and it can be represented by a meaning derivation tree in case of full semantic parsing (Poon and Domingos, 2009) or, e.g., by a hierarchical segmentation into utterances along with an utterance-field alignment in a more shallow variation of the problem.",

        "As common for complex generative models, the most challenging part is the computation of the posterior distributions P(a, m\\ w) on the E-step which, depending on the underlying model P(m, a, w), may require approximate inference.",

        "However, this approach is still expensive even for simple models, both because of the need to represent distributions over m and also because of the large number of iterations of message exchange needed to reach convergence (if it converges).",

        "The original dataset contains 22,146 texts of 28.7 words on average, there are 12 types of records (predicates) and 36.0 records per forecast on average.",
        "We randomly chose 100 texts along with their world states to be used as the labeled data.",
        "To produce groups of non-contradictory texts we have randomly selected a subset of weather states, represented them in a visual form (icons accompanied by numerical and symbolic parameters) and then manually annotated these illustrations.",
        "These newly-produced forecasts, when combined with the original texts, resulted in 259 groups of non-contradictory texts (650 texts, 2.5 texts per group).",
        "An example of such a group is given in igure 1.",
        "The dataset is relatively noisy: there are inconsistencies due to annotation mistakes (e.g., number distortions), or due to different perception of the weather by the annotators (e.g., expressions such as 'warm' or 'cold' are subjective).",
        "The overlap between the verbalized ields in each group was estimated to be below 35%.",
        "Around 60% of fields are mentioned only in a single forecast from a group, consequently, the texts cannot be regarded as paraphrases of each other.",
        "The test set consists of 150 texts, each corresponding to a different weather state.",
        "Note that during testing we no longer assume that documents share the state, we treat each document in isolation.",
        "We aimed to preserve approximately the same proportion of new and original examples as we had in the training set, therefore, we combined 50 texts originally present in the weather dataset with additional 100 newly-produced texts.",
        "We annotated these 100 texts by aligning each line to one or more records, whereas for the original texts the alignments were already present.",
        "Following Liang et al.",
        "(2009) we evaluate the models on how well they predict these alignments.",
        "When estimating the model parameters, we followed the training regime prescribed in (Liang et al., 2009).",
        "Namely, 5 iterations of EM with a basic model (with no segmentation or coherence modeling), followed by 5 iterations of EM with the model which generates ields independently and, at last, 5 iterations with the full model.",
        "Only then, in the semi-supervised learning scenarios, we added unlabeled data and ran 5 additional iterations of EM.",
        "Instead of prohibiting records from crossing punctuation, as suggested by Liang et al.",
        "(2009), in our implementation we disregard the words not attached to speciic ields (attached to the null-field, see section 3.1) when computing spans of records.",
        "To speed-up training, only a single record of each type is allowed to be generated when running inference for unlabeled examples on the Estep of the EM algorithm, as it signiicantly reduces the search space.",
        "Similarly, though we preserved all records which refer to the irst time period, for other time periods we removed all the records which declare that the corresponding event (e.g., rain or snowfall) is not expected to happen.",
        "This preprocessing results in the oracle recall of 93%.",
        "We compare our approach (Semi-superv, non-contr) with two baselines: the basic supervised training on 100 labeled forecasts (Supervised BL) and with the semi-supervised training which disregards the non-contradiction relations (Semi-superv BL).",
        "The learning regime, the inference procedure and the texts for the semi-supervised baseline were identical to the ones used for our approach, the only difference is that all the documents were modeled as independent.",
        "Additionally, we report the results of the model trained with all the 750 texts labeled (Supervised UB), its scores can be regarded as an upper bound on the results of the semi-supervised models.",
        "The results are reported in table 1.",
        "Our training strategy results in a substantially more accurate model, outperforming both the supervised and semi-supervised baselines.",
        "Surprisingly, its precision is higher than that of the model trained on 750 labeled examples, though admittedly it is achieved at a very different recall level.",
        "The estimation of the model with our approach takes around one hour on a standard desktop PC, which is comparable to 40 minutes required to train the semi-supervised baseline.",
        "In these experiments, we consider the problem of predicting alignment between text and the corresponding observable world state.",
        "The direct evaluation of the meaning recognition (i.e. semantic parsing) accuracy is not possible on this dataset, as the data does not contain information which ields are discussed.",
        "Even if it would pro-",
        "Table 2: Top 5 words in the word distribution for ield mode of record sky cover, function words and punctuation are omitted.",
        "vide this information, the documents do not verbalize the state at the necessary granularity level to predict the ield values.",
        "For example, it is not possible to decide to which bucket of the ield sky cover the expression 'cloudy' refers to, as it has a relatively uniform distribution across 3 (out of 4) buckets.",
        "The problem of predicting text-meaning alignments is interesting in itself, as the extracted alignments can be used in training of a statistical generation system or information extractors, but we also believe that evaluation on this problem is an appropriate test for the relative comparison of the semantic analyzers' performance.",
        "Additionally, note that the success of our weakly-supervised scenario indirectly suggests that the model is suficiently accurate in predicting semantics of an unlabeled text, as otherwise there would be no useful information passed in between semantically overlapping documents during learning and, consequently, no improvement from sharing the state.",
        "To conirm that the model trained by our approach indeed assigns new words to correct ields and records, we visualize top words for the ield characterizing sky cover (table 2).",
        "Note that the words \"sun\", \"cloudiness\" or \"gaps\" were not appearing in the labeled part of the data, but seem to be assigned to correct categories.",
        "However, correlation between rain and overcast, as also noted in (Liang et al., 2009), results in the wrong assignment of the rain-related words to the ield value corresponding to very cloudy weather."
