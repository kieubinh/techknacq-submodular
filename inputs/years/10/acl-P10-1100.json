        "A script is \"a standardized sequence of events that describes some stereotypical human activity such as going to a restaurant or visiting a doctor\" (Barr and Feigenbaum, 1981).",
        "Scripts are fundamental pieces of commonsense knowledge that are shared between the different members of the same culture, and thus a speaker assumes them to be tacitly understood by a hearer when a scenario related to a script is evoked: When one person says \"I'm going shopping\", it is an acceptable reply to say \"did you bring enough money?",
        "\", because the SHOPPING script involves a 'payment' event, which again involves the transfer of money.",
        "It has long been recognized that text understanding systems would benefit from the implicit information represented by a script (Cullingford, 1977; Mueller, 2004; Miikkulainen, 1995).",
        "There are many other potential applications, including automated storytelling (Swanson and Gordon, 2008), anaphora resolution (McTear, 1987), and information extraction (Rau et al., 1989).",
        "However, it is also commonly accepted that the large-scale manual formalization of scripts is in-feasible.",
        "While there have been a few attempts at doing this (Mueller, 1998; Gordon, 2001), efforts in which expert annotators create script knowledge bases clearly don't scale.",
        "The same holds true of the script-like structures called \"scenario frames\" in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "There has recently been a surge of interest in automatically learning script-like knowledge resources from corpora (Chambers and Jurafsky, efforts have achieved impressive results, they are limited by the very fact that a lot of scripts - such as shopping - are shared implicit knowledge, and their events are therefore rarely elaborated in text.",
        "In this paper, we propose a different approach to the unsupervised learning of script-like knowledge.",
        "We focus on the temporal event structure of scripts; that is, we aim to learn what phrases can describe the same event in a script, and what constraints must hold on the temporal order in which these events occur.",
        "We approach this problem by asking non-experts to describe typical event sequences in a given scenario over the Internet.",
        "This allows us to assemble large and varied collections of event sequence descriptions (ESDs), which are focused on a single scenario.",
        "We then compute a temporal script graph for the scenario by identifying corresponding event descriptions using a Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithm from bioin-formatics, and converting the alignment into a graph.",
        "This graph makes statements about what phrases can describe the same event of a scenario, and in what order these events can take place.",
        "Crucially, our algorithm exploits the sequential structure of the ESDs to distinguish event descriptions that occur at different points in the script storyline, even when they are semantically similar.",
        "We evaluate our script graph algorithm on ten unseen scenarios, and show that it significantly outperforms a clustering-based baseline.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "We will first position our research in the landscape of related work in Section 2.",
        "We will then define how we understand scripts, and what aspect of scripts we model here, in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 describes our data collection method, and Section 5 explains how we use Multiple Sequence Alignment to compute a temporal script graph.",
        "We evaluate our system in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7."

        "Approaches to learning script-like knowledge are not new.",
        "For instance, Mooney (1990) describes an early attempt to acquire causal chains, and Smith and Arnold (2009) use a graph-based algorithm to learn temporal script structures.",
        "However, to our knowledge, such approaches have never been shown to generalize sufficiently for wide coverage application, and none of them was rigorously evaluated.",
        "More recently, there have been a number of approaches to automatically learning event chains from corpora (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008b; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Manshadi et al., 2008).",
        "These systems typically employ a method for classifying temporal relations between given event descriptions (Chambers et al., 2007; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008a; Mani et al., 2006).",
        "They achieve impressive performance at extracting high-level descriptions of procedures such as a criminal process.",
        "Because our approach involves directly asking people for event sequence descriptions, it can focus on acquiring specific scripts from arbitrary domains, and we can control the level of granularity at which scripts are described.",
        "Furthermore, we believe that much information about scripts is usually left implicit in texts and is therefore easier to learn from our more explicit data.",
        "Finally, our system automatically learns different phrases which describe the same event together with the temporal ordering constraints.",
        "Jones and Thompson (2003) describe an approach to identifying different natural language realizations for the same event considering the temporal structure of a scenario.",
        "However, they don't aim to acquire or represent the temporal structure of the whole script in the end.",
        "In its ability to learn paraphrases using Multiple Sequence Alignment, our system is related to Barzilay and Lee (2003).",
        "Unlike Barzilay and Lee, we do not tackle the general paraphrase problem, but only consider whether two phrases describe the same event in the context of the same script.",
        "Furthermore, the atomic units of our alignment process are entire phrases, while in Barzilay and Lee's setting, the atomic units are words.",
        "Finally, it is worth pointing out that our work is placed in the growing landscape of research that attempts to learn linguistic information out of data directly collected from users over the Internet.",
        "Some examples are the general acquisition of commonsense knowledge (Singh et al., 2002), the use of browser games for that purpose (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2008), and the collaborative annotation of anaphoric reference (Chamberlain et al., 2009).",
        "In particular, the use of the Amazon Mechanical Turk, which we use here, has been evaluated and shown to be useful for language processing tasks (Snow et al., 2008)."

        "Before we delve into the technical details, let us establish some terminology.",
        "In this paper, we distinguish scenarios, as classes of human activities, from scripts, which are stereotypical models of the internal structure of these activities.",
        "Where eating in a restaurant is a scenario, the script describes a number of events, such as ordering and leaving, that must occur in a certain order in order to constitute an eating in a restaurant activity.",
        "The classical perspective on scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977) has been that next to defining some events with temporal constraints, a script also defines their participants and their causal connections.",
        "Here we focus on the narrower task of learning the events that a script consists of, and of modeling and learning the temporal ordering constraints that hold between them.",
        "Formally, we will specify a script (in this simplified sense) in terms of a directed graph Gs = (Es,Ts), where Es is a set of nodes representing the events of a scenario s, and Ts is a set of edges (ej, ek) indicating that the event ej typically happens before ek in s. We call Gs the temporal script graph (TSG) for s.",
        "Each event in a TSG can usually be expressed with many different natural-language phrases.",
        "As the TSG in Fig. 3 illustrates, the first event in the script for eating in a fast food restaurant can be equivalently described as 'walk to the counter' or 'walk up to the counter'; even phrases like 'walk into restaurant', which would not usually be taken as paraphrases of these, can be accepted as describing the same event in the context"

        "We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect the data.",
        "For every scenario, we asked 25 people to enter a typical sequence of events in this scenario, in temporal order and in \"bullet point style\".",
        "We required the annotators to enter at least 5 and at most 6 events.",
        "Participants were allowed to skip a scenario if they felt unable to enter events for it, but had to indicate why.",
        "We did not restrict the participants (e.g. to native speakers).",
        "In this way, we collected 493 ESDs for the 22 scenarios.",
        "People used the possibility to skip a form 57 times.",
        "The most frequent explanation for this was that they didn't know how a certain scenario works: The scenario with the highest proportion of skipped forms was create a homepage, whereas making scrambled eggs was the only one in which nobody skipped a form.",
        "Because we did not restrict the participants' inputs, the data was fairly noisy.",
        "For the purpose of this study, we manually corrected the data for orthography and filtered out forms that were written in broken English or did not comply with the task (e.g. when users misunderstood the scenario, or did not list the event descriptions in temporal order).",

        "We will now describe how we compute a temporal script graph out of the collected data.",

        "First, we identify phrases from different ESDs that describe the same event by computing a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of all ESDs for the same scenario.",
        "Then we postpro-cess the MSA and convert it into a temporal script graph, which encodes and generalizes the temporal information contained in the original ESDs.",
        "The problem of computing Multiple Sequence Alignments comes from bioinformatics, where it is typically used to find corresponding elements in proteins or DNA (Durbin et al., 1998).",
        "A sequence alignment algorithm takes as its input some sequences s1,...,sn G S* over some alphabet S, along with a cost function cm : Sx S – R for substitutions and gap costs cgap G R for insertions and deletions.",
        "In bioinformatics, the elements of S could be nucleotides and a sequence could be a DNA sequence; in our case, S contains the individual event descriptions in our data, and the sequences are the ESDs.",
        "A Multiple Sequence Alignment A of these sequences is then a matrix as in Fig. 2: The i-th column of A is the sequence Sj, possibly with some gaps (\"0\") interspersed between the symbols of Si, such that each row contains at least one non-gap.",
        "If a row contains two non-gaps, we take these symbols to be aligned; aligning a non-gap with a gap can be thought of as an insertion or deletion.",
        "Each sequence alignment A can be assigned a cost c(A) in the following way:",
        "where S0 is the number of gaps in A, n is the number of rows and m the number of sequences.",
        "In other words, we sum up the alignment cost for any two symbols from S that are aligned with each other, and add the gap cost for each gap.",
        "There is an algorithm that computes cheapest pairwise alignments (i.e. n = 2) in polynomial time (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970).",
        "For n > 2, the problem is NP-complete, but there are efficient algorithms that approximate the cheapest MSAs by aligning two sequences first, considering the result as a single sequence whose elements are pairs, and repeating this process until all sequences are incorporated in the MSA (Higgins and Sharp, 1988).",
        "In order to apply MSA to the problem of aligning ESDs, we choose S to be the set of all individual event descriptions in a given scenario.",
        "Intuitively, we want the MSA to prefer the alignment of two phrases if they are semantically similar, i.e. it should cost more to align 'exit' with 'eat' than 'exit' with 'leave'.",

In terms of the MSA, this means that if a phrase from u comes from the same column as a phrase from v, there are at most some gaps between them.",

        "Then we combine the event descriptions from u and v and cluster the resulting set.",
        "If the union has more clusters than either u or v, we assume the nodes to be too dissimilar for merging.",

        "• v has only one child and is the only child of",

        "One node created by the node merging step was the top left one, which combines one original node containing 'walk into restaurant' and another with 'go to restaurant'.",
        "The graph mostly groups phrases together into event nodes quite well, although there are some exceptions, such as the 'collect utensils' node.",
        "Similarly, the temporal information in the graph is pretty accurate.",

        "On the technical side, we intend to address the question of detecting participants of the scripts and integrating them into the graphs, Further, we plan to move on to more elaborate data structures than our current TSGs, and then identify and represent script elements like optional events, alternative events for the same step, and events that can occur in arbitrary order.",
        "Because our approach gathers information from volunteers on the Web, it is limited by the knowledge of these volunteers.",
        "We expect it will perform best for general commonsense knowledge; culture-specific knowledge or domain-specific expert knowledge will be hard for it to learn.",
        "This limitation could be addressed by targeting specific groups of online users, or by complementing our approach with corpus-based methods, which might perform well exactly where ours does not."
