        "In this paper we present experiments with an automatic system for semantic role labeling (SRL) that is designed to model aspects of human language acquisition.",
        "This simplified SRL system is inspired by the syntactic bootstrapping theory, and by an account of syntactic bootstrapping known as 'structure-mapping' (Fisher, 1996; Gillette et al., 1999; Lidz et al., 2003).",
        "Syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that young children use their very partial knowledge of syntax to guide sentence comprehension.",
        "The structure-mapping account makes three key assumptions: First, sentence comprehension is grounded by the acquisition of an initial set of concrete nouns.",
        "Nouns are arguably less dependent on prior linguistic knowledge for their acquisition than are verbs; thus children are assumed to be able to identify the referents of some nouns via cross-situational observation (Gillette et al., 1999).",
        "Second, these nouns, once identified, yield a skeletal sentence structure.",
        "Children treat each noun as a candidate argument, and thus interpret the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate-argument structure (Fisher, 1996).",
        "Third, children represent sentences in an abstract format that permits generalization to new verbs (Gertner et al., 2006).",
        "The structure-mapping account of early syntactic bootstrapping makes strong predictions, including predictions of tell-tale errors.",
        "In the sentence \"Ellen and John laughed\", an intransitive verb appears with two nouns.",
        "If young children rely on representations of sentences as simple as an ordered set of nouns, then they should have trouble distinguishing such sentences from transitive sentences.",
        "Experimental evidence suggests that they do: 21-month-olds mistakenly interpreted word order in sentences such as \"The girl and the boy kradded\" as conveying agent-patient roles (Gertner and Fisher, 2006).",
        "Previous computational experiments with a system for automatic semantic role labeling (BabySRL: (Connor et al., 2008)) showed that it is possible to learn to assign basic semantic roles based on the shallow sentence representations proposed by the structure-mapping view.",
        "Furthermore, these simple structural features were robust to drastic reductions in the integrity of the semantic-role feedback (Connor et al., 2009).",
        "These experiments showed that representations of sentence structure as simple as 'first of two nouns' are useful, but the experiments relied on perfect knowledge of arguments and predicates as a start to classification.",
        "Perfect built-in parsing finesses two problems facing the human learner.",
        "The first problem involves classifying words by part-of-speech.",
        "Proposed solutions to this problem in the NLP and human language acquisition literatures focus on distributional learning as a key data source (e.g., (Mintz, 2003; Johnson, 2007)).",
        "Importantly, infants are good at learning distributional patterns (Gomez and Gerken, 1999; Saffran et al., 1996).",
        "Here we use a fairly standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to generate clusters of words that occur in similar distributional contexts in a corpus of input sentences.",
        "The second problem facing the learner is more contentious: Having identified clusters of distributionally-similar words, how do children figure out what role these clusters of words should play in a sentence interpretation system?",
        "Some clusters contain nouns, which are candidate arguments; others contain verbs, which take arguments.",
        "How is the child to know which are which?",
        "In order to use the output of the HMM tagger to process sentences for input to an SRL model, we must find a way to automatically label the clusters.",
        "Our strategies for automatic argument and predicate identification, spelled out below, reflect core claims of the structure-mapping theory: (1) The meanings of some concrete nouns can be learned without prior linguistic knowledge; these concrete nouns are assumed based on their meanings to be possible arguments; (2) verbs are identified, not primarily by learning their meanings via observation, but rather by learning about their syntactic argument-taking behavior in sentences.",
        "By using the HMM part-of-speech tagger in this way, we can ask how the simple structural features that we propose children start with stand up to reductions in parsing accuracy.",
        "In doing so, we move to a parser derived from a particular theoretical account of how the human learner might classify words, and link them into a system for sentence comprehension."

        "We model language learning as a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task (Carreras and Marquez, 2004).",
        "This allows us to ask whether a learner, equipped with particular theoretically-motivated representations of the input, can learn to understand sentences at the level of who did what to whom.",
        "The architecture of our system is similar to a previous approach to modeling early language acquisition (Connor et al., 2009), which is itself based on the standard architecture of a full SRL system (e.g. (Punyakanok et al., 2008)).",
        "This basic approach follows a multi-stage pipeline, with each stage feeding in to the next.",
        "The stages are: (1) Parsing the sentence, (2) Identifying potential predicates and arguments based on the parse, (3) Classifying role labels for each potential argument relative to a predicate, (4) Applying constraints to find the best labeling of arguments for a sentence.",
        "In this work we attempt to limit the knowledge available at each stage to the automatic output of the previous stage, constrained by knowledge that we argue is available to children in the early stages of language learning.",
        "In the parsing stage we use an unsupervised parser based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), modeling a simple 'predict the next word' parser.",
        "Next the argument identification stage identifies HMM states that correspond to possible arguments and predicates.",
        "The candidate arguments and predicates identified in each input sentence are passed to an SRL classifier that uses simple abstract features based on the number and order of arguments to learn to assign semantic roles.",
        "As input to our learner we use samples of natural child directed speech (CDS) from the CHILDES corpora (MacWhinney, 2000).",
        "During initial unsupervised parsing we experiment with incorporating knowledge through a combination of statistical priors favoring a skewed distribution of words into classes, and an initial hard clustering of the vocabulary into function and content words.",
        "The argument identifier uses a small set of frequent nouns to seed argument states, relying on the assumptions that some concrete nouns can be learned as a prerequisite to sentence interpretation, and are interpreted as candidate arguments.",
        "The SRL classifier starts with noisy largely unsupervised argument identification, and receives feedback based on annotation in the PropBank style; in training, each word identified as an argument receives the true role label of the phrase that word is part of.",
        "This represents the assumption that learning to interpret sentences is naturally supervised by the fit of the learner's predicted meaning with the referential context.",
        "The provision of perfect 'gold-standard' feedback overestimates the real child's access to this supervision, but allows us to investigate the consequences of noisy argument identification for SRL performance.",
        "We show that even with imperfect parsing, a learner can identify useful abstract patterns for sentence interpretation.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to 'close the loop' of this system, by using learning in the SRL system to improve the initial unsupervised parse and argument identification.",
        "The training data were samples of parental speech to three children (Adam, Eve, and Sarah; (Brown, 1973)), available via CHILDES.",
        "The SRL training corpus consists of parental utterances in samples Adam 01-20 (child age 2;3 - 3;1), Eve01-18 (1;6 - 2;2), and Sarah01-83 (2;3 - 3;11).",
        "All verb-containing utterances without symbols indicating disfluencies were automatically parsed with the Charniak parser (Charniak, 1997), annotated using an existing SRL system (Punyakanok et al., 2008) and then errors were hand-corrected.",
        "The final annotated sample contains about 16,730 propositions, with 32,205 arguments."

        "Johnson (2007) observed that EM tends to create word clusters of uniform size, which does not reflect the way words cluster into parts of speech in natural languages.",
        "The addition of priors biasing the system toward a skewed allocation of words to classes can help.",
        "The second parser was an 80 state HMM trained with Variational Bayes EM (VB) incorporating Dirichlet priors (Beal, 2003).",
        "In the third and fourth parsers we experiment with enriching the HMM POS-tagger with other psycholinguistically plausible knowledge.",
        "Words of different grammatical categories differ in their phonological as well as in their distributional properties (e.g., (Kelly, 1992; Monaghan et al., 2005; Shi et al., 1998)); combining phonological and distributional information improves the clustering of words into grammatical categories.",
        "The phonological difference between content and function words is particularly striking (Shi et al., 1998).",
        "Even newborns can categorically distinguish content and function words, based on the phonological difference between the two classes (Shi et al., 1999).",
        "Human learners may treat content and function words as distinct classes from the start.",
        "To implement this division into function and content words, we start with a list of function word POS tags and then find words that appear predominantly with these POS tags, using tagged WSJ data (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "We allocated a fixed number of states for these function words, and left the rest of the states for the rest of the words.",
        "This amounts to initializing the emission matrix for the HMM with a block structure; words from one class cannot be emitted by states allocated to the other class.",
        "This trick has been used before in speech recognition work (Rabiner, 1989), and requires far fewer resources than the full tagging dictionary that is often used to intelligently initialize an unsupervised POS classifier (e.g. (Brill, 1997; Toutanova and Johnson, 2007;",
        "Ravi and Knight, 2009)).",
        "Because the function and content word preclus-tering preceded parameter estimation, it can be combined with either EM or VB learning.",
        "Although this initial split forces sparsity on the emission matrix and allows more uniform sized clusters, Dirichlet priors may still help, if word clusters within the function or content word subsets vary in size and frequency.",

        "Note that incorporating function word precluster-ing allows both EM and VB algorithms to achieve the same performance with an order of magnitude fewer sentences.",
        "We first evaluate these parsers (the first stage of our SRL system) on unsupervised POS tagging.",
        "Figure 1 shows the performance of the four systems using Variation of Information to measure match between gold states and unsupervised parsers as we vary the amount of text they receive.",
        "Each point on the graph represents the average result over 10 runs of the HMM with different samples of the unlabeled CDS.",
        "Another common measure for unsupervised POS (when there are more states than tags) is a many to one greedy mapping of states to tags.",

        "On the structure-mapping account, learners identify verbs, and begin to determine their meanings, based on sentence structure cues.",
        "Verbs take noun arguments; thus, learners could learn which words are verbs by detecting each verb's syntactic argument-taking behavior.",
        "Experimental evidence provides some support for this procedure: 2-year-olds keep track of the syntactic structures in which a new verb appears, even without a concurrent scene that provides cues to the verb's semantic content (Yuan and Fisher, 2009).",

        "These patterns contrast with the behavior of the VerbPos features: When the BabySRL was trained with perfect parsing, VerbPos promoted agentpatient interpretations of transitive test sentences, and did so even more successfully than Noun-Pat features did, reflecting the usefulness of position relative to the verb in understanding English sentences.",

        "Relative to the lexical baseline, NounPat features fared well: they promoted the assignment of A0-A1 interpretations to transitive sentences, across all parser versions and both sets of known nouns.",
        "Both VB estimation and the content-function word split increased the ability of NounPat features to learn that the first of two nouns was an agent, and the second a patient.",
        "The NounPat features also promote the predicted error with two-noun intransitive sentences (Figures 4(b), 4(d)).",
        "Despite the relatively low accuracy of predicate identification noted in section 4.1, the VerbPos features did succeed in promoting an A0A1 interpretation for transitive sentences containing novel verbs relative to the lexical baseline.",
        "In every case the performance of the Combined model that includes both Noun-Pat and VerbPos features exceeds the performance of either NounPat or VerbPos alone, suggesting both contribute to correct predictions for transitive sentences.",
        "However, the performance of VerbPos features did not improve with parsing accuracy as did the performance of the NounPat features.",
        "Most strikingly, the VerbPos features did not eliminate the predicted error with two-noun intransitive sentences, as shown in panels 4(b) and 4(d).",

        "Our results suggest that multiple simple representations of sentence structure could coexist in the child's system for sentence comprehension; representations that will ultimately turn out to be powerful guides to role identification may be less powerful early in acquisition because of the noise introduced by the unsupervised parsing.",
        "The next step is to 'close the loop', using higher level semantic feedback to improve the earlier argument identification and parsing stages.",
        "Perhaps with the help of semantic feedback the system can automatically improve predicate identification, which in turn allows it to correct the observed intransitive sentence error.",
        "This approach will move us closer to the goal of using initial simple structural patterns and natural observation of the world (semantic feedback) to bootstrap more and more sophisticated representations of linguistic structure."
