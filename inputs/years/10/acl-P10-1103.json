        "First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour.",
        "This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods.",
        "We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward.",
        "The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios.",
        "We are also the first to show that adding predictive \"lower level\" features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences.",

        "Work on evaluating SDS suggests that the Information Presentation (IP) phase is the primary contributor to dialogue duration (Walker et al., 2001), and as such, is a central aspect of SDS design.",
        "During this phase the system returns a set of items (\"hits\") from a database, which match the user's current search constraints.",
        "An inherent problem in this task is the trade-off between presenting \"enough\" information to the user (for example helping them to feel confident that they have a good overview of the search results) versus keeping the utterances short and understandable.",
        "In the following we show that IP for SDS can be treated as a data-driven joint optimisation problem, and that this outperforms a supervised model of human 'wizard' behaviour on a particular IP task (presenting sets of search results to a user).",
        "A similar approach has been applied to the problem of Referring Expression Generation in dialogue (Janarthanam and Lemon, 2010).",
        "Broadly speaking, IP for SDS can be divided into two main steps: 1) IP strategy selection and 2) Content or Attribute Selection.",
        "Prior work has presented a variety of IP strategies for structuring information (see examples in Table 1).",
        "For example, the summary strategy is used to guide the user's \"focus of attention\".",
        "It draws the user's attention to relevant attributes by grouping the current results from the database into clusters, e.g. (Polifroni and Walker, 2008; Demberg and Moore, 2006).",
        "Other studies investigate a compare strategy, e.g. (Walker et al., 2007; Nakatsu, 2008), while most work in SDS uses a recommend strategy, e.g. (Young et al., 2007).",
        "In a previous proof-of-concept study (Rieser and Lemon, 2009) we show that each of these strategies has its own strengths and drawbacks, dependent on the particular context in which information needs to be presented to a user.",
        "Here, we will also explore possible combinations of the strategies, for example sumMary followed by recommend, e.g. (Whittaker et al., 2002), see Figure 1.",
        "Prior work on Content or Attribute Selection has used a \"Summarize and Refine\" approach (Po-lifroni and Walker, 2008; Polifroni and Walker, 2006; Chung, 2004).",
        "This method employs utility-based attribute selection with respect to how each attribute (e.g. price or food type in restaurant search) of a set of items helps to narrow down the user's goal to a single item.",
        "Related work explores a user modelling approach, where attributes are ranked according to user preferences (Dem-berg and Moore, 2006; Winterboer et al., 2007).",
        "Our data collection (see Section 3) and training environment incorporate these approaches.",
        "The work in this paper is the first to apply a data-driven method to this whole decision space (i.e. combinations of Information Presentation strategies as well as attribute selection), and to show the utility of both lower-level features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) and higher-level features (e.g. from Dialogue Management) for this problem.",
        "Previous work has only focused on individual aspects of the problem (e.g. how many attributes to generate, or when to use a summary), using a pipeline model for SDS with DM features as input, and where NLG has no knowledge of lower level features (e.g. behaviour of the realiser).",
        "In Section 4.3 we show that lower level features significantly influence users' ratings of IP strategies.",
        "In the following we use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a statistical planning framework (Sutton and Barto, 1998) to explore the contextual features for making these decisions, and propose a new joint optimisation method for IP strategies combining content structuring and attribute selection."

        "Other recent approaches describe this task as planning, e.g. (Koller and Petrick, 2008), or as contextual decision making according to a cost function (van Deemter, 2009), but not as a statistical planning problem, where uncertainty in the stochastic environment is explicitly modelled.",
        "Below, we apply this framework to Information Presentation strategies in SDS using Reinforcement Learning, where the example task is to present a set of search results (e.g. restaurants) to users.",
        "In particular, we consider 7 possible policies for structuring the content (see Figure 1): Recommending one single item, comparing two items, summarising all of them, or ordered combinations of those actions, e.g. first summarise all the retrieved items and then recommend one of them.",

        "The learned RL policies show that lower level features are important in gaining significant improvements over the baseline.",
        "The more complex the scenario, the harder it is to gain higher rewards for the policies in general (as more variation is introduced), but the relative improvement in rewards also increases with complexity: the baseline does not adapt well to the variations in lower level features whereas RL learns to adapt to the more challenging scenarios.",
        "An overview of the range of different IP strategies learned for each setup can be found in Table 4.",

        "Also see Table 4.",
        "Note that the WoZ strategy behaves as described in Figure 3.",
        "In addition, the RL policy for scenario 1.2 learns to adapt to a more complex scenario: the number of attributes requested by the DM and produced by the stochastic sentence realiser.",
        "It learns to generate the whole sequence (summary+compare+recommend) if #attributes is low (<3), because the overall generated utterance (final #sentences) is still relatively short.",
        "Otherwise the policy is similar to the one for scenario 1.1.",
        "The RL policies for jointly optimising IP strategy and attribute selection learn to select the number of attributes according to the generation scenarios 2.1-2.4.",
        "For example, the RL policy learned for scenario 2.1 generates a recommend with 5 attributes if the database hits are low (<13).",
        "Otherwise, it will start with a summary using 2 attributes.",
        "If the user is predicted to narrow down his focus after the summary, the policy continues with a compare using 1 attribute only, otherwise it helps the user by presenting 4 attributes.",
        "It then continues with recommend(5), and stops as soon as the user is predicted to select one item.",
        "The learned policy for scenario 2.1 generates 5.85 attributes per NLG turn on average (i.e. the cumulative number of attributes generated in the whole NLG sequence, where the same attribute may be repeated within the sequence).",
        "This strategy primarily adapts to the variations from the user simulation (tri-gram model).",
        "For scenario 2.2 the average number of attributes is higher (7.15) since the number of attributes helps to narrow down the user's focus via the DBhits/attribute relationship specified in section 4.2.",
        "For scenario 2.3 fewer attributes are generated on average (3.14), since here the number of attributes influences the sentence realiser, i.e. fewer attributes results in fewer sentences, but does not impact the user's focus.",
        "In scenario 2.4 all the conditions mentioned above influence the learned policy.",
        "The average number of attributes selected is still low (3.19).",

        "We have presented a new data-driven method for Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems using a statistical optimisation framework for content structure planning and attribute selection.",
        "This work is the first to apply a data-driven optimisation method to the IP decision space, and to show the utility of both lower-level and higher-level features for this problem.",
        "We collected data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and showed that human \"wizards\" mostly pay attention to 'high-level' features from Dialogue Management.",
        "The WoZ data was used to build statistical models of user reactions to IP strategies, and a data-driven reward function for Reinforcement Learning (RL).",
        "We show that lower level features significantly influence users' ratings of IP strategies.",
        "We compared a model of human behaviour (the 'human wizard baseline') against policies optimised using Reinforcement Learning, in a variety of scenarios.",
        "Our optimised policies significantly outperform the IP structuring and attribute selection present in the WoZ data, especially when performing in complex generation scenarios which require adaptation to, e.g. number of database results, utterance length, etc.",
        "While the human wizards were able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward.",
        "We have also shown that adding predictive \"lower level\" features, e.g. from the NLG realiser and a user reaction model, is important for learning optimal IP strategies according to user preferences.",
        "Future work could include the predicted TTS quality (Boidin et al., 2009) as a feature.",
        "We are now working on testing the learned policies with real users, outside of laboratory conditions, using a restaurant-guide SDS, deployed as a VOIP service.",
        "Previous work in SDS has shown that results for Dialogue Management obtained with simulated users are able to transfer to evaluations with real users (Lemon et al., 2006).",
        "This methodology provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem, which has previously been treated as a module following dialogue management with no access to lower-level context features.",
        "The data-driven planning method applied here promises a significant upgrade in the performance of generation modules, and thereby of Spoken Dialogue Systems in general."
