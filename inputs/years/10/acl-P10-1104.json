        "However, most such work makes little contact with empirical data (de Boer and Zuidema, 2009).",
        "As pointed out by Choudhury (2007), most computational work on language change deals with data from cases of change either not at all, or at a relatively high level.",
        "spirit, we use data from an ongoing stress shift in English noun/verb (N/V) pairs.",
        "Because stress has been listed in dictionaries for several centuries, we are able to trace stress longitudinally and at the level of individual words, and observe dynamics significantly more complicated than in changes previously considered in the computational literature.",
        "In §2, we summarize aspects of the dynamics to be accounted for by any computational model of the stress shift.",
        "We also discuss proposed sources of these dynamics from the literature, based on experimental work by psychologists and linguists.",
        "In §3^k we develop models in the mathematical framework of dynamical systems (DS), which over the past 15 years has been used to model the interaction between language learning and language change in a variety of settings (Niyogi and Berwick, 1995; Niyogi and Berwick, 1996; Niyogi, 2006; Komarova et al., 2001; Yang, 2001; Yang, 2002; Mitchener, 2005; Pearl and Weinberg, 2007).",
        "We interpret 6 aspects of the N/V stress dynamics in DS terms; this gives a set of 6 desired properties to which any DS model's dynamics can be compared.",
        "We consider 5 models of language learning by individuals, based on the experimental findings relevant to the N/V stress shift, and evaluate the population-level dynamics of the dynamical system model resulting from each against the set of desired properties.",
        "We are thus able to reason about which theories of the source of language change – considered as hypotheses about how individuals learn – lead to the populationlevel patterns observed in change."

        "We use the notation {Nstress,Vstress} to denote the stress of an N/V pair, with 1=aa, 2=aa.",
        "Of the four logically possible stress patterns, all current N/V pairs follow one of the 3 patterns shown in Table 1: {1,1}, {1,2}, {2,2}.No pair follows the fourth possible pattern, {2,1}.",
        "N/V pairs have been undergoing variation and change between these 3 patterns since Middle English (ME, c. 1066-1470), especially change to {1,2}.",
        "The vast majority of stress shifts occurred after 1570 (Minkova, 1997), when the first dictionary listing English word stresses was published (Levens, 1570).",
        "Many dictionaries from the 17th century on list word stresses, making it possible to trace change in the stress of individual N/V pairs in considerable detail.",
        "Expanding on dictionary pronunciation data collected by Sherman (1975) for the period 15701800, we have collected a corpus of pronunciations of 149 N/V pairs, as listed in 62 British dictionaries, published 1570-2007.",

        "Stability Previous work on stress in N/V pairs (Sherman, 1975; Phillips, 1984) has emphasized change, in particular {2,2} – -{1,2} (the most common change).",
        "However, an important aspect of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability: most N/V pairs do not show variation or change.",
        "The 149 N/V pairs, used both in our corpus and in previous work, were chosen by Sherman (1975) as those most likely to have undergone change, and thus are not suitable for studying how stable the three attested stress patterns are.",
        "In a random sample of N/V pairs (not the set of 149) in use over a fixed time period (1700-2007), we find that only 12% have shown variation or change in stress (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010).",
        "Most pairs maintain the {1,1}, {2,2}, or {1,2} stress pattern for hundreds of years.",
        "A model of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pair stress must explain how it can be the case both that some pairs show variation and change, and that many do not.",
        "Variation N/V pair stress patterns show both synchronic and diachronic variation.",
        "Synchronically, there is variation at the population level in the stress of some N/V pairs at any given time; this is reflected by the inclusion of more than one pronunciation for some N/V pairs in many dictionaries.",
        "An important question for modeling is whether there is variation within individual speakers.",
        "We show in (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010) that there is, for present-day American English speakers, using a corpus of radio speech.",
        "For several N/V pairs which have currently variable pronunciation, 1/3 of speakers show variation in the stress of the N form.",
        "Metrical evidence from poetry suggests that individual variation also existed in the past; the best evidence is for Shakespeare, who shows variation in the stress of over 20 N/V pairs (Kokeritz, 1953).",
        "Diachronically, a relevant question for modeling is whether all variation is short-lived, or whether stable variation is possible.",
        "A particular type of stable variation is in fact observed relatively often in the corpus: either the N or V form stably vary (Fig.",

        "In (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010), we give preliminary evidence from realtime frequency trajectories (for <10 N/V pairs) that it is not lower frequency per se which triggers change to {1,2}, but falling frequency.",
        "For example, change in combat from {1,1 } – {1,2} around 1800 (Fig.",
        "1(b)) coincides with falling word frequency from 1775-present.",
        "The most salient facts about English N/V pair stress are that (a) change is most often to {1,2} (b) the {2,1} pattern never occurs.",
        "We summarize two types of explanation for these facts from the experimental literature, each of which exemplifies a commonly-proposed type of explanation for phonological change.",
        "In both cases, there is experimental evidence for biases in present-day English speakers reflecting (a-b).",
        "We assume that these biases have been active over the course of the N/V stress shift, and can thus be seen as possible sources of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs.",
        "Analogy/Lexicon In historical linguistics, analogical changes are those which make \"...related forms more similar to each other in their phonetic (and morphological) structure\" (Hock, 1991).Proposed causes for analogical change thus often involve a speaker's production and perception of a form being influenced by similar forms in their lexicon.",
        "The English lexicon shows a broad tendency, which we call Ross' generalization, which could be argued to be driving analogical change to { 1,2}, and acting against the unobserved stress pattern {2,1}: \"primary stress in English nouns is farther to the left than primary stress in English verbs\" (Ross, 1973).",
        "Change to {1,2} could be seen as motivated by Ross' generalization, and {2,1 } made impossible by it.",
        "The argument is lent plausibility by experimental evidence that Ross' Generalization is reflected in production and perception.",
        "English listeners strongly prefer the typical stress pattern (N=aa or V=aa) in novel English disyllables (Guion et al., 2003), and process atypical disyllables (N=aa or V=aa) more slowly than typical ones (Arciuli and",
        "Cupples, 2003).",
        "Mistransmission An influential line of research holds that many phonological changes are based in asymmetric transmission errors: because of articulatory or perceptual factors, listeners systematically mishear some sound a as ß, but rarely mishear ß as a.",

        "Mistransmission-based explanations were pioneered by Ohala (1981, et seq.",
        "), and are the subject of much recent work (reviewed by Hans-",
        "For English N/V pairs, M. Kelly and collaborators have shown mistransmission effects which they propose are responsible for the directionality of the most common type of N/V pair stress shifts ({1,1}, {2,2} – {1,2}), based on \"rhythmic context\" (Kelly, 1988; Kelly and Bock, 1988; Kelly, 1989).",
        "Word stress is misperceived more often as initial in \"trochaic-biasing\" contexts, where the preceding syllable is weak or the following syllable is heavy; and more often as final in analogously \"iambic-biasing\" contexts.",
        "Nouns occur more frequently in trochaic contexts, and verbs more frequently in iambic contexts; there is thus pressure for the V forms of {1,1} pairs to be misperceived as a&, and for the N forms of {2,2} pairs to be misperceived as a a."

        "We believe detailed datasets are potentially very useful for evaluating and differentiating between proposed computational models of change.",
        "This paper is a first attempt to integrate detailed data with a range of DS models.",
        "We have only considered some schematic properties of the dynamics observed in our dataset, and used these to qualitatively compare each model's predictions to the dynamics.",
        "Future work should consider the dynamics in more detail, develop more complex models (for example, by relaxing the infinite-population assumption, allowing for stochastic dynamics), and quantitatively compare model predictions and observed dynamics.",
        "We were able to reason about how assumptions about individual learning affect population dynamics by analyzing a range of simple, related models.",
        "This approach is pursued in more depth in the larger set of models considered in (Sonderegger, 2009).",
        "Our use of model comparison contrasts with most recent computational work on change, where a small number (1-2) of very complex models are analyzed, allowing for much more detailed models of language learning and usage than those considered here (e.g. Choudhury et al., 2006; Minett & Wang, 2008; Baxter et al., 2009; Landsbergen, 2009).",
        "An advantage of our approach is an enhanced ability to evaluate a range of proposed causes for a particular case of language change.",
        "By using simple models, we were able to consider a range of learning algorithms corresponding to different explanations for the observed diachronic dynamics.",
        "What makes this a useful exercise is the fundamentally non-trivial map, illustrated by Models 1-5, between individual learning and population-level dynamics.",
        "Although the type of individual learning assumed in each model was chosen with the same patterns of change in mind, and despite the simplicity of the models used, the resulting population-level dynamics differ greatly.",
        "This is an important point given that proposed explanations for change (e.g., mistrans-mission and analogy) operate at the level of individuals, while the phenomena being explained (patterns of change, or particular changes) are aspects of the population-level dynamics."
