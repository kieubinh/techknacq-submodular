        "A crowning achievement of historical linguistics is the comparative method (Ohala, 1993), wherein linguists use word similarity to elucidate the hidden phonological and morphological processes which govern historical descent.",
        "The comparative method requires reasoning about three important hidden variables: the overall phylogenetic guide tree among languages, the evolutionary parameters of the ambient changes at each branch, and the cognate group structure that specifies which words share common ancestors.",
        "All three of these variables interact and inform each other, and so historical linguists often consider them jointly.",
        "However, linguists are currently required to make qualitative judgments regarding the relative likelihood of certain sound changes, cognate groups, and so on.",
        "Several recent statistical methods have been introduced to provide increased quantitative backing to the comparative method (Oakes, 2000; Bouchard-Cote et al., 2007; Bouchard-Cote et al., 2009); others have modeled the spread of language changes and spe-ciation (Ringe et al., 2002; Daumé III and Campbell, 2007; Daumé III, 2009; Nerbonne, 2010).",
        "These automated methods, while providing robustness and scale in the induction of ancestral word forms and evolutionary parameters, assume that cognate groups are already known.",
        "In this work, we address this limitation, presenting a model in which cognate groups can be discovered automatically.",
        "Finding cognate groups is not an easy task, because underlying morphological and phonological changes can obscure relationships between words, especially for distant cognates, where simple string overlap is an inadequate measure of similarity.",
        "Indeed, a standard string similarity metric like Levenshtein distance can lead to false positives.",
        "Consider the often cited example of Greek /ma:ti/ and Malay /mata/, both meaning \"eye\" (Bloomfield, 1938).",
        "If we were to rely on Levenshtein distance, these words would seem to be a highly attractive match as cognates: they are nearly identical, essentially differing in only a single character.",
        "However, no linguist would posit that these two words are related.",
        "To correctly learn that they are not related, linguists typically rely on two kinds of evidence.",
        "First, because sound change is largely regular, we would need to commonly see /i/ in Greek wherever we see /a/ in Malay (Ross, 1950).",
        "Second, we should look at languages closely related to Greek and Malay, to see if similar patterns hold there, too.",
        "Some authors have attempted to automatically detect cognate words (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994; Oakes, 2000; Kontypically work on language pairs rather than on larger language families.",
        "To fully automate the comparative method, it is necessary to consider multiple languages, and to do so in a model which couples cognate detection with similarity learning.",
        "In this paper, we present a new generative model for the automatic induction of cognate groups given only (1) a known family tree of languages and (2) word lists from those languages.",
        "A prior on word survival generates a number of cognate groups and decides which groups are attested in each modern language.",
        "An evolutionary model captures how each word is generated from its parent word.",
        "Finally, an alignment model maps the flat word lists to cognate groups.",
        "Inference requires a combination of message-passing in the evolutionary model and iterative bipartite graph matching in the alignment model.",
        "In the message-passing phase, our model encodes distributions over strings as weighted finite state automata (Mohri, 2009).",
        "Weighted automata have been successfully applied to speech processing (Mohri et al., 1996) and more recently to morphology (Dreyer and Eisner, 2009).",
        "Here, we present a new method for automatically compressing our message automata in a way that can take into account prior information about the expected outcome of inference.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a transcribed word list of 583 cognate sets from three Romance languages (Portuguese, Italian and Spanish), as well as their common ancestor Latin (Bouchard-Cote et al., 2007).",
        "We consider both the case where we know that all cognate groups have a surface form in all languages, and where we do not know that.",
        "On the former, easier task we achieve identification accuracies of 90.6%.",
        "On the latter task, we achieve F1 scores of 73.6%.",
        "Both substantially beat baseline performance."

        "Survival dictates, for each cognate group, which languages have words in that group.",

        "This process captures the intuition that cognate words are more likely to be found clustered in sibling languages than scattered across unrelated languages.",

        "The second is a much harder \"partial data\" experiment, in which we randomly prune 20% of the branches from the dataset according to the survival process described in Section 2.1.",
        "Here, only a fraction of words appear in any cognate group, so this task crucially involves the survival model.",
        "The ultimate purpose of the induced cognate groups is to feed richer evolutionary models, such as full reconstruction models.",
        "Therefore, we also consider a proto-word reconstruction experiment.",
        "For this experiment, using the system of Bouchard-Cote et al.",
        "(2009), we compare the reconstructions produced from our automatic groups to those produced from gold cognate groups.",
        "As a novel but heuristic baseline for cognate group detection, we use an iterative bipartite matching algorithm where instead of conditional likelihoods for affinities we use Dice's coefficient, defined for sets X and Y as:",
        "Dice's coefficients are commonly used in bilingual detection of cognates (Kondrak, 2001; Kondrak et al., 2003).",
        "We follow prior work and use sets of bigrams within words.",
        "In our case, during bipartite matching the set X is the set of bigrams in the language being re-permuted, and Y is the union of bigrams in the other languages.",
        "In this experiment, we know precisely how many cognate groups there are and that every cognate group has a word in each language.",
        "While this scenario does not include all of the features of the real-world task, it represents a good test case of how well these models can perform without the non-parametric task of deciding how many clusters to use.",
        "We scrambled the 583 cognate groups in the Romance dataset and ran each method to convergence.",
        "Besides the heuristic baseline, we tried our model-based approach using Unigrams, Bigrams and Anchored Unigrams, with and without learning the parametric edit distances.",
        "When we did not use learning, we set the parameters of the edit distance to (0, -3, -4) for matches, substitutions, and deletions/insertions, respectively.",
        "With learning enabled, transducers were initialized with those parameters.",
        "For evaluation, we report two metrics.",
        "The first is pairwise accuracy for each pair of languages, averaged across pairs of words.",
        "The other is accu-",
        "Table 1: Accuracies for reconstructing cognate groups.",
        "Lev-enshtein refers to fixed parameter edit distance transducer.",
        "Learned refers to automatically learned edit distances.",
        "Pair-wise Accuracy means averaged on each word pair; Exact Match refers to percentage of completely and accurately reconstructed groups.",
        "For a description of the baseline, see Section 7.1.",

        "Scores reported are precision, recall, and F1, averaged over all word pairs.",
        "racy measured in terms of the number of correctly, completely reconstructed cognate groups.",
        "Table 1 shows the results under various configurations.",
        "As can be seen, the kind of approximation used matters immensely.",
        "In this application, positional information is important, more so than the context of the previous phoneme.",
        "Both Un-igrams and Bigrams significantly under-perform the baseline, while Anchored Unigrams easily outperforms it both with and without learning.",
        "An initially surprising result is that learning actually harms performance under the unanchored approximations.",
        "The explanation is that these topologies are not sensitive enough to context, and that the learning procedure ends up flattening the distributions.",
        "In the case of unigrams - which have the least context - learning degrades performance to chance.",
        "However, in the case of positional uni-grams, learning reduces the error rate by more than two-thirds.",
        "As a more realistic scenario, we consider the case where we do not know that all cognate groups have words in all languages.",

        "Using the simple Levenshtein transducers, on the other hand, our model keeps all three separated, because the transducers cannot know among other things - that Portuguese /i/, Spanish /e/, and Italian /i/ are commonly substituted for one another.",
        "Unfortunately, because the transducers used cannot learn contextual rules, certain transformations can be over-applied.",
        "For instance, Spanish /nombrar/ \"name\" is grouped together with Portuguese /numirar/ \"number\" and Italian /numerare/ \"number,\" largely because the rule Portuguese /u/ – Spanish /o/ is applied outside of its normal context.",
        "This sound change occurs primarily with final vowels, and does not usually occur word medially.",
        "Thus, more sophisticated transducers could learn better sound laws, which could translate into improved accuracy.",

        "Our model is not optimized for faithful reconstruction, and so we used the Ancestry Resampling system of Bouchard-Cote et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "To evaluate, we matched each Latin word with the best possible cognate group for that word.",
        "The process for the matching was as follows.",
        "If two or three of the words in an constructed cognate group agreed, we assigned the Latin word associated with the true group to it.",
        "With the remainder, we executed a bipartite matching based on bigram overlap.",
