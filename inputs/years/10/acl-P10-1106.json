        "Letter-substitution ciphers encode a document from a known language into an unknown writing system or an unknown encoding of a known writing system.",
        "This problem has practical significance in a number of areas, such as in reading electronic documents that may use one of many different standards to encode text.",
        "While this is not a problem in languages like English and Chinese, which have a small set of well known standard encodings such as ASCII, Big5 and Unicode, there are other languages such as Hindi in which there is no dominant encoding standard for the writing system.",
        "In these languages, we would like to be able to automatically retrieve and display the information in electronic documents which use unknown encodings when we find them.",
        "We also want to use these documents for information retrieval and data mining, in which case it is important to be able to read through them automatically, without resorting to a human annotator.",
        "The holy grail in this area would be an application to archaeological decipherment, in which the underlying language's identity is only hypothesized, and must be tested.",
        "The purpose of this paper, then, is to simplify the problem of reading documents in unknown encodings by presenting a new algorithm to be used in their decipherment.",
        "Our algorithm operates by running a search over the n-gram probabilities of possible solutions to the cipher, using a generalization of the Viterbi algorithm that is wrapped in an A* search, which determines at each step which partial solutions to expand.",
        "It is guaranteed to converge on the language-model-optimal solution, and does not require restarts or risk falling into local optima.",
        "We specifically consider the problem of finding decodings of electronic documents drawn from the internet, and we test our algorithm on ciphers drawn from randomly selected pages of Wikipedia.",
        "Our testing indicates that our algorithm will be effective in this domain.",
        "It may seem at first that automatically decoding (as opposed to deciphering) a document is a simple matter, but studies have shown that simple algorithms such as letter frequency counting do not always produce optimal solutions (Bauer, 2007).",
        "If the text from which a language model is trained is of a different genre than the plaintext of a cipher, the unigraph letter frequencies may differ substantially from those of the language model, and so frequency counting will be misleading.",
        "Because of the perceived simplicity of the problem, however, little work was performed to understand its computational properties until Peleg and Rosenfeld (1979), who developed a method that repeatedly swaps letters in a cipher to find a maximum probability solution.",
        "Since then, several different approaches to this problem have been suggested, some of which use word counts in the language to arrive at a solution (Hart, 1994), and some of which treat the problem as an expectation maximization problem (Knight et al., 2006; Knight, 1999).",
        "These later algorithms are, however, highly dependent on their initial states, and require a number of restarts in order to find the globally optimal solution.",
        "A further contribution was made by (Ravi and Knight, 2008), which, though published earlier, was inspired in part by the method presented here, first discovered in 2007.",
        "Unlike the present method, however, Ravi and Knight (2008) treat the decipherment of letter-substitution ciphers as an integer programming problem.",
        "Clever though this constraint-based encoding is, their paper does not quantify the massive running times required to decode even very short documents with this sort of approach.",
        "Such inefficiency indicates that integer programming may simply be the wrong tool for the job, possibly because language model probabilities computed from empirical data are not smoothly distributed enough over the space in which a cutting-plane method would attempt to compute a linear relaxation of this problem.",
        "In any case, an exact method is available with a much more efficient A* search that is linear-time in the length of the cipher (though still horribly exponential in the size of the cipher and plain text alphabets), and has the additional advantage of being massively parallelizable.",
        "(Ravi and Knight, 2008) also seem to believe that short cipher texts are somehow inherently more difficult to solve than long cipher texts.",
        "This difference in difficulty, while real, is not inherent, but rather an artefact of the character-level n-gram language models that they (and we) use, in which preponderant evidence of differences in short character sequences is necessary for the model to clearly favour one lettersubstitution mapping over another.",
        "Uniform character models equivocate regardless of the length of the cipher, and sharp character models with many zeroes can quickly converge even on short ciphers of only a few characters.",
        "In the present method, the role of the language model can be acutely perceived; both the time complexity of the algorithm and the accuracy of the results depend crucially on this characteristic of the language model.",
        "In fact, we must use add-one smoothing to decipher texts of even modest lengths because even one unseen plain-text letter sequence is enough to knock out the correct solution.",
        "It is likely that the method of (Ravi and Knight, 2008) is sensitive to this as well, but their experiments were apparently fixed on a single, well-trained model.",
        "Applications of decipherment are also explored by (Nagy et al., 1987), who uses it in the context of optical character recognition (OCR).",
        "The problem we consider here is cosmetically related to the \"L2P\" (letter-to-phoneme) mapping problem of text-to-speech synthesis, which also features a prominent constraint-based approach (van den Bosch and Canisius, 2006), but the constraints in L2P are very different: two different instances of the same written letter may legitimately map to two different phonemes.",
        "This is not the case in letter-substitution maps."

A string S that results from such a mapping is consistent with a partial solution a iff, for every pi : ci G a, the character positions of C that map to pi are exactly the character positions with ci in C.",

        "In the above paper, we have presented an algorithm for solving letter-substitution ciphers, with an eye towards discovering unknown encoding standards in electronic documents on the fly.",
        "In a test of our algorithm over ciphers drawn from Wikipedia, we found its accuracy to be 100% on the ciphers that it solved within a threshold of 12 hours, this being 80% of the total attempted.",
        "We found that the running time of our algorithm is highly variable depending on the order of characters attempted, and, due to the linear-time theoretical complexity of this method, that running times tend to decrease with larger ciphertexts due to our character-level language model's facility at eliminating highly improbable solutions.",
        "There is, however, a great deal of room for improvement in the trigram model's ability to rank partial solutions that are not eliminated outright.",
        "Perhaps the most valuable insight gleaned from this study has been on the role of the language model.",
        "This algorithm's asymptotic runtime complexity is actually a function of entropic aspects of the character-level language model that it uses – more uniform models provide less prominent separations between candidate partial solutions, and this leads to badly ordered queues, in which extended partial solutions can never compete with partial solutions that have smaller domains, leading to a blind search.",
        "We believe that there is a great deal of promise in characterizing natural language processing algorithms in this way, due to the prevalence of Bayesian methods that use language models as priors.",
        "Our approach makes no explicit attempt to account for noisy ciphers, in which characters are erroneously mapped, nor any attempt to account for more general substitution ciphers in which a single plaintext (resp.",
        "ciphertext) letter can map to multiple ciphertext (resp.",
        "plaintext) letters, nor for ciphers in which ciphertext units corresponds to larger units of plaintext such syllables or words.",
        "Extensions in these directions are all very worthwhile to explore."
