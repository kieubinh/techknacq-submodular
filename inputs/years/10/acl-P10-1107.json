        "Dozens of lost languages have been deciphered by humans in the last two centuries.",
        "In each case, the decipherment has been considered a major intellectual breakthrough, often the culmination of decades of scholarly efforts.",
        "Computers have played no role in the decipherment any of these languages.",
        "In fact, skeptics argue that computers do not possess the \"logic and intuition\" required to unravel the mysteries of ancient scripts.In this paper, we demonstrate that at least some of this logic and intuition can be successfully modeled, allowing computational tools to be used in the decipherment process.",
        "Our definition of the computational decipherment task closely follows the setup typically faced by human decipherers (Robinson, 2002).",
        "Our input consists of texts in a lost language and a corpus of non-parallel data in a known related language.",
        "The decipherment itself involves two related sub-tasks: (i) finding the mapping between alphabets of the known and lost languages, and (ii) translating words in the lost language into corresponding cognates of the known language.",
        "While there is no single formula that human decipherers have employed, manual efforts have focused on several guiding principles.",
        "A common starting point is to compare letter and word frequencies between the lost and known languages.",
        "In the presence of cognates the correct mapping between the languages will reveal similarities in frequency, both at the character and lexical level.",
        "In addition, morphological analysis plays a crucial role here, as highly frequent morpheme correspondences can be particularly revealing.",
        "In fact, these three strands of analysis (character frequency, morphology, and lexical frequency) are intertwined throughout the human decipherment process.",
        "Partial knowledge of each drives discovery in the others.",
        "We capture these intuitions in a generative Bayesian model.",
        "This model assumes that each word in the lost language is composed of morphemes which were generated with latent counterparts in the known language.",
        "We model bilingual morpheme pairs as arising through a series of Dirichlet processes.",
        "This allows us to assign probabilities based both on character-level correspondences (using a character-edit base distribution) as well as higher-level morpheme correspondences.",
        "In addition, our model carries out an implicit morphological analysis of the lost language, utilizing the known morphological structure of the related language.",
        "This model structure allows us to capture the interplay between the characterand morpheme-level correspondences that humans have used in the manual decipherment process.",
        "In addition, we introduce a novel technique for imposing structural sparsity constraints on character-level mappings.",
        "We assume that an accurate alphabetic mapping between related languages will be sparse in the following way: each letter will map to a very limited subset of letters in the other language.",
        "We capture this intuition by adapting the so-called \"spike and slab\" prior to the Dirichlet-multinomial setting.",
        "For each pair of characters in the two languages, we posit an indicator variable which controls the prior likelihood of character substitutions.",
        "We define a joint prior over these indicator variables which encourages sparse settings.",
        "We applied our model to a corpus of Ugaritic, an ancient Semitic language discovered in 1928.",
        "Ugaritic was manually deciphered in 1932, using knowledge of Hebrew, a related language.",
        "We compare our method against the only existing decipherment baseline, an HMM-based character substitution cipher (Knight and Yamada, 1999; Knight et al., 2006).",
        "The baseline correctly maps the majority of letters – 22 out of 30 – to their correct Hebrew counterparts, but only correctly translates 29% of all cognates.",
        "In comparison, our method yields correct mappings for 29 of 30 letters, and correctly translates 60.4% of all cognates."

        "Our work on decipherment has connections to three lines of work in statistical NLP.",
        "First, our work relates to research on cognate identification (Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994; Guy, 1994; Kondrak, 2001; Bouchard et al., 2007; Kondrak, 2009).",
        "These methods typically rely on information that is unknown in a typical deciphering scenario (while being readily available for living languages).",
        "For instance, some methods employ a hand-coded similarity function (Kondrak, 2001), while others assume knowledge of the phonetic mapping or require parallel cognate pairs to learn a similarity function (Bouchard et al., 2007).",
        "A second related line of work is lexicon induction from non-parallel corpora.",
        "While this research has similar goals, it typically builds on information or resources unavailable for ancient texts, such as comparable corpora, a seed lexicon, and cognate information (Fung and McKe-own, 1997; Rapp, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002;",
        "Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "Moreover, distributional methods that rely on co-occurrence analysis operate over large corpora, which are typically unavailable for a lost language.",
        "Finally, Knight and Yamada (1999) and Knight et al.",
        "(2006) describe a computational HMM-based method for deciphering an unknown script that represents a known spoken language.",
        "This method \"makes the text speak\" by gleaning character-to-sound mappings from non-parallel character and sound sequences.",
        "It does not relate words in different languages, thus it cannot encode deciphering constraints similar to the ones considered in this paper.",
        "More importantly, this method had not been applied to archaeological data.",
        "While lost languages are gaining increasing interest in the NLP community (Knight and Sproat, 2009), there have been no successful attempts of their automatic decipherment."

        "Manual Decipherment of Ugaritic Ugaritic tablets were first found in Syria in 1929 (Smith, 1955; Watson and Wyatt, 1999).",
        "At the time, the cuneiform writing on the tablets was of an unknown type.",
        "Charles Virolleaud, who lead the initial decipherment effort, recognized that the script was likely alphabetic, since the inscribed words consisted of only thirty distinct symbols.",
        "The location of the tablets discovery further suggested that Ugaritic was likely to have been a Semitic language from the Western branch, with properties similar to Hebrew and Aramaic.",
        "This realization was crucial for deciphering the Ugaritic script.",
        "In fact, German cryptographer and Semitic scholar Hans Bauer decoded the first two Ugaritic letters – mem and lambda – by mapping them to Hebrew letters with similar occurrence patterns in prefixes and suffixes.",
        "Bootstrapping from this finding, Bauer found words in the tablets that were likely to serve as cognates to Hebrew words – e.g., the Ugaritic word for king matches its Hebrew equivalent.",
        "Through this process a few more letters were decoded, but the Ugaritic texts were still unreadable.",
        "What made the final decipherment possible was a sheer stroke of luck – Bauer guessed that a word inscribed on an ax discovered in the Ras Shamra excavations was the Ugaritic word for ax.",
        "Bauer's guess was correct, though he selected the wrong phonetic sequence.",
        "Edouard Dhorme, another cryptographer and Semitic scholar, later corrected the reading, expanding a set of translated words.",
        "Discoveries of additional tablets allowed Bauer, Dhorme and Virolleaud to revise their hypothesis, successfully completing the decipherment.",
        "Linguistic Features of Ugaritic Ugaritic shares many features with other ancient Semitic languages, following the same word order, gender, number, and case structure (Hetzron, 1997).",
        "It is a morphologically rich language, with triliteral roots and many prefixes and suffixes.",
        "At the same time, it exhibits a number of features that distinguish it from Hebrew.",
        "Ugaritic has a bigger phonemic inventory than Hebrew, yielding a bigger alphabet - 30 letters vs. 22 in Hebrew.",
        "Another distinguishing feature of Ugaritic is that vowels are only written with glottal stops while in Hebrew many long vowels are written using homorganic consonants.",
        "Ugaritic also does not have articles, while Hebrew nouns and adjectives take definite articles which are realized as prefixes.",
        "These differences result in significant divergence between Hebrew and Ugaritic cognates, thereby complicating the decipherment process."

        "We are given a corpus in a lost language and a nonparallel corpus in a related language from the same language family.",

        "As part of this process, we induce a lower-level mapping between the letters of the two alphabets, capturing the regular phonetic correspondences found in cognates.",
        "We make several assumptions about the writing system of the lost language.",
        "First, we assume that the writing system is alphabetic in nature.",
        "In general, this assumption can be easily validated by counting the number of symbols found in the written record.",
        "Next, we assume that the corpus has been transcribed into electronic format, where the graphemes present in the physical text have been unambiguously identified.",
        "Finally, we assume that words are explicitly separated in the text, either by white space or a special symbol.",
        "We also make a mild assumption about the morphology of the lost language.",
        "We posit that each word consists of a stem, prefix, and suffix, where the latter two may be omitted.",
        "This assumption captures a wide range of human languages and a variety of morphological systems.",
        "While the correct morphological analysis of words in the lost language must be learned, we assume that the inventory and frequencies of prefixes and suffixes in the known language are given.",
        "In summary, the observed input to the model consists of two elements: (i) a list of unanalyzed word types derived from a corpus in the lost language, and (ii) a morphologically analyzed lexicon in a known related language derived from a separate corpus, in our case non-parallel."

        "Our goal is to incorporate the logic and intuition used by human decipherers in an unsupervised statistical model.",
        "To make these intuitions concrete, consider the following toy example, consisting of a lost language much like English, but written using numerals:",
        "Analyzing the undeciphered corpus, we might first notice a pair of endings, -34, and -5, which both occur after the initial sequence 152- (and may likewise occur at the end of a variety of words in the corpus).",
        "If we know this lost language to be closely related to English, we can surmise that these two endings correspond to the English verbal suffixes -ed and -s. Using this knowledge, we can hypothesize the following character correspondences: (3 = e), (4 = d), (5 = s).",
        "We now know that (4252 = des2) and we can use our knowledge of the English lexicon to hypothesize that this word is desk, thereby learning the correspondence (2 = k).",
        "Finally, we can use similar reasoning to reveal that the initial character sequence 152- corresponds to the English verb ask.",
        "As this example illustrates, human decipherment efforts proceed by discovering both character-level and morpheme-level correspondences.",
        "This interplay implicitly relies on a morphological analysis of words in the lost language, while utilizing knowledge of the known language's lexicon and morphology.",
        "One final intuition our model should capture is the sparsity of the alphabetic correspondence between related languages.",
        "We know from comparative linguistics that the correct mapping will preserve regular phonetic relationships between the two languages (as exemplified by cognates).",
        "As a result, each character in one language will map to a small number of characters in the other language (typically one, but sometimes two or three).",
        "By incorporating this structural sparsity intuition, we can allow the model to focus on on a smaller set of linguistically valid hypotheses.",
        "Below we give an overview of our model, which is designed to capture these linguistic intuitions.",
        "Our model posits that every observed word in the lost language is composed of a sequence of morphemes (prefix, stem, suffix).",

        "As a baseline for the first three of these tasks (learning alphabetic mappings and translating and identifying cognates), we adapt the HMM-based method of Knight et al.",
        "(2006) for learning letter substitution ciphers.",
        "In its original setting, this model was used to map written texts to spoken language, under the assumption that each character was emitted from a hidden phonemic state.",
        "In our adaptation, we assume instead that each Ugaritic character was generated by a hidden Hebrew letter.",
        "Hebrew character trigram transition probabilities are estimated using the Hebrew Bible, and Hebrew to Ugaritic character emission probabilities are learned using EM.",
        "Finally, the highest probability sequence of latent Hebrew letters is predicted for each Ugaritic word-form, using Viterbi decoding.",
        "Alphabetic Mapping The first essential step towards successful decipherment is recovering the mapping between the symbols of the lost language and the alphabet of a known language.",
        "As a gold standard for this comparison, we use the well-established relationship between the Ugaritic and Hebrew alphabets (Hetzron, 1997).",
        "This mapping is not one-to-one but is generally quite sparse.",
        "Of the 30 Ugaritic symbols, 28 map predominantly to a single Hebrew letter, and the remaining two map to two different letters.",
        "As the Hebrew alphabet contains only 22 letters, six map to two distinct Ugaritic letters and two map to three distinct Ugaritic letters.",
        "We recover our model's predicted alphabetic mappings by simply examining the sampled values of the binary indicator variables XUyh for each Ugaritic-Hebrew letter pair (u,h).",
        "Due to our structural sparsity prior P(A), the predicted mappings are sparse: each Ugaritic letter maps to only a single Hebrew letter, and most Hebrew letters map to only a single Ugaritic letter.",
        "To recover alphabetic mappings from the HMM substitution cipher baseline, we predict the Hebrew letter h which maximizes the model's probability P(h|u), for each Ugaritic letter u.",
        "To evaluate these mappings, we simply count the number of Ugaritic letters that are correctly mapped to one of their Hebrew reflexes.",
        "By this measure, the baseline recovers correct mappings for 22 out of 30 Ugaritic characters (73.3%).",
