        "Phrase or constituent structure is often regarded as an analysis step guiding semantic interpretation, while grammatical functions (i. e. subject, object, modifier etc.)",
        "provide important information relevant to determining predicate-argument structure.",
        "In languages with restricted word order (e. g. English), core grammatical functions can often be recovered from configurational information in constituent structure analyses.",
        "By contrast, simple constituent structures are not sufficient for less configurational languages, which tend to encode grammatical functions by morphological means (Bresnan, 2001).",
        "Case features, for instance, can be important indicators of grammatical functions.",
        "Unfortunately, many of these languages (including German) exhibit strong syncretism where morphological cues can be highly ambiguous with respect to functional information.",
        "Statistical classifiers have been successfully used to label constituent structure parser output with grammatical function information (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000; Chrupala and Van Genabith, 2006).",
        "However, as these approaches tend to use only limited and local context information for learning and prediction, they often fail to enforce simple yet important global linguistic constraints that exist for most languages, e. g. that there will be at most one subject (object) per sen-tence/clause.",
        "\"Hard\" linguistic constraints, such as these, tend to affect mostly the \"core grammatical functions\", i. e. the argument functions (rather than e. g. adjuncts) of a particular predicate.",
        "As these functions constitute the core meaning of a sentence (as in: who did what to whom), it is important to get them right.",
        "We present a system that adds grammatical function labels to constituent parser output for German in a postprocessing step.",
        "We combine a statistical classifier with an integer linear program (ILP) to model non-violable global linguistic constraints, restricting the solution space of the classifier to those labellings that comply with our set of global constraints.",
        "There are, of course, many other ways of including functional information into the output of a syntactic parser.",
        "Klein and Manning (2003) show that merging some linguistically motivated function labels with specific syntactic categories can improve the performance of a PCFG model on Penn-II English data.",
        "Tsarfaty and Sim'aan (2008) present a statistical model (Relational-Realizational Parsing) that alternates between functional and config-urational information for constituency tree parsing and Hebrew data.",
        "Dependency parsers like the MST parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) and Malt parser (Nivre et al., 2007) use function labels as core part of their underlying formalism.",
        "In this paper, we focus on phrase structure parsing with function labelling as a post-processing step.",
        "Integer linear programs have already been successfully used in related fields including semantic role labelling (Punyakanok et al., 2004), relation and entity classification (Roth and Yih, 2004), sentence compression (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) and dependency parsing (Martins et al., 2009).",
        "Early work on function labelling for German (Brants et al., 1997) reports 94.2% accuracy on gold data (a very early version of the TiGer Treebank (Brants et al., 2002)) using Markov models.",
        "Klenner (2007) uses a system similar to - but more restricted than - ours to label syntactic chunks derived from the TiGer Treebank.",
        "His research focusses on the correct selection of predefined sub-categorisation frames for a verb (see also Klenner (2005)).",
        "By contrast, our research does not involve subcategorisation frames as an external resource, instead opting for a less knowledge-intensive approach.",
        "Klenner's system was evaluated on gold treebank data and used a small set of 7 dependency labels.",
        "We show that an ILP-based approach can be scaled to a large and comprehensive set of 42 labels, achieving 97.99% label accuracy on gold standard trees.",
        "Furthermore, we apply the system to automatically parsed data using a state-of-the-art statistical phrase-structure parser with a label accuracy of 94.10%.",
        "In both cases, the ILP-based approach improves the quality of argument function labelling when compared with a non-ILP-approach.",
        "Finally, we show that the approach substantially improves the quality and coverage (from 93.6% to 98.4%) of treebank-based Lexical-Functional Grammars for German over previous work in Rehbein and van Genabith (2009).",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents basic data demonstrating the challenges presented by German word order and case syncretism for the function labeller.",
        "Section 3 describes the labeller including the feature model of the classifier and the integer linear program used to pick the correct labelling.",
        "The evaluation part (Section 4) is split into an intrinsic evaluation measuring the quality of the labelling directly using the German TiGer Treebank (Brants et al., 2002), and an extrinsic evaluation where we test the impact of the constraint-based labelling on treebank-based automatic LFG grammar acquisition.",
        "Unlike English, German exhibits a relatively free word order, i. e. in main clauses, the verb occupies second position (the last position in subordinated clauses) and arguments and adjuncts can be placed (fairly) freely.",
        "The grammatical function of a noun phrase is marked morphologically on its constituting parts.",
        "Determiners, pronouns, adjectives and nouns carry case markings and in order to be well-formed, all parts of a noun phrase have to agree on their case features.",

        "Introducing adjuncts to this example makes matters even worse.",
        "Case information for a given noun phrase can give a classifier some clue about the correct argument function, since functions are strongly related to case values.",

        "For each possible label and for each node, the classifier assigns a probability that this node is labelled by this label.",
        "This results in a complete probability distribution over all labels for each node.",
        "An integer linear program then tries to find the optimal overall tree labelling by picking for each node the label with the highest probability without violating any of its constraints.",
        "These constraints implement linguistic rules like the one-subject-per-sentence rule mentioned above.",
        "They can also be used to capture treebank particulars, such as for example that punctuation marks never receive a label.",

        "They usually give good results while at the same time allowing for the inclusion of arbitrarily complex features.",

        "In the second step, a binary integer linear program is used to select those labels that optimise the whole tree labelling.",
        "A linear program consists of a linear objective function that is to be maximised (or minimised) and a set of constraints which impose conditions on the variables of the objective function (see (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) for a short but readable introduction).",

        "Due to the constraints imposed on the classification, the function labeller can no longer assign two subjects to the same S node.",

        "If the selected frame does not require a subject, then the constraint blocks the assignment of subjects for the entire phrase.",
        "The same was done for the other argument functions and as before we included an extension of this constraint to cover embedded VPs.",
        "For unseen verbs (i.e. verbs not attested in the training set) we keep the original constraints as a back-off.",
        "Table 5: node span results for the test set using constraints with automatically extracted subcat frames",
        "Table 5 shows the results of the test set node span evaluation when using the ILP system enhanced with subcat frames.",
        "Compared to Tables 2 and 3, the results are clearly inferior, and particularly so for argument grammatical functions.",
        "This seems to confirm our assumption that, given our data, letting the joint statistical and ILP model decide argument functions is superior to an approach that involves subcat frames.",
        "However, and importantly, our results do not rule out that a more comprehensive subcat frame resource may in fact result in improvements.",
        "Over the last number of years, treebank-based deep grammar acquisition has emerged as an attractive alternative to hand-crafting resources within the HPSG, CCG and LFG paradigms (Miyao et al., 2003; Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002; Cahill et al., 2004).",
        "While most of the initial development work focussed on English, more recently efforts have branched to other languages.",
        "Below we concentrate on LFG.",
        "Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001) is a constraint-based theory of grammar with minimally two levels of representation: c(onstituent)-structure and f(unctional)-structure.",
        "C-structure (CFG trees) captures language specific surface configurations such as word order and the hierarchical grouping of words into phrases, while f-structure represents more abstract (and somewhat more language independent) grammatical relations (essentially bilexical labelled dependencies with some morphological and semantic information, approximating to basic predicate-argument structures) in the form of attribute-value structures.",
        "F-structures are defined in terms of equations annotated to nodes in c-structure trees (grammar rules).",
        "Treebank-based LFG acquisition was originally developed for English (Cahill, 2004; Cahill et al., 2008) and is based on an f-structure annotation algorithm that annotates c-structure trees (from a treebank or parser output) with f-structure equations, which are read off of the tree and passed on to a constraint solver producing an f-structure for the given sentence.",
        "The English annotation algorithm (for Penn-II treebank-style trees) relies heavily on configurational and catego-rial information, translating this into grammatical functional information (subject, object etc.)",
        "represented at f-structure.",
        "LFG is \"functional\" in the mathematical sense, in that argument grammatical functions have to be single valued (there cannot be two or more subjects etc.",
        "in the same clause).",
        "In fact, if two or more values are assigned to a single argument grammatical function in a local tree, the LFG constraint solver will produce a clash (i. e. it will fail to produce an f-structure) and the sentence will be considered ungrammatical (in other words, the corresponding c-structure tree will be uninterpretable).",
        "Rehbein (2009) and Rehbein and van Genabith (2009) develop an f-structure annotation algorithm for German based on the TiGer treebank resource.",
        "Unlike the English annotation algorithm and because of the language-particular properties of German (see Section 2), the German annotation algorithm cannot rely on c-structure configurational information, but instead heavily uses TiGer function labels in the treebank.",
        "Learning function labels is therefore crucial to the German LFG annotation algorithm, in particular when parsing raw text.",
        "Because of the strong case syncretism in German, traditional classification models using local information only run the risk of predicting multiple occurences of the same function (subject, object etc.)",
        "at the same level, causing feature clashes in the constraint solver with no f-structure being produced.",
        "Rehbein (2009) and Rehbein and van Genabith (2009) identify this as a major problem resulting in a considerable loss in coverage of the German annotation algorithm compared to English, in particular for parsing raw text, where TiGer function labels have to be supplied by a machine-learning-based method and where the coverage of the LFG annotation algorithm drops to 93.62% with corresponding drops in recall and f-scores for the f-structure evaluations (Table 6).",
        "Below we test whether the coverage problems caused by incorrect multiple assignments ofgram-matical functions can be addressed using the combination of classifier with ILP constraints developed in this paper.",
        "We report experiments where automatically parsed and labelled data are handed over to an LFG f-structure computation algorithm.",
        "The f-structures produced are converted into a dependency triple representation (Crouch et al., 2002) and evaluated against TiGerDB.",
        "Table 6 shows the results of the f-structure evaluation against TiGerDB, with 84.07% f-score upper-bound results for the f-structure annotation algorithm on the original TiGer treebank trees with hand-annotated function labels.",
        "Using the function labeller without ILP constraints results in drastic drops in coverage (between 4.5% and 6.5% points absolute) and hence recall (6% and 12%) and f-score (3.5% and 9.5%) for both gold trees and parser output (compared to upper bounds).",
        "By contrast, with ILP constraints, the loss in coverage observed above almost completely disappears and recall and f-scores improve by between 4.4% and 5.5% (recall) and 3% (f-score) absolute (over without ILP constraints).",
        "For comparison, we repeated the experiment using the bestscoring method of Rehbein (2009).",
        "Rehbein trains the Berkeley Parser to learn an extended category set, merging TiGer function labels with syntactic categories, where the parser outputs fully-labelled trees.",
        "The results show that this approach suffers from the same drop in coverage as the classifier without ILP constraints, with recall about 7% and f-score about 4% (absolute) lower than for the classifier with ILP constraints.",
        "Table 7 shows the dramatic effect of the ILP constraints on the number of sentences in the test set that have multiple argument functions of the same type within the same clause.",
        "With ILP constraints, the problem disappears and therefore, less feature-clashes occur during f-structure computation.",
        "In order to assess whether ILP constraints help with coverage only or whether they affect the quality of the f-structures as well, we repeat the experiment in Table 6, however this time evaluating only on those sentences that receive an f-structure, ignoring the rest.",
        "Table 8 shows that the impact of ILP constraints on quality is much less dramatic than on coverage, with only very small variations in precison, recall and f-scores across the board, and small increases over Rehbein (2009).",
        "Early work on automatic LFG acquisition and parsing for German is presented in Cahill et al.",
        "Annotation Algorithm to an earlier and smaller version of the TiGer treebank (without morphological information) and training a parser to learn merged Tiger function-category labels, and reporting 95.75% coverage and an f-score of 74.56% f-structure quality against 2,000 gold treebank trees automatically converted into f-structures.",
        "Rehbein (2009) uses the larger Release 2 of the treebank (with morphological information) reporting 77.79% f-score and coverage of 93.62% (Table 8) against the dependencies in the TiGerDB test set.",
        "The only rule-based approach to German LFG-parsing we are aware of is the hand-crafted German grammar in the ParGram Project (Butt et al., 2002).",
        "Forst (2007) reports 83.01% dependency f-score evaluated against a set of 1,497 sentences of the TiGerDB.",
        "It is very difficult to compare results across the board, as individual papers use (i) different versions of the treebank, (ii) different (sections of) gold-standards to evaluate against (gold TiGer trees in TigerDB, the dependency representations provided by TigerDB, automatically generated gold-standards etc.)",
        "and (iii) different label/grammatical function sets.",
        "Furthermore, (iv) coverage differs drastically (with the hand-crafted LFG resources achieving about 80% full f-structures) and finally, (v) some of the grammars evaluated having been used in the generation of the gold standards, possibly introducing a bias towards these resources: the German hand-crafted LFG was used to produce TiGerDB (Forst et al., 2004).",
        "In order to put the results into some perspective, Table 9 shows an evaluation of our resources against a set of automatically generated gold standard f-structures produced by using the f-structure annotation algorithm on the original hand-labelled TiGer gold trees in the section corresponding to TiGerDB: without ILP constraints we achieve a dependency f-score of 84.35%, with ILP constraints 87.23% and 98.89% coverage.",

        "In this paper, we addressed the problem of assigning grammatical functions to constituent structures.",
        "We have proposed an approach to grammatical function labelling that combines the flexibility of a statistical classifier with linguistic expert knowledge in the form of hard constraints implemented by an integer linear program.",
        "These constraints restrict the solution space of the classifier by blocking those solutions that cannot be correct.",
        "One of the strengths of an integer linear program is the unlimited context it can take into account by optimising over the entire structure, providing an elegant way of supporting classifiers with explicit linguistic knowledge while at the same time keeping feature models small and comprehensible.",
        "Most of the constraints are direct formalizations of linguistic generalizations for German.",
        "Our approach should generalise to other languages for which linguistic expertise is available.",
        "We evaluated our system on the TiGer corpus and the TiGerDB and gave results on gold standard trees and parser output.",
        "We also applied the German f-structure annotation algorithm to the automatically labelled data and evaluated the system by measuring the quality of the resulting f-structures.",
        "We found that by using the constraint set, the function labeller ensures the inter-pretability and thus the usefulness of the syntactic structure for a subsequently applied processing step.",
        "In our f-structure evaluation, that means, the f-structure computation algorithm is able to produce an f-structure for almost all sentences."
