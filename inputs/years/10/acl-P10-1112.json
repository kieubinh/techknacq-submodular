        "Modern NLP systems have increasingly used dataintensive models that capture many or even all substructures from the training data.",
        "In the domain of syntactic parsing, the idea that all training fragments might be relevant to parsing has a long history, including tree-substitution grammar (data-oriented parsing) approaches (Scha, 1990; Bod, 1993; Goodman, 1996a; Chiang, 2003) and tree kernel approaches (Collins and Duffy, 2002).",
        "For machine translation, the key modern advancement has been the ability to represent and memorize large training substructures, be it in contiguous phrases (Koehn et al., 2003) or syntactic trees",
        "!In this paper, a fragment means an elementary tree in a tree-substitution grammar, while a subtree means a fragment that bottoms out in terminals.",
        "(Galley et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005; Deneefe and Knight, 2009).",
        "In all such systems, a central challenge is efficiency: there are generally a combinatorial number of substructures in the training data, and it is impractical to explicitly extract them all.",
        "On both efficiency and statistical grounds, much recent TSG work has focused on fragment selection (Zuidema, 2007; Cohn et al., 2009; Post and",
        "Gildea, 2009).",
        "At the same time, many high-performance parsers have focused on symbol refinement approaches, wherein PCFG independence assumptions are weakened not by increasing rule sizes but by subdividing coarse treebank symbols into many subcategories either using structural annotation (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003) or lexicalization (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).",
        "Indeed, a recent trend has shown high accuracies from models which are dedicated to inducing such subcategories (Henderson, 2004; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we present a simplified parser which combines the two basic ideas, using both large fragments and symbol refinement, to provide non-local and local context respectively.",
        "The two approaches turn out to be highly complementary; even the simplest (deterministic) symbol refinement and a basic use of an all-fragments grammar combine to give accuracies substantially above recent work on tree-substitution grammar based parsers and approaching top refinement-based parsers.",
        "For example, our best result on the English WSJ task is an F1 of over 88%, where recent TSG parsers achieve 82-84% and top refinement-based parsers achieve 88-90% (e.g., Table 5).",
        "Rather than select fragments, we use a simplification of the PCFG-reduction of DOP (Goodman, 1996a) to work with all fragments.",
        "This reduction is a flexible, implicit representation of the fragments that, rather than extracting an intractably large grammar over fragment types, indexes all nodes in the training treebank and uses a compact grammar over indexed node tokens.",
        "This indexed grammar, when appropriately marginalized, is equivalent to one in which all fragments are explicitly extracted.",
        "Our work is the first to apply this reduction to full-scale parsing.",
        "In this direction, we present a coarse-to-fine inference scheme and a compact graph encoding of the training set, which, together, make parsing manageable.",
        "This tractability allows us to avoid selection of fragments, and work with all fragments.",
        "Of course, having a grammar that includes all training substructures is only desirable to the extent that those structures can be appropriately weighted.",
        "Implicit representations like those used here do not allow arbitrary weightings of fragments.",
        "However, we use a simple weighting scheme which does decompose appropriately over the implicit encoding, and which is flexible enough to allow weights to depend not only on frequency but also on fragment size, node patterns, and certain lexical properties.",
        "Similar ideas have been explored in Bod (2001), Collins and Duffy (2002), and Goodman (2003).",
        "Our model empirically affirms the effectiveness of such a flexible weighting scheme in full-scale experiments.",
        "We also investigate parsing without an explicit lexicon.",
        "The all-fragments approach has the advantage that parsing down to the character level requires no special treatment; we show that an explicit lexicon is not needed when sentences are considered as strings of characters rather than words.",
        "This avoids the need for complex unknown word models and other specialized lexical resources.",
        "The main contribution of this work is to show practical, tractable methods for working with an all-fragments model, without an explicit lexicon.",
        "In the parsing case, the central result is that accuracies in the range of state-of-the-art parsers (i.e., over 88% F1 on English WSJ) can be obtained with no sampling, no latent-variable modeling, no smoothing, and even no explicit lexicon (hence negligible training overall).",
        "These techniques, however, are not limited to the case of monolingual parsing, offering extensions to models of machine translation, semantic interpretation, and other areas in which a similar tension exists between the desire to extract many large structures and the computational cost of doing so."

In G, each derivation d is a tree (multiset) of fragments (Figure 1(c)), and the weight of the derivation is the product of the weights of the fragments: w(d) = Yif ed w(f ).",

We can consider any derivation d in G to be a tree of fragments f, each fragment a token of a fragment type f = n(f ) in the original grammar G. By extension, we can therefore map any derivation d in G to the corresponding derivation d = n(d ) in G.",
        "The mapping n is an onto mapping from G to G. In particular, each derivation d in G has a nonempty set of corresponding derivations {d j = n~l(d) in G, because fragments f in d correspond to multiple fragments f in G that differ only in their indexed symbols (one f per occurrence of f in B).",
