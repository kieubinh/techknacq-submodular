        "As a robust unsupervised way to perform shallow latent semantic analysis of topics in text, probabilistic topic models (Hofmann, 1999a; Blei et al., 2003b) have recently attracted much attention.",
        "The common idea behind these models is the following.",
        "A topic is represented by a multinomial word distribution so that words characterizing a topic generally have higher probabilities than other words.",
        "We can then hypothesize the existence of multiple topics in text and define a generative model based on the hypothesized topics.",
        "By fitting the model to text data, we can obtain an estimate of all the word distributions corresponding to the latent topics as well as the topic distributions in text.",
        "Intuitively, the learned word distributions capture clusters of words that co-occur with each other probabilistically.",
        "Although many topic models have been proposed and shown to be useful (see Section 2 for more detailed discussion of related work), most of them share a common deficiency: they are designed to work only for monolingual text data and would not work well for extracting cross-lingual latent topics, i.e. topics shared in text data in two different natural languages.",
        "The deficiency comes from the fact that all these models rely on co-occurrences of words forming a topical cluster, but words in different language generally do not co-occur with each other.",
        "Thus with the existing models, we can only extract topics from text in each language, but cannot extract common topics shared in multiple languages.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel topic model, called Probabilistic Cross-Lingual Latent Semantic Analysis (PCLSA) model, which can be used to mine shared latent topics from unaligned text data in different languages.",
        "PCLSA extends the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model by regularizing its likelihood function with soft constraints defined based on a bilingual dictionary.",
        "The dictionary-based constraints are key to bridge the gap of different languages and would force the captured co-occurrences of words in each language by PCLSA to be \"synchronized\" so that related words in the two languages would have similar probabilities.",
        "PCLSA can be estimated efficiently using the General Expectation-Maximization (GEM) algorithm.",
        "As a topic extraction algorithm, PCLSA would take a pair of unaligned document sets in different languages and a bilingual dictionary as input, and output a set of aligned word distributions in both languages that can characterize the shared topics in the two languages.",
        "In addition, it also outputs a topic coverage distribution for each language to indicate the relative coverage of different shared topics in each language.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has attempted to solve this topic extraction problem and generate the same output.",
        "The closest existing work to ours is the MuTo model proposed in (Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2009) and the JointLDA model published recently in (Jagarala-mudi and Daum√© III, 2010).",
        "Both used a bilingual dictionary to bridge the language gap in a topic model.",
        "However, the goals of their work are different from ours in that their models mainly focus on mining cross-lingual topics of matching word pairs and discovering the correspondence at the vocabulary level.",
        "Therefore, the topics extracted using their model cannot indicate how a common topic is covered differently in the two languages, because the words in each word pair share the same probability in a common topic.",
        "Our work focuses on discovering correspondence at the topic level.",
        "In our model, since we only add a soft constraint on word pairs in the dictionary, their probabilities in common topics are generally different, naturally capturing which shows the different variations of a common topic in different languages.",
        "We use a cross-lingual news data set and a review data set to evaluate PCLSA.",
        "We also propose a \"cross-collection\" likelihood measure to quantitatively evaluate the quality of mined topics.",
        "Experimental results show that the PCLSA model can effectively extract cross-lingual latent topics from multilingual text data, and it outperforms a baseline approach using the standard PLSA on text data in each language."

        "Many topic models have been proposed, and the two basic models are the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model (Hofmann, 1999a) and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003b).",
        "They and their extensions have been successfully applied to many problems, including hierarchical topic extraction (Hofmann, 1999b; Blei et al., 2003a; Li and McCalcorporating the knowledge of a bilingual dictionary as soft constraints.",
        "Such an extension is similar to the extension of PLSA for incorporating social network analysis (Mei et al., 2008a) but our constraint is different.",
        "Some previous work on multilingual topic models assume documents in multiple languages are aligned either at the document level, sentence level or by time stamps (Mimno et al., 2009; Zhao and Xing, 2006; Kim and Khudanpur, 2004; Ni et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2007).",
        "However, in many applications, we need to mine topics from unaligned text corpus.",
        "For example, mining topics from search results in different languages can facilitate summarization of multilingual search results.",
        "Besides all the multilingual topic modeling work discussed above, comparable corpora have also been studied extensively (e.g. (Fung, 1995; Franz et al., 1998; Masuichi et al., 2000; Sadat et al., 2003; Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006)), but most previous work aims at acquiring word translation knowledge or cross-lingual text categorization from comparable corpora.",
        "Our work differs from this line of previous work in that our goal is to discover shared latent topics from multilingual text data that are weakly comparable (e.g. the data does not have to be aligned by time)."

        "In general, the problem of cross-lingual topic extraction can be defined as to extract a set of common cross-lingual latent topics covered in text collections in different natural languages.",
        "A cross-lingual latent topic will be represented as a multinomial word distribution over the words in all the languages, i.e. a multilingual word distribution.",
        "For example, given two collections of news articles in English and Chinese, respectively, we would like to extract common topics simultaneously from the two collections.",
        "A discovered common topic, such as the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, would be characterized by a word distribution that would assign relatively high probabilities to words related to this event in both English and Chinese (e.g. \"terror\", \"attack\", \"afghanistan\", \"taliban\", and their translations in Chinese).",
        "As a computational problem, our input is a multilingual text corpus, and output is a set of cross-lingual latent topics.",
        "We now define this problem more formally.",
        "Definition 1 (Multi-Lingual Corpus) A multilingual corpus C is a set of text collections [Ci, C2,..., Cs}, where Ci = [d\\, di,,..., diMi} is a collection of documents in language Li with vocabulary Vi = [w\\ ,w\\,..., wlN.}.",
        "Here, Mi is the total number of documents in Ci, Ni is the total number of words in Vi, and dj is a document in collection Ci.",
        "Following the common assumption of bag-of-words representation, we represent document dj with a bag of words [wj1, wj2wjd}, and use c(wk, dj) to denote the count of word w%k in document dij.",
        "Definition 2 (Cross-Lingual Topic): A cross-lingual topic 6 is a semantically coherent multinomial distribution over all the words in the vocabularies of languages Li,Ls.",
        "That is, p(w\\6) would give the probability of a word w which can be in any of the s languages under consideration.",
        "6 is semantically coherent if it assigns high probabilities to words that are semantically related either in the same language or across different languages.",
        "Clearly, we have ¬£s=i ¬£weVi p(w\\6) = 1 for any cross-lingual topic 6.",
        "Definition 3 (Cross-Lingual Topic Extraction) Given a multilingual corpus C, the task of cross-lingual topic extraction is to model and extract k major cross-lingual topics [6i,62,... ,6k} from C, where 6i is a cross-lingual topic, and k is a user specified parameter.",
        "The extracted cross-lingual topics can be directly used as a summary of the common content of the multilingual data set.",
        "Note that once a cross-lingual topic is extracted, we can easily obtain its representation in each language Li by \"splitting\" the cross-lingual topic into multiple word distributions in different languages.",
        "Formally, the word distribution of a cross-lingual",
        "topic 6 in language Li is given by pi(wi\\6) = p{wi\\e)",

        "They can also be used to analyze the difference of the coverage of the same topic in different languages.",

        "In this section, we present our probabilistic cross-lingual latent semantic analysis (PCLSA) model and discuss how it can be used to extract cross-lingual topics from multilingual text data.",
        "The main reason why existing topic models can't be used for cross-lingual topic extraction is because they cannot cross the language barrier.",
        "Intuitively, in order to cross the language barrier and extract a common topic shared in articles in different languages, we must rely on some kind of linguistic knowledge.",
        "Our PCLSA model assumes the availability of bilingual dictionaries for at least some language pairs, which are generally available for major language pairs.",
        "Specifically, for text data in languages L , ... , Ls, if we represent each language as a node in a graph and connect those language pairs for which we have a bilingual dictionary, the minimum requirement is that the whole graph is connected.",
        "Thus, as a minimum, we will need s ‚Äì 1 distinct bilingual dictionaries.",
        "This is so that we can potentially cross all the language barriers.",
        "Our key idea is to \"synchronize\" the extraction of monolingual \"component topics\" of a cross-lingual topic from individual languages by forcing a cross-lingual topic word distribution to assign similar probabilities to words that are potential translations according to a Li-Lj bilingual dictionary.",
        "We achieve this by adding such preferences formally to the likelihood function of a probabilistic topic model as \"soft constraints\" so that when we estimate the model, we would try to not only fit the text data well (which is necessary to extract coherent component topics from each language), but also satisfy our specified preferences (which would ensure the extracted component topics in different languages are semantically related).",
        "Below we present how we implement this idea in more detail.",
        "A bilingual dictionary for languages Li and Lj generally would give us a many-to-many mapping between the vocabularies of the two languages.",
        "With such a mapping, we can construct a bipartite graph Gij = (Vij,Eij) between the two languages where if one word can be potentially translated into another word, the two words would be connected with an edge.",
        "An edge can be weighted based on the probability of the corresponding translation.",

        "China Porcelain",
        "With multiple bilingual dictionaries, we can merge the graphs to generate a multi-partite graph G = (V,E).",
        "Based on this graph, the PCLSA model extends the standard PLSA by adding a constraint to the likelihood function to \"smooth\" the word distributions of topics in PLSA on the multi-partite graph so that we would encourage the words that are connected in the graph (i.e. possible translations of each other) to be given similar probabilities by every cross-lingual topic.",
        "Thus when a cross-lingual topic picks up words that co-occur in monolingual text, it would prefer picking up word pairs whose translations in other languages also co-occur with each other, giving us a coherent multilingual word distribution that characterizes well the content of text in different languages.",
        "Specifically, let 6 = [6j} (j = 1,k) be a set of k cross-lingual topic models to be discovered from a multilingual text data set with s languages such that p(w\\6i) is the probability of word w according to the topic model 6i.",
        "If we are to use the regular PLSA to model our data, we would have the following log-likelihood and we usually use a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate parameters and discover topics.",
        "i=i deCi w j=i",
        "Our main extension is to add to L(C) a cross-lingual constraint term R(C) to incorporate the knowledge of bilingual dictionaries.",
        "R(C) is defined as where w(u, v) is the weight on the edge between u and v in the multi-partite graph G = (V,E), which in our experiments is set to 1, and Deg(u) is the degree of word u, i.e. the sum of the weights of all the edges ending with u.",
        "Intuitively, R(C) measures the difference between p(wu\\6j) and p(wv\\6j) for each pair (u, v) in a bilingual dictionary; the more they differ, the larger R(C) would be.",
        "So it can be regarded as a \"loss function\" to help us assess how well the \"component word distributions\" in multiple languages are correlated semantically.",
        "Clearly, we would like the extracted topics to have a small R(C).",
        "We choose this specific form of loss function because it would make it convenient to solve the optimization problem of maximizing the corresponding regularized maximum likelihood (Mei et al., 2008b).",
        "The normalization with Deg(u) and Deg(v) can be regarded as a way to compensate for the potential ambiguity of u and v in their translations.",
        "Putting L(C) and R(C) together, we would like to maximize the following objective function which is a regularized log-likelihood:",
        "where X G (0,1) is a parameter to balance the likelihood and the regularizer.",
        "When X = 0, we recover the standard PLSA.",
        "Specifically, we will search for a set of values for all our parameters that can maximize the objective function defined above.",

        "This optimization problem can be solved using a Generalized Expectation-Maximization (GEM) algorithm as described in (Mei et al., 2008a).",
        "Specifically, in the E-step of the algorithm, the distribution of hidden variables is computed using Eq.",

        "Fortunately, according to GEM we do not need to find the local maximum of Q(^>; ^n) in every M-step, and we only need to find a new value ^>n+1 to improve the complete data likelihood, i.e. to make sure Q(^n+i] ^n) > Q(^n] *n).",

        "To show the effectiveness of PCLSA in mining multiple language corpus, we first construct a simulated data set based on 1115 reviews of three brands of laptops, namely IBM (303), Apple(468) and DELL(344).",
        "To simulate a three language corpus, we use an 'IBM' word, an 'Apple' word, and a 'Dell' word to replace an English word in their corpus.",
        "For example, we use 'IBM10', 'ApplelO', 'Dell10' to replace the word 'CD' whenever it appears in an IBM's, Apple's, or Dell's review.",
        "After the replacement, the reviews about IBM, Apple, and Dell will not share vocabularies with each other.",
        "On the other hand, for any three created words which represent the same English word, we add three edges among them, and therefore we get a simulated dictionary graph for our PCLSA model.",

        "In this paper, we study the problem of cross-lingual latent topic extraction where the task is to extract a set of common latent topics from multilingual text data.",
        "We propose a novel probabilistic topic model (i.e. the Probabilistic Cross-Lingual Latent Semantic Analysis (PCLSA) model) that can incorporate translation knowledge in bilingual dictionaries as a regularizer to constrain the parameter estimation so that the learned topic models would be synchronized in multiple languages.",
        "We evaluated the model using several data sets.",
        "The experimental results show that PCLSA is effective in extracting common latent topics from multilingual text data, and it outperforms the baseline method which uses the standard PLSA to fit each monolingual text data set.",
        "Our work opens up some interesting future research directions to further explore.",
        "First, in this paper, we have only experimented with uniform weighting of edge in the bilingual graph.",
        "It should be very interesting to explore how to assign weights to the edges and study whether weighted graphs can further improve performance.",
        "Second, it would also be interesting to further extend PCLSA to accommodate discovering topics in each language that aren't well-aligned with other languages."
