        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of automatically determining the correct sense for a target word given the context in which it occurs.",
        "WSD is an important problem in NLP and an essential preprocessing step for many applications, including machine translation, question answering and information extraction.",
        "However, WSD is a difficult task, and despite the fact that it has been the focus of much research over the years, state-of-the-art systems are still often not good enough for real-world applications.",
        "One major factor that makes WSD difficult is a relative lack of manually annotated corpora, which hampers the performance of supervised systems.",
        "To address this problem, there has been a significant amount of work on unsupervised WSD that does not require manually sense-disambiguated training data (see McCarthy (2009) for an overview).",
        "Recently, several researchers have experimented with topic models (Brody and Lapata, 2009; Boyd-Graber et al., 2007; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2007; Cai et al., 2007) for sense disambiguation and induction.",
        "Topic models are generative probabilistic models of text corpora in which each document is modelled as a mixture over (latent) topics, which are in turn represented by a distribution over words.",
        "Previous approaches using topic models for sense disambiguation either embed topic features in a supervised model (Cai et al., 2007) or rely heavily on the structure of hierarchical lexicons such as WordNet (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel framework which is fairly resource-poor in that it requires only 1) a large unlabelled corpus from which to estimate the topics distributions, and 2) paraphrases for the possible target senses.",
        "The paraphrases can be user-supplied or can be taken from existing resources.",
        "We approach the sense disambiguation task by choosing the best sense based on the conditional probability of sense paraphrases given a context.",
        "We propose three models which are suitable for different situations: Model I requires knowledge of the prior distribution over senses and directly maximizes the conditional probability of a sense given the context; Model II maximizes this conditional probability by maximizing the cosine value of two topic-document vectors (one for the sense and one for the context).",
        "We apply these models to coarse-and fine-grained WSD and find that they outperform comparable systems for both tasks.",
        "We also test our framework on the related task of idiom detection, which involves distinguishing literal and nonliteral usages of potentially ambiguous expressions such as rock the boat.",
        "For this task, we propose a third model.",
        "Model III calculates the probability of a sense given a context according to the component words of the sense paraphrase.",
        "Specifically, it chooses the sense type which maximizes the probability (given the context) of the paraphrase component word with the highest likelihood of occurring in that context.",
        "This model also outperforms state-of-the-art systems."

        "They can be combined with supervised machine-learning models to assemble semi-supervised approaches.",

        "(2007) enhance the basic LDA algorithm by incorporating WordNet senses as an additional latent variable.",
        "Instead of generating words directly from a topic, each topic is associated with a random walk through the WordNet hierarchy which generates the observed word.",
        "Topics and synsets are then inferred together.",
        "While Boyd-Graber et al.",
        "(2007) show that this method can lead to improvements in accuracy, they also find that idiosyncracies in the hierarchical structure of WordNet can harm performance.",
        "This is a general problem for methods which use hierarchical lexicons to model semantic distance (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "In our approach, we circumvent this problem by exploiting paraphrase information for the target senses rather than relying on the structure of WordNet as a whole.",

      "text": [
        "As pointed out by Hofmann (1999), the starting point of topic models is to decompose the conditional word-document probability distribution p(w\\d) into two different distributions: the word-topic distribution p(w\\z), and the topic-document distribution p(z\\d) (see Equation 1).",
        "This allows each semantic topic z to be represented as a multinominal distribution of words p(w\\z), and each document d to be represented as a multinominal distribution of semantic topics p(z\\d).",
        "The model introduces a conditional independence assumption that document d and word w are independent conditioned on the hidden variable, topic z.",
        "LDA is a Bayesian version of this framework with Dirichlet hyper-parameters (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "The inference of the two distributions given an observed corpus can be done through Gibbs Sampling (Geman and Geman, 1987; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "For each turn of the sampling, each word in each document is assigned a semantic topic based on the current word-topic distribution and topic-document distribution.",
        "The resulting topic assignments are then used to re-estimate a new word-topic distribution and topic-document distribution for the next turn.",
        "This process repeats until convergence.",
        "To avoid statistical coincidence, the final estimation of the distributions is made by the average of all the turns after convergence.",
        "Assigning the correct sense s to a target word w occurring in a context c involves finding the sense which maximizes the conditional probability of senses given a context:",
        "In our model, we represent a sense (si) as a collection of 'paraphrases' that capture (some aspect of) the meaning of the sense.",
        "These paraphrases can be taken from an existing resource such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) or supplied by the user (see Section 4).",
        "This conditional probability is decomposed by incorporating a hidden variable, topic z, introduced by the topic model.",
        "We propose three variations of the basic model, depending on how much background information is available, i.e., knowledge of the prior sense distribution available and type of sense paraphrases used.",
        "In Model I and Model II, the sense paraphrases are obtained from WordNet, and both the context and the sense paraphrases are treated as documents, c = dc and s = ds.",
        "WordNet is a fairly rich resource which provides detailed information about word senses (glosses, example sentences, synsets, semantic relations between senses, etc.).",
        "Sometimes such detailed information may not be available, for instance for languages for which such a resource does not exist or for expressions that are not very well covered in WordNet, such as idioms.",
        "For those situations, we propose another model, Model III, in which contexts are treated as documents while sense paraphrases are treated as sequences of independent words.",
        "Model I directly maximizes the conditional probability of the sense given the context, where the sense is modeled as a 'paraphrase document' ds and the context as a 'context document' dc.",
        "The conditional probability of sense given context p( ds\\ dc) can be rewritten as a joint probability divided by a normalization factor:",
        "This joint probability can be rewritten as a generative process by introducing a hidden variable z.",
        "We make the conditional independence assumption that, conditioned on the topic z, a paraphrase document ds is generated independently of the specific context document dc:",
        "We apply the same process to the conditional probability p(dc\\z).",
        "It can be rewritten as:",
        "Now, the disambiguation model p(ds\\ dc) can be rewritten as a prior p(ds) times a topic function",
        "As p( z) is a uniform distribution according to the uniform Dirichlet priors assumption, Equation 6 can be rewritten as:",
        "Model I:",
        "Model I has the disadvantage that it requires information about the prior distribution of senses p(ds), which is not always available.",
        "We use sense frequency information from WordNet to estimate the prior sense distribution, although it must be kept in mind that, depending on the genre of the texts, it is possible that the distribution of senses in the testing corpus may diverge greatly from the WordNet-based estimation.",
        "If there is no means for estimating the prior sense distribution of an experimental corpus, generally a uniform distribution must be assumed.",
        "However, this assumption does not hold, as the true distribution of word senses is often highly skewed (McCarthy, 2009).",
        "To overcome this problem, we propose Model II, which indirectly maximizes the sense-context probability by maximizing the cosine value of two document vectors that encode the document-topic frequencies from sampling, v(z\\dc) and v(z\\ds).",
        "The document vectors are represented by topics, with each dimension representing the number of times that the tokens in this document are assigned to a certain topic.",
        "Model II:",
        "Ifthe prior distribution ofsenses is known, Model I is the best choice.",
        "However, Model II has to be chosen instead when this knowledge is not available.",
        "In our experiments, we test the performance of both models (see Section 5).",
        "If the sense paraphrases are very short, it is difficult to reliably estimate p(z\\ds).",
        "In order to solve this problem, we treat the sense paraphrase ds as a 'query', a concept which is used in information retrieval.",
        "One model from information retrieval takes the conditional probability of the query given the document as a product of all the conditional probabilities of words in the query given the document.",
        "The assumption is that the query is generated by a collection of conditionally independent words (Song and Croft, 1999).",
        "We make the same assumption here.",
        "However, instead of taking the product of all the conditional probabilities of words given the document, we take the maximum.",
        "There are two reasons for this: (i) taking the product may penalize longer paraphrases since the product of probabilities decreases as there are more words; (ii) we do not want to model the probability of generating specific paraphrases, but rather the probability of generating a sense, which might only be represented by one or two words in the paraphrases (e.g., the potentially idiomatic phrase 'rock the boat' can be paraphrased as 'break the norm' or 'cause trouble'.",
        "A similar topic distribution to that of the individual words 'norm' or 'trouble' would be strong supporting evidence of the corresponding idiomatic reading.).",
        "We propose Model III:",
        "where qs is a collection of words contained in the sense paraphrases.",
        "One possible inference approach is to combine the context documents and sense paraphrases into a corpus and run Gibbs sampling on this corpus.",
        "The problem with this approach is that the test set and sense paraphrase set are relatively small, and topic models running on a small corpus are less likely to capture rich semantic topics.",
        "One simple explanation for this is that a small corpus usually has a relatively small vocabulary, which is less representative of topics, i.e., p(w\\z) cannot be estimated reliably.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, we infer the word-topic distribution from a very large corpus (Wikipedia dump, see Section 4).",
        "All the following inference experiments on the test corpus are based on the assumption that the word-topic distribution p( w\\ z) is the same as the one estimated from the Wikipedia dump.",

        "The unsupervised Type III model Model II achieves better results than the most frequent sense baseline on nouns, but not on other parts-of-speech.",
        "This is in line with results obtained by previous systems (Griffiths et al., 2005; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008; Cai et al., 2007).",
        "While the performance on verbs can be increased to outperform the most frequent sense baseline by including the prior sense probability, the performance on adjectives and adverbs remains below the most frequent sense baseline.",
        "We think that there are three reasons for this: first, adjectives and adverbs have fewer reference synsets for paraphrases compared with nouns and verbs (see Table 1); second, adjectives and adverbs tend to convey less key semantic content in the document, so they are more difficult to capture by the topic model; and third, adjectives and adverbs are a small portion of the test set, so their performances are statistically unstable.",
        "For example, if 'already' appears 10 times out of 20 adverb instances, a system may get bad result on adverbs only because of its failure to disambiguate the word 'already'.",

        "As can be seen from the table, including all reference synsets in sense paraphrases increases performance.",
        "Longer paraphrases contain more information, and they are statistically more stable for inference.",
        "We find that nouns get the greatest performance boost from including reference synsets, as they have the largest number of different types of synsets.",
        "We also find the 'similar' reference synset for adjectives to be very useful.",
        "Performance on adjectives increases by 2.75% when including this reference synset.",
        "Context analysis In order to study how the context influences the performance, we experiment with Model II on different context sizes (see Table 3).",
        "We find sentence context is the best size for this disambiguation task.",
        "Using a smaller context not only reduces the precision, but also reduces the recall rate, which is caused by the all-zero topic assignment by the topic model for documents only containing words that are not in the vocabulary.",
        "As a result, the model is unable to disambiguate.",
        "The context based on the whole text (article) does not perform well either, possibly because using the full text folds in too much noisy information.",

        "To determine whether our framework is also able to detect subtler sense distinctions, we tested Model I on the English all-words subtask of SemEval-2007 Task-17 (see Table 4).",
        "We find that Model I performs better than both the best unsupervised system, RACAI (Ion and Tufis,, 2007) and the most frequent sense baseline (BLmfs), although these differences are not statistically significant due to the small size of the available test data (465).",

        "WordNet has a relatively low coverage for idiomatic expressions.",

        "As the paraphrases obtained from the idiom dictionary are very short, we treat the paraphrase as a sequence of independent words instead of as a document and apply Model III (see Section 3).",

        "This shows how a limited amount of human knowledge (e.g., paraphrases) can be added to an unsupervised system for a strong boost in performance ( Model III compared with the cohesion-graph and the bootstrapping approaches).",
        "For obvious reasons, this approach is sensitive to the quality of the paraphrases.",
        "The paraphrases chosen to characterise (aspects of) the meaning of a sense should be non-ambiguous between the literal or idiomatic meaning.",
        "For instance, 'fire' is not a good choice for a paraphrase of the literal reading of 'play with fire', since this word can be interpreted literally as 'fire' or metaphorically as 'something dangerous'.",
        "The verb component word 'play' is a better literal paraphrase.",
        "For the same reason, this approach works well for expressions where the literal and nonliteral readings are well separated (i.e., occur in different contexts), while the performance drops for expressions whose literal and idiomatic readings can appear in a similar context.",
        "We test the performance on individual idioms on the five most frequent idioms in our corpus (see Table 6).",
        "We find that 'drop the ball' is a difficult case.",
        "The words 'fault', 'mistake', 'fail' or 'miss' can be used as the nonlit-eral paraphrases.",

        "In contrast, the performance on 'rock the boat' is much better, since the nonliteral reading of the phrases 'break the norm' or 'cause trouble' are less likely to be linked with the literal reading 'boat'.",
        "This may also be because 'boat' is not often used metaphorically in the corpus.",
        "As the topic distribution of nouns and verbs exhibit different properties, topic comparisons across parts-of-speech do not make sense.",

        "We propose three models for sense disambiguation on words and multi-word expressions.",

        "While Model I and Model III model the problem in a probabilistic way, Model II uses a vector space model by comparing the cosine values of two topic vectors.",
        "Model II and Model III are completely unsupervised, while Model I needs the prior sense distribution.",
        "Model I and Model II treat the sense paraphrases as documents, while Model III treats the sense paraphrases as a collection of independent words.",
        "We test the proposed models on three tasks.",
        "We apply Model I and Model II to the WSD tasks due to the availability of more paraphrase information.",
        "Model III is applied to the idiom detection task since the paraphrases from the idiom dictionary are smaller.",
        "We find that all models outperform comparable state-of-the-art systems either quantitatively or statistically significantly.",

        "The system also points out a promising way of solving the granularity problem of word sense disambiguation, as new application tasks which need different sense granularities can utilize this framework when new paraphrases of sense clusters are available.",
        "In addition, this system can also be used in a larger context such as figurative language identification (literal or figurative) and sentiment detection (positive or negative)."
