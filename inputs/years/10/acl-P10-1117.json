        "Grammars offer structural and positional sensitivity that is not exploited in the basic LDA topic models.",
        "Here we explore the potential for using Bayesian inference for learning linear ordering constraints that hold between elements within proper names.",
        "The Penn WSJ treebank is a widely used resource within computational linguistics (Marcus et al., 1993), but one of its weaknesses is that it does not indicate any structure internal to base noun phrases (i.e., it presents \"flat\" analyses of the pre-head NP elements).",
        "For many applications it would be extremely useful to have a more elaborated analysis of this kind of NP structure.",
        "For example, in an NP coreference application, if we could determine that Bill and Hillary are both first names then we could infer that Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are likely to refer to distinct individuals.",
        "On the other hand, because Mr in Mr Clinton is not a first name, it is possible that Mr Clinton and Bill Clinton refer to the same individual (Elsner et al., 2009).",
        "Here we present an adaptor grammar based on the insights of the PCFG encoding of LDA topic models that learns some of the structure of proper names.",
        "The key idea is that elements in proper names typically appear in a fixed order; we expect honorifics to appear before first names, which appear before middle names, which in turn appear before surnames, etc.",
        "Similarly, many company names end in fixed phrases such as Inc.",
        "Here we think of first names as a kind of topic, albeit one with a restricted positional location.",
        "One of the challenges is that some of these structural elements can be filled by multiword expressions; e.g., de Groot can be a surname.",
        "We deal with this by permitting multi-word collocations to fill the corresponding positions, and use the adaptor grammar machinery to learn these collocations.",
        "Inspired by the grammar presented in Elsner et al.",
        "(2009), our adaptor grammar is as follows, where adapted nonterminals are indicated by underlining as before.",
        "B6 – Word+ Unordered – Word+",
        "In this grammar parentheses indicate optionality, and the Kleene plus indicates iteration (these were manually expanded into ordinary CFG rules in our experiments).",
        "The grammar provides three different expansions for proper names.",
        "The first expansion says that a proper name can consist of some subset of the six different collocation classes A0 through A6 in that order, while the second expansion says that a proper name can consist of some subset of the collocation classes B0 through B6, again in that order.",
        "Finally, the third expansion says that a proper name can consist of an arbitrary sequence of \"unordered\" collocations (this is intended as a \"catch-all\" expansion to provide analyses for proper names that don't fit either of the first two expansions).",
        "We extracted all of the proper names (i.e., phrases of category NNP and NNPS) in the Penn WSJ treebank and used them as the training corpora for the adaptor grammar just described.",
        "The adaptor grammar inference procedure found skeletal sample parses such as the following:",
        "(B0 american express) (B1 information services) (B6 co) (U abc) (U sports) (U sports illustrated) (U sports unlimited)",
        "While a full evaluation will have to await further study, in general it seems to distinguish person names from company names reasonably reliably, and it seems to have discovered that person names consist of a first name (A0), a middle name or initial (A2), a surname (A3) and an optional suffix (A4).",
        "Similarly, it seems to have uncovered that company names typically end in a phrase such as inc, ltd or co."

        "This paper establishes a connection between two very different kinds of probabilistic models; LDA models of the kind used for topic modelling, and PCFGs, which are a standard model of hierarchical structure in language.",
        "The embedding we presented shows how to express an LDA model as a PCFG, and has the property that Bayesian inference of the parameters of that PCFG produces an equivalent model to that produced by Bayesian inference of the LDA model's parameters.",
        "The primary value of this embedding is theoretical rather than practical; we are not advocating the use of PCFG estimation procedures to infer LDA models.",
        "Instead, we claim that the embedding suggests novel extensions to both the LDA topic models and PCFG-style grammars.",
        "We justified this claim by presenting several hybrid models that combine aspects of both topic models and grammars.",
        "We don't claim that these are necessarily the best models for performing any particular tasks; rather, we present them as examples of models inspired by a combination of PCFGs and LDA topic models.",
        "We showed how the LDA to PCFG embedding suggested a \"sticky topic\" model extension to LDA.",
        "We then discussed adaptor grammars, and inspired by the LDA topic models, presented a novel topic model whose primitive elements are multi-word collocations rather than words.",
        "We concluded with an adaptor grammar that learns aspects of the internal structure of proper names."
