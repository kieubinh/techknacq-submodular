        "In natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) fields, question answering (QA) problem has attracted much attention over the past few years.",
        "Nevertheless, most of the QA researches mainly focus on locating the exact answer to a given factoid question in the related documents.",
        "The most well known international evaluation on the factoid QA task is the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), and the annotated questions and answers released by TREC have become important resources for the researchers.",
        "However, when facing a non-factoid question such as why, how, or what about, however, almost no automatic QA systems work very well.",
        "The user-generated question-answer pairs are definitely of great importance to solve the non-factoid questions.",
        "Obviously, these natural QA pairs are usually created during people's communication via Internet social media, among which we are interested in the community-driven question-answering (cQA) sites and online forums.",
        "The cQA sites (or systems) provide platforms where users can either ask questions or deliver answers, and best answers are selected manually (e.g., Baidu Zhidao and Yahoo!",
        "Answers).",
        "Comparing with cQA sites, online forums have more virtual society characteristics, where people hold discussions in certain domains, such as techniques, travel, sports, etc.",
        "Online forums contain a huge number of QA pairs, and much noise information is involved.",
        "To make use of the QA pairs in cQA sites and online forums, one has to face the challenging problem of distinguishing the questions and their answers from the noise.",
        "According to our investigation, the data in the community based sites, especially for the forums, have two obvious characteristics: (a) a post usually includes a very short content, and when a person is initializing or replying a post, an informal tone tends to be used; (b) most of the posts are useless, which makes the community become a noisy environment for question-answer detection.",
        "In this paper, a novel approach for modeling the semantic relevance for QA pairs in the social media sites is proposed.",
        "We concentrate on the following two problems:",
        "1.",
        "How to model the semantic relationship between two short texts using simple textual features?",
        "As mentioned above, the user generated questions and their answers via social media are always short texts.",
        "The limitation of length leads to the sparsity of the word features.",
        "In addition, the word frequency is usually either 0 or 1, that is, the frequency offers little information except the occurrence of a word.",
        "Because of this situation, the traditional relevance computing methods based on word co-occurrence, such as Cosine similarity and KL-divergence, are not effective for questionanswer semantic modeling.",
        "Most researchers try to introduce structural features or users' behavior to improve the models performance, by contrast, the effect of textual features is not obvious.",
        "2.",
        "How to train a model so that it has good performance on both cQA and forum datasets?",
        "So far, people have been doing QA researches on the cQA and the forum datasets separately (Ding et al., 2008; Surdeanu et al., 2008), and no one has noticed the relationship between the two kinds of data.",
        "Since both the cQA systems and the online forums are open platforms for people to communicate, the QA pairs in the cQA systems have similarity with those in the forums.",
        "In this case, it is highly valuable and desirable to propose a training strategy to improve the model's performance on both of the two kinds of datasets.",
        "In addition, it is possible to avoid the expensive and arduous hand-annotating work by introducing the method.",
        "To solve the first problem, we present a deep belief network (DBN) to model the semantic relevance between questions and their answers.",
        "The network establishes the semantic relationship for QA pairs by minimizing the answer-to-question reconstructing error.",
        "Using only word features, our model outperforms the traditional methods on question-answer relevance calculating.",
        "For the second problem, we make our model to learn the semantic knowledge from the solved question threads in the cQA system.",
        "Instead of mining the structure based features from cQA pages and forum threads individually, we consider the textual similarity between the two kinds of data.",
        "The semantic information learned from cQA corpus is helpful to detect answers in forums, which makes our model show good performance on social media corpora.",
        "Thanks to the labels for the best answers existing in the threads, no manual work is needed in our strategy.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys the related work.",
        "Section 3 introduces the deep belief network for answer detection.",
        "In Section 4, the homogenous data based learning strategy is described.",
        "Experimental result is given in Section 5.",

        "For HowNet based approaches, there are a large number of words not included by HowNet, thus it fails to compute the similarity between questions and answers.",
        "KL-divergence suffers from the same problems with the Cosine Similarity method.",
        "Compared with the Cosine Similarity method, this approach has achieved the improvement of 9.3% in P@1, but it performs much better than the other baseline methods in MRR.",
        "The baseline results indicate that the online forum is a complex environment with large amount of noise for answer detection.",
        "Traditional IR methods using pure textual features can hardly achieve good results.",
        "The similar baseline results for forum answer ranking are also achieved by Hong and Davison (2009), which takes some nontextual features to improve the algorithm's performance.",
        "We also notice that, however, the baseline methods have obtained better results on forum corpus (Cong et al., 2008).",
        "One possible reason is that the baseline approaches are suitable for their data, since we observe that the \"nearest answer\" strategy has obtained a 73.5% precision in their work.",
        "Our model has achieved the precision of 45.00% in P@1 and 62.03% in MRR for answer detecting on forum data after fine-tuning, while some related works have reported the results with the precision over 90% (Cong et al., 2008; Hong and Davison, 2009).",
        "There are mainly two reasons for this phenomena: Firstly, both of the previous works have adopt non-textual features based on the forum structure, such as authorship, position and quotes, etc.",
        "The non-textual (or social based) features have played a significant role in improving the algorithms' performance.",
        "Secondly, the quality of corpora influences the results of the ranking strategies significantly, and even the same algorithm may perform differently when the dataset is changed (Hong and Davison, 2009).",
        "For the experiments of this paper, large amount of noise is involved in the forum corpus and we have done nothing extra to filter it.",

        "From Table 2 we observe that all the approaches perform much better on this dataset.",
        "We attribute the improvements to the high quality QA corpus Baidu Zhidao offers: the candidate answers tend to be more formal than the ones in the forums, with less noise information included.",
        "In addition, the \"Nearest Answer\" strategy has reached 36.05% in P@1 on this dataset, which indicates quite a number of askers receive the real answers at the first answer post.",
        "This result has supported the idea of introducing position features.",
        "What's more, if the best answer appear immediately, the asker tends to lock down the question thread, which helps to reduce the noise information in the cQA corpus.",
        "Despite the baseline methods' performances have been improved, our approaches still outperform them, with a 32.0% improvement in P@1 and a 15.3% improvement in MRR at least.",
        "On the cQA dataset, our model shows better performance than the previous experiment, which is expected because the training set and the testing set come from the same corpus, and the DBN model is more adaptive to the cQA data.",
        "We have observed that, from both of the two groups of experiments, fine-tuning is effective for enhancing the performance of our model.",
        "On the forum data, the results have been improved by 8.6% in P@1 and 4.0% in MRR, and the improvements are 3.5% and 3.1% individually."

        "As a data driven approach, our model learns semantic knowledge from large amount of QA pairs to represent the semantic relevance between questions and their answers.",
        "(2) We have studied the textual similarity between the cQA and the forum datasets for QA pair extraction, and introduce a novel learning strategy to make our method show good performance on both cQA and forum datasets.",
        "The experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional approaches on both the cQA and the forum corpora.",
        "Our future work will be carried out along two directions.",
        "Firstly, we will further improve the performance of our method by adopting the nontextual features.",
        "Secondly, more research will be taken to put forward other architectures of the deep networks for QA detection."
