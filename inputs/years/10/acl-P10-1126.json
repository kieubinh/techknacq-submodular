        "Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented growth in the amount of digital information available on the Internet.",
        "Flickr, one of the best known photo sharing websites, hosts more than three billion images, with approximately 2.5 million images being uploaded every day.",
        "Many on-line news sites like CNN, Yahoo!, and BBC publish images with their stories and even provide photo feeds related to current events.",
        "Browsing and finding pictures in large-scale and heterogeneous collections is an important problem that has attracted much interest within information retrieval.",
        "Many of the search engines deployed on the web retrieve images without analyzing their content, simply by matching user queries against collocated textual information.",
        "Examples include meta-data (e.g., the image's file name and format), user-annotated tags, captions, and generally text surrounding the image.",
        "As this limits the applicability of search engines (images that do not coincide with textual data cannot be retrieved), a great deal of work has focused on the development of methods that generate description words for a picture automatically.",
        "The literature is littered with various attempts to learn the associations between image features and words using supervised classification (Vailaya et al., 2001; Smeulders et al., 2000), instantiations of the noisy-channel model (Duygulu et al., 2002), latent variable models (Blei and Jordan, 2003; Barnard et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2009), and models inspired by information retrieval (Lavrenko et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper we go one step further and generate captions for images rather than individual keywords.",
        "Although image indexing techniques based on keywords are popular and the method of choice for image retrieval engines, there are good reasons for using more linguistically meaningful descriptions.",
        "A list of keywords is often ambiguous.",
        "An image annotated with the words blue, sky, car could depict a blue car or a blue sky, whereas the caption \"car running under the blue sky\" would make the relations between the words explicit.",
        "Automatic caption generation could improve image retrieval by supporting longer and more targeted queries.",
        "It could also assist journalists in creating descriptions for the images associated with their articles.",
        "Beyond image retrieval, it could increase the accessibility of the web for visually impaired (blind and partially sighted) users who cannot access the content of many sites in the same ways as sighted users can (Ferres et al., 2006).",
        "We explore the feasibility of automatic caption generation in the news domain, and create descriptions for images associated with on-line articles.",
        "Obtaining training data in this setting does not require expensive manual annotation as many articles are published together with captioned images.",
        "Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive caption generation models.",
        "The backbone for both approaches is a probabilistic image annotation model that suggests keywords for an image.",
        "We can then simply identify (and rank) the sentences in the documents that share these keywords or create a new caption that is potentially more concise but also informative and fluent.",
        "Our abstractive model operates over image description keywords and document phrases.",
        "Their combination gives rise to many caption realizations which we select probabilistically by taking into account dependency and word order constraints.",
        "Experimental results show that the model's output compares favorably to handwritten captions and is often superior to extractive methods."

        "A multi-sentence description is generated using a document planner and a surface realizer.",
        "Within natural language processing most previous efforts have focused on generating captions to accompany complex graphical presentations (Mittal et al., 1998; Corio and Lapalme, 1999; Fas-ciano and Lapalme, 2000; Feiner and McKeown, 1990) or on using the captions accompanying information graphics to infer their intended message, e.g., the author's goal to convey ostensible increase or decrease of a quantity of interest (Elzer et al., 2005).",
        "Little emphasis is placed on image processing; it is assumed that the data used to create the graphics are available, and the goal is to enable users understand the information expressed in them.",
        "The task of generating captions for news images is novel to our knowledge.",
        "Instead of relying on manual annotation or background ontological information we exploit a multimodal database of news articles, images, and their captions.",
        "The latter is admittedly noisy, yet can be easily obtained from on-line sources, and contains rich information about the entities and events depicted in the images and their relations.",
        "Similar to previous work, we also follow a two-stage approach.",
        "Using an image annotation model, we first describe the picture with keywords which are subsequently realized into a human readable sentence.",
        "The caption generation task bears some resemblance to headline generation (Dorr et al., 2003; Banko et al., 2000; Jin and Hauptmann, 2002) where the aim is to create a very short summary for a document.",
        "Importantly, we aim to create a caption that not only summarizes the document but is also a faithful to the image's content (i.e., the caption should also mention some of the objects or individuals depicted in the image).",
        "We therefore explore extractive and abstractive models that rely on visual information to drive the generation process.",

        "A good caption must be succinct and informative, clearly identify the subject of the picture, establish the picture's relevance to the article, provide context for the picture, and ultimately draw the reader into the article.",

        "In most cases the keywords are found in the document but interspersed across multiple sentences.",

        "The likelihood of different surface realizations is estimated using a bigram model.",
        "They also take the distribution of the length of the headlines into account in an attempt to bias the model towards generating concise output:",

        "The above model can be easily adapted to the caption generation task.",
        "Content selection is now the probability of a word appearing in the caption given the image and its associated document which we obtain from the output of our image annotation model (see Section 4).",
        "In addition we replace the bigram surface realizer with a trigram:",
        "where C is the caption, j the image, D the accompanying document, and P(wi G C j, D) the image annotation probability.",
        "Despite its simplicity, the caption generation model in (7) has a major drawback.",
        "The content selection component will naturally tend to ignore function words, as they are not descriptive of the image's content.",
        "This will seriously impact the grammaticality of the generated captions, as there will be no appropriate function words to glue the content words together.",
        "One way to remedy this is to revert to a content selection model that ignores the image and simply estimates the probability of a word appearing in the caption given the same word appearing in the document.",
        "At the same time we modify our surface realization component so that it takes note ofthe image annotation probabilities.",
        "Specifically, we use an adaptive language model (Kneser et al., 1997) that modifies an n-gram model with local unigram probabilities:",
        "where P(wi G C\\wi G D) is the probability of wi appearing in the caption given that it appears in the document D, and Padap(wi\\wi-1, wi-2) the language model adapted with probabilities from our image annotation model:",
        "Pback (w) where Pback(w\\h) is the probability of w given the history h of preceding words (i.e., the original trigram model), Padap(w) the probability of w according to the image annotation model, Pback( w) the probability of w according to the original model, and ß a scaling parameter.",

        "Specifically, we obtain phrases from the output of a dependency parser.",
        "A phrase is simply a head and its dependents with the exception of verbs, where we record only the head (otherwise, an entire sentence could be a phrase).",
        "For example, from the first sentence in Table 1 (first row, left document) we would extract the phrases: thousands of Tongans, attended, the funeral, King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, last week, at the age, died, and so on.",

        "where w j is a word in the phrase P j.",
        "One problem with the models discussed thus far is that words or phrases are independent of each other.",
        "It is up to the trigram model to enforce coarse ordering constraints.",
        "These may be sufficient when considering isolated words, but phrases are longer and their combinations are subject to structural constraints that are not captured by sequence models.",

        "wiGPiwjGPj",
        "where p( w j\\ wi) is the probability of a phrase containing word wj appearing to the right of a phrase containing word wi, f(wi, wj) indicates the number of times wi and wj are adjacent, f(wi, -) is the number of times wi appears on the left of any phrase, and f(-, wi) the number of times it appears on the right.",
        "After integrating the attachment probabilities into equation (12), the caption generation model becomes:",
        "On the one hand, the model in equation (15) takes long distance dependency constraints into account, and has some notion of syntactic structure through the use of attachment probabilities.",
        "On the other hand, it has a primitive notion of caption lengthestimated by P(len(C) = mj=1 len(P j)) and will therefore generate captions of the same (phrase) length.",
        "Ideally, we would like the model to vary the length of its output depending on the chosen context.",
        "However, we leave this to future work.",
        "Search To generate a caption it is necessary to find the sequence of words that maximizes P(w1, w2, ... , wn) for the word-based model (equation (8)) and P(p1,p2,...,pm) for the phrase-based model (equation (15)).",
        "We rewrite both probabilities as the weighted sum of their log form components and use beam search to find a near-optimal sequence.",
        "Note that we can make search more efficient by reducing the size of the document D. Using one of the models from Section 5, we may rank its sentences in terms of their relevance to the image keywords and consider only the n-best ones.",

        "We have presented extractive and abstractive models that generate image captions for news articles.",
        "A key aspect of our approach is to allow both the visual and textual modalities to influence the generation task.",
        "This is achieved through an image annotation model that characterizes pictures in terms of description keywords that are subsequently used to guide the caption generation process.",
        "Our results show that the visual information plays an important role in content selection.",
        "Simply extracting a sentence from the document often yields an inferior caption.",
        "Our experiments also show that a probabilistic abstractive model defined over phrases yields promising results.",
        "It generates captions that are more grammatical than a closely related word-based system and manages to capture the gist of the image (and document) as well as the captions written by journalists.",
        "Future extensions are many and varied.",
        "Rather than adopting a two-stage approach, where the image processing and caption generation are carried out sequentially, a more general model should integrate the two steps in a unified framework.",
        "Indeed, an avenue for future work would be to define a phrase-based model for both image annotation and caption generation.",
        "We also believe that our approach would benefit from more detailed linguistic and non-linguistic information.",
        "For instance, we could experiment with features related to document structure such as titles, headings, and sections of articles and also exploit syntactic information more directly.",
        "The latter is currently used in the phrase-based model by taking attachment probabilities into account.",
        "We could, however, improve grammaticality more globally by generating a well-formed tree (or dependency graph)."
