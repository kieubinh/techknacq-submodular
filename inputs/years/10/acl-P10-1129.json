        "For example, consider the first instruction in Figure 1 – \"open control panel.\"",
        "The three GUI commands required for its successful execution are not explicitly described in the text, and need to be inferred by the user.",
        "This dependence on domain knowledge makes the automatic interpretation of high-level instructions particularly challenging.",
        "The standard approach to this task is to start with both a manually-developed model of the environment, and rules for interpreting high-level instructions in the context of this model (Agre and",
        "Chapman, 1988; Di Eugenio and White, 1992; Di Eugenio, 1992; Webber et al., 1995).",
        "Given both the model and the rules, logic-based inference is used to automatically fill in the intermediate steps missing from the original instructions.",
        "Our approach, in contrast, operates directly on the textual instructions in the context of the interactive environment, while requiring no additional information.",
        "By interacting with the environment and observing the resulting feedback, our method automatically learns both the mapping between the text and the commands, and the underlying model of the environment.",
        "One particularly noteworthy aspect of our solution is the interplay between the evolving mapping and the progressively acquired environment model as the system learns how to interpret the text.",
        "Recording the state transitions observed during interpretation allows the algorithm to construct a relevant model of the environment.",
        "At the same time, the environment model enables the algorithm to consider the consequences of commands before they are executed, thereby improving the accuracy of interpretation.",
        "Our method efficiently achieves both of these goals as part of a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm.",
        "We apply our method to the task of mapping software troubleshooting guides to GUI actions in the Windows environment (Branavan et al., 2009; Kushman et al., 2009).",
        "The key findings of our experiments are threefold.",
        "First, the algorithm can accurately interpret 61.5% of high-level instructions, which cannot be handled by previous statistical systems.",
        "Second, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling the environment also greatly improves the accuracy of processing low-level instructions, yielding a 14% absolute increase in performance over a competitive baseline (Brana-van et al., 2009).",

        "Interpreting Instructions Our approach is most closely related to the reinforcement learning algorithm for mapping text instructions to commands developed by Branavan et al.",
        "(2009) (see Section 4 for more detail).",
        "Their method is predicated on the assumption that each command to be executed is explicitly specified in the instruction text.",
        "This assumption of a direct correspondence between the text and the environment is not unique to that paper, being inherent in other work on grounded language learning (Siskind, 2001; Oates, 2001; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Fleischman and Roy, 2005; Mooney, 2008; Liang et al., 2009; Matuszek et al., 2010).",
        "A notable exception is the approach of Eisenstein et al.",
        "(2009), which learns how an environment operates by reading text, rather than learning an explicit mapping from the text to the environment.",
        "For example, their method can learn the rules of a card game given instructions for how to play.",
        "Many instances of work on instruction interpretation are replete with examples where instructions are formulated as high-level goals, targeted at users with relevant knowledge (Winograd, 1972; Di Eugenio, 1992; Webber et al., 1995; MacMahon et al., 2006).",
        "Not surprisingly, automatic approaches for processing such instructions have relied on hand-engineered world knowledge to reason about the preconditions and effects of environment commands.",
        "The assumption of a fully specified environment model is also common in work on semantics in the linguistics literature (Lascarides and Asher, 2004).",
        "While our approach learns to analyze instructions in a goal-directed manner, it does not require manual specification of relevant environment knowledge.",
        "Reinforcement Learning Our work combines ideas of two traditionally disparate approaches to reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998).",
        "The first approach, model-based learning, constructs a model of the environment in which the learner operates (e.g., modeling location, velocity, and acceleration in robot navigation).",
        "It then computes a policy directly from the rich information represented in the induced environment model.",
        "In the NLP literature, model-based reinforcement learning techniques are commonly used for dialog management (Singh et al., 2002; Lemon and Konstas, 2009; Schatzmann and Young, 2009).",
        "However, if the environment cannot be accurately approximated by a compact representation, these methods perform poorly (Boyan and Moore, 1995; Jong and Stone, 2007).",
        "Our instruction interpretation task falls into this latter category, rendering standard model-based learning ineffective.",

        "However, this change significantly complicates the interpretation problem - we need to be able to predict commands that are not directly described by any words, and allowing action sequences significantly increases the space of possibilities for each instruction.",
        "Since we cannot enumerate all possible sequences at decision time, we limit the space of possibilities by learning which sequences are likely to be relevant for the current instruction.",

        "The algorithm focuses on command sequences leading to environment states where the control panel icon was previously observed.",

        "Our goal is to map high-level instructions to command sequences by leveraging knowledge about the long-term effects of commands.",
        "We do this by integrating the partial environment model into the policy function.",
        "Specifically, we modify the log-linear policy p(a|s; q, 6) by adding lookahead features 0(s,a, q) which complement the local features used in the previous model.",

        "Although primarily designed to analyze high-level instructions, this approach is also useful for mapping low-level instructions.",

        "This is followed by the details of parameter estimation for our algorithm.",

        "As shown in Table 1, our model outperforms the baseline on the two datasets, according to all evaluation metrics.",
        "In contrast to the baseline, our model can handle high-level instructions, accurately interpreting 62% of them in the second dataset.",
        "Every document in this set contains at least one high-level action, which on average, maps to 3.11 environment commands each.",
        "The overall action performance on this dataset, however, seems unexpectedly low at 42%.",
        "This discrepancy is explained by the fact that in this dataset, high-level instructions are often located towards the beginning of the document.",
        "If these initial challenging instructions are not processed correctly, the rest of the actions for the document cannot be interpreted.",
        "As the performance on the first dataset indicates, the new algorithm is also beneficial for processing low-level instructions.",
        "The model outperforms the baseline by at least 14%, both in terms of the actions and the documents it can process.",
        "Not surprisingly, the best performance is achieved when the new algorithm has access to manually annotated data during training.",
        "We also performed experiments to validate the intuition that the partial environment model must contain information relevant for the language interpretation task.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we replaced the learned environment model with one of the same size gathered by executing random commands.",
        "The model with randomly sampled environment transitions performs poorly: it can only process 4.6% of documents and 15% of actions on the dataset with high-level instructions, compared to 28.3% and 41.9% respectively for our algorithm.",
        "This result also explains why training with full supervision hurts performance on highlevel instructions (see Table 1).",
        "Learning directly from annotations results in a low-quality environment model due to the relative lack of exploration,",

        "hurting the model's ability to leverage the lookahead features.",
        "Finally, to demonstrate the quality of the learned word-command alignments, we evaluate our method's ability to paraphrase from high-level instructions to low-level instructions.",
        "Here, the goal is to take each high-level instruction and construct a text description of the steps required to achieve it.",
        "We did this by finding high-level instructions where each of the commands they are associated with is also described by a low-level instruction in some other document.",
        "For example, if the text \"open control panel\" was mapped to the three commands in Figure 1, and each of those commands was described by a low-level instruction elsewhere, this procedure would create a paraphrase such as \"click start, left click setting, and select control panel.\"",
        "Of the 60 highlevel instructions tagged in the test set, this approach found paraphrases for 33 of them.",
        "29 of these paraphrases were correct, in the sense that they describe all the necessary commands.",

        "In this paper, we demonstrate that knowledge about the environment can be learned and used effectively for the task ofmapping instructions to actions.",
        "A key feature of this approach is the synergy between language analysis and the construction of the environment model: instruction text drives the sampling of the environment transitions, while the acquired environment model facilitates language interpretation.",
        "This design enables us to learn to map high-level instructions while also improving accuracy on low-level instructions.",
        "To apply the above method to process a broad range of natural language documents, we need to handle several important semantic and pragmatic phenomena, such as reference, quantification, and conditional statements.",
        "These linguistic constructions are known to be challenging to learn - existing approaches commonly rely on large amounts of hand annotated data for training.",
        "An interesting avenue of future work is to explore an alternative approach which learns these phenomena by combining linguistic information with knowledge gleaned from an automatically induced environment model."
