        "Learning multiple languages together should be easier than learning them separately.",
        "For example, in the domain of syntactic parsing, a range of recent work has exploited the mutual constraint between two languages' parses of the same bitext (Kuhn, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Kuz-man et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Snyder et al., 2009a).",

        "In this work, we consider unsupervised grammar induction without bitexts or multitexts.",
        "Without translation examples, multilingual constraints cannot be exploited at the sentence token level.",
        "Rather, we capture multilingual constraints at a parameter level, using a phylogeny-structured prior to tie together the various individual languages' learning problems.",
        "Our joint, hierarchical prior couples model parameters for different languages in a way that respects knowledge about how the languages evolved.",

        "In their work, structurally constrained covariance in a logistic normal prior is used to couple parameters between the two languages.",

        "Bouchard-Cote et al.",
        "(2007) considers an entirely different problem, phonological reconstruction, but shares with this work both the use of a phylogenetic structure as well as the use oflog-linear parameterization oflocal model components.",
        "Our work differs from theirs primarily in the task (syntax vs. phonology) and the variables governed by the phylogeny: in our model it is the grammar parameters that drift (in the prior) rather than individual word forms (in the likelihood model).",
        "Specifically, we consider dependency induction in the DMV model of Klein and Manning (2004).",
        "Our data is a collection of standard dependency data sets in eight languages: English, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese, Slovene, and Chinese.",
        "Our focus is not the DMV model itself, which is well-studied, but rather the prior which couples the various languages' parameters.",
        "While some choices of prior structure can greatly complicate inference (Cohen and Smith, 2009), we choose a hierarchical Gaussian form for the drift term, which allows the gradient of the observed data likelihood to be easily computed using standard dynamic programming methods.",
        "In our experiments, joint multilingual learning substantially outperforms independent monolingual learning.",
        "Using a limited phylogeny that only couples languages within linguistic families reduces error by 5.6% over the monolingual baseline.",
        "Using a flat, global phylogeny gives a greater reduction, almost 10%.",

        "We define our model over two kinds of random variables: dependency trees and parameters.",
        "For each language I in a set L, our model will generate a collection tg of dependency trees tg.",
        "We assume that these dependency trees are generated by the DMV model of Klein and Manning (2004), which we write as tg ~ DMV(9g).",
        "Here, 9g is a vector of the various model parameters for language I.",
        "The prior is what couples the 9g parameter vectors across languages; it is the focus of this work.",
        "We first consider the likelihood model before moving on to the prior.",
        "A dependency parse is a directed tree t over tokens in a sentence s. Each edge of the tree specifies a directed dependency from a head token to a dependent, or argument token.",
        "The DMV is a generative model for trees t, which has been widely used for dependency parse induction.",
        "The observed data likelihood, used for parameter estimation, is the marginal probability of generating the observed sentences s, which are simply the leaves of the trees t. Generation in the DMV model involves two types of local conditional probabilities: continue distributions that capture valence and attach distributions that capture argument selection.",
        "First, the Bernoulli continue probability distributions PCONTINUE(c| h, dir, adj; 9g) model the fertility of a particular head type h. The outcome c g {stop, continue} is conditioned on the head type h, direction dir, and adjacency adj.",
        "If a head type's continue probability is low, tokens of this type will tend to generate few arguments.",
        "Second, the attach multinomial probability distributions PATTACH(a|h, dir; 9g) capture attachment preferences of heads, where a and h are both token types.",
        "We take the same approach as previous work (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009) and use gold part-of-speech labels as tokens.",

        "actually word classes.",
        "The DMV's local conditional distributions were originally given as simple multinomial distributions with one parameter per outcome.",
        "However, they can be re-parameterized to give the following log-linear form (Eisner, 2002; Bouchard-Cote et al., 2007; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010):",

        "In the case where the vector of feature functions f has an indicator for each possible conjunction of outcome and conditions, the original multinomial distributions are recovered.",
        "We refer to these full indicator features as the set of Specific features.",
        "The focus of this work is coupling each of the parameters 9i in a phylogeny-structured prior.",
        "Consider a phylogeny like the one shown in Figure 1, where each modern language I in L is a leaf.",
        "We would like to say that the leaves' parameter vectors arise from a process which slowly drifts along each branch.",
        "A convenient choice is to posit additional parameter variables 9g+ at internal nodes l+ G L+, a set of ancestral languages, and to assume that the conditional distribution P (9l|9par(l)) at each branch in the phylogeny is a Gaussian centered on 9par(g), where par(l) is the parent of l in the phylogeny and l ranges over L U L+.",
        "The variance structure of the Gaussian would then determine how much drift (and in what directions) is expected.",
        "Concretely, we assume that each drift distribution is an isotropic Gaussian with mean 9par(g) and scalar variance a.",
        "The root is centered at zero.",
        "We have thus defined a joint distribution P(0|a) where 6 = (9g : l G L U L+).",
        "a is a hyperparameter for this prior which could itselfbe re-parameterized to depend on branch length or be learned; we simply set it to a plausible constant value.",
        "Two primary challenges remain.",
        "First, inference under arbitrary priors can become complex.",
        "However, in the simple case of our diagonal covariance Gaussians, the gradient of the observed data likelihood can be computed directly using the DMV's expected counts and maximum-likelihood estimation can be accomplished by applying standard gradient optimization methods.",
        "Second, while the choice of diagonal covariance is efficient, it causes components of 9 that correspond to features occurring in only one language to be marginally independent of the parameters of all other languages.",
        "In other words, only features which fire in more than one language are coupled by the prior.",
        "In the next section, we therefore increase the overlap between languages' features by using coarse projections of parts-of-speech.",
        "With diagonal covariance in the Gaussian drift terms, each parameter evolves independently of the others.",
        "Therefore, our prior will be most informative when features activate in multiple languages.",
        "In phonology, it is useful to map phonemes to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in order to have a language-independent parameterization.",
        "We introduce a similarly neutral representation here by projecting language-specific parts-of-speech to a coarse, shared inventory.",
        "Indeed, we assume that each language has a distinct tagset, and so the basic configurational features will be language specific.",
        "For example, when",
        "SPECIFIC: Activate for only one conjunction of outcome and conditions: 1 (c = •, h = •, dir = •, adj = •)",

        "an English vbz takes a left argument headed by a nns, a feature will activate specific to vbz-nns-left.",
        "That feature will be used in the log-linear attachment probability for English.",
        "However, because that feature does not show up in any other language, it is not usefully controlled by the prior.",
        "Therefore, we also include coarser features which activate on more abstract, cross-linguistic configurations.",
        "In the same example, a feature will fire indicating a coarse, direction-free ou verb attachment.",
        "This feature will now occur in multiple languages and will contribute to each of those languages' attachment models.",
        "Although such cross-lingual features will have different weight parameters in each language, those weights will covary, being correlated by the prior.",
        "The coarse features are defined via a projection n from language-specific part-of-speech labels to coarser, cross-lingual word classes, and hence we refer to them as S hared features.",
        "For each corpus used in this paper, we use the tagging annotation guidelines to manually define a fixed mapping from the corpus tagset to the following coarse tagset: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, conjunction, preposition, determiner, interjection, numeral, and pronoun.",
        "Parts-of-speech for which this coarse mapping is ambiguous or impossible are not mapped, and do not have corresponding Shared features.",
        "We summarize the feature templates for the c o ti ue and attach conditional distributions in Table 1.",
        "Variants of all feature templates that ignore direction and/or adjacency are included.",
        "In practice, we found it beneficial for all languageindependent features to ignore direction.",
        "Again, only the coarse features occur in multiple languages, so all phylogenetic influence is through those.",
        "onetheless, the effect of the phylogeny turns out to be quite strong.",
        "We now turn to learning with the phylogenetic prior.",
        "Since the prior couples parameters across languages, this learning problem requires parameters for all languages be estimated jointly.",
        "We seek to find 6 = (9g : l G L U L+) which optimizes logP(6|s), where s aggregates the observed leaves of all the dependency trees in all the languages.",
        "This can be written as",
        "The third term is a constant and can be ignored.",
        "The first term can be written as where C is a constant.",
        "The form of log P(6) immediately shows how parameters are penalized for being different across languages, more so for languages that are near each other in the phylogeny.",

        "Table 2 shows the overall results.",
        "In all cases, methods which coupled the languages in some way outperformed the independent baselines that considered each language independently.",
        "The weakest of the coupled models was Families, which had an average relative error reduction of 5.6% over the strong baseline.",
        "In this case, most of the average improvement came from a single family: Spanish and Portuguese.",
        "The limited improvement of the family-level prior compared to other phylogenies suggests that there are important multilingual interactions that do not happen within families.",
        "Table 2 also reports the maximum accuracy achieved for each language when it was paired with another language (same family or otherwise) and trained together with a single common parent.",
        "These results appear in the column headed by BestPair, and show the best accuracy for the language on that row over all possible pairings with other languages.",
        "When pairs of languages were trained together in isolation, the largest benefit was seen for languages with small training corpora, not necessarily languages with common ancestry.",
        "In our setup, Spanish, Slovene, and Chinese have substantially smaller training corpora than the rest of the languages considered.",
        "Otherwise, the patterns are not particularly clear; combined with subsequent results, it seems that pairwise constraint is fairly limited.",
        "Models that coupled multiple languages performed better in general than models that only considered pairs of languages.",
        "The Global model, which couples all languages, if crudely, yielded an average relative error reduction of 9.9%.",
        "This improvement comes as the number of languages able to exert mutual constraint increases.",
        "For example, Dutch and Danish had large improvements, over and above any improvements these two languages gained when trained with a single additional language.",
        "Beyond the simplistic Global phylogeny, the more nuanced Linguistic model gave large improvements for English, Swedish, and Portuguese.",
        "Indeed, the Linguistic model is the only model we evaluated that gave improvements for all the languages we considered.",
        "It is reasonable to worry that the improvements from these multilingual models might be partially due to having more total training data in the multilingual setting.",
        "However, we found that halving the amount of data used to train the English, Dutch, and Swedish (the languages with the most training data) monolingual models did not substantially affect their performance, suggesting that for languages with several thousand sentences or more, the increase in statistical support due to additional monolingual data was not an important effect (the DMV is a relatively low-capacity model in any case).",
        "Recall the structures of the three phylogenies presented in Figure 2.",
        "These phylogenies differ in the correlations they can represent.",
        "The Global phylogeny captures only \"universals,\" while Families captures only correlations between languages that are known to be similar.",
        "The Linguistic model captures both of these effects simultaneously by using a two layer hierarchy.",
        "Notably, the improvement due to the Linguistic model is more than the sum of the improvements due to the Global and Families models.",
        "The phylogeny is capable of allowing appropriate influence to pass between languages at multiple levels.",
        "We compare these results to the AllPairs model in order to see whether limitation to a tree structure is helpful.",
        "The All-Pairs model achieved an average relative error reduction of 17.1%, certainly outperforming both the simple phylogenetic models.",
        "However, the rich phylogeny of the Linguistic model, which incorporates linguistic constraints, outperformed the freer AllPairs model.",
        "A large portion of this improvement came from English, a language for which the Linguistic model greatly outperformed all other models evaluated.",
        "We found that the improved English analyses produced by the Linguistic model were more consistent with this model's analyses of other languages.",
        "This consistency was not present for the English analyses produced by other models.",
        "We explore consistency in more detail in Section 5.",
        "The likelihood models for both the strong monolingual baseline and the various multilingual models are the same, both expanding upon the standard DMV by adding coarse Shared features.",
        "These coarse features, even in a monolingual setting, improved performance slightly over the weak baseline, perhaps by encouraging consistent treatment of the different finer-grained variants of parts-of-speech (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).",
        "The only difference between the multilingual systems and the strong baseline is whether or not cross-language influence is allowed through the prior.",
        "While this progression of model structure is similar to that explored in Cohen and Smith (2009), Cohen and Smith saw their largest improvements from tying together parameters for the varieties of coarse parts-of-speech monolinugally, and then only moderate improvements from allowing cross-linguistic influence on top of monolingual sharing.",
        "When Cohen and Smith compared their best shared logistic-normal bilingual models to monolingual counterparts for the languages they investigate (Chinese and English), they reported a relative error reduction of 5.3%.",
        "in comparison, with the Linguistic model, we saw a much larger 16.9% relative error reduction over our strong baseline for these languages.",
        "Evaluating our Linguistic model on the same test sets as (Cohen and Smith, 2009), sentences of length 10 or less in section 23 of PTB and sections 271300 of CTB, we achieved an accuracy of 56.6 for Chinese and 60.3 for English.",
        "The best models of Cohen and Smith (2009) achieved accuracies of 52.0 and 62.0 respectively on these same test sets.",
        "Our results indicate that the majority of our model's power beyond that of the standard DMV is derived from multilingual, and in particular, more-than-bilingual, interaction.",
        "These are, to the best of our knowledge, the first results of this kind for grammar induction without bitext."

        "By examining the proposed parses we found that the Linguistic and AllPairs models produced analyses that were more consistent across languages than those of the other models.",

        "For ease of comprehension, we use the cross-lingual projections and only show counts for selected interesting classes.",
        "Comparing Figure 3(c), which shows dependency counts proposed by the Linguistic model, to Figure 3(a), which shows the same for the strong monolingual baseline, suggests that the analyses proposed by the Linguistic model are more consistent across languages than are the analyses proposed by the monolingual model.",
        "For example, the monolingual learners are divided as to whether determiners or nouns head noun phrases.",
        "There is also confusion about which labels head whole sentences.",
        "Dutch has the problem that verbs modify pronouns more often than pronouns modify verbs, and pronouns are predicted to head sentences as often as verbs are.",
        "Spanish has some confusion about conjunctions, hypothesizing that verbs often attach to conjunctions, and conjunctions frequently head sentences.",
        "More subtly, the monolingual analyses are inconsistent in the way they head prepositional phrases.",
        "in the monolingual Portuguese hypotheses, prepositions modify nouns more often than nouns modify prepositions.",
        "in English, nouns modify prepositions, and prepositions modify verbs.",
        "Both the Dutch and Spanish models are ambivalent about the attachment of prepositions.",
        "As has often been observed in other contexts (Liang et al., 2008), promoting agreement can improve accuracy in unsupervised learning.",
        "Not only are the analyses proposed by the Linguistic model more consistent, they are also more in accordance with the gold analyses.",
        "Under the Linguistic model, Dutch now attaches pronouns to verbs, and thus looks more like English, its sister in the phylogenetic tree.",
        "The Linguistic model has also chosen consistent analyses for prepositional phrases and noun phrases, calling prepositions and nouns the heads of each, respectively.",
        "The problem of conjunctions heading Spanish sentences has also been corrected.",
