        "Information on various numerical properties of physical objects, such as length, width and weight is fundamental in question answering frameworks and for answering search engine queries.",
        "While in some cases manual annotation of objects with numerical properties is possible, it is a hard and labor intensive task, and is impractical for dealing with the vast amount ofobjects ofinterest.",
        "Hence, there is a need for automated semantic acquisition algorithms targeting such properties.",
        "In addition to answering direct questions, the ability to make a crude comparison or estimation of object attributes is important as well.",
        "For example, it allows to disambiguate relationships between objects such as Xpart-of Y or X inside Y.",
        "Thus, a coarse approximation of the height of a house and a window is sufficient to decide that in the 'house window' nominal compound, 'window' is very likely to be a part of house and not vice versa.",
        "Such relationship information can, in turn, help summarization, machine translation or textual entailment tasks.",
        "Due to the importance of relationship and attribute acquisition in NLP, numerous methods were proposed for extraction of various lexical relationships and attributes from text.",
        "Some of these methods can be successfully used for extracting numerical attributes.",
        "However, numerical attribute extraction is substantially different in two aspects, verification and approximation.",
        "First, unlike most general lexical attributes, numerical attribute values are comparable.",
        "It usually makes no sense to compare the names of two actors, but it is meaningful to compare their ages.",
        "The ability to compare values of different objects allows to improve attribute extraction precision by verifying consistency with attributes of other similar objects.",
        "For example, suppose that for Toyota Corolla width we found two different values, 1.695m and 27cm.",
        "The second value can be either an extraction error or a length of a toy car.",
        "Extracting and looking at width values for different car brands and for 'cars' in general we find:",
        "• Boundaries: Maximal car width is 2.195m, minimal is 88cm.",
        "• Average: Estimated avg.",
        "car width is 1.7m.",
        "• Direct/indirect comparisons: Toyota Corolla is wider than Toyota Corona.",
        "• Distribution: Car width is distributed normally around the average.",
        "Usage of all this knowledge allows us to select the correct value of 1.695m and reject other values.",
        "Thus we can increase the precision of value extraction by finding and analyzing an entire group of comparable objects.",
        "Second, while it is usually meaningless and impossible to approximate general lexical attribute values like an actor's name, numerical attributes can be estimated even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.",
        "In general, attribute extraction frameworks usually attempt to discover a single correct value (e.g., capital city of a country) or a set of distinct correct values (e.g., actors of a movie).",
        "So there is essentially nothing to do when there is no explicit information present in the text for a given object and an attribute.",
        "In contrast, in numerical attribute extraction it is possible to provide an approximation even when no explicit information is present in the text, by using values of comparable objects for which information is provided.",
        "In this paper we present a pattern-based framework that takes advantage ofthe properties ofsim-ilar objects to improve extraction precision and allow approximation of requested numerical object properties.",
        "Our framework comprises three main stages.",
        "First, given an object name we utilize WordNet and pattern-based extraction to find a list of similar objects and their category labels.",
        "Second, we utilize a predefined set of lexical patterns in order to extract attribute values of these objects and available comparison/boundary information.",
        "Finally, we analyze the obtained information and select or approximate the attribute value for the given (object, attribute) pair.",
        "We performed a thorough evaluation using three different applications: Question Answering (QA), WordNet (WN) enrichment, and comparison with Wikipedia and answers provided by leading search engines.",
        "QA evaluation was based on a designed dataset of 1250 questions on size, height, width, weight, and depth, for which we created a gold standard and compared against it automatically.",
        "For WN enrichment evaluation, our framework discovered size and weight values for 300 WN physical objects, and the quality of results was evaluated by human judges.",
        "For interactive search, we compared our results to information obtained through Wikipedia, Google and Wolfram Alpha.",
        "'This dataset is available in the authors' websites for the research community.",
        "Utilization of information about comparable objects provided a significant boost to numerical attribute extraction quality, and allowed a meaningful approximation of missing attribute values.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 details the algorithmic framework, Section 4 describes the experimental setup, and Section 5 presents our results."

        "However, most of them do not exploit the numerical nature of the attribute data.",
        "Our research is related to a sub-domain ofquestion answering (Prager, 2006), since one of the applications of our framework is answering questions on numerical values.",
        "The majority of the proposed QA frameworks rely on pattern-based relationship acquisition (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2009).",
        "However, most QA studies focus on different types of problems than our paper, including question classification, paraphrasing, etc.",
        "Several recent studies directly target the acquisition of numerical attributes from the Web and attempt to deal with ambiguity and noise of the retrieved attribute values.",

        "They utilize a textual snippet feature and snippet quantity in order to select and rank intervals of the requested values.",
        "This approach is particularly useful when it is possible to obtain a substantial amount of a desired attribute values for the requested query.",
        "(Moriceau, 2006) proposed a rule-based system which analyzes the variation of the extracted numerical attribute values using information in the textual context of these values.",
        "A significant body of recent research deals with extraction of various data from web tables and lists (e.g., (Cafarella et al., 2008; Crestan and Pantel, 2010)).",
        "While in the current research we do not utilize this type of information, incorporation of the numerical data extracted from semi-structured web pages can be extremely beneficial for our framework.",
        "All of the above numerical attribute extraction systems utilize only direct information available in the discovered object-attribute co-occurrences and their contexts.",
        "However, as we show, indirect information available for comparable objects can contribute significantly to the selection of the obtained values.",
        "Using such indirect information is particularly important when only a modest amount of values can be obtained for the desired object.",

        "To verify and estimate attribute values for the given object we utilize similar objects (co-hyponyms) and the object's class label (hyper-nym).",
        "In the WN enrichment scenario we can easily obtain these, since we get the object's synset as input.",

        "However, this is not essential.",
        "We then extract new terms from the retrieved web snippets and use these terms iteratively to retrieve more terms from the Web.",

        "WN class labels are used later for the retrieval of boundary values, and here for expansion of the similar object set.",
        "In the WN enrichment scenario, we already have the class label of the object.",
        "In the QA scenario, we automatically find class labels as follows.",
        "We compute for each WN subtree a coverage value, the number of retrieved terms found in the subtree divided by the number of subtree terms, and select the subtree having the highest coverage.",
        "In all scenarios, we add all terms found in this subtree to the retrieved term list.",
        "If no WN subtree with significant (> 0.1) coverage is found, we retrieve a set of category labels from the Web using hypernymy detection patterns like \"* such as [Obj]\" (Hearst, 1992).",

        "We extend this group iteratively from the given seed as commonly done in pattern-based acquisition methods.",

        "We then extract new patterns from the retrieved search engine snippets and re-query the Web with the new patterns to obtain more attribute values.",
        "We provided the framework with unit names and with an appropriate conversion table which allows to convert between different measurement systems and scales.",
        "The provided names include common abbreviations like cm/centimeter.",
        "All value acquisition patterns include unit names, so we know the units of each extracted value.",
