        "Textual definitions constitute a fundamental source to look up when the meaning of a term is sought.",

        "However, manually constructing and updating glossaries requires the cooperative effort of a team of domain experts.",
        "Further, in the presence of new words or usages, and - even worse - new domains, such resources are of no help.",
        "Nonetheless, terms are attested in texts and some (usually few) of the sentences in which a term occurs are typically definitional, that is they provide a formal explanation for the term of interest.",
        "While it is not feasible to manually search texts for definitions, this task can be automatized by means of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "Automatic definition extraction is useful not only in the construction of glossaries, but also in many other NLP tasks.",
        "In ontology learning, definitions are used to create and enrich concepts with textual information (Gangemi et al., 2003), and extract taxonomic and non-taxonomic relations (Snow et al., 2004; Navigli and Velardi, 2006; Navigli, 2009a).",
        "Definitions are also harvested in Question Answering to deal with \"what is\" questions (Cui et al., 2007; Saggion, 2004).",
        "In eLearning, they are used to help students assimilate knowledge (Westerhout and Monachesi, 2007), etc.",
        "Much of the current literature focuses on the use of lexico-syntactic patterns, inspired by Hearst's (1992) seminal work.",
        "However, these methods suffer both from low recall and precision, as definitional sentences occur in highly variable syntactic structures, and because the most frequent definitional pattern - X is a Y - is inherently very noisy.",
        "In this paper we propose a generalized form of word lattices, called Word-Class Lattices (WCLs), as an alternative to lexico-syntactic pattern learning.",
        "A lattice is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a subclass of non-deterministic finite state automata (NFA).",
        "The lattice structure has the purpose of preserving the salient differences among distinct sequences, while eliminating redundant information.",
        "In computational linguistics, lattices have been used to model in a compact way many sequences of symbols, each representing an alternative hypothesis.",
        "Lattice-based methods differ in the types of nodes (words, phonemes, concepts), the interpretation of links (representing either a sequential or hierarchical ordering between nodes), their means of creation, and the scoring method used to extract the best consensus output from the lattice (Schroeder et al., 2009).",
        "In speech processing, phoneme or word lattices (Campbell et al., 2007; Mathias and Byrne, 2006; Collins et al., 2004) are used as an interface between speech recognition and understanding.",
        "Lattices are adopted also in Chinese word segmentation (Jiang et al., 2008), decompounding in German (Dyer, 2009), and to represent classes of translation models in machine translation (Dyer et al., 2008; Schroeder et al., 2009).",
        "In more complex text processing tasks, such as information retrieval, information extraction and summarization, the use of word lattices has been postulated but is considered unrealistic because of the dimension of the hypothesis space.",
        "To reduce this problem, concept lattices have been proposed (Carpineto and Romano, 2005; Klein, 2008; Zhong et al., 2008).",
        "Here links represent hierarchical relations, rather than the sequential order of symbols like in word/phoneme lattices, and nodes are clusters of salient words aggregated using synonymy, similarity, or subtrees of a thesaurus.",
        "However, salient word selection and aggregation is non-obvious and furthermore it falls into word sense disambiguation, a notoriously AI-hard problem (Navigli, 2009b).",
        "In definition extraction, the variability of patterns is higher than for \"traditional\" applications of lattices, such as translation and speech, however not as high as in unconstrained sentences.",
        "The methodology that we propose to align patterns is based on the use of star (wildcard *) characters to facilitate sentence clustering.",
        "Each cluster of sentences is then generalized to a lattice of word classes (each class being either a frequent word or a part of speech).",
        "A key feature of our approach is its inherent ability to both identify definitions and extract hypernyms.",
        "The method is tested on an annotated corpus of Wikipedia sentences and a large Web corpus, in order to demonstrate the independence of the method from the annotated dataset.",
        "WCLs are shown to generalize over lexico-syntactic patterns, and outperform well-known approaches to definition and hyper-nym extraction.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, WCLs are introduced in Section 3 and illustrated by means of an example in Section 4, experiments are presented in Section 5.",
        "We conclude the paper in Section 6."

        "Definition Extraction.",
        "A great deal of work is concerned with definition extraction in several languages (Klavans and Muresan, 2001; Storrer and Wellinghoff, 2006; Gaudio and Branco, 2007;",
        "Iftene et al., 2007; Westerhout and Monachesi, 2007; Przepiorkowski et al., 2007; Degorski et al., 2008).",
        "The majority of these approaches use symbolic methods that depend on lexico-syntactic patterns or features, which are manually crafted or semi-automatically learned (Zhang and Jiang, 2009; Hovy et al., 2003; Fahmi and Bouma, 2006; Westerhout, 2009).",
        "Patterns are either very simple sequences of words (e.g. \"refers to\", \"is defined as\", \"is a\") or more complex sequences of words, parts of speech and chunks.",
        "A fully automated method is instead proposed by Borg et al.",
        "(2009): they use genetic programming to learn simple features to distinguish between definitions and non-definitions, and then they apply a genetic algorithm to learn individual weights of features.",
        "However, rules are learned for only one category of patterns, namely \"is\" patterns.",
        "As we already remarked, most methods suffer from both low recall and precision, because definitional sentences occur in highly variable and potentially noisy syntactic structures.",
        "Higher performance (around 6070% Fi-measure) is obtained only for specific domains (e.g., an ICT corpus) and patterns (Borg et al., 2009).",
        "Only few papers try to cope with the generality of patterns and domains in real-world corpora (like the Web).",
        "In the GlossExtractor web-based system (Velardi et al., 2008), to improve precision while keeping pattern generality, candidates are pruned using more refined stylistic patterns and lexical filters.",
        "Cui et al.",
        "(2007) propose the use of probabilistic lexico-semantic patterns, called soft patterns, for definitional question answering in the TREC contest.",
        "The authors describe two soft matching models: one is based on an n-gram language model (with the Expectation Maximization algorithm used to estimate the model parameter), the other on Profile Hidden Markov Models (PHMM).",
        "Soft patterns generalize over lexico-syntactic \"hard\" patterns in that they allow a partial matching by calculating a generative degree of match probability between the test instance and the set of training instances.",
        "Thanks to its generalization power, this method is the most closely related to our work, however the task of definitional question answering to which it is applied is slightly different from that of definition extraction, so a direct performance comparison is not possible.",
        "In fact, the TREC evaluation datasets cannot be considered true definitions, but rather text fragments providing some relevant fact about a target term.",
        "For example, sentences like: \"Bollywood is a Bombay-based film industry\" and \"700 or more films produced by India with 200 or more from Bollywood\" are both \"vital\" answers for the question \"Bollywood\", according to TREC classification, but the second sentence is not a definition.",
        "Hypernym Extraction.",
        "The literature on hy-pernym extraction offers a higher variability of methods, from simple lexical patterns (Hearst, 1992; Oakes, 2005) to statistical and machine learning techniques (Agirre et al., 2000; Cara-ballo, 1999; Dolan et al., 1993; Sanfilippo and Poznanski, 1992; Ritter et al., 2009).",
        "One of the highest-coverage methods is proposed by Snow et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "They first search sentences that contain two terms which are known to be in a taxonomic relation (term pairs are taken from WordNet (Miller et al., 1990)); then they parse the sentences, and automatically extract patterns from the parse trees.",
        "Finally, they train a hypernym clas-sifer based on these features.",
        "Lexico-syntactic patterns are generated for each sentence relating a term to its hypernym, and a dependency parser is used to represent them."

        "Notion of deinition.",
        "In our work, we rely on a formal notion of textual definition.",
        "Specifically, given a definition, e.g.: \"In computer science, a closure is a first-class function with free variables that are bound in the lexical environment\", we assume that it contains the following fields (Storrer",
        "• The Definiendum field (DF): this part of the definition includes the definiendum (that is, the word being defined) and its modifiers (e.g., \"In computer science, a closure\");",
        "• The Definitor field (VF): it includes the verb phrase used to introduce the definition",
        "• The Definiens field (GF): it includes the genus phrase (usually including the hyper-nym, e.g., \"a first-class function\");",
        "• The Rest field (RF): it includes additional clauses that further specify the differentia of the definiendum with respect to its genus (e.g., \"with free variables that are bound in the lexical environment\").",
        "Further examples of definitional sentences annotated with the above fields are shown in Table 1.",
        "For each sentence, the definiendum (that is, the word being defined) and its hypernym are marked in bold and italic, respectively.",
        "Given the lexico-syntactic nature of the definition extraction models we experiment with, training and test sentences are part-of-speech tagged with the TreeTagger system, a part-of-speech tagger available for many languages (Schmid, 1995).",

        "Let t be the set of training sentences, manually bracketed with the DF, VF, GF and RF fields.",
        "We first determine the set F of words in t whose frequency is above a threshold 6 (e.g., the, a, is, of, refer, etc.).",
        "In our training sentences, we replace the term being defined with (TARGET), thus this frequent token is also included in F.",
        "We use the set of frequent words F to generalize words to \"word classes\".",
        "We define a word class as either a word itself or its part of speech.",

        "• Sentence clustering: the training sentences are then clustered based on the star patterns to which they belong (Section 3.2.2);",
        "• Word-Class Lattice construction: for each sentence cluster, a WCL is created by means of a greedy alignment algorithm (Section",
        "3.2.3).",
        "We present two variants of our WCL model, dealing either globally with the entire sentence or separately with its definition fields (Section 3.2.4).",
        "The WCL models can then be used to classify any input sentence of interest (Section 3.2.5).",
        "Let T be the set of training sentences.",
        "In this step, we associate a star pattern a(s) with each sentence s G T .To do so, let s G T be a sentence such that s = wi,w2,..., where wi is its i-th word.",
        "Given the set F of most frequent words in T (cf.",
        "Section 3.1), the star pattern a(s) associated with s is obtained by replacing with * all the words Wi G F, that is all the tokens that are non-frequent words.",
        "For instance, given the sentence \"In arts, a chiaroscuro is a monochrome picture\", the corresponding star pattern is \"In *, a (TARGET) is a *\", where (TARGET) is the defined term.",
        "Note that, here and in what follows, we discard the sentence fragments tagged with the Rest field, which is used only to delimit the core part of definitional sentences.",
        "In the second step, we cluster the sentences in our training set T based on their star patterns.",
        "Formally, let S = (ai,..., am) be the set of star patterns associated with the sentences in T. We create a clustering C = (Ci,..., Cm) such that Ci = {s G T : a(s) = that is Ci contains all the sentences whose star pattern is ai.",

        "Finally, the third step consists of the construction of a Word-Class Lattice for each sentence cluster.",
        "Given such a cluster Ci G C, we apply a greedy algorithm that iteratively constructs the WCL.",
        "Let Ci = {si,s2,..., s|Ci|} and consider its first sentence si = wf, wf,..., wisi| (wjdenotes the i-th token of the j-th sentence).",

        "Next, for the subsequent sentences in Ci, that is, for each j = 2,..., |Ci|, we determine the alignment between the sentence sj and each sentence sk G Ci such that k < j based on the following dynamic programming formulation (Cormenetal., 1990, pp.",
        "314-319):",
        "where a G {1,..., |sk|} and b G {1,..., |sj|}, Sa>b is a score of the matching between the a-th token of sk and the b-th token of sj, and Mo,o, M0;b and Ma 0 are initially set to 0 for all a and b.",

        "We add to the set of vertices V the tokens of the generalized sentence sj for which there is no alignment to s'k and we add to E the edges (wj ,wj ), ..., (wj i_-, , wj ,).",
        "Furthermore, in the final lattice, nodes associated with the hypernym words in the learning sentences are marked as hypernyms in order to be able to determine the hypernym of a test sentence at classification time.",
        "So far, we have assumed that our WCL model learns lattices from the training sentences in their entirety (we call this model WCL-1).",
        "We now propose a second model that learns separate WCLs for each field of the definition, namely: the Definiendum (DF), Definitor (VF) and Definiens (GF) fields (see Section 3.1).",
        "We refer to this latter model as WCL-3.",
        "Rather than applying the WCL algorithm to the entire sentence, the very same method is applied to the sentence fragments tagged with one of the three definition fields.",
        "The reason for introducing the WCL-3 model is that, while definitional patterns are highly variable, DF, VF and GF individually exhibit a lower variability, thus WCL-3 should improve the generalization power.",
        "once the learning process is over, a set ofWCLs is produced.",
        "Given a test sentence s, the classification phase for the WCL-1 model consists of determining whether it exists a lattice that matches s. In the case of WCL-3, we consider any combination of Definiendum, Definitor and Definiens lattices.",
        "While WCL-1 is applied as a yes-no classifier as there is a single WCL that can possibly match the input sentence, WCL-3 selects, if any, the combination of the three WCLs that best fits the sentence.",
        "In fact, choosing the most appropriate combination of lattices impacts the performance of hypernym extraction.",
        "The best combination of WCLs is selected by maximizing the following confidence score:",
        "score(s, lDF, lVF, lGF) = coverage • log(suppori) where s is the candidate sentence, lDF, lVF and lGFare three lattices one for each definition field, coverage is the fraction of words of the input sentence covered by the three lattices, and support is the sum of the number of sentences in the star patterns corresponding to the three lattices.",
        "Finally, when a sentence is classified as a definition, its hypernym is extracted by selecting the words in the input sentence that are marked as \"hy-pernyms\" in the WCL-1 lattice (or in the WCL-3",
        "GF lattice).",
        "4 Example",
        "As an example, consider the definitions in Table 1.",
        "As illustrated in Section 3.2.2, their star pattern is \"In *, a (TARGET) is a *\".",
        "The corresponding WCL is built as follows: the first part-of-speech tagged sentence, \"In/IN arts/NN , a/DT (TARGET)/NN is/VBZ a/DT monochrome/JJ pic-ture/NN\", is considered.",
        "The corresponding generalized sentence is \"In NN , a (TARGET) is a JJ NN\".",
        "The initially empty graph is thus populated with one node for each word class and one edge for each pair of consecutive tokens, as shown in Figure 1 (the central sequence of nodes in the graph).",
        "Note that we draw the hypernym token nn2 with a rectangle shape.",
        "We also add to the graph a start node • and an end node ®, and connect them to the corresponding initial and final sentence tokens.",
        "Next, the second sentence, \"In mathematics, a graph is a data structure that consists of...\", is aligned to the first sentence.",
        "The alignment of the generalized sentence is perfect, apart from the NN3 node corresponding to \"data\".",
        "The node is added to the graph together with the",
        "Finally, the third sentence in Table 1, \"In computer science, a pixel is a dot that is part of a computer image\", is generalized as \"In NN NN , a (TARGET) is a NN\".",
        "Thus, a new node NN4 is added, corresponding to \"computer\" and new edges are added: In – NN4 and NN4 – NN f. Figure 1 shows the resulting WCL-1 lattice."

        "Section 2), their results do not show significant improvements over the bigram language model.",
        "For hypernym extraction, we compared WCL-1 and WCL-3 with Hearst's patterns, a system that extracts hypernyms from sentences based on the lexico-syntactic patterns specified in Hearst's seminal work (1992).",
        "These include (hypernym in italic): \"such NP as {NP ,} {(or | and)} NP\", \"NP {, NP} {,} or other NP\", \"NP {,} including { NP ,} {or | and} NP\", \"NP {,} especially { NP ,} {or | and} NP\", and variants thereof.",
        "However, it should be noted that hypernym extraction methods in the literature do not extract hypernyms from definitional sentences, like we do, but rather from specific patterns like \"X such as Y\".",
        "Therefore a direct comparison with these methods is not possible.",
        "Nonetheless, we decided to implement Hearst's patterns for the sake of completeness.",
        "We could not replicate the more refined approach by Snow et al.",
        "(2004) because it requires the annotation of a possibly very large dataset of sentence fragments.",
        "In any case Snow et al.",
        "(2004) reported the following performance figures on a corpus of dimension and complexity comparable with ukWaC: the recall-precision graph indicates precision 85% at recall 10% and precision 25% at recall of 30% for the hypernym classifier.",
        "A variant of the classifier that includes evidence from coordinate terms (terms with a common ancestor in a taxonomy) obtains an increased precision of 35% at recall 30%.",

        "• recall - the number of definitional sentences correctly retrieved by the system over the number of definitional sentences in the dataset.",
        "• the F measure - a harmonic mean of precision (P) and recall (R) given by Iq-R.",
        "• accuracy - the number of correctly classified sentences (either as definitional or non-definitional) over the total number of sentences in the dataset.",
        "Definition Extraction.",
        "In Table 2 we report the results of definition extraction systems on the Wikipedia dataset.",
        "Given this dataset is also used for training, experiments are performed with 10fold cross validation.",
        "The results show very high precision for WCL-1, WCL-3 (around 99%) and star patterns (86%).",
        "As expected, bigrams and star patterns exhibit a higher recall (82% and 66%, respectively).",
        "The lower recall of WCL-1 is due to its limited ability to generalize compared to WCL-3 and the other methods.",
        "In terms of F i-measure, star patterns and WCL-3 achieve 75%, and are thus the best systems.",
        "Similar performance is observed when we also account for negative sentences - that is we calculate accuracy (with WCL-3 performing better).",

        "From our Wikipedia corpus, we learned over 1,000 lattices (and star patterns).",
        "using WCLthe ukWaC dataset.",
        "To calculate precision on this dataset, we manually validated the definitions output by each system.",
        "However, given the large size of the test set, recall could only be estimated.",
        "To this end, we manually analyzed 50,000 sentences and identified 99 definitions, against which recall was calculated.",
        "The results are shown in Table 3. on the ukWaC dataset, WCL-3 performs best, obtaining 94.87% precision and 56.57% recall (we did not calculate F f, as recall is estimated).",
        "Interestingly, star patterns obtain only 44% precision and around 63% recall.",
        "Bigrams achieve even lower performance, namely 46.60% precision, 45.45% recall.",
        "The reason for such bad performance on ukWaC is due to the very different nature of the two datasets: for example, in Wikipedia most \"is a\" sentences are definitional, whereas this property is not verified in the real world (that is, on the Web, of which ukWaC is a sample).",

        "However, our performance of identifying a substring of the correct hypernym is much higher (around 78.58%).",
        "In Table 4 we do not report the precision of Hearst's patterns, as only one hypernym was found, due to the inherently low coverage of the method.",
