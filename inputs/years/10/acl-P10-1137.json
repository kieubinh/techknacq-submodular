        "The central problem of Information Retrieval (IR) is to satisfy the user's information need, which is typically expressed through a short (typically 2-3 words) and often ambiguous query.",
        "The problem of matching the user's query to the documents is rendered difficult by natural language phenomena like morphological variations, polysemy and synonymy.",
        "Relevance Feedback (RF) tries to overcome these problems by eliciting user feedback on the relevance of documents obtained from the initial ranking and then uses it to automatically refine the query.",
        "Since user input is hard to obtain, Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) (Buckley etal., 1994; Xu and Croft, 2000; Mitra et al., 1998) is used as an alternative, wherein RF is performed by assuming the top k documents from the initial retrieval as being relevant to the query.",
        "Based on the above assumption, the terms in the feedback document set are analyzed to choose the most distinguishing set of terms that characterize the feedback documents and as a result the relevance of a document.",
        "Query refinement is done by adding the terms obtained through PRF, along with their weights, to the actual query.",
        "Although PRF has been shown to improve retrieval, it suffers from the following drawbacks: (a) the type of term associations obtained for query expansion is restricted to co-occurrence based relationships in the feedback documents, and thus other types of term associations such as lexical and semantic relations (morphological variants, synonyms) are not explicitly captured, and (b) due to the inherent assumption in PRF, i.e., relevance of top k documents, performance is sensitive to that of the initial retrieval algorithm and as a result is not robust.",
        "Multilingual Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (MultiPRF) (Chinnakotla et al., 2010) is a novel framework for PRF to overcome both the above limitations of PRF.",
        "It does so by taking the help of a different language called the assisting language.",
        "In MultiPRF, given a query in source language L1, the query is automatically translated into the assisting language L2 and PRF performed in the assisting language.",
        "The resultant terms are translated back into Li using a probabilistic bilingual dictionary.",

        "The present paper is a report of these investigations, their results and conclusions drawn therefrom.",

        "model, is then combined with the original feedback model of L1 to obtain the final model which is used to re-rank the corpus.",

        "The intuition behind the above approach is that if the query does not have many relevant documents in the collection then any improvements in the modeling of PRF is bound to perform poorly due to query drift.",

        "Although there is no significant topic drift in this case, there are not many relevant terms apart from the query terms.",
        "However the same query performs very well in English with all the documents in the feedback set of the English corpus being relevant, thus resulting in informative feedback terms such as {bovin, scientif, recherch}.",
        "(b) Finding Synonyms/Morphological Variations: Another situation in which MultiPRF leads to large improvements is when it finds semantically/lexically related terms to the query terms which the original feedback model was unable to.",
        "For example, consider the French query \"Ingénierie g'n'tique\".",
        "While the feedback model was unable to find any of the synonyms of the query terms, due to their lack of co-occurence with the query terms, the MultiPRF model was able to get these terms, which are introduced primarily during the backtranslation process.",
        "Thus terms like {genetic, gen, engineering} , which are synonyms of the query words, are found thus resulting in improved performance.",
        "(c) Combination of Above Factors: Sometimes a combination of the above two factors causes improvements in the performance as in the German query \"Ölkatastrophein Sibirien\".",
        "For this query, MultiPRF finds good feedback terms such as {russisch, russland} while also obtaining semantically related terms such as {olverschmutz, erdol, olunfall} .",
        "Although all of the previously described examples had good quality translations of the query in the assisting language, as mentioned in (Chinnakotla et al., 2010), the MultiPRF approach is robust to suboptimal translation quality as well.",
        "To see how MultiPRF leads to improvements even with errors in query translation consider the German Query \"Siegerinnen von Wimbledon\".",
        "When this is translated to English, the term \"Lady\" is dropped, this causes only \"Wimbledon Champions\" to remain.",
        "As can be observed, this causes terms like sampras to come up in the MultiPRF model.",
        "However, while the MultiPRF model has some terms pertaining to Men's Winners of Wimbledon as well, the original feedback model suffers from severe topic drift, with irrelevant terms such as {telefonbuch, telekom} also amongst the top terms.",
        "Thus we notice that despite the error in query translation MultiPRF still manages to correct the drift of the original feedback model, while also introducing relevant terms such as {verfecht, steffi, martina, novotna, navratilova} as well.",
        "Thus as shown in (Chinnakotla et al., 2010), having a better query translation system can only lead to better performance.",
        "We also perform a detailed error analysis and found three main reasons for MultiPRF failing: (i) Inaccuracies in query translation (including the presence of out-of-vocabulary terms).",
        "This is seen in the German Query AI in Lateinamerika, which wrongly translates to Avian Flu in Latin America in Spanish thus affecting performance.",
        "(ii) Poor retrieval in Assisting Language.",

        "We varied the ß and y parameters for French, German and Finnish collections with English, Dutch and Spanish as assisting languages and studied its effect on MAP of MultiPRF.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 2.",
        "The results show that, in all the three collections, the optimal value of the parameters almost remains the same and lies in the range of 0.4-0.48.",
        "Due to the above reason, we arbitrarily choose the parameters in the above range and do not use any technique to learn these parameters.",
        "In this section, we discuss the effect of varying the assisting language.",
        "Besides, we also study the inter and intra familial behaviour of source-assisting language pairs.",
        "In order to ensure that the results are comparable across languages, we indexed the collections from the years 2002, 2003 and use common topics from the topic range 91200 that have relevant documents across all the six languages.",
        "The number of such common topics were 67.",
        "For each source language, we use the other languages as assisting collections and study the performance of MultiPRF.",
        "Since query translation quality varies across language pairs, we analyze the behaviour of MultiPRF in the following two scenarios: (a) Using ideal query translation (b) Using Google Translate for query translation.",
        "In ideal query translation setup, in order to eliminate its effect, we skip the query translation step and use the corresponding original topics for each target language instead.",
        "The results for both the above scenarios are given in Tables 6 and 7.",
        "From the results, we firstly observe that besides English, other languages such as French, Spanish, German and Dutch act as good assisting languages and help in improving performance over monolingual MBF.",
        "We also observe that the best assisting language varies with the source language.",
        "However, the crucial factors of the assisting language which influence the performance of Multi-PRF are: (a) Monolingual PRF Performance: The main motivation for using a different language was to get good feedback terms, especially in case of queries which fail in the source language.",
        "Hence, an assisting language in which the monolingual feedback performance itself is poor, is unlikely to give any performance gains.",
        "This observation is evident in case of Finnish, which has the lowest Monolingual MBF performance.",
        "The results show that Finnish is the least helpful of assisting languages, with performance similar to those of the baselines.",
        "We also observe that the three best performing assistant languages, i.e. English, French and Spanish, have the highest monolingual performances as well, thus further validating the claim.",
        "One possible reason for this is the relative",
        "Table 6: Results showing the performance of MultiPRF with different source and assisting languages using Google Translate for query translation step.",
        "The intra-familial affinity could be observed from the elements close to the diagonal.",

        "(2008) show that the language family is a strong predictor of machine translation performance.",
        "Hence, the query translation and back translation quality improves if the source and assisting languages belong to the same family.",
        "For example, in the Germanic family, the source-assisting language pairs German-English, Dutch-English, Dutch-German and German-Dutch show good performance.",
        "Similarly, in Romance family, the performance of French-Spanish confirms this behaviour.",
        "In some cases, we observe that Multi-PRF scores decent improvements even when the assisting language does not belong to the same language family as witnessed in French-English and English-French.",
        "This is primarily due to their strong monolingual MBF performance.",
        "As already mentioned, the performance of Multi-PRF is good if the source and assisting languages belong to the same family.",
        "In this section, we verify the above intuition by studying the impact of language family on back translation performance.",
        "The experiment designed is as follows: Given a query in source language L1, the ideal translation in assisting language L2 is used to compute the query model in L2 using only the query terms.",

        "is directly back translated from L2 into L1 and finally documents are re-ranked using this translated feedback model.",
        "Since the automatic query translation and PRF steps have been eliminated, the only factor which influences the MultiPRF performance is the back-translation step.",
        "This means that the source-assisting language pairs for which the back-translation is good will score a higher performance.",
        "The results of the above experiment is shown in Table 8.",
        "For each source language, the best performing assisting languages have been highlighted.",
        "The results show that the performance of closely related languages like French-Spanish and German-Dutch is more when compared to other source-assistant language pairs.",
        "This shows that in case of closely related languages, the backtranslation step succeeds in adding good terms which are relevant like morphological variants, synonyms and other semantically related terms.",
        "Hence, familial closeness of the assisting language helps in boosting the MultiPRF performance.",
