      "text": [
        "The application of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to Information Retrieval (IR) has been subject of a significant research effort in the recent past.",
        "The essential idea is that, by indexing and matching word senses (or even meanings) , the retrieval process could better handle polysemy and synonymy problems (Sanderson, 2000).",
        "In practice, however, there are two main difficulties: (i) for long queries, IR models implicitly perform disambiguation, and thus there is little room for improvement.",
        "This is the case with most standard IR benchmarks, such as TREC (trec.nist.gov) or CLEF (www.clef-campaign.org) ad-hoc collections; (ii) for very short queries, disambiguation may not be possible or even desirable.",
        "This is often the case with one word and even two word queries in Web search engines.",
        "In Web search, there are at least three ways of coping with ambiguity:",
        "• Promoting diversity in the search results (Clarke et al., 2008): given the query \"oasis\", the search engine may try to include representatives for different senses of the word (such as the Oasis band, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, the online fashion store, etc.)",
        "among the top results.",
        "Search engines are supposed to handle diversity as one of the multiple factors that influence the ranking.",
        "• Presenting the results as a set of (labelled) clusters rather than as a ranked list (Carpineto et al., 2009).",
        "• Complementing search results with search suggestions (e.g. \"oasis band\", \"oasis fashion store\") that serve to refine the query in the intended way (Anick, 2003).",
        "All of them rely on the ability of the search engine to cluster search results, detecting topic similarities.",
        "In all of them, disambiguation is implicit, a side effect of the process but not its explicit target.",
        "Clustering may detect that documents about the Oasis band and the Oasis fashion store deal with unrelated topics, but it may as well detect a group of documents discussing why one of the Oasis band members is leaving the band, and another group of documents about Oasis band lyrics; both are different aspects of the broad topic Oasis band.",
        "A perfect hierarchical clustering should distinguish between the different Oasis senses at a first level, and then discover different topics within each of the senses.",
        "Is it possible to use sense inventories to improve search results for one word queries?",
        "To answer this question, we will focus on two broad-coverage lexical resources of a different nature: WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), as a de-facto standard used in Word Sense Disambiguation experiments and many other Natural Language Processing research fields; and Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), as a large coverage and updated encyclopedic resource which may have a better coverage of relevant senses in Web pages.",
        "Our hypothesis is that, under appropriate conditions, any of the above mechanisms (clustering, search suggestions, diversity) might benefit from an explicit disambiguation (classification of pages in the top search results) using a wide-coverage sense inventory.",
        "Our research is focused on four relevant aspects of the problem:",
        "1.",
        "Coverage: Are Wikipedia/Wordnet senses representative of search results?",
        "Otherwise, trying to make a disambiguation in terms ofa fixed sense inventory would be meaningless.",
        "2.",
        "If the answer to (1) is positive, the reverse question is also interesting: can we estimate search results diversity using our sense inventories?",
        "3.",
        "Sense frequencies: knowing sense frequencies in (search results) Web pages is crucial to have a usable sense inventory.",
        "Is it possible to estimate Web sense frequencies from currently available information?",
        "4.",
        "Classification: The association of Web pages to word senses must be done with some unsupervised algorithm, because it is not possible to hand-tag training material for every possible query word.",
        "Can this classification be done accurately?",
        "Can it be effective to promote diversity in search results?",
        "In order to provide an initial answer to these questions, we have built a corpus consisting of 40 nouns and 100 Google search results per noun, manually annotated with the most appropriate Wordnet and Wikipedia senses.",
        "Section 2 describes how this corpus has been created, and in Section 3 we discuss WordNet and Wikipedia coverage of search results according to our testbed.",
        "As this initial results clearly discard Wordnet as a sense inventory for the task, the rest of the paper mainly focuses on Wikipedia.",
        "In Section 4 we estimate search results diversity from our testbed, finding that the use of Wikipedia could substantially improve diversity in the top results.",
        "In Section 5 we use the Wikipedia internal link structure and the number of visits per page to estimate relative frequencies for Wikipedia senses, obtaining an estimation which is highly correlated with actual data in our testbed.",
        "Finally, in Section 6 we discuss a few strategies to classify Web pages into word senses, and apply the best classifier to enhance diversity in search results.",
        "The paper concludes with a discussion of related work (Section 7) and an overall discussion of our results in Section 8."

      "text": [
        "The most crucial step in building our test set is choosing the set of words to be considered.",
        "We are looking for words which are susceptible to form a one-word query for a Web search engine, and therefore we should focus on nouns which are used to denote one or more named entities.",
        "At the same time we want to have some degree of comparability with previous research on Word Sense Disambiguation, which points to noun sets used in Senseval/SemEval evaluation campaigns.",
        "Our budget for corpus annotation was enough for two persons-month, which limited us to handle 40 nouns (usually enough to establish statistically significant differences between WSD algorithms, although obviously limited to reach solid figures about the general behaviour of words in the Web).",
        "With these arguments in mind, we decided to choose: (i) 15 nouns from the Senseval-3 lexical sample dataset, which have been previously employed by (Mihalcea, 2007) in a related experiment (see Section 7); (ii) 25 additional words which satisfy two conditions: they are all ambiguous, and they are all names for music bands in one of their senses (not necessarily the most salient).",
        "The Senseval set is: {argument, arm, atmosphere, bank, degree, difference, disc, image, paper, party, performance, plan, shelter, sort, source}.",
        "The bands set is {amazon, apple, camel, cell, columbia, cream, foreigner, fox, genesis, jaguar, oasis, pioneer, police, puma, rainbow, shell, skin, sun, tesla, thunder, total, traffic, trapeze, triumph, yes} .",
        "For each noun, we looked up all its possible senses in WordNet 3.0 and in Wikipedia (using",
        "Wikipedia disambiguation pages).",
        "Wikipedia has an average of 22 senses per noun (25.2 in the Bands set and 16.1 in the Senseval set), and Word-net a much smaller figure, 4.5 (3.12 for the Bands set and 6.13 for the Senseval set).",
        "For a conventional dictionary, a higher ambiguity might indicate an excess of granularity; for an encyclopaedic resource such as Wikipedia, however, it is just an indication of larger coverage.",
        "Wikipedia entries for camel which are not in WordNet, for instance, include the Apache Camel routing and mediation engine, the British rock band, the brand of cigarettes, the river in Cornwall, and the World World War I fighter biplane.",
        "We retrieved the 150 first ranked documents for each noun, by submitting the nouns as queries to a Web search engine (Google).",
        "Then, for each document, we stored both the snippet (small description of the contents of retrieved document) and the whole HTML document.",
        "This collection of documents contain an implicit new inventory of senses, based on Web search, as documents retrieved by a noun query are associated with some sense of the noun.",
        "Given that every document in the top Web search results is supposed to be highly relevant for the query word, we assume a \"one sense per document\" scenario, although we allow annotators to assign more than one sense per document.",
        "In general this assumption turned out to be correct except in a few exceptional cases (such as Wikipedia disambiguation pages): only nine documents received more than one WordNet sense, and 44 (1.1% of all annotated pages) received more than one Wikipedia sense.",
        "We implemented an annotation interface which stored all documents and a short description for every Wordnet and Wikipedia sense.",
        "The annotators had to decide, for every document, whether there was one or more appropriate senses in each of the dictionaries.",
        "They were instructed to provide annotations for 100 documents per name; if an URL in the list was corrupt or not available, it had to be discarded.",
        "We provided 150 documents per name to ensure that the figure of 100 usable documents per name could be reached without problems.",
        "Each judge provided annotations for the 4,000 documents in the final data set.",
        "In a second round, they met and discussed their independent annotations together, reaching a consensus judgement for every document."

        "Examples taken from related pages (even if the relationship is close as in this case) seem to be too noisy for the task.",
        "This result is compatible with findings in (Santamarïa et al., 2003) using the Open Directory Project to extract examples automatically.",
        "• Our estimation of sense frequencies turns out to be very helpful for cases where our TiMBL-based algorithm cannot provide an answer: precision rises from .60 (TiMBL-core) to .67 (TiMBL-core+freq).",
        "The difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05) according to the t-test.",
        "As for the experiments with VSM, the variations tested do not provide substantial improvements to the baseline (which is .67).",

        "Remarkably, the use of frequency estimations is very helpful for the WSD approach but not for the SVM one, and they both end up with similar performance figures; this might indicate that using frequency estimations is only helpful up to certain precision ceiling.",
        "All the above experiments are done at maximal coverage, i.e., all systems assign a sense for every document in the test collection (at least for every document with textual content).",
        "But it is possible to enhance search results diversity without annotating every document (in fact, not every document can be assigned to a Wikipedia sense, as we have discussed in Section 3).",
        "Thus, it is useful to investigate which is the precision/coverage trade-off in our dataset.",
        "We have experimented with the best performing system (VSM-GT+freq), introducing a similarity threshold: assignment of a document to a sense is only done if the similarity of the document to the Wikipedia page for the sense exceeds the similarity threshold.",

        "But in our Web Search scenario, 44% of the documents were not assigned to any Wikipedia sense: in practice, our classification algorithm would have to cope with all this noise as well.",
        "Figure 1 (dotted line) shows how the precision/coverage curve is affected when the algorithm attempts to disambiguate all documents retrieved by Google, whether they can in fact be assigned to a Wikipedia sense or not.",

        "We now want to estimate how the reported classification accuracy may perform in practice to enhance diversity in search results.",
        "In order to provide an initial answer to this question, we have re-ranked the documents for the 40 nouns in our testbed, using our best classifier (VSM-GT+freq) and making a list of the top-ten documents with the primary criterion of maximising the number of senses represented in the set, and the secondary criterion of maximising the similarity scores of the documents to their assigned senses.",
        "The algorithm proceeds as follows: we fill each position in the rank (starting at rank 1), with the document which has the highest similarity to some of the senses which are not yet represented in the rank; once all senses are represented, we start choosing a second representative for each sense, following the same criterion.",
        "The process goes on until the first ten documents are selected.",
        "We have also produced a number of alternative rankings for comparison purposes:",
        "• clustering (centroids): this method applies Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering - which proved to be the most competitive clustering algorithm in a similar task (Artiles et al., 2009) - to the set of search results, forcing the algorithm to create ten clusters.",
        "The centroid of each cluster is then selected",
        "as one of the top ten documents in the new rank.",
        "• clustering (top ranked): Applies the same clustering algorithm, but this time the top ranked document (in the original Google rank) of each cluster is selected.",
        "• random: Randomly selects ten documents from the set of retrieved results.",
        "• upper bound: This is the maximal diversity that can be obtained in our testbed.",
        "Note that coverage is not 100%, because some words have more than ten meanings in Wikipedia and we are only considering the top ten documents.",
        "All experiments have been applied on the full set of documents in the testbed, including those which could not be annotated with any Wikipedia sense.",
        "Coverage is computed as the ratio of senses that appear in the top ten results compared to the number of senses that appear in all search results.",
        "Results are presented in Table 5.",
        "Note that diversity in the top ten documents increases from an average of 2.80 Wikipedia senses represented in the original search engine rank, to 4.75 in the modified rank (being 6.15 the upper bound), with the coverage of senses going from 49% to 77%.",
        "With a simple VSM algorithm, the coverage of Wikipedia senses in the top ten results is 70% larger than in the original ranking.",
        "Using Wikipedia to enhance diversity seems to work much better than clustering: both strategies to select a representative from each cluster are unable to improve the diversity of the original ranking.",

        "Web search results clustering and diversity in search results are topics that receive an increasing attention from the research community.",
        "Diversity is used both to represent sub-themes in a broad topic, or to consider alternative interpretations for ambiguous queries (Agrawal et al., 2009), which is our interest here.",
        "Standard IR test collections do not usually consider ambiguous queries, and are thus inappropriate to test systems that promote diversity (Sanderson, 2008); it is only recently that appropriate test collections are being built, such as (Paramita et al., 2009) for image search and (Ar-tiles et al., 2009) for person name search.",
        "We see our testbed as complementary to these ones, and expect that it can contribute to foster research on search results diversity.",
        "To our knowledge, Wikipedia has not explicitly been used before to promote diversity in search results; but in (Gollapudi and Sharma, 2009), it is used as a gold standard to evaluate diversification algorithms: given a query with a Wikipedia disambiguation page, an algorithm is evaluated as promoting diversity when different documents in the search results are semantically similar to different Wikipedia pages (describing the alternative senses of the query).",
        "Although semantic similarity is measured automatically in this work, our results confirm that this evaluation strategy is sound, because Wikipedia senses are indeed representative of search results.",
        "(Clough et al., 2009) analyses query diversity in a Microsoft Live Search, using click entropy and query reformulation as diversity indicators.",
        "It was found that at least 9.5% - 16.2% of queries could benefit from diversification, although no correlation was found between the number of senses of a word in Wikipedia and the indicators used to discover diverse queries.",
        "This result does not discard, however, that queries where applying diversity is useful cannot benefit from Wikipedia as a sense inventory.",
        "In the context of clustering, (Carmel et al., 2009) successfully employ Wikipedia to enhance automatic cluster labeling, finding that Wikipedia labels agree with manual labels associated by humans to a cluster, much more than with significant terms that are extracted directly from the text.",
        "In a similar line, both (Gabrilovich and evidence suggesting that categories of Wikipedia articles can successfully describe common concepts in documents.",
        "In the field of Natural Language Processing, there has been successful attempts to connect Wikipedia entries to Wordnet senses: (Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005) reports an algorithm that provides an accuracy of 84%.",
        "(Mihalcea, 2007) uses internal Wikipedia hyperlinks to derive sense-tagged examples.",
        "But instead of using Wikipedia directly as sense inventory, Mihalcea then manually maps Wikipedia senses into Wordnet senses (claiming that, at the time of writing the paper, Wikipedia did not consistently report ambiguity in disambiguation pages) and shows that a WSD system based on acquired sense-tagged examples reaches an accuracy well beyond an (informed) most frequent sense heuristic."

        "We have investigated whether generic lexical resources can be used to promote diversity in Web search results for one-word, ambiguous queries.",
        "We have compared WordNet and Wikipedia and arrived to a number of conclusions: (i) unsurprisingly, Wikipedia has a much better coverage of senses in search results, and is therefore more appropriate for the task; (ii) the distribution ofsenses in search results can be estimated using the internal graph structure of the Wikipedia and the relative number of visits received by each sense in Wikipedia, and (iii) associating Web pages to Wikipedia senses with simple and efficient algorithms, we can produce modified rankings that cover 70% more Wikipedia senses than the original search engine rankings.",
        "We expect that the testbed created for this research will complement the - currently short - set of benchmarking test sets to explore search results diversity and query ambiguity.",
        "Our testbed is publicly available for research purposes at http://nlp.uned.es.",
        "Our results endorse further investigation on the use of Wikipedia to organize search results.",
        "Some limitations of our research, however, must be noted: (i) the nature of our testbed (with every search result manually annotated in terms of two sense inventories) makes it too small to extract solid conclusions on Web searches (ii) our work does not involve any study of diversity from the point of view of Web users (i.e. when a Web query addresses many different use needs in practice); research in (Clough et al., 2009) suggests that word ambiguity in Wikipedia might not be related with diversity of search needs; (iii) we have tested our classifiers with a simple reordering of search results to test how much diversity can be improved, but a search results ranking depends on many other factors, some of them more crucial than diversity; it remains to be tested how can we use document/Wikipedia associations to improve search results clustering (for instance, providing seeds for the clustering process) and to provide search suggestions."
