        "There is a growing research interest in opinion retrieval as on-line users' opinions are becoming more and more popular in business, social networks, etc.",
        "Practically speaking, the goal of opinion retrieval is to retrieve documents, which entail opinions or comments, relevant to a target subject specified by the user's query.",
        "A fundamental challenge in opinion retrieval is information representation.",
        "Existing research focuses on document-based approaches and documents are represented by bag-of-word.",
        "However, due to loss of contextual information, this representation fails to capture the associative information between an opinion and its corresponding target.",
        "It cannot distinguish different degrees of a sentiment word when associated with different targets.",
        "This in turn seriously affects opinion retrieval performance.",
        "In this paper, we propose a sentence-based approach based on a new information representation, namely topic-sentiment word pair, to capture intra-sentence contextual information between an opinion and its target.",
        "Additionally, we consider inter-sentence information to capture the relationships among the opinions on the same topic.",
        "Finally, the two types of information are combined in a unified graph-based model, which can effectively rank the documents.",
        "Compared with existing approaches, experimental results on the COAE08 dataset showed that our graph-based model achieved significant improvement."

        "In recent years, there is a growing interest in sharing personal opinions on the Web, such as product reviews, economic analysis, political polls, etc.",
        "These opinions cannot only help independent users make decisions, but also obtain valuable feedbacks (Pang et al., 2008).",
        "Opinion oriented research, including sentiment classification, opinion extraction, opinion question answering, and opinion summarization, etc.",
        "are receiving growing attention (Wilson, et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Oard et al., 2006).",
        "However, most existing works concentrate on analyzing opinions expressed in the documents, and none on how to represent the information needs required to retrieve opinionated documents.",
        "In this paper, we focus on opinion retrieval, whose goal is to find a set of documents containing not only the query keyword(s) but also the relevant opinions.",
        "This requirement brings about the challenge on how to represent information needs for effective opinion retrieval.",
        "In order to solve the above problem, previous work adopts a 2-stage approach.",
        "In the first stage, relevant documents are determined and ranked by a score, i.e. tf-idf value.",
        "In the second stage, an opinion score is generated for each relevant document (Macdonald and Ounis, 2007; Oard et al., 2006).",
        "The opinion score can be acquired by either machine learning-based sentiment classifiers, such as SVM (Zhang and Yu, 2007), or a sentiment lexicons with weighted scores from training documents (Amati et al., 2007; Hannah et al., 2007; Na et al., 2009).",
        "Finally, an overall score combining the two is computed by using a score function, e.g. linear combination, to re-rank the retrieved documents.",
        "Retrieval in the 2-stage approach is based on document and document is represented by bag-of-word.",
        "This representation, however, can only ensure that there is at least one opinion in each relevant document, but it cannot determine the relevance pairing of individual opinion to its target.",
        "In general, by simply representing a document in bag-of-word, contextual information i.e. the corresponding target of an opinion, is neglected.",
        "This may result in possible mismatch between an opinion and a target and in turn affects opinion retrieval performance.",
        "By the same token, the effect to documents consisting of multiple topics, which is common in blogs and on-line reviews, is also significant.",
        "In this setting, even if a document is regarded opinionated, it cannot ensure that all opinions in the document are indeed relevant to the target concerned.",
        "Therefore, we argue that existing information representation i.e. bag-of-word, cannot satisfy the information needs for opinion retrieval.",
        "In this paper, we propose to handle opinion retrieval in the granularity of sentence.",
        "It is observed that a complete opinion is always expressed in one sentence, and the relevant target of the opinion is mostly the one found in it.",
        "Therefore, it is crucial to maintain the associative information between an opinion and its target within a sentence.",
        "We define the notion of a topic-sentiment word pair, which is composed of a topic term (i.e. the target) and a sentiment word (i.e. opinion) of a sentence.",
        "Word pairs can maintain intra-sentence contextual information to express the potential relevant opinions.",
        "In addition, inter-sentence contextual information is also captured by word pairs to represent the relationship among opinions on the same topic.",
        "In practice, the inter-sentence information reflects the degree of a word pair.",
        "Finally, we combine both intra-sentence and inter-sentence contextual information to construct a unified undirected graph to achieve effective opinion retrieval.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the motivation of our approach.",
        "Section 3 presents a novel unified graph-based model for opinion retrieval.",
        "We evaluated our model and the results are presented in Section 4.",
        "We review related works on opinion retrieval in Section 5.",
        "Finally, in Section 6, the paper is concluded and future work is suggested."

      "text": [
        "In this section, we start from briefly describing the objective of opinion retrieval.",
        "We then illustrate the limitations of current opinion retrieval approaches, and analyze the motivation of our method.",
        "Opinion retrieval was first presented in the TREC 2006 Blog track, and the objective is to retrieve documents that express an opinion about a given target.",
        "The opinion target can be a \"traditional\" named entity (e.g. a name of person, location, or organization, etc.",
        "), a concept (e.g. a type of technology), or an event (e.g. presidential election).",
        "The topic of the document is not required to be the same as the target, but an opinion about the target has to be presented in the document or one of the comments to the document (Macdonald and Ounis, 2006).",
        "Therefore, in this paper we regard the information needs for opinion retrieval as relevant opinion.",
        "In traditional information retrieval (IR) bag-of-word representation is the most common way to express information needs.",
        "However, in opinion retrieval, information need target at relevant opinion, and this renders bag-of-word representation ineffective.",
        "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
        "There are three sentences A, B, and C in a document di.",
        "Now given an opinion-oriented query Q related to 'Avatar'.",
        "According to the conventional 2-stage opinion retrieval approach, di is represented by a bag-of-word.",
        "Among the words, there is a topic term Avatar (t1) occurring twice, i.e. Avatar in A and Avatar in C, and two sentiment words comfortable (o1) and favorite (o2) (refer to Figure 2 (a)).",
        "In order to rank this document, an overall score of the document di is computed by a simple combination of the relevant score ( Scorerel ) and the opinion score (Scoreop), e.g. equal weighted linear combination, as follows.",
        "Scoredoc =Scorerel + ScoreopFor simplicity, we let Scorerel = tfq xidfq, and Scoreop be computed by using lexicon-based method: Scoreop = weigAtcomfortable+weigAttavorlte.",

        "Although bag-of-word representation achieves good performance in retrieving relevant documents, our study shows that it cannot satisfy the information needs for retrieval of relevant opinion.",
        "It suffers from the following limitations:",
        "(1) It cannot maintain contextual information; thus, an opinion may not be related to the target of the retrieved document is neglected.",
        "In this example, only the opinion favorite (o2) on Avatar in C is the relevant opinion.",
        "But due to loss of contextual information between the opinion and its corresponding target, Avatar in A and com- fortable (o1) are also regarded as relevant opinion mistakenly, creating a false positive.",
        "In reality comfortable (oj) describes \"the seats in IMAX\", which is an irrelevant opinion, and sentence A is a factual statement rather than an opinion statement.",
        "Figure 2: Two kinds of information representation of opinion retrieval.",
        "(tj='Avatar' oj= 'comfortable', o2='favorite')",
        "(1) Current approaches cannot capture the relationship among opinions about the same topic.",
        "Suppose there is another document including sentence C which expresses the same opinion on Avatar.",
        "Existing information representation simply does not cater for the two identical opinions from different documents.",
        "In addition, if many documents contain opinions on Avatar, the relationship among them is not clearly represented by existing approaches.",
        "In this paper, we process opinion retrieval in the granularity of sentence as we observe that a complete opinion always exists within a sentence (refer to Figure 2 (b)).",
        "To represent a relevant opinion, we define the notion of topic-sentiment word pair, which consists of a topic term and a sentiment word.",
        "A word pair maintains the associative information between the two words, and enables systems to draw up the relationship among all the sentences with the same opinion on an identical target.",
        "This relationship information can identify all documents with sentences including the sentiment words and to determine the contributions of such words to the target (topic term).",

        "Different from existing approaches which simply make use of document relevance to reflect the relevance of opinions embedded in them, our approach concerns more on identifying the relevance of individual opinions.",
        "Intuitively, we believed that the more relevant opinions appear in a document, the more relevant is that document for subsequent opinion analysis operations.",
        "Further, since the lexical scope of an opinion does not usually go beyond a sentence, we propose to handle opinion retrieval in the granularity of sentence.",
        "Without loss of generality, we assume that there is a document set T> = {d1,d2,d3, – ,dn}, and a specific query Q = {q1,q2,q3, – ,qz} , where <?i,<?2,<?3,-\",<?z are query keywords.",

        "To maintain the associative information between the target and the opinion, we consider the document set as a bag of sentences, and define a sentence set as s = {s1,s2,s3,---,sN}.",
        "For each sentence, we capture the intra-sentence information through the topic-sentiment word pair.",

        "The topic term from Vt determines relevance by the query term matching, and the sentiment word from V0 is used to express an opinion.",
        "We use the word pair to maintain the associative information between the topic term and the opinion word (also referred to as sentiment word).",
        "The word pair is used to identify a relevant opinion in a sentence.",
        "In Figure 2 (b), th i.e. Avatar in C, is a topic term relevant to the query, and o2 ('favorite') is supposed to be an opinion; and the word pair < t1, o2> indicates sentence C contains a relevant opinion.",
        "Similarly, we map each sentence in word pairs by the following rule, and express the intra-sentence information using word pairs.",
        "For each sentiment word of a sentence, we choose the topic term with minimum distance as the other element of the word pair:",
        "According to the mapping rule, although a sentence may give rise to a number of word pairs, only the pair with the minimum word distance is selected.",
        "We do not take into consideration of the other words in a sentence as relevant opinions are generally formed in close proximity.",
        "A sentence is regarded non-opinionated unless it contains at least one word pair.",
        "In practice, not all word pairs carry equal weights to express a relevant opinion as the contribution of an opinion word differs from different target topics, and vice versa.",
        "For example, the word pair < t1, o2> should be more probable as a relevant opinion than < t1, o1>.",
        "To consider that, inter-sentence contextual information is explored.",
        "This is achieved by assigning a weight to each word pair to measure their associative degrees to different queries.",
        "We believe that the more a word pair appears the higher should be the weight between the opinion and the target in the context.",
        "We will describe how to utilize intra-sentence contextual information to express relevant opinion, and inter-sentence information to measure the degree of each word pair through a graph-based model in the following section.",
        "We propose an opinion retrieval model based on HITS, a popular graph ranking algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999).",
        "By considering both in-tra-sentence information and inter-sentence information, we can determine the weight of a word pair and rank the documents.",
        "HITS algorithm distinguishes hubs and authorities in objects.",

        "The lower level contains all the documents to be retrieved.",
        "Figure 3 gives the bipartite graph representation of the HITS model.",
        "For our purpose, the word pairs layer is considered as hubs and the documents layer authorities.",
        "If a word pair occurs in one sentence of a document, there will be an edge between them.",
        "In Figure 3, we can see that the word pair that has links to many documents can be assigned a high weight to denote a strong associative degree between the topic term and a sentiment word, and it likely expresses a relevant opinion.",
        "On the other hand, if a document has links to many word pairs, the document is with many relevant opinions, and it will result in high ranking.",
        "Formally, the representation for the bipartite graph is denoted as G=<Hp,Ad,Edp>, where hp = {Pij] is the set of all pairs of topic words and sentiment words, which appear in one sentence.",

        "Our research focuses on relevant opinion rather than on relevant document retrieval.",
        "We, therefore, review related works in opinion identification research.",
        "Furthermore, we do not support the conventional 2-stage opinion retrieval approach.",
        "We conducted literature review on unified opinion retrieval models and related work in this area is presented in the section.",
        "Different from traditional IR, opinion retrieval focuses on the opinion nature of documents.",
        "During the last three years, NTICR and TREC evaluations have shown that sentiment lexicon-based methods led to good performance in opinion identification.",
        "A lightweight lexicon-based statistical approach was proposed by Hannah et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "In this method, the distribution of terms in relevant opinionated documents was compared to their distribution in relevant fact-based documents to calculate an opinion weight.",
        "These weights were used to compute opinion scores for each retrieved document.",
        "A weighted dictionary was generated from previous TREC relevance data (Amati et al., 2007).",
        "This dictionary was submitted as a query to a search engine to get an initial query-independent opinion score of all retrieved documents.",
        "Similarly, a pseudo opinionated word composed of all opinion words was first created, and then used to estimate the opinion score of a document (Na et al., 2009).",
        "This method was shown to be very effective in TREC evaluations (Lee et al., 2008).",
        "More recently, Huang and Croft (2009) proposed an effective relevance model, which integrated both query-independent and query-dependent sentiment words into a mixture model.",
        "In our approach, we also adopt sentiment lexicon-based method for opinion identification.",
        "Unlike the above methods, we generate a weight to a sentiment word for each target (associated topic term) rather than assign a unified weight or an equal weight to the sentiment word for the whole topics.",
        "Besides, in our model no training data is required.",
        "We just utilize the structure of our graph to generate a weight to reflect the associative degree between the two elements of a word pair in different context.",
        "In addition to conventional 2-stage approach, there has been some research on unified opinion retrieval models.",
        "Eguchi and Lavrenko proposed an opinion retrieval model in the framework of generative language modeling (Eguchi and Lavrenko, 2006).",
        "They modeled a collection of natural language documents or statements, each of which consisted of some topic-bearing and some sentiment-bearing words.",
        "The sentiment was either represented by a group of predefined seed words, or extracted from a training sentiment corpus.",
        "This model was shown to be effective on the MPQA corpus.",
        "Mei et al.",
        "tried to build a fine-grained opinion retrieval system for consumer products (Mei et al., 2007).",
        "The opinion score for a product was a mixture of several facets.",
        "Due to the difficulty in associating sentiment with products and facets, the system was only tested using small scale text collections.",
        "Zhang and Ye proposed a generative model to unify topic relevance and opinion generation (Zhang and Ye, 2008).",
        "This model led to satisfactory performance, but an intensive computation load was inevitable during retrieval, since for each possible candidate document, an opinion score was summed up from the generative probability of thousands of sentiment words.",
        "Huang and Croft proposed a unified opinion retrieval model according to the Kullback-Leib-ler divergence between the two probability distributions of opinion relevance model and document model (Huang and Croft, 2009).",
        "They divided the sentiment words into query-dependent and query-independent by utilizing several sentiment expansion techniques, and integrated them into a mixed model.",
        "However, in this model, the contribution of a sentiment word was its corresponding incremental mean average precision value.",
        "This method required that large amount of training data and manual labeling.",
        "Different from the above opinion retrieval approaches, our proposed graph-based model processes opinion retrieval in the granularity of sentence.",
        "Instead of bag-of-word, the sentence is split into word pairs which can maintain the contextual information.",
        "On the one hand, word pair can identify the relevant opinion according to intra-sentence contextual information.",
        "On the other hand, it can measure the degree of a relevant opinion by considering the inter-sentence contextual information."

        "In this work we focus on the problem of opinion retrieval.",
        "Different from existing approaches, which regard document relevance as the key indicator of opinion relevance, we propose to explore the relevance of individual opinion.",
        "To do that, opinion retrieval is performed in the granularity of sentence.",
        "We define the notion of word pair, which can not only maintain the association between the opinion and the corresponding target in the sentence, but it can also build up the relationship among sentences through the same word pair.",
        "Furthermore, we convert the relationships between word pairs and sentences into a unified graph, and use the HITS algorithm to achieve document ranking for opinion retrieval.",
        "Finally, we compare our approach with existing methods.",
        "Experimental results show that our proposed model performs well on COAE08 dataset.",
        "The novelty of our work lies in using word pairs to represent the information needs for opinion retrieval.",
        "On the one hand, word pairs can identify the relevant opinion according to in-tra-sentence contextual information.",
        "On the other hand, word pairs can measure the degree of a relevant opinion by taking inter-sentence contextual information into consideration.",
        "With the help of word pairs, the information needs for opinion retrieval can be represented appropriately.",
        "In the future, more research is required in the following directions:",
        "(1) Since word pairs can indicate relevant opinions effectively, it is worth further study on how they could be applied to other opinion oriented applications, e.g. opinion summarization, opinion prediction, etc.",
        "(2) The characteristics of blogs will be taken into consideration, i.e., the post time, which could be helpful to create a more time sensitivity graph to filter out fake opinions.",
        "(3) Opinion holder is another important role of an opinion, and the identification of opinion holder is a main task in NTCIR.",
        "It would be interesting to study opinion holders, e.g. its seniority, for opinion retrieval.",
