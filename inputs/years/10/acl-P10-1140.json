        "As the number of reviews available for each individual product increases, RSs may overwhelm the user if they make all those reviews available.",
        "Additionally, in some reviews only few sentences actually describe the recommended product, hence, the interest in opinion mining and in summarizing those reviews.",
        "A Music RS could be developed along the lines of Product RSs.",
        "However, Music RSs recommend individual tracks, not full albums, e.g. see www.itunes.com.",
        "Summarizing reviews becomes more complex: available data consists of album reviews, not individual song reviews (www.",

        "Comments about a given song are fragmented all over an album review.",
        "Though some websites like www.last.fm allow users to comment on individual songs, the comments are too short (a few words such as \"awesome song\") to be counted as a full review.",
        "In this paper, after presenting related work and contrasting it to our goals in Section 2, we discuss our prototype Music RS in Section 3.",
        "We devote Section 4 to our summarizer, that extracts comments on individual tracks from album reviews and produces a summary of those comments for each individual track recommended to the user.",
        "In Section 5, we report two types of evaluation: an intrinsic evaluation of the extraction components, and of the coverage of the summary; an extrinsic evaluation via a between-subject study.",

        "We compared their algorithm to ours on 10 randomly chosen reviews from our corpus, for a total of about 500 sentences.",
        "Its accuracy (40.8% precision, and 64.5% recall) is much lower than ours, and than their original results on product reviews (72% precision, and 80% recall).",
        "To evaluate the information captured in the summary, we randomly selected 5 or 6 songs from 10 albums, and generated the corresponding 52 summaries, one per song - this corresponds to a test set of about 500 album reviews (each album has about 50 reviews).",
        "Most summary evaluation schemes, for example the Pyramid method (Harnly et al., 2005) , make use of reference summaries written by humans.",
        "We approximate those goldstandard reference summaries with 2 or 3 critic reviews per album taken from www.pitchfork.",
        "\"The Song That Jane Likes\" is cute.",
        "The song has some nice riffs by Leroi Moore.",
        "\"The Song That Jane Likes\" is also amazing funk number.",
        "The lyrics are sweet and loving.",
        "The song carries a light-hearted tone.",
        "It has a catchy tune.",
        "The song features some nice accents.",
        "\"The Song That Jane Likes\" is beautiful song with great rhythm.",
        "The funky beat will surely make a move.",
        "It is a heavily acoustic guitar-based song.",
        "com, www.rollingstone.com and www.",
        "allmusic.com.",
        "First, we manually annotated both critic reviews and the automatically generated summaries for song titles and song features.",
        "302, i.e., 91.2% of the features identified in the critic reviews are also identified in the summaries (recall that a feature is considered as identified, if the head-noun of the NP is identified by both the critic review and the summary, and attributed to the same song).",
        "64 additional features were identified, for a recall of 82%.",
        "It is not surprising that additional features may appear in the summaries: even if only one of the 50 album reviews talks about that feature, it is included in the summary.",
        "Potentially, a threshold on frequency of feature mention could increase recall, but we found out that even a threshold of two significantly affects precision.",
        "In a second evaluation, we used our Feature Extraction algorithm to extract features from the critic reviews, for each song whose summary needs to be evaluated.",
        "This is an indirect evaluation of that algorithm, in that it shows it is not affected by somewhat different data, since the critic reviews are more formally written.",
        "375, or 95% of the features identified in the critic reviews are also identified in the summaries.",
        "55 additional features were additionally identified, for a recall of 87.5%.",
        "These values are comparable, even if slightly higher, to the precision and recall of the manual annotation described above.",
        "Our intrinsic evaluation gives satisfactory results.",
        "However, we believe the ultimate measure of such a summarization algorithm is an end-to-end evaluation to ascertain whether it affects user behavior, and how.",
        "We conducted a between-subject user study, where users were presented with two different versions of our Music RS.",
        "For each of the recommended songs, the baseline version provides only whole album reviews, the experimental version provides the automatically generated song feature summary, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The interface for the baseline version is similar, but the summary in the bottom window is replaced by the corresponding album review.",
        "The presented review is the one among the 50 reviews for that album whose length is closest to the average length of album reviews in the corpus (478 words).",
        "Each user was presented with 5 songs in succession, with 3 recommendations each (only the top 3 recommendations were presented among the available 25, see Section 3).",
        "Users were asked to select at least one recommendation for each song, namely, to click on the url where they can listen to the song.",
        "They were also asked to base their selection on the information provided by the interface.",
        "The first song was a test song for users to get acquainted with the system.",
        "We collected comprehensive timed logs of the user actions, including clicks, when windows are open and closed, etc.",
        "After using the system, users were administered a brief questionnaire which included questions on a 5-point Likert Scale.",
        "18 users interacted with the baseline version and 21 users with the experimental version (five additional subjects were run but their log data was not properly saved).",
        "All users were students at our University, and most of them, graduate students (no differences were found due to gender, previous knowledge of music, or education level).",
        "Our main measure is time on task, the total time taken to select the recommendations from song 2 to song 5 - this excludes the time spent listening to the songs.",
        "A t-test showed that users in the experimental version take less time to make their decision when compared to baseline subjects (p = 0.019, t = 2.510).",
        "This is a positive result, because decreasing time to selection is important, given that music collections can include millions of songs.",
        "However, time-on-task basically represents the time it takes users to peruse the review or summary, and the number of words in the summaries is significantly lower than the number of words in the reviews (p < 0.001, t = 16.517).",
        "Hence, we also analyzed the influence of summaries on decision making, to see if they have any effects beyond cutting down on the number of words to read.",
        "Our assumption is that the default choice is to choose the first recommendation.",
        "Users in the baseline condition picked the first recommendation as often as the other two recommendations combined; users in the experimental condition picked the second and third recommendations more often than the first, and the difference between the two conditions is significant (X = 8.74, df = 1, p = 0.003).",
        "If we examine behavior song by song, this holds true especially for song 3 (x = 12.3, df = 1, p < 0.001) and song 4 (x = 5.08, df = 1, p = 0.024).",
        "We speculate that users in the experimental condition are more discriminatory in their choices, because important features of the recommended songs are evident in the summaries, but are buried in the album reviews.",
        "For example, for Song 3, only one of the 20 sentences in the album review is about the first recommended song, and is not very positive.",
        "Negative opinions are much more evident in the review summaries.",
        "The questionnaires included three common questions between the two conditions.",
        "The experimental subjects gave a more positive assessment of the length of the summary than the baseline subjects (p = 0.003, t = – 3.248, df = 31.928).",
        "There were no significant differences on the other two questions, feeling overwhelmed by the information provided; and whether the review/summary helped them to quickly make their selection.",
        "A multiple Linear Regression with, as predictors, the number of words the user read before making the selection and the questions, and time on task as dependent variable, revealed only one, not surprising, correlation: the number of words the user read correlates with time on task (R = 0.277, ß = 0.509, p = 0.004).",
        "Users in the experimental version were also asked to rate the grammaticality and coherence of the summary.",
        "The average rating was 3.33 for grammaticality, and 3.14 for coherence.",
        "Whereas these numbers in isolation are not too telling, they are at least suggestive that users did not find these summaries badly written.",
        "We found no significant correlations between grammaticality and coherence of summaries, and time on task."
