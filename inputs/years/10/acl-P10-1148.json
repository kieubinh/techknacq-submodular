        "In traditional philosophy, human beings are known to acquire knowledge mainly by reasoning and experience.",
        "Reasoning allows us to draw a conclusion based on evidence, but people tend to believe it firmly when they experience or observe it in the physical world.",
        "Despite the fact that direct experiences play a crucial role in making a firm decision and solving a problem, people often resort to indirect experiences by reading written materials or asking around.",
        "Among many sources people resort to, the Web has become the largest one for human experiences, especially with the proliferation of weblogs.",
        "While Web documents contain various types of information including facts, encyclopedic knowledge, opinions, and experiences in general, personal experiences tend to be found in weblogs more often than other web documents like news articles, home pages, and scientific papers.",
        "As such, we have begun to see some research efforts in mining experience-related attributes such as time, location, topic, and experiencer, and their relations from weblogs (Inui et al., 2008; Kura-shima et al., 2009).",
        "Mined experiences can be of practical use in wide application areas.",
        "For example, a collection of experiences from the people who visited a resort area would help planning what to do and how to do things correctly without having to spend time sifting through a variety of resources or rely on commercially-oriented sources.",
        "Another example would be a public service department gleaning information about how a park is being used at a specific location and time.",
        "Experiences can be recorded around a frame like \"who did what, when, where, and why\" although opinions and emotions can be also linked.",
        "Therefore attributes such as location, time, and activity and their relations must be extracted by devising a method for selecting experience-containing sentences based on verbs that have a particular linguistics case frame or belong to a \"do\" class (Kurashima et al., 2009).",
        "However, this kind of method may extract the following sentences as containing an experience:",
        "[1] If Jason arrives on time, I'll buy him a drink.",
        "[2] Probably, she will laugh and dance in his funeral.",
        "[3] Can anyone explain what is going on here?",
        "None of the sentences contain actual experiences because hypotheses, questions, and orders have not actually happened in the real world.",
        "For experience mining, it is important to ensure a sentence mentions an event or passes a factuality test to contain experience (Inui et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the problem of detecting experiences from weblogs.",
        "We formulate the problem as a classification task using various linguistic features including tense, mood, aspect, modality, experiencer, and verb classes.",
        "Based on our observation that experience-revealing sentences tend to have a certain linguistic style (Jijkoun et al., 2010), we investigate on the roles of various features.",
        "The ability to detect experience-revealing sentences should be a precursor for ensuring the quality of extracting various elements of actual experiences.",
        "Another issue addressed in this paper is automatic construction of a lexicon for verbs related to activities and events.",
        "While there have been well-known studies about classifying verbs based on aspectual features (Vendler, 1967), thematic roles and selectional restrictions (Fill-more, 1968; Somers, 1987; Kipper et al., 2008), valence alternations and intuitions (Levin, 1993) and conceptual structures (Fillmore and Baker, 2001), we found that none of the existing lexical resources such as Framenet (Baker et al., 2003) and Verbnet (Kipper et al., 2008) are sufficient for identifying experience-revealing verbs.",
        "We introduce a method for constructing an activity/event verb lexicon based on Vendler's theory and statistics obtained by utilizing a web search engine.",
        "We define experience as knowledge embedded in a collection of activities or events which an individual or group has actually undergone.",
        "It can be subjective as in opinions as well as objective, but our focus in this article lies in objective knowledge.",
        "The following sentences contain objective experiences:",
        "[5] I ran with my wife 3 times a week until we",
        "moved to Washington, D.C. [6] Jane and I hopped on a bus into the city centre.",
        "[7] We went to a restaurant near the central park.",
        "Whereas sentences like the following contain subjective knowledge:",
        "[8] I like your new style.",
        "You're beautiful!",
        "[9] The food was great, the interior too.",
        "Subject knowledge has been studied extensively for various functions such as identification, polarity detection, and holder extraction under the names of opinion mining and sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "In summary, our contribution lies in three aspects: 1) conception of experience detection, which is a precursor for experience mining, and specific related tasks that can be tackled with a high performance machine learning based solution; 2) examination and identification of salient linguistic features for experience detection; 3) a novel lexicon construction method with identification of key features to be used for verb classification.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents our lexicon construction method with experiments.",
        "Section 3 describes the experience detection method, including experimental setup, evaluation, and results.",

        "While our initial observation indicated that the existing lexical resources would not be sufficient for our goal, it occurred to us that the linguistic theory behind them would be worth exploring as generating additional features for categorizing verbs for the two classes.",

        "Activity verbs are expected to have high frequency of agent and instrument roles than state verbs.",
        "Although a verb may have more than one case frame, it is possible to determine which thematic roles used more dominantly.",
        "We utilize two major resources of lexical semantics, Verbnet (Kipper et al., 2008) based on the theory of Levin (1993), and Framenet (Baker et al., 2003), which is based on Fillmore (1968).",

        "By the mapping, we obtained distributions of the thematic roles for 2,868 unique verbs that exist in both of the resources.",

        "To generate a single value for a verb, we combine multiple probability values using the following sigmoid function:",
        "Evidence of a word w being an action in eHow is denoted as E(w) where variable t is the sum of individual action probability values in Dw the set of documents from which the word w has been extracted as an action.",

        "The selection was based on the lack of word sense ambiguity.",
        "One of our classifiers is based on Maximum Entropy (ME) models that implement the intuition that the best model will be the one that is consistent with the set of constraints imposed by the evidence, but otherwise is as uniform as possible (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "ME models are widely used in natural language processing tasks for its flexibility to incorporate a diverse range of features.",
        "The other one is based on Support Vector Machine (Chang and Lin, 2001) which is the state-of-the-art algorithm for many classification tasks.",
        "We used RBF kernel with the default settings (Hsu et al., 2009) because it is been known to show moderate performance using multiple feature compositions.",
        "The features we considered are a total of 42 real values: 18 from linguistic schemata, 23 thematic role distributions, and one from eHow.",
        "In order to examine which features are discriminative for the classification, we used two well known feature selection methods, Chi-square and information gain.",
        "Table 3 shows the classification performance values for different feature selection methods.",
        "The evaluation was done on the training data with 10-fold cross validation.",
        "Note that the precision and recall are macro-averaged values across the two classes, activity and state.",
        "The most discriminative features were absolute ratio and relative ratio in conjunction with the force, stop, progressive, and persuade schemata, the role distribution of experiencer, and the eHow evidence.",
        "It is noteworthy that eHow evidence and the distribution of experiencer got into the top 10.",
        "Other thematic roles did not perform well because of the data sparseness.",
        "Only a few roles (e.g., experience, agent, topic, location) among the 23 had frequency values other than 0 for many verbs.",
        "Data sparseness affected the linguistic schemata as well.",
        "Many of the verbs had zero hit counts for the for and carefully schemata.",
        "It is also interesting that the validity ratio Vi(w) was not shown to be a good feature-generating statistic.",
        "We finally trained our model with the top 10 features and classified all WordNet verbs and verb phrases.",
        "For actual construction of the lexicon, 11,416 verbs and verb phrases were classified into the two classes roughly equally.",
        "We randomly sampled 200 items and examined how accurately the classification was done.",
        "A total of 164 items were correctly classified, resulting in 82% accuracy.",
        "Some examples from the classification are shown in table 4.",
        "A further analysis of the results show that most of the errors occurred with domain-specific verbs (e.g., ablactate, alkalify, and transaminate in chemistry) and multi-word verb phrases (e.g., turn a nice dime; keep one's shoulder to the wheel).",
        "Since many features are computed based on Web resources, rare verbs cannot be classified correctly when their hit rations are very low.",

        "In selecting experience-containing blog pots, we used location names such as Central Park, SOHO, Seoul and general place names such as airport, subway station, and restaurant because blog posts with some places are expected to describe experiences rather than facts or thoughts.",
        "We crawled 6,000 blog posts.",
        "After deleting non-English and multimedia blog posts for which we could not obtain any meaningful text data, the number became 5,326.",
        "We randomly sampled 1,000 sentences and asked three annotators to judge whether or not individual sentences are considered containing an experience based on our definition.",
        "For maximum accuracy, we decided to use only those sentences all the three annotators agreed, resulting in a total of 568 sentences.",
        "While we tested several classifiers, we chose to use two different classifiers based on SVM and Logistic Regression for the final experimental results because they showed the best performance.",
        "For comparison purposes, we take the method of Kurashima et al.",
        "(2005) as our baseline because the method was used in subsequent studies (Ku-rashima et al., 2006; Kurashima et al., 2009) where experience attributes are extracted.",
        "We briefly describe the method and present how we implemented it.",
        "The method first extracts all verbs and their dependent phrasal unit from candidate sentences.",
        "The candidate goes through three filters before it is treated as experience-containing sentence.",
        "First, the candidates that do not have an objective case (Fillmore, 1968) are eliminated because their definition of experience as \"action + object\".",
        "This was done by identifying the object-indicating particle (case marker) in Japanese.",
        "Next, the candidates belonging to \"become\" and \"be\" statements based on Japanese verb types are filtered out.",
        "Finally, the candidate sentences including a verb that indicates a movement are eliminated because the main interest was to identify an activity in a place.",
        "Although their definition of experience is somewhat different from ours (i.e., \"action + object\"), they used the method to generate candidate sentences from which various experience attributes are extracted.",
        "From this perspective, the method functioned like our experience detection.",
        "Put differently, the definition and the method by which it is determined were much cruder than the one we are using, which seems close to our general understanding.",
        "The three filtering steps were implemented as follows.",
        "We used the dependency parser for extracting objective cases using the direct object relation.",
        "The second step, however, could not be applied because there is no grammatical distinction among \"do, be, become\" statements in English.",
        "We had to alter this step by adopting the approach of Inui et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "The authors propose a lexicon of experience expression by collecting hyponyms from a hierarchically structured dictionary.",
        "We collected all hyponyms of words \"do\" and \"act\", from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Lastly, we removed all the verbs that are under the hierarchy of \"move\" from WordNet.",
        "We not only compared our results with the baseline in terms of precision and recall but also evaluated individual features for their importance in experience detection (classification).",
        "The evaluation was conducted with 10-fold cross validation.",
        "The results are shown in table 5.",
        "The performance, especially precision, of the baseline is much lower than those of the others.",
        "The method devised for Japanese doesn't seem suitable for English.",
        "It seems that the linguistic styles shown in experience expressions are different from each other.",
        "In addition, the lexicon we constructed for the baseline (i.e., using the WordNet) contains more errors than our activity lexicon for activity verbs.",
        "Some hyponyms of an activity verb may not be activity verbs.",
        "(e.g., \"appear\" is a hyponym of \"do\").",
        "There is almost no difference between the Logistic Regression and SVM classifiers for our methods although SVM was inferior for the baseline.",
        "The performance for the best case with all the features included is very promising, closed to 92% precision and recall.",
        "Among the features, the lexicon, i.e., verb classes, gave the best result when each is used alone, followed by modality, tense, and mood.",
        "Aspect was the worst but close to the baseline.",
        "This result is very encouraging for the automatic lexicon construction work because the lexicon plays a pivotal role in the overall performance.",
        "In order to see the effect of including individual features in the feature set, precision and recall were measured after eliminating a particular feature from the full set.",
        "The results are shown in table 6.",
        "Although the absence of the lexicon feature hurt the performance most badly, still the performance was reasonably high (roughly 84 % in precision and recall for the Logistic Regression case).",
        "Similar to table 5, the aspect and experience features were the least contributors as the performance drops are almost negligible.",

        "Experience mining in its entirety is a relatively new area where various natural language processing and text mining techniques can play a significant role.",
        "While opinion mining or sentiment analysis, which can be considered an important part of experience mining, has been studied quite extensively (see Pang and Lee's excellent survey (2008)), another sub-area, factuality analysis, begins to gain some popularity (Inui et al., 2008; Sauri, 2008).",
        "Very few studies have focused explicitly on extracting various entities that constitute experiences (Kurashima et al., 2009) or detecting experience-containing parts of text although many NLP research areas such as named entity recognition and verb classification are strongly related.",
        "The previous work on experience detection relies on a handcrafted lexicon.",
        "There have been a number of studies for verb classification (Fillmore, 1968; Vendler, 1967; Somers, 1982; Levin, 1993; Fillmore and Baker, 2001; Kipper et al., 2008) that are essential for construction of an activity verb lexicon, which in turn is important for experience detection.",
        "Most similar to our work was done by Siegel and McKeown (2000), who attempted to categorize verbs into state or event classes based on 14 tests similar to those of Vendler's.",
        "They attempted to compute co-occurrence statistics from a corpus.",
        "The event class, however, includes activity, accomplishment, and achievement.",
        "Similarly, Za-crone and Lenci (2008) attempted to categorize verbs in Italian into the four Vendler classes using the Vendler tests by using a tagged corpus.",
        "They focused on existence of arguments such as subject and object that should co-occur with the linguistic features in the tests.",
        "The main difference between the previous work and ours lies in the goal and scope of the work.",
        "Since our work is specifically geared toward domain-independent experience detection, we attempted to maximize the coverage by using all the verbs in WordNet, as opposed to the verbs appearing in a particular domain-specific corpus (e.g., medicine domain) as done in the previous work.",
        "Another difference is that while we are not limited to a particular domain, we did not use extensive human-annotated corpus other than using the 80 seed verbs and existing lexical resources."

      "heading": "5. Conclusion and Future Work",
      "text": [
        "We defined experience detection as an essential task for experience mining, which is restated as determining whether individual sentences contain experience or not.",
        "Viewing the task as a classification problem, we focused on identification and examination of various linguistic features such as verb class, tense, aspect, mood, modality, and experience, all of which were computed automatically.",
        "For verb classes, in particular, we devised a method for classifying all the verbs and verb phrases in WordNet into the activity and state classes.",
        "The experimental results show that verb and verb phrase classification method is reasonably accurate with 91% precision and 78% recall with manually constructed gold standard consisting of 80 verbs and 82% accuracy for a random sample of all the WordNet entries.",
        "For experience detection, the performance was very promising, closed to 92% in precision and recall when all the features were used.",
        "Among the features, the verb classes, or the lexicon we constructed, contributed the most.",
        "In order to increase the coverage even further and reduce the errors in lexicon construction, i.e., verb classification, caused by data sparseness, we need to devise a different method, perhaps using domain specific resources.",
        "Given that experience mining is a relatively new research area, there are many areas to explore.",
        "In addition to refinements of our work, our next step is to develop a method for representing and extracting actual experiences from experience-revealing sentences.",
        "Furthermore, considering that only 13% of the blog data we processed contain experiences, an interesting extension is to apply the methodology to extract other types of knowledge such as facts, which are not necessarily experiences."
