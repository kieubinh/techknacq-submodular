        "For those tasks, we need a much larger inventory of specific classes and accurate classification of terms into those classes.",
        "While supervised learning methods perform well for traditional NER, they are impractical for fine-grained classification because sufficient labeled data to train classifiers for all the classes is unavailable and would be very expensive to obtain.",

        "In all experimental conditions with 2 and 10 seeds per class in Figure 7, we observe that the three methods consistently achieved the best performance on the TextRunner + YAGO graph.",
        "This suggests that addition of attribute based semantic constraints from YAGO to the TextRunner graph results in a better connected graph which in turn results in better inference by the graph-based SSL algorithms, compared to using either of the sources, i.e., TextRunner output or YAGO attributes, in isolation.",
        "This further illustrates the advantage of aggregating information across sources (Talukdar et al., 2008; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009).",
        "However, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate the effectiveness of attributes in class-instance acquisition.",
        "We note that this work is similar in spirit to the recent work by Carlson et al.",
        "(2010) which also demonstrates the benefits of additional constraints in SSL.",
        "Because of the label propagation behavior, graph-based SSL algorithms assign classes to all nodes reachable in the graph from at least one of the labeled instance nodes.",
        "This allows us to check the classes assigned to nodes corresponding to YAGO attributes in the TextRunner + YAGO graph, as shown in Table 2.",
        "Even though the experiments were designed for class-instance acquisition, it is encouraging to see that the graph-based SSL algorithm (MAD in Table 2) is able to learn class-attribute relationships, an important by-product that has been the focus of recent studies (Reisinger and Paşca, 2009).",
        "For example, the algorithm is able to learn that works .at is an attribute of the WordNet class word-netscientist210560631', and thereby its instances (e.g. Aage Niels Bohr, Adi Shamir)."

        "We have started a systematic experimental comparison of graph-based SSL algorithms for class-instance acquisition on a variety of graphs constructed from different domains.",
        "We found that MAD, a recently proposed graph-based SSL algorithm, is consistently the most effective across the various experimental conditions.",
        "We also showed that class-instance acquisition performance can be significantly improved by incorporating additional semantic constraints in the class-instance acquisition process, which for the experiments in this paper were derived from instance-attribute pairs available in an independently developed knowledge base.",
        "All the data used in these experiments was drawn from publicly available datasets and we plan to release our code to foster reproducible research in this area.",
        "Topics for future work include the incorporation of other kinds of semantic constraint for improved class-instance acquisition, further investigation into per-node sparsity constraints in graph-based SSL, and moving beyond bipartite graph constructions."
