        "Building and maintaining knowledge-rich resources is of great importance to information extraction, question answering, and textual entailment.",
        "Given the endless amount of data we have at our disposal, many efforts have focused on mining knowledge from structured or unstructured text, including ground facts (Etzioni et al., 2005), semantic lexicons (Thelen and Riloff, 2002), encyclopedic knowledge (Suchanek et al., 2007), and concept lists (Katz et al., 2003).",
        "Researchers have also successfully harvested relations between entities, such as is-a (Hearst, 1992; Paşca, 2004) and part-of (Girju et al., 2003).",
        "The kinds of knowledge learned are generally of two kinds: ground instance facts (New York is-a city, Rome is the capital of Italy) and general relational types (city is-a location, engines are part-of cars).",
        "A variety of NLP tasks involving inference or entailment (Zanzotto et al., 2006), including QA (Katz and Lin, 2003) and MT (Mt et al., 1988), require a slightly different form of knowledge, derived from many more relations.",
        "This knowledge is usually used to support inference and is expressed as selectional restrictions (Wilks, 1975) (namely, the types of arguments that may fill a given relation, such as person live-in city and airline fly-to location).",
        "Selectional restrictions constrain the possible fillers of a relation, and hence the possible contexts in which the patterns expressing that relation can participate in, thereby enabling sense disambiguation of both the fillers and the expression itself.",
        "To acquire this knowledge two common approaches are employed: clustering and patterns.",
        "While clustering has the advantage of being fully unsupervised, it may or may not produce the types and granularity desired by a user.",
        "In contrast pattern-based approaches are more precise, but they typically require a handful to dozens of seeds and lexico-syntactic patterns to initiate the learning process.",
        "In a closed domain these approaches are both very promising, but when tackling an unbounded number of relations they are unrealistic.",
        "The quality of clustering decreases as the domain becomes more continuously varied and diverse, and it has proven difficult to create collections of effective patterns and high-yield seeds manually.",
        "In addition, the output of most harvesting systems is a flat list of lexical semantic expressions such as \"New York is-a city\" and \"virus causes flu\".",
        "However, using this knowledge in inference requires it to be formulated appropriately and organized in a semantic repository.",
        "(Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006) proposed an algorithm for automatically ontologizing semantic relations into WordNet.",
        "However, despite its high precision entries, WordNet's limited coverage makes it impossible for relations whose arguments are not present in WordNet to be incorporated.",
        "One would like a procedure that dynamically organizes and extends its semantic repository in order to be able to accommodate all newly-harvested information, and thereby become a global semantic repository.",
        "Given these considerations, we address in this paper the following question: How can the selectional restrictions of semantic relations be learned automatically from the Web with minimal effort using lexico-syntactic recursive patterns?",
        "The contributions of the paper are as follows:",
        "• A novel representation of semantic relations using recursive lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "• An automatic procedure to learn the selectional restrictions (arguments and supertypes) of semantic relations from Web data.",
        "• An exhaustive human-based evaluation of the harvested knowledge.",
        "• A comparison of the results with some large existing knowledge bases.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section, we review related work.",
        "Section 3 addresses the representation of semantic relations using recursive patterns.",
        "Section 4 describes the bootstrapping mechanism that learns the selectional restrictions of the relations.",

        "A substantial body of work has been done in attempts to harvest bits of semantic information, including: semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997), concept lists (Lin and Pantel, 2002), isa relations (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005; Paşca, 2004; Kozareva et al., 2008), part-of relations (Girju et al., 2003), and others.",
        "Knowledge has been harvested with varying success both from structured text such as Wikipedia's infoboxes (Suchanek et al., 2007) or unstructured text such as the Web (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; Yates et al., 2007).",
        "A variety of techniques have been employed, including clustering (Lin and Pantel, 2002), co-occurrence statistics (Roark and Char-niak, 1998), syntactic dependencies (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004), and lexico-syntactic patterns (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Fleischman and",
        "Hovy, 2002; Thelen and Riloff, 2002).",
        "When research focuses on a particular relation, careful attention is paid to the pattern(s) that express it in various ways (as in most of the work above, notably (Riloff and Jones, 1999)).",
        "But it has proven a difficult task to manually find effectively different variations and alternative patterns for each relation.",
        "In contrast, when research focuses on any relation, as in TextRun-ner (Yates et al., 2007), there is no standardized manner for reusing the pattern learned.",
        "TextRun-ner scans sentences to obtain relation-independent lexico-syntactic patterns to extract triples of the form (John, fly to, Prague).",
        "The middle string denotes some (unspecified) semantic relation while the first and third denote the learned arguments of this relation.",
        "But TextRunner does not seek specific semantic relations, and does not reuse the patterns it harvests with different arguments in order to extend their yields.",
        "Clearly, it is important to be able to specify both the actual semantic relation sought and use its textual expression(s) in a controlled manner for maximal benefit.",
        "The objective of our research is to combine the strengths of the two approaches, and, in addition, to provide even richer information by automatically mapping each harvested argument to its su-pertype(s) (i.e., its semantic concepts).",
        "For instance, given the relation destination and the pattern X flies to Y, automatically determining that John, Prague) and (John, conference) are two valid filler instance pairs, that (RyanAir, Prague) is another, as well as that person and airline are supertypes of the first argument and city and event of the second.",
        "This information provides the selectional restrictions of the given semantic relation, indicating that living things like people can fly to cities and events, while non-living things like airlines fly mainly to cities.",
        "This is a significant improvement over systems that output a flat list of lexical semantic knowledge (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Yates et al., 2007; Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Knowing the sectional restrictions of a semantic relation supports inference in many applications, for example enabling more accurate information extraction.",
        "(Igo and Riloff, 2009) report that patterns like \"attack on (NP)\" can learn undesirable words due to idiomatic expressions and parsing errors.",
        "Over time this becomes problematic for the bootstrapping process and leads to significant deterioration in performance.",
        "(Thelen and Riloff, 2002) address this problem by learning multiple semantic categories simultaneously, relying on the often unrealistic assumption that a word cannot belong to more than one semantic category.",
        "However, if we have at our disposal a repository of semantic relations with their selectional restrictions, the problem addressed in (Igo and Riloff, 2009) can be alleviated.",
        "In order to obtain selectional restriction classes, (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006) made an attempt to ontologize the harvested arguments of is-a, part-of, and cause relations.",
        "They mapped each argument of the relation into WordNet and identified the senses for which the relation holds.",
        "Unfortunately, despite its very high precision entries, WordNet is known to have limited coverage, which makes it impossible for algorithms to map the content of a relation whose arguments are not present in WordNet.",
        "To surmount this limitation, we do not use WordNet, but employ a different method of obtaining superclasses of a filler term: the inverse doubly-anchored patterns DAP-1 (Hovy et al., 2009), which, given two arguments, harvests its supertypes from the source corpus.",
        "(Hovy et al., 2009) show that DAP-1 is reliable and it enriches WordNet with additional hyponyms and hypernyms."

        "A singly-anchored pattern contains one example of the seed term (the anchor) and one open position for the term to be learned.",
        "Most researchers use singly-anchored patterns to harvest semantic relations.",
        "Unfortunately, these patterns run out of steam very quickly.",
        "To surmount this obstacle, a handful of seeds is generally used, and helps to guarantee diversity in the extraction of new lexico-syntactic patterns (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Snow et al., 2005; Etzioni et al., 2005).",
        "Some algorithms require ten seeds (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Igo and Riloff, 2009), while others use a variation of 5, 10, to even 25 seeds (Taluk-dar et al., 2008).",
        "Seeds may be chosen at random (Davidov et al., 2007; Kozareva et al., 2008), by picking the most frequent terms of the desired class (Igo and Riloff, 2009), or by asking humans (Pantel et al., 2009).",
        "As (Pantel et al., 2009) show, picking seeds that yield high numbers of different terms is difficult.",
        "Thus, when dealing with unbounded sets of relations (Banko and Etzioni, 2008), providing many seeds becomes unrealistic.",
        "Interestingly, recent work reports a class of patterns that use only one seed to learn as much information with only one seed.",
        "(Kozareva et al., 2008; Hovy et al., 2009) introduce the so-called doublyanchored pattern (DAP) that has two anchor seed positions \"(type) such as (seed) and *\", plus one open position for the terms to be learned.",
        "Learned terms can then be replaced into the seed position automatically, creating a recursive procedure that is reportedly much more accurate and has much higher final yield.",
        "(Kozareva et al., 2008; Hovy et al., 2009) have successfully applied DAP for the learning of hyponyms and hypernyms of is-a relations and report improvements over (Etzioni et al., 2005) and (Paşca, 2004).",
        "Surprisingly, this work was limited to the semantic relation is-a.",
        "No other study has described the use or effect of recursive patterns for different semantic relations.",
        "Therefore, going beyond (Kozareva et al., 2008; Hovy et al., 2009), we here introduce recursive patterns other than DAP that use only one seed to harvest the arguments and supertypes of a wide variety of relations.",
        "(Banko and Etzioni, 2008) show that semantic relations can be expressed using a handful of relation-independent lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "Practically, we can turn any of these patterns into recursive form by giving as input only one of the arguments and leaving the other one as an open slot, allowing the learned arguments to replace the initial seed argument directly.",
        "For example, for the relation \"fly to\", the following recursive patterns can be built: \"* and (seed) fly to *\", \"(seed) and * fly to *\", \"* fly to (seed) and *\", \"* fly to * and (seed)\", \"(seed) fly to *\" or \"* fly to (seed)\", where ( seed) is an example like John or Ryanair, and (*) indicates the position on which the arguments are learned.",
        "Conjunctions like and, or are useful because they express list constructions and extract arguments similar to the seed.",
        "Potentially, one can explore all recursive pattern variations when learning a relation and compare their yield, however this study is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "We are particularly interested in the usage of recursive patterns for the learning of semantic relations not only because it is a novel method, but also because recursive patterns of the DAP fashion are known to: (1) learn concepts with high precision compared to singly-anchored patterns (Kozareva et al., 2008), (2) use only one seed instance for the discovery of new previously unknown terms, and (3) harvest knowledge with minimal supervision."

        "Initially, we decided to conduct an automatic evaluation comparing our results to knowledge bases that have been extracted in a similar way (i.e., through pattern application over unstructured text).",
        "However, it is not always possible to perform a complete comparison, because either researchers have not fully explored the same relations we have studied, or for those relations that overlap, the gold standard data was not available.",
        "The online demo of TextRunner (Yates et al., 2007) actually allowed us to collect the arguments for all our semantic relations.",
        "However, due to Web based query limitations, TextRunner returns only the first 1000 snippets.",
        "Since we do not have the complete and ranked output of TextRunner, comparing results in terms of recall and precision is impossible.",
        "Turning instead to results obtained from structured sources (which one expects to have high correctness), we found that two of our relations overlap with those of the freely available ontology Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007), which was harvested from the Infoboxes tables in Wikipedia.",
        "In addition, we also had two human annotators judge as many results as we could afford, to obtain Precision.",
        "We conducted two evaluations, one for the arguments and one for the supertypes.",
        "In this section, we discuss the results of the harvested arguments.",
        "For each relation, we selected the top 200 highly ranked arguments.",
        "We hired two annotators to judge their correctness.",
        "We created detailed annotation guidelines that define the labels for the arguments of the relations, as shown in Table 2.",
        "(Previously, for the same task, researchers have not conducted such an exhaustive and detailed human-based evaluation.)",
        "The annotation was conducted using the CAT system.",
        "Table 2: Annotation Labels.",
        "We allow multiple labels to be assigned to the same concept, because sometimes the concept can appear in different contexts that carry various conceptual representations.",
        "Although the labels can be easily collapsed to judge correct and incorrect terms, the fine-grained annotation shown here provides a better overview of the information learned by our algorithm.",
        "We measured the inter-annotator agreement for all labels and relations considering that a single entry can be tagged with multiple labels.",
        "The Kappa score is around 0.80.",
        "This judgement is good enough to warrant using these human judgements to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm.",
        "We compute Accuracy as the number of examples tagged as Correct divided by the total number of examples.",
        "Table 4 shows the obtained results.",
        "The overall accuracy of the argument harvesting phase is 91%.",
        "The majority of the occurred errors are due to part-of-speech tagging.",

        "We propose a minimally supervised algorithm that uses only one seed example and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn in bootstrapping fashion the selectional restrictions of a large class of semantic relations.",
        "The principal contribution of the paper is to demonstrate that this kind of pattern can be applied to almost any kind of semantic relation, as long as it is expressible in a concise surface pattern, and that the recursive mechanism that allows each newly acquired term to restart harvesting automatically is a significant advance over patterns that require a handful of seeds to initiate the learning process.",
        "It also shows how one can combine free-form but undirected pattern-learning approaches like TextRun-ner with more-controlled but effort-intensive approaches like commonly used.",
        "In our evaluation, we show that our algorithm is capable of extracting high quality non-trivial information from unstructured text given very restricted input (one seed).",
        "To measure the performance of our approach, we use various semantic relations expressed with three lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "For two of the relations, we compare results with the freely available ontology Yago, and conduct a manual evaluation of the harvested terms.",
        "We will release the annotated and the harvested data to the public to be used for comparison by other knowledge harvesting algorithms.",
        "The success of the proposed framework opens many challenging directions.",
        "We plan to use the algorithm described in this paper to learn the selectional restrictions of numerous other relations, in order to build a rich knowledge repository that can support a variety of applications, including textual entailment, information extraction, and question answering.",
