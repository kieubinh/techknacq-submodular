        "Knowledge lies at the core of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), the task of computationally identifying the meanings of words in context (Navigli, 2009b).",
        "In the recent years, two main approaches have been studied that rely on a fixed sense inventory, i.e., supervised and knowledge-based methods.",
        "In order to achieve high performance, supervised approaches require large training sets where instances (target words in context) are hand-annotated with the most appropriate word senses.",
        "Producing this kind of knowledge is extremely costly: at a throughput of one sense annotation per minute (Edmonds, 2000) and tagging one thousand examples per word, dozens of person-years would be required for enabling a supervised classifier to disambiguate all the words in the English lexicon with high accuracy.",
        "In contrast, knowledge-based approaches exploit the information contained in wide-coverage lexical resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "However, it has been demonstrated that the amount of lexical and semantic information contained in such resources is typically insufficient for high-performance WSD (Cuadros and Rigau, 2006).",
        "Several methods have been proposed to automatically extend existing resources (cf.",
        "Section 2) and it has been shown that highly-interconnected semantic networks have a great impact on WSD (Navigli and Lapata, 2010).",
        "However, to date, the real potential of knowledge-rich WSD systems has been shown only in the presence of either a large manually-developed extension of WordNet (Navigli and Velardi, 2005) or sophisticated WSD algorithms (Agirre et al., 2009).",
        "The contributions of this paper are two-fold.",
        "First, we relieve the knowledge acquisition bottleneck by developing a methodology to extend WordNet with millions of semantic relations.",
        "The relations are harvested from an encyclopedic resource, namely Wikipedia.",
        "Wikipedia pages are automatically associated with WordNet senses, and topical, semantic associative relations from Wikipedia are transferred to WordNet, thus producing a much richer lexical resource.",
        "Second, two simple knowledge-based algorithms that exploit our extended WordNet are applied to standard WSD datasets.",
        "The results show that the integration of vast amounts of semantic relations in knowledge-based systems yields performance competitive with state-of-the-art supervised approaches on open-text WSD.",
        "In addition, we support previous findings from Agirre et al.",
        "(2009) that in a domain-specific WSD scenario knowledge-based systems perform better than supervised ones, and we show that, given enough knowledge, simple algorithms perform better than more sophisticated ones."

      "text": [
        "In the last three decades, a large body of work has been presented that concerns the development of automatic methods for the enrichment of existing resources such as WordNet.",
        "These include proposals to extract semantic information from dictionaries (e.g. Chodorow et al.",
        "(1985) and Rigau et al.",
        "(1998)), approaches using lexico-syntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992; Cimiano et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2006), heuristic methods based on lexical and semantic regularities (Harabagiu et al., 1999), taxonomy-based ontologization (Pen-nacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; Snow et al., 2006).",
        "Other approaches include the extraction ofseman-tic preferences from sense-annotated (Agirre and Martinez, 2001) and raw corpora (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003), as well as the disambiguation of dictionary glosses based on cyclic graph patterns (Navigli, 2009a).",
        "Other works rely on the disambiguation of collocations, either obtained from specialized learner's dictionaries (Navigli and Ve-lardi, 2005) or extracted by means of statistical techniques (Cuadros and Rigau, 2008), e.g. based on the method proposed by Agirre and de Lacalle (2004).",
        "But while most of these methods represent state-of-the-art proposals for enriching lexical and taxonomic resources, none concentrates on augmenting WordNet with associative semantic relations for many domains on a very large scale.",
        "To overcome this limitation, we exploit Wikipedia, a collaboratively generated Web encyclopedia.",
        "The use of collaborative contributions from volunteers has been previously shown to be beneficial in the Open Mind Word Expert project (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002).",
        "However, its current status indicates that the project remains a mainly academic attempt.",
        "In contrast, due to its low entrance barrier and vast user base, Wikipedia provides large amounts of information at practically no cost.",
        "Previous work aimed at transforming its content into a knowledge base includes open-domain relation extraction (Wu and Weld, 2007), the acquisition of taxonomic (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007a; Suchanek et al., 2008; Wu and Weld, 2008) and other semantic relations (Nastase and Strube, 2008), as well as lexical reference rules (Shnarch et al., 2009).",
        "Applications using the knowledge contained in Wikipedia include, among others, text categorization (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2006), computing semantic similarity of texts (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007; Ponzetto and erence resolution (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007b), multi-document summarization (Nastase, 2008), and text generation (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009).",
        "In our work we follow this line of research and show that knowledge harvested from Wikipedia can be used effectively to improve the performance of a WSD system.",
        "Our proposal builds on previous insights from Bunescu and Pa§ca (2006) and Mihalcea (2007) that pages in Wikipedia can be taken as word senses.",
        "Mihalcea (2007) manually maps Wikipedia pages to WordNet senses to perform lexical-sample WSD.",
        "We extend her proposal in three important ways: (1) we fully automatize the mapping between Wikipedia pages and WordNet senses; (2) we use the mappings to enrich an existing resource, i.e. WordNet, rather than annotating text with sense labels; (3) we deploy the knowledge encoded by this mapping to perform unrestricted WSD, rather than apply it to a lexical sample setting.",
        "Knowledge from Wikipedia is injected into a WSD system by means of a mapping to WordNet.",
        "Previous efforts aimed at automatically linking Wikipedia to WordNet include full use of the first WordNet sense heuristic (Suchanek et al., 2008), a graph-based mapping of Wikipedia categories to WordNet synsets (Ponzetto and Nav-igli, 2009), a model based on vector spaces (Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005) and a supervised approach using keyword extraction (Reiter et al., 2008).",
        "These latter methods rely only on text overlap techniques and neither they take advantage of the input from Wikipedia being semi-structured, e.g. hyperlinked, nor they propose a high-performing probabilistic formulation of the mapping problem, a task to which we turn in the next section."

        "The title of a Wikipage (e.g.",
        "Soda (soft drink)) is composed of the lemma of the concept defined (e.g. soda) plus an optional label in parentheses which specifies its meaning in case the lemma is ambiguous (e.g. SOFT DRINK vs.",
        "SODIUM CARBONATE).",
        "Finally, some Wikipages are redirections to other pages, e.g.",
        "SODA (SODIUM CARBONATE) redirects to SODIUM CARBONATE.",

        "In order to establish a mapping between the two resources, we first identify different kinds of disambiguation contexts for Wikipages (Section 3.2.1) and WordNet senses (Section 3.2.2).",
        "Next, we intersect these contexts to perform the mapping (see Section 3.2.3).",
        "Given a target Wikipage w which we aim to map to a WordNet sense of w, we use the following information as a disambiguation context:",
        "• Sense labels: e.g. given the page Soda (soft drink), the words soft and drink are added to the disambiguation context.",
        "• Links: the titles' lemmas of the pages linked from the Wikipage w (outgoing links).",
        "For instance, the links in the Wikipage SODA (SOFT drink) include soda, lemonade, sugar, etc.",
        "• Categories: Wikipages are classified according to one or more categories, which represent meta-information used to categorize them.",
        "For instance, the Wikipage SODA (SOFT DRINK) is categorized as SOFT DRINKS.",
        "Since many categories are very specific and do not appear in WordNet (e.g., SWEDISH WRITERS or SCIENTISTS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE), we use the lemmas of their syntactic heads as disambiguation context (i.e. writer and scientist).",
        "To this end, we use the category heads provided by Ponzetto and Navigli (2009).",
        "Given a Wikipage w, we define its disambiguation context Ctx(w) as the set of words obtained from some or all of the three sources above.",
        "Given a WordNet sense s and its synset S, we use the following information as disambiguation context to provide evidence for a potential link in our mapping",
        "• Synonymy: all synonyms of s in synset S. For instance, given the synset of soda;;, all its synonyms are included in the context (that is, tonic, soda pop, pop, etc.",
        ").",
        "• Hypernymy/Hyponymy: all synonyms in the synsets H such that H is either a hypernym (i.e., a generalization) or a hyponym (i.e., a specialization) of S. For example, given soda;;, we include the words from its hypernym { soft drink; }.",
        "• Sisterhood: words from the sisters of S. A sister synset S' is such that S and S' have a common direct hypernym.",

        "First, we check whether a redirection exists to Soda (soft drink) that was previously disambiguated (lines 8-10).",
        "Next, we construct the disambiguation context for the Wikipage by including words from its label, links and categories (cf.",
        "Section 3.2.1).",
        "The context includes, among others, the following words: soft, drink, cola, sugar.",
        "We now construct the disambiguation context for the two WordNet senses of soda (cf.",
        "Section 3.2.2), namely the sodium carbonate (#1) and the drink (#2) senses.",
        "To do so, we include words from their synsets, hypernyms, hyponyms, sisters, and glosses.",
        "The context for soda; includes: salt, acetate, chlorate, benzoate.",
        "The context for soda;; contains instead: soft, drink, cola, bitter, etc.",

        "Our insight is to use this alignment to enable the transfer of semantic relations from Wikipedia to Word-Net.",
        "In fact, given a Wikipage w we can collect all Wikipedia links occurring in that page.",
        "For any such link from w to w', if the two Wikipages are mapped to WordNet senses (i.e., /(w) = e and /( w') = e), we can transfer the corresponding edge (/(w), /(w')) to WordNet.",
        "Note that /(w) and /( w') are noun senses, as Wikipages describe nominal concepts or named entities.",

        "Assuming /(Soda (soda drink)) = soda;; and /(Syrup) = syrup;, we can add the corresponding semantic relation (soda;;, syrup^) to WordNet.",
        "Thus, WordNet++ represents an extension of WordNet which includes semantic associative relations between synsets.",
        "These are originally found in Wikipedia and then integrated into WordNet by means of our mapping.",
        "In turn, Word-Net++ represents the English-only subset of a larger multilingual resource, BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), where lexicalizations of the synsets are harvested for many languages using the so-called Wikipedia inter-language links and applying a machine translation system."

        "The average polysemy is 1.3 and 2.5 for WordNet senses and Wikipages, respectively (2.8 and 4.7 when excluding monosemous words).",

        "Due to the limited context provided by the WordNet glosses, we follow Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) and expand the gloss of each sense s to include words from the glosses of those synsets in a semantic relation with s. These include all WordNet synsets which are directly connected to s, either by means of the semantic pointers found in WordNet or through the unlabeled links found in WordNet++.",

        "In this paper, we have presented a large-scale method for the automatic enrichment of a computational lexicon with encyclopedic relational knowledge.",
        "Our experiments show that the large amount of knowledge injected into WordNet is of high quality and, more importantly, it enables simple knowledge-based WSD systems to perform as well as the highest-performing supervised ones in a coarse-grained setting and to outperform them on domain-specific text.",
        "Thus, our results go one step beyond previous findings (Cuadros and Rigau, 2006; Agirre et al., 2009; Navigli and La-pata, 2010) and prove that knowledge-rich disambiguation is a competitive alternative to supervised systems, even when relying on a simple algorithm.",
        "We note, however, that the present contribution does not show which knowledge-rich algorithm performs best with WordNet++.",
        "In fact, more sophisticated approaches, such as Personalized PageRank (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), could be still applied to yield even higher performance.",
        "We leave such exploration to future work.",
        "Moreover, while the mapping has been used to enrich WordNet with a large amount of semantic edges, the method can be reversed and applied to the encyclopedic resource itself, that is Wikipedia, to perform disambiguation with the corresponding sense inventory (cf. the task of wikification proposed by Mihalcea and Csomai (2007) and Milne and Witten (2008b)).",
        "In this paper, we focused on English Word Sense Disambiguation.",
        "However, since WordNet++ is part of a multilingual semantic network (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), we plan to explore the impact of this knowledge in a multilingual setting."
