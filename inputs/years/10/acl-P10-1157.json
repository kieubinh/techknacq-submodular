        "A second line of research has focused on introducing statistics at the generation decision level, by training models that find the set of generation parameters maximising an objective function, e.g. producing a target linguistic style (Paiva and Evans, 2005; Mairesse and Walker, 2008), generating the most likely context-free derivations given a corpus (Belz, 2008), or maximising the expected reward using reinforcement learning (Rieser and Lemon, 2009).",
        "While such methods do not suffer from the computational cost of an overgeneration phase, they still require a handcrafted generator to define the generation decision space within which statistics can be used to find an optimal solution.",
        "This paper presents BAGEL (Bayesian networks for generation using active learning), an NLG system that can be fully trained from aligned data.",
        "While the main requirement of the generator is to produce natural utterances within a dialogue system domain, a second objective is to minimise the overall development effort.",
        "In this regard, a major advantage of data-driven methods is the shift of the effort from model design and implementation to data annotation.",
        "In the case of NLG systems, learning to produce paraphrases can be facilitated by collecting data from a large sample of annotators.",
        "Our meaning representation should therefore (a) be intuitive enough to be understood by untrained annotators, and (b) provide useful generalisation properties for generating unseen inputs.",
        "Section 2 describes Bagel's meaning representation, which satisfies both requirements.",
        "Section 3 then details how our meaning representation is mapped to a phrase sequence, using a dynamic Bayesian network with backoff smoothing.",
        "Within a given domain, the same semantic concept can occur in different utterances.",

        "A stack representation provides useful generalisation properties (see Section 3.1), while the resulting stack sequences are relatively easy to align (see Section 5.1).",
        "In the context of dialogue systems, Table 1 illustrates how the input dialogue act is first mapped to a set of stacks of semantic concepts, and then aligned with a word sequence.",
        "The bottom concept in the stack will typically be a dialogue act type, e.g. an utterance providing information about the object under discussion (inform) or specifying that the request of the user cannot be met (reject).",
        "Other concepts include attributes of that object (e.g., food, area), values for those attributes (e.g., Chinese, riverside), as well as special symbols for negating underlying concepts (e.g., not) or specifying that they are irrelevant (e.g., dontcare).",
        "The generator's goal is thus finding the most likely realisation given an unordered set of mandatory semantic stacks Sm derived from the input dialogue act.",
        "For example, s =inform(area(centre)) is a mandatory stack associated with the dialogue act in Table 1 (frame 8).",
        "While mandatory stacks must all be conveyed in the output realisation, Sm does not contain the optional intermediary stacks Sj that can refer to (a) general attributes of the object under discussion (e.g., inform(area) in Table 1), or (b) to concepts that are not in the input at all, which are associated with the singleton stack inform (e.g., phrases expressing the dialogue act type, or clause aggregation operations).",
        "For example, the stack sequence in Table 1 contains 3 intermediary stacks for t = 2, 5 and 7.",

        "While most previous work on trainable NLG relies on a handcrafted component (see Section 1), recent research has started exploring fully data-driven NLG models.",
        "Factored language models have recently been used for surface realisation within the OpenCCG framework (White et al., 2007; Espinosa et al., 2008).",
        "More generally, chart generators for different grammatical formalisms have been trained from syntactic treebanks (White et al., 2007; Nakanishi et al., 2005), as well as from semantically-annotated treebanks (Varges and Mellish, 2001).",
        "However, a major difference with our approach is that Bagel uses domain-specific data to generate a surface form directly from semantic concepts, without any syntactic annotation (see Section 7 for further discussion).",
        "This work is strongly related to Wong and Mooney's Wasp-1 generation system (2007), which combines a language model with an inverted synchronous CFG parsing model, effectively casting the generation task as a translation problem from a meaning representation to natural language.",
        "Wasp-1 relies on Giza++ to align utterances with derivations of the meaning representation (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Although early experiments showed that Giza++ did not perform well on our data – possibly because of the coarse granularity of our semantic representation – future work should evaluate the generalisation performance of synchronous CFGs in a dialogue system domain.",
        "Although we do not know of any work on active learning for NLG, previous work has used active learning for semantic parsing and information extraction (Thompson et al., 1999; Tang et al., 2002) , spoken language understanding (Tur et al., 2003) , speech recognition (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2002), word alignment (Sassano, 2002), and more recently for statistical machine translation (Blood-good and Callison-Burch, 2010).",
        "While certainty-based methods have been widely used, future work should investigate the performance of committee-based active learning for NLG, in which examples are selected based on the level of disagreement between models trained on subsets of the data (Freund et al., 1997)."

        "This paper presents and evaluates Bagel, a statistical language generator that can be trained entirely from data, with no handcrafting required beyond the semantic annotation.",
        "All the required subtasks – i.e.",
        "content ordering, aggregation, lexical selection and realisation – are learned from data using a unified model.",
        "To train Bagel in a dialogue system domain, we propose a stack-based semantic representation at the phrase level, which is expressive enough to generate natural utterances from unseen inputs, yet simple enough for data to be collected from 42 untrained annotators with a minimal normalisation step.",
        "A human evaluation over 202 dialogue acts does not show any difference in naturalness and informativeness between Bagel's outputs and human utterances.",
        "Additionally, we find that the data collection process can be optimised using active learning, resulting in a significant increase in performance when training data is limited, according to ratings from 18 human judges.",
        "These results suggest that the proposed framework can largely reduce the development time of NLG systems.",
        "While this paper only evaluates the most likely realisation given a dialogue act, we believe that Bagel's probabilistic nature and generalisation capabilities are well suited to model the linguistic variation resulting from the diversity ofannota-tors.",
        "Our first objective is thus to evaluate the quality of Bagel's n-best outputs, and test whether sampling from the output distribution can improve naturalness and user satisfaction within a dialogue.",
        "Our results suggest that explicitly modelling syntax is not necessary for our domain, possibly because of the lack of syntactic complexity compared with formal written language.",
        "Nevertheless, future work should investigate whether syntactic information can improve performance in more complex domains.",
        "For example, the realisation phrase can easily be conditioned on syntactic constructs governing that phrase, and the recursive nature of syntax can be modelled by keeping track of the depth of the current embedded clause.",
        "While syntactic information can be included with no human effort by using syntactic parsers, their robustness to dialogue system utterances must first be evaluated.",
        "Finally, recent years have seen HMM-based synthesis models become competitive with unit selection methods (Tokuda et al., 2000).",
        "Our long term objective is to take advantage of those advances to jointly optimise the language generation and the speech synthesis process, by combining both components into a unified probabilistic concept-to-speech generation model."
