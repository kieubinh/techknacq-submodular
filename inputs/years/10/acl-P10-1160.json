        "These studies have demonstrated the maturity of SRL within an evaluation setting that restricts the argument search space to the sentence containing the predicate of interest.",

        "For example, the sale predicate was associated with the highest number of true implicit arguments, but only 80% of those could be resolved within the two-sentence candidate window.",
        "Empirically, we found that extending the candidate window uniformly for all predicates did not increase performance on the development data.",
        "The oracle results suggest that predicate-specific window settings might offer some advantage.",
        "In Section 4.2, we discussed the price predicate, which frequently occurs in the \"[p price] index\" collocation.",
        "We observed that this collocation is rarely associated with either an overt argo or an implicit iarg0.",
        "Similar observations can be made for the investment and fund predicates.",
        "Although these two predicates are frequent, they are rarely associated with implicit arguments: investment takes only eight implicit arguments across its 21 instances, and fund takes only six implicit arguments across its 43 instances.",
        "This behavior is due in large part to collocations such as \"[p investment] banker\", \"stock [p fund]\", and \"mutual [ p fund]\", which use predicate senses that are not eventive.",
        "Such collocations also violate our assumption that differences between the PropBank and NomBank argument structure for a predicate are indicative of implicit arguments (see Section 3.1 for this assumption).",
        "Despite their lack of implicit arguments, it is important to account for predicates such as investment and fund because incorrect prediction of implicit arguments for them can lower precision.",
        "This is precisely what happened for the fund predicate, where the model incorrectly identified many implicit arguments for \"stock [p fund]\" and \"mutual [p fund]\".",
        "The left context offund should help the model avoid this type of error; however, our feature selection process did not identify any overall gains from including this information.",
        "The baseline heuristic covers the simple case where identical predicates share arguments in the same position.",
        "Thus, it is interesting to examine cases where the baseline heuristic failed but the discriminative model succeeded.",
        "Consider the following sentence:",
        "(12) Mr. Rogers recommends that [p investors] sell [iarg2 takeover-related stock].",
        "Neither NomBank nor the baseline heuristic associate the marked predicate in Example 12 with any arguments; however, the feature-based model was able to correctly identify the marked iarg2 as the entity being invested in.",
        "This inference captured a tendency of investors to sell the things they have invested in.",
        "We conclude our discussion with an example of an extra-sentential implicit argument:",
        "(13) [iarg0 Olivetti] has denied that it violated the rules, asserting that the shipments were properly licensed.",
        "However, the legality of these [p sales] is still an open question.",
        "As shown in Example 13, the system was able to correctly identify Olivetti as the agent in the selling event of the second sentence.",
        "This inference involved two key steps.",
        "First, the system identified coreferent mentions of Olivetti that participated in exporting and supplying events (not shown).",
        "Second, the system identified a tendency for exporters and suppliers to also be sellers.",
        "Using this knowledge, the system extracted information that could not be extracted by the baseline heuristic or a traditional SRL system."

        "Current SRL approaches limit the search for arguments to the sentence containing the predicate of interest.",
        "Many systems take this assumption a step further and restrict the search to the predicate's local syntactic environment; however, predicates and the sentences that contain them rarely exist in isolation.",
        "As shown throughout this paper, they are usually embedded in a coherent and semantically rich discourse that must be taken into account.",
        "We have presented a preliminary study of implicit arguments for nominal predicates that focused specifically on this problem.",
        "Our contribution is three-fold.",
        "First, we have created gold-standard implicit argument annotations for a small set of pervasive nominal predicates.",
        "Our analysis shows that these annotations add 65% to the role coverage of NomBank.",
        "Second, we have demonstrated the feasibility of recovering implicit arguments for many of the predicates, thus establishing a baseline for future work on this emerging task.",
        "Third, our study suggests a few ways in which this research can be moved forward.",
        "As shown in Section 6, many errors were caused by the absence of true implicit arguments within the set of candidate constituents.",
        "More intelligent windowing strategies in addition to alternate candidate sources might offer some improvement.",
        "Although we consistently observed development gains from using automatic coref-erence resolution, this process creates errors that need to be studied more closely.",
        "It will also be important to study implicit argument patterns of non-verbal predicates such as the partitive percent.",
        "These predicates are among the most frequent in the TreeBank and are likely to require approaches that differ from the ones we pursued.",
        "Finally, any extension of this work is likely to encounter a significant knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "Implicit argument annotation is difficult because it requires both argument and coreference identification (the data produced by Ruppenhofer et al.",
        "(2009) is similar).",
        "Thus, it might be productive to focus future work on (1) the extraction of relevant knowledge from existing resources (e.g., our use of coreference patterns from Gigaword) or (2) semi-supervised learning of implicit argument models from a combination of labeled and unla-beled data."
