        "In speech translation, by using lattices that represent not only 1-best result but also other possibilities of speech recognition, we can take into account the ambiguities of speech recognition.",
        "Thus, the translation quality for lattice inputs is better than the quality for 1-best inputs.",
        "In this paper, we show that lattice decoding is also useful for handling input variations.",
        "\"Input variations\" refers to the differences of input texts with the same meaning.",
        "For example, \"Is there a beauty salon?\"",
        "and \"Is there a beauty parlor?\"",
        "have the same meaning with variations in \"beauty salon\" and \"beauty parlor\" .",
        "Since these variations are frequently found in natural language texts, a mismatch of the expressions in source sentences and the expressions in training corpus leads to a decrease in translation quality.",
        "Therefore, we propose a novel method that can handle input variations using paraphrases and lattice decoding.",
        "In the proposed method, we regard a given source sentence as one ofmany variations (1-best).",
        "Given an input sentence, we build a paraphrase lattice which represents paraphrases of the input sentence.",
        "Then, we give the paraphrase lattice as an input to the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Moses selects the best path for decoding.",
        "By using paraphrases of source sentences, we can translate expressions which are not found in a training corpus on the condition that paraphrases of them are found in the training corpus.",
        "Moreover, by using lattice decoding, we can employ the source-side language model as a decoding feature.",
        "Since this feature is affected by the source-side context, the decoder can choose a proper paraphrase and translate correctly.",

        "The proposed method is described in Section 3.",
