        "Improper rule selections may result in poor translations.",
        "There is some related work about the hierarchical rule selection.",
        "In the original work (Chiang, 2005), the target-side rule selection is analogous to the model in traditional phrase-based SMT system such as Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Extending this work, (He et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008) integrate rich context information of non-terminals to predict the target-side rule selection.",
        "Different from the above work where the probability distribution of source-side rule selection is uniform, (Setiawan et al., 2009) proposes to select source-side rules based on the captured function words which often play an important role in word reordering.",
        "There is also some work considering to involve more rich contexts to guide the source-side rule selection.",

        "Following (Chiang, 2005), (a, 7) is used to represent a synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) rule extracted from the training corpus, where a and 7 are the source-side and target-side rule respectively.",
        "Let C be the context of (a, 7).",
        "Formally, our joint probability model of hierarchical rule selection is described as follows:",
        "We decompose the joint probability model into two sub-models based on the Bayes formulation, where the first sub-model is source-side rule selection model and the second one is the target-side rule selection model.",
        "For the source-side rule selection model, we further compute it by the interpolation of two submodels:",
        "where Ps (a) is the context-free source model (CFSM) and Ps(a|C) is the context-based source model (CBSM), 6 is the interpolation weight that can be optimized over the development data.",
        "CFSM is the probability of source-side rule selection that can be estimated based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method:",
        "where the numerator is the total count of bilingual rule pairs with the same source-side rule that are extracted based on the extraction algorithm in (Chiang, 2005), and the denominator is the total amount of source-side rule patterns contained in the monolingual source side of the training corpus.",
        "CFSM is used to capture how likely the source-side rule is linguistically motivated or has the corresponding target-side counterpart.",
        "For CBSM, it can be naturally viewed as a classification problem where each distinct source-side rule is a single class.",
        "However, considering the huge number of classes may cause serious data sparseness problem and thereby degrade the classification accuracy, we approximate CBSM by a binary classification problem which can be solved by the maximum entropy (ME) approach (Berger et al., 1996) as follows:",
        "where u G {0,1} is the indicator whether the source-side rule is applied during decoding, u = 1 when the source-side rule is applied, otherwise u = 0; hi is a feature function, Ai is the weight of hi.",
        "CBSM estimates the probability of the source-side rule being selected according to the rich context information coming from the surface strings and sub-phrases that will be reduced to non-terminals during decoding.",
        "Analogously, we decompose the target-side rule selection model by the interpolation approach as well:",
        "where Pt (7) is the context-free target model (CFTM) and Pt(7\\a, C) is the context-based target model (CBTM), is the interpolation weight that can be optimized over the development data.",
        "In the similar way, we compute CFTM by the MLE approach and estimate CBTM by the ME approach.",

        "This section explains how the training instances are constructed for the training of CBSM and CBTM.",
        "Let s and t be the source sentence and target sentence, W be the word alignment between them, rs be a source-side rule that pattern-matches a sub-phrase of s, rt be the target-side rule pattern-matching a sub-phrase of t and being aligned to rsbased on W, and C(r) be the context features related to the rule r which will be explained in the following section.",
        "For the training of CBSM, if the SCFG rule",
        "(rs, rt) can be extracted based on the rule extraction algorithm in (Chiang, 2005), (u = 1, C(rs)) is constructed as a positive instance, otherwise ( u = 0, C( rs ) ) is constructed as a negative instance.",
        "For example in Figure 1(a), the context of source-side rule \"X1 hezuo\" that pattern-matches the phrase \"youhao hezuo\" produces a positive instance, while the context of \"Xi youhao\" that pattern-matches the source phrase \"de youhao\" or \"shuangfang de youhao\" will produce a negative instance as there are no corresponding plausible target-side rules that can be extracted legally.",
        "For the training of CBTM, given rs, suppose there is a SCFGrule set {(rs,rtfc)\\1 < k < n} extracted from multiple distinct sentence pairs in the bilingual training corpus, among which we assume (rs,r\\) is extracted from the sentence pair (s,t).",
        "Then, we construct (u = 1,C(rs),C(r\\)) as a positive instance, while the elements in {(u = 0, C(rs),C(rj= i A 1 < j < n} are viewed as negative instances since they fail to be applied to the translation from s to t. For example in Figure 1(c), Rule (1) and Rule (2) are two different SCFG rules extracted from Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) respectively, where their source-side rules are the same.",
        "As Rule (1) cannot be applied to Figure 1(b) for the translation and Rule (2) cannot be applied to Figure 1(a) for the translation either, (u = 1,C(ras),C(rt)) and (u = 1,C(rb),C(rb)) are constructed as positive instances while (u = 0,C(rs),C(rbt)) and (u = 0,C(r^),C(rts)) are viewed as negative instances.",
        "It is noticed that this instance construction method may lead to a large quantity of negative instances and choke the training procedure.",
        "In practice, to limit the size of the training set, the negative instances constructed based on low-frequency target-side rules are pruned.",
        "ME approach has the merit of easily combining different features to predict the probability of each class.",
        "We incorporate into the ME based model the following informative context-based features to train CBSM and CBTM.",
        "These features are carefully designed to reduce the data sparseness problem and some of them are inspired by previous work (He et al., 2008; Gimpel and Smith, 2008; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Chiang et al.,",

        "Apparently, our method also performs better than the other two approaches, indicating that our method is more effective in the hierarchical rule selection as both source-side and target-side rules are selected together.",
        "Due to the space limitation, we analyze the effect of sub-models upon the system performance, rather than that of ME features, part of which have been investigated in previous related work.",
        "As shown in Table 2, when sub-models are integrated as independent features, the performance is improved compared to the baseline, which shows that each of the sub-models can improve the hierarchical rule selection.",
