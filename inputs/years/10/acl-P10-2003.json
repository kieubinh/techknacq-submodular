        "Given a phrase pair bp = (ei, f a.",
        "), where ai defines that the source phrase f ai is aligned to the target phrase ei, the traditional lexicalized reordering model computes the reordering count of bp in the orientation o based on the word alignments of boundary words.",
        "Specifically, the model collects bilingual phrases and distinguishes their orientations with respect to the previous bilingual phrase into three categories:",
        "Using the relative-frequency approach, the reordering probability regarding bp is",
        "p{o\\bP) = Countjo, bp) ^ Y^cs Counted, bp)",
        "For a parallel sentence pair, its reordering graph indicates all possible translation derivations consisting of the extracted bilingual phrases.",
        "To construct a reordering graph, we first extract bilingual phrases using the way of (Och, 2003).",
        "Then, the adjacent bilingual phrases are linked according to the target-side order.",
        "Some bilingual phrases, which have no adjacent bilingual phrases because of maximum length limitation, are linked to the nearest bilingual phrases in the target-side order.",
        "Shown in Figure 2(b), the reordering graph for the parallel sentence pair (Figure 2(a)) can be represented as an undirected graph, where each rectangle corresponds to a phrase pair, each link is the orientation relationship between adjacent bilingual phrases, and two distinguished rectangles bs and beindicate the beginning and ending of the parallel sentence pair, respectively.",
        "With the reordering graph, we can obtain all reordering examples containing the given bilingual phrase.",
        "For example, the bilingual phrase (zhengshi huitan, formal meetings) (see Figure 2(a)), corresponding to the rectangle labeled with the source span [6,7] and the target span [4,5], is in a monotone order with one previous phrase and in a discontinuous order with two subsequent phrases (see Figure 2(b)).",
        "We estimate the reordering probabilities from reordering graphs.",
        "Given a parallel sentence pair, there are many translation derivations corresponding to different paths in its reordering graph.",
        "Assuming all derivations have a uniform probability, the fractional counts of bilingual phrases for orientations can be calculated by utilizing an algorithm in the inside-outside fashion.",
        "Given a phrase pair bp in the reordering graph, we denote the number of paths from bs to bp with a (bp).",
        "It can be computed in an iterative way a(bp) = bpf a(bp'), where bp' is one of the previous bilingual phrases of bp and a(bs)=1.",
        "In a similar way, the number of paths from be to bp, notated as ß(bp), is simply ß(bp) = bp„ ß(bp''), where bp'' is one of the subsequent bilingual phrases of bp and ß(be)=1.",
        "Here, we show the a and ß values of all bilingual phrases of Figure 2 in Table 1.",
        "Especially, for the reordering example consisting of the bilingual phrases bp\\=(jiang juxing, will hold) and bp2=(zhengshi huitan, formal meetings), marked in the gray color in Figure 2, the a and ß values can be calculated: a(bpi) = 1, ß(bp2) = 1+1 = 2, ß(bs) = 8+1 = 9.",
        "Inspired by the parsing literature on pruning where the numerator indicates the number of paths containing the reordering example (o,bp',bp) and the denominator is the total number of paths in the reordering graph.",
        "Continuing with the reordering example described above, we obtain its fractional count using the formula (3): Count(M, bp1,bp2) = (1 x 2)/9 = 2/9.",
        "Then, the fractional count of bp in the orientation o is calculated as described below:",
        "For example, we compute the fractional count of bp2 in the monotone orientation by the formula (4): Count(M,bp2) = 2/9.",
