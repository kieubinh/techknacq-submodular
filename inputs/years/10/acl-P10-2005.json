        "Word alignment usually serves as the starting point and foundation for a statistical machine translation (SMT) system.",
        "It has received a significant amount of research over the years, notably in (Brown et al., 1993; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005; Fraser and Marcu, 2007; Hermjakob, 2009).",
        "They all focused on the improvement of word alignment models.",
        "In this work, we leverage existing aligners and generate multiple sets of word alignments based on complementary information, then combine them to get the final alignment for phrase training.",
        "The resource required for this approach is little, compared to what is needed to build a reasonable discriminative alignment model, for example.",
        "This makes the approach especially appealing for SMT on low-resource languages.",
        "Most of the research on alignment combination in the past has focused on how to combine the alignments from two different directions, source-to-target and target-to-source.",
        "Usually people start from the intersection of two sets of alignments, and gradually add links in the union based on certain heuristics, as in (Koehn et al., 2003), to achieve a better balance compared to using either intersection (high precision) or union (high recall).",
        "In (Ayan and Dorr, 2006) a maximum entropy approach was proposed to combine multiple alignments based on a set of linguistic and alignment features.",
        "A different approach was presented in (Deng and Zhou, 2009), which again concentrated on the combination of two sets of alignments, but with a different criterion.",
        "It tries to maximize the number of phrases that can be extracted in the combined alignments.",
        "A greedy search method was utilized and it achieved higher translation performance than the baseline.",
        "More recently, an alignment selection approach was proposed in (Huang, 2009), which computes confidence scores for each link and prunes the links from multiple sets of alignments using a hand-picked threshold.",
        "The alignments used in that work were generated from different aligners (HMM, block model, and maximum entropy model).",
        "In this work, we use soft voting with weighted confidence scores, where the weights can be tuned with a specific objective function.",
        "There is no need for a predetermined threshold as used in (Huang, 2009).",
        "Also, we utilize various knowledge sources to enrich the alignments instead of using different aligners.",
        "Our strategy is to diversify and then combine in order to catch any complementary information captured in the word alignments for low-resource languages.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We present three different sets of alignments i n Section 2 for an English-to-Pashto MT task.",
        "I n Section 3, we propose the alignment combination algorithm.",

        "We take an English-to-Pashto MT task as an example and create three sets of additional alignments on top of the baseline alignment.",
        "Pashto is a subject-object-verb (SOV) language, which puts verbs after objects.",
        "People have proposed different syntactic rules to pre-reorder SOV languages, either based on a constituent parse tree (Drabek and Yarowsky, 2004; Wang et al., 2007) or dependency parse tree (Xu et al., 2009).",
        "In this work, we apply syntactic reordering for verb phrases (VP) based on the English constituent parse.",
        "The VP-based reordering rule we apply in the work is:",
        "where VB * represents VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP and VBZ.",
        "In Figure 1, we show the reference alignment between an English sentence and the corresponding Pashto translation, where E is the original English sentence, P is the Pashto sentence (in romanized text), and E is the English sentence after reordering.",
        "As we can see, after the VP-based reordering, the alignment between the two sentences becomes monotone, which makes it easier for the aligner to get the alignment correct.",
        "During the reordering of English sentences, we store the index changes for the English words.",
        "After getting the alignment trained on the reordered English and original Pashto sentence pairs, we map the English words back to the original order, along with the learned alignment links.",
        "In this way, the alignment is ready to be combined with the baseline alignment and any other alternatives.",
        "Pashto is one of the morphologically rich languages.",
        "In addition to the linguistic knowledge applied in the syntactic reordering described above, we also utilize morphological analysis by applying stemming on both the English and Pashto sides.",
        "For English, we use Porter stemming (Porter,",
        "well ........",
        "1980), a widely applied algorithm to remove the common morphological and inflexional endings from words in English.",
        "For Pashto, we utilize a morphological decompostion algorithm that has been shown to be effective for Arabic speech recognition (Xiang et al., 2006).",
        "We start from a fixed set of affixes with 8 prefixes and 21 suffixes.",
        "The prefixes and suffixes are stripped off from the Pashto words under the two constraints:(1) Longest matched affixes first; (2) Remaining stem must be at least two characters long.",
        "For low-resource languages, we usually suffer from the data sparsity issue.",
        "Recently, a simple method was presented in (Chiang et al., 2009), which keeps partial English and Urdu words in the training data for alignment training.",
        "This is similar to the stemming method, but is more heuristics-based, and does not rely on a set of available affixes.",
        "With the same motivation, we keep the first 4 characters of each English and Pashto word to generate one more alternative for the word alignment."

        "Each candidate link ajk gets soft votes from N sets of alignments via weighted confidence scores:",

        "They all result in significantly higher F-scores.",
        "We also generate alignments on VP-reordered partial words (X in Table 1) and compared B + X and B + V + P. The better results with B + V + P show the benefit of keeping the alignments as diversified as possible before the combination.",
        "Finally, we compare the proposed alignment combination c2 with the heuristics-based method (gdf), where the latter starts from the intersection ofall 4 sets of alignments and then applies grow-diagonal-final (Koehn et al., 2003) based on the links in the union.",
        "The proposed combination approach on B + V + S + P results in close to 7% higher F-scores than the baseline and also 2% higher than gdf.",
