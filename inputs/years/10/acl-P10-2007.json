        "Full NP coreference, the task of discovering which non-pronominal NPs in a discourse refer to the same entity, is widely known to be challenging.",
        "In practice, however, most work focuses on the subtask of linking NPs with different head words.",
        "Decisions involving NPs with the same head word have not attracted nearly as much attention, and many systems, especially unsupervised ones, operate under the assumption that all same-head pairs corefer.",
        "This is by no means always the case-there are several systematic exceptions to the rule.",
        "In this paper, we show that these exceptions are fairly common, and describe an unsupervised system which learns to distinguish them from coref-erent same-head pairs.",
        "There are several reasons why relatively little attention has been paid to same-head pairs.",
        "Primarily, this is because they are a comparatively easy subtask in a notoriously difficult area; Stoy-anov et al.",
        "(2009) shows that, among NPs headed by common nouns, those which have an exact match earlier in the document are the easiest to resolve (variant MUC score .82 on MUC-6) and while those with partial matches are quite a bit harder (.53), by far the worst performance is on those without any match at all (.27).",
        "This effect is magnified by most popular metrics for coreference, which reward finding links within large clusters more than they punish proposing spurious links, making it hard to improve performance by linking conservatively.",
        "Systems that use gold mention boundaries (the locations of NPs marked by annotators) have even less need to worry about same-head relationships, since most NPs which disobey the conventional assumption are not marked as mentions.",
        "In this paper, we count how often same-head pairs fail to corefer in the MUC-6 corpus, showing that gold mention detection hides most such pairs, but more realistic detection finds large numbers.",
        "We also present an unsupervised generative model which learns to make certain same-head pairs non-coreferent.",
        "The model is based on the idea that pronoun referents are likely to be salient noun phrases in the discourse, so we can learn about NP antecedents using pronominal antecedents as a starting point.",
        "Pronoun anaphora, in turn, is learnable from raw data (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Charniak and Elsner, 2009).",
        "Since our model links fewer NPs than the baseline, it improves precision but decreases recall.",
        "This tradeoff is favorable for CEAF, but not for b."

        "Unsupervised systems specify the assumption of same-head coreference in several ways: by assumption (Haghighi and Klein, 2009), using a head-prediction clause (Poon and Domingos, 2008), and using a sparse Dirichlet prior on word emissions (Haghighi and Klein, 2007).",
        "(These three systems, perhaps not coincidentally, use gold mentions.)",
        "An exception is Ng (2008), who points out that head identity is not an entirely reliable cue and instead uses exact string match (minus determiners) for common NPs and an alias detection system for proper NPs.",
        "This work uses mentions extracted with an NP chunker.",
        "No specific results are reported for same-head NPs.",
        "However, while using exact string match raises precision, many non-matching phrases are still coreferent, so this approach cannot be considered a full solution to the problem.",
        "Supervised systems do better on the task, but not perfectly.",
        "Recent work (Stoyanov et al., 2009) attempts to determine the contributions of various categories of NP to coreference scores, and shows (as stated above) that common NPs which partially match an earlier mention are not well resolved by the state-of-the-art RECONCILE system, which uses pairwise classification.",
        "They also show that using gold mention boundaries makes the corefer-ence task substantially easier, and argue that this experimental setting is \"rather unrealistic\"."

        "We begin by examining how often non-same-head pairs appear in the MUC-6 coreference dataset.",
        "To do so, we compare two artificial coreference systems: the link-all strategy links all, and only, full (non-pronominal) NP pairs with the same head which occur within 10 sentences of one another.",
        "The oracle strategy links NP pairs with the same head which occur within 10 sentences, but only if they are actually coreferent (according to the gold annotation) The link-all system, in other words, does what most existing unsupervised systems do on the same-head subset of NPs, while the oracle system performs perfectly.",
        "We compare our results to the gold standard using two metrics.",
        "b(Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) is a standard metric which calculates a precision and recall for each mention.",
        "The mention CEAF (Luo, 2005) constructs a maximum-weight bipartite matching between gold and proposed clusters, then gives the percentage of entities whose gold label and proposed label match.",
        "b gives more weight to errors involving larger clusters (since these lower scores for several mentions at once); for mention CEAF, all mentions are weighted equally.",
        "We annotate the data with the self-trained Char-niak parser (McClosky et al., 2006), then extract mentions using three different methods.",
        "The gold mentions method takes only mentions marked by annotators.",
        "The nps method takes all base noun phrases detected by the parser.",
        "Finally, the nouns method takes all nouns, even those that do not head NPs; this method maximizes recall, since it does not exclude prenominals in phrases like \"a Bush spokesman\".",
        "(High-precision models of the internal structure of flat Penn Treebank-style NPs were investigated by Vadas and Curran (2007).)",
        "For each experimental setting, we show the number of mentions detected, and how many of them are linked to some antecedent by the system.",
        "The data is shown in Table 1. b shows a large drop in precision when all same-head pairs are linked; in fact, in the nps and nouns settings, only about half the same-headed NPs are actually coref-erent (864 real links, 1592 pairs for nps).",
        "This demonstrates that non-coreferent same-head pairs not only occur, but are actually rather common in the dataset.",
        "The drop in precision is much less obvious in the gold mentions setting, however; most unlinked same-head pairs are not annotated as mentions in the gold data, which is one reason why systems run in this experimental setting can afford to ignore them.",
        "Improperly linking same-head pairs causes a loss in precision, but scores are dominated by re-call.",
        "Thus, reporting b helps to mask the impact of these pairs when examining the final f-score.",
        "We roughly characterize what sort of same-headed NPs are non-coreferent by hand-examining 100 randomly selected pairs.",
        "39 pairs denoted different entities (\"recent employees\" vs \"employees who have worked for longer\") disambiguated by modifiers or sometimes by discourse position.",
        "The next largest group (24) consists of time and measure phrases like \"ten miles\".",
        "12 pairs refer to parts or quantities",
        "Table 1: Oracle, system and baseline scores on MUC-6 test data.",
        "Gold mentions leave little room for improvement between baseline and oracle; detecting more mentions widens the gap between them.",
        "With realistic mention detection, precision and CEAF scores improve over baselines, while recall and f-scores drop.",
        "(\"members of...\"), and 12 contained a generic (\"In a corporate campaign, a union tries...\").",
        "9 contained an annotator error.",
        "The remaining 4 were mistakes involving proper noun phrases headed by Inc. and other abbreviations; this case is easy to handle, but apparently not the primary cause of errors."

        "Our system is a version of the popular IBM model 2 for machine translation.",
        "To define our generative model, we assume that the parse trees for the entire document D are given, except for the subtrees with root nonterminal NP, denoted ni, which our system will generate.",
        "These subtrees are related by a hidden set of alignments, ai, which link each NP to another NP (which we call a generator) appearing somewhere before it in the document, or to a null antecedent.",
        "The set of potential generators G (which plays the same role as the source-language text in MT) is taken to be all the NPs occurring within 10 sentences of the target, plus a special null antecedent which plays the same role as the null word in machine translation-it serves as a dummy generator for NPs which are unrelated to any real NP in G.",
        "The generative process fills in all the NP nodes in order, from left to right.",
        "This process ensures that, when generating node ni, we have already filled in all the NPs in the set G (since these all precede ni).",

        "However, we cannot extract features from the subtree under ni, since we have yet to generate it!",
        "As usual for IBM models, we learn using EM, and we need to start our alignment function off with a good initial set of parameters.",
        "Since antecedents of NPs and pronouns (both salient NPs) often occur in similar syntactic environments, we use an alignment function for pronoun corefer-ence as a starting point.",
