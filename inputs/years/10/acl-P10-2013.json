        "The need for corpora annotated for multiple phenomena across a variety of linguistic layers is keenly recognized in the computational linguistics community.",
        "Several multiply-annotated corpora exist, especially for Western European languages and for spoken data, but, interestingly, broad-based English language corpora with robust annotation for diverse linguistic phenomena are relatively rare.",

        "The most well-known multiply-annotated and validated corpus of English is the one million word Wall Street Journal corpus known as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), which over the years has been fully or partially annotated for several phenomena over and above the original part-of-speech tagging and phrase structure annotation.",
        "The usability of these annotations is limited, however, by the fact that many of them were produced by independent projects using their own tools and formats, making it difficult to combine them in order to study their inter-relations.",
        "More recently, the OntoNotes project (Pradhan et al., 2007) released a one million word English corpus of newswire, broadcast news, and broadcast conversation that is annotated for Penn Treebank syntax, PropBank predicate argument structures, coreference, and named entities.",
        "OntoNotes comes closest to providing a corpus with multiple layers of annotation that can be analyzed as a unit via its representation of the annotations in a \"normal form\".",
        "However, like the Wall Street Journal corpus, OntoNotes is limited in the range of genres it includes.",
        "It is also limited to only those annotations that may be produced by members of the OntoNotes project.",
        "In addition, use of the data and annotations with software other than the OntoNotes database API is not necessarily straightforward.",
        "The sparseness of reliable multiply-annotated corpora can be attributed to several factors.",
        "The greatest obstacle is the high cost of manual production and validation of linguistic annotations.",
        "Furthermore, the production and annotation of corpora, even when they involve significant scientific research, often do not, per se, lead to publishable research results.",
        "It is therefore understandable that many research groups are unwilling to get involved in such a massive undertaking for relatively little reward.",
        "The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) (Ide et al., 2008) project has been established to address many of these obstacles to the creation of large-scale, robust, multiply-annotated corpora.",
        "The project is providing appropriate data and annotations to serve as the base for a community-wide annotation effort, together with an infrastructure that enables the representation of internally-produced and contributed annotations in a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats, thus enabling its immediate use with many common annotation platforms as well as off-the-shelf concordance and analysis software.",
        "The MASC project's aim is to offset some of the high costs of producing high quality linguistic annotations via a distribution of effort, and to solve some of the usability problems for annotations produced at different sites by harmonizing their representation formats.",
        "The MASC project provides a resource that is significantly different from OntoNotes and similar corpora.",
        "It provides data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and all of the data in the corpus are drawn from current American English so as to be most useful for NLP applications.",
        "Perhaps most importantly, the MASC project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations.",
        "It is also committed to incorporating diverse annotations contributed by the community, regardless of format, into the corpus.",
        "As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, community-based effort to create a much-needed language resource for NLP.",

        "All MASC annotations, whether contributed or produced in-house, are transduced to the Graph Annotation Framework (GrAF) (Ide and Suder-man, 2007) defined by ISO TC37 SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) (Ide and Romary, 2004).",
        "GrAF is an XML serialization of the LAF abstract model of annotations, which consists of a directed graph decorated with feature structures providing the annotation content.",

        "However, because the underlying data structure is a graph, the GrAF representation itself can serve as the basis for analysis via application of graph-analytic algorithms such as common subtree detection.",
        "The layering of annotations over MASC texts dictates the use of a stand-off annotation representation format, in which each annotation is contained in a separate document linked to the primary data.",
