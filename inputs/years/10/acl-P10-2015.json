        "Automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) systems requires automated procedures to ensure consistency and efficient handling of large amounts of data.",
        "In statistical MT systems, automatic evaluation of translations is essential for parameter optimization and system development.",
        "Human evaluation is too labor intensive, time consuming and expensive for daily evaluations.",
        "However, manual evaluation is important in the comparison of different MT systems and for the validation and development of automatic MT evaluation measures, which try to model human assessments of translations as closely as possible.",
        "Furthermore, the ideal evaluation method would be language independent, fast to compute and simple.",
        "Recently, normalized compression distance (NCD) has been applied to the evaluation of machine translations.",
        "NCD is a general information theoretic measure of string similarity, whereas most MT evaluation measures, e.g., BLEU and METEOR, are specifically constructed for the task.",
        "Parker (2008) introduced BADGER, an MT evaluation measure that uses NCD and a language independent word normalization method.",
        "BADGER scores were directly compared against the scores of METEOR and word error rate (WER).",
        "The correlation between BADGER and METEOR were low and correlations between",
        "BADGER and WER high.",
        "Kettunen (2009) uses the NCD directly as an MT evaluation measure.",
        "He showed with a small corpus of three language pairs that NCD and METEOR 0.6 correlated for translations of 10-12 MT systems.",
        "NCD was not compared to human assessments of translations, but correlations of NCD and METEOR scores were very high for all the three language pairs.",
        "Vayrynen et al.",
        "(2010) have extended the work by including NCD in the ACL WMT08 evaluation framework and showing that NCD is correlated to human judgments.",
        "The NCD measure did not match the performance of the state-of-the-art MT evaluation measures in English, but it presented a viable alternative to de facto standard BLEU (Pa-pineni et al., 2001), which is simple and effective but has been shown to have a number of drawbacks (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "Some recent advances in automatic MT evaluation have included non-binary matching between compared items (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Agar-wal and Lavie, 2008; Chan and Ng, 2009), which is implicitly present in the string-based NCD measure.",

        "Normalized compression distance (NCD) is a similarity measure based on the idea that a string x is similar to another string y when both share substrings.",
        "The description of y can reference shared substrings in the known x without repetition, indicating shared information.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example in which the compression of the concatenation of x and y results in a shorter output than individual compressions of x and y.",
        "The normalized compression distance, as defined by Cilibrasi and Vitanyi (2005), is given in Equation 1, with C (x) as length of the compression of x and C (x, y) as the length of the compression of the concatenation of x and y.",
        "NCD computes the distance as a score closer to one for very different strings and closer to zero for more similar strings.",
        "NCD is an approximation of the uncomputable normalized information distance (NID), a general measure for the similarity of two objects.",
        "NID is based on the notion of Kolmogorov complexity K(x), a theoretical measure for the information content of a string x, defined as the shortest universal Turing machine that prints x and stops (Solomonoff, 1964).",
        "NCD approximates NID by the use of a compressor C(x) that is an upper bound of the Kolmogorov complexity K(x).",
        "Normalized compression distance was not conceived with MT evaluation in mind, but rather it is a general measure of string similarity.",
        "Implicit non-binary matching with NCD is indicated by preliminary experiments which show that NCD is less sensitive to random changes on the character level than, for instance, BLEU, which only counts the exact matches between word n-grams.",
        "Thus comparison of sentences at the character level could account better for morphological changes.",
        "Variation in language leads to several acceptable translations for each source sentence, which is why multiple reference translations are preferred in evaluation.",
        "Unfortunately, it is typical to have only one reference translation.",
        "Paraphrasing techniques can produce additional translation variants (Russo-Lassner et al., 2005; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006).",
        "These can be seen as new reference translations, similar to pseudo references (Ma et al., 2007).",
        "The proposed method, mNCD, works analogously to M-BLEU and M-TER, which use the flexible word matching modules from METEOR to find relaxed word-to-word alignments (Agar-wal and Lavie, 2008).",
        "The modules are able to align words even if they do not share the same surface form, but instead have a common stem or are synonyms of each other.",
        "A similarized translation reference is generated by replacing words in the reference with their aligned counterparts from the translation hypothesis.",
        "The NCD score is computed between the translations and the similarized references to get the mNCD score.",
