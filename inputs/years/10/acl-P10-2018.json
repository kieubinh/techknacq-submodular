        "They reported that incorporating this type of features provides substantial gain of the system performance.",
        "The other factor is interdependencies between a predicate sense and argument roles, which relate to selectional preference, and motivated us to jointly identify a predicate sense and its argument roles.",
        "This type of dependencies has been explored by Riedel and Meza-Ruiz (2008; 2009b; 2009a), all of which use Markov Logic Networks (MLN).",

        "For instance, ifa predicate-argument structure has an agent (A0) followed by the predicate and a patient (A1), we encode the structure as a string A0-PRED-A1 and use it as a feature.",
        "This type of features provide plausibility of predicate-argument structures.",
        "Even if the highest scoring predicate-argument structure with the other factors misses some core arguments, the global feature demands the model to fill the missing arguments.",

        "The crucial point of the model is how to deal with the global factor FG, because enumerating possible assignments is too costly.",

        "(B) is the constraint that ensures a sufficient margin p(y, yL) between y and yL.",
        "The necessity of this constraint is that if we apply only (A), the algorithm does not guarantee a sufficient margin in terms of local features, and it leads to poor quality in the N-best assignments.",
        "The Kazama and Tori-sawa's perceptron algorithm uses constant values for the cost function p(y, yL+G) and p(y, yL).",
        "The proposed model is trained using the following optimization problem.",
        "lL+G is the loss function for the case of using both local and global features, corresponding to the constraint (A), and lL is the loss function for the case of using only local features, corresponding to the constraints (B) provided that (A) is satisfied.",
        "The fact that an argument candidate is not assigned any role (namely it is assigned the label \"NONE\") is unlikely to contribute predicate sense disambiguation.",
        "However, it remains possible that \"NONE\" arguments is biased toward a particular predicate sense by Fpa (i.e. w • $PA(x,sensei,ak = \"NONE'') > w • <$>pa(x, sense j ,ak = \"NONE').",
        "In order to avoid this bias, we define a special sense label, senseany, that is used to calculate the score for a predicate and a roll-less argument, regardless of the predicate's sense.",
