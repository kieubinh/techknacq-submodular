        "The notion of collocation has been widely discussed in the field of language teaching for decades.",
        "It has been shown that collocation, a successive common usage of words in a chain, is important in helping language learners achieve native-like fluency.",
        "In the field of English for Academic Purpose, more and more researchers are also recognizing this important feature in academic writing.",
        "It is often argued that collocation can influence the effectiveness of a piece of writing and the lack of such knowledge might cause cumulative loss of precision (Howarth, 1998).",
        "Many researchers have discussed the function of collocations in the highly conventionalized and specialized writing used within academia.",
        "Research also identified noticeable increases in the quantity and quality of collocational usage by",
        "Corresponding author: Yu-chia Chang (Email address: richtrf@gmail.com)",
        "native speakers (Howarth, 1998).",
        "Granger (1998) reported that learners underuse native-like collocations and overuse atypical word combinations.",
        "This disparity in collocation usage between native and non-native speakers is clear and should receive more attention from the language technology community.",
        "To tackle such word usage problems, traditional language technology often employs a database of the learners' common errors that are manually tagged by teachers or specialists (e.g. Shei and Pain, 2000; Liu, 2002).",
        "Such system then identifies errors via string or pattern matching and offer only pre-stored suggestions.",
        "Compiling the database is time-consuming and not easily maintainable, and the usefulness is limited by the manual collection of pre-stored suggestions.",
        "Therefore, it is beneficial if a system can mainly use untagged data from a corpus containing correct language usages rather than the error-tagged data from a learner corpus.",
        "A large corpus of correct language usages is more readily available and useful than a small labeled corpus of incorrect language usages.",
        "For this suggestion task, the large corpus not only provides us with a rich set of common collocations but also provides the context within which these collocations appear.",
        "Intuitively, we can take account of such context of collocation to generate more suitable suggestions.",
        "Contextual information in this sense often entails more linguistic clues to provide suggestions within sentences or paragraph.",
        "However, the contextual information is messy and complex and thus has long been overlooked or ignored.",
        "To date, most fashionable suggestion methods still rely upon the linguistic components within collocations as well as the linguistic relationship between misused words and their correct counterparts (Chang et al., 2008; Liu, 2009).",
        "In contrast to other research, we employ contextual information to automate suggestions for verb-noun lexical collocation.",
        "Verb-noun collocations are recognized as presenting the most challenge to students (Howarth, 1996; Liu, 2002).",
        "More specifically, in this preliminary study we start by focusing on the word choice of verbs in collocations which are considered as the most difficult ones for learners to master (Liu, 2002; Chang, 2008).",
        "The experiment confirms that our collocation writing assistant proves the feasibility of using machine learning methods to automatically prompt learners with collocation suggestions in academic writing."

        "In our study, we take advantage of a dependency parser, Stanford Parser, which extracts typed dependencies for certain grammatical relations (shown in Figure 2).",
        "Within the parsed sentence of example (1), we can notice that the extracted dependency \"dobj (introduce-2, method-4)\" meets the criterion.",
        "Using a Classifier for the Suggestion task: A classifier is a function generally to take a set of attributes as an input and to provide a tagged class as an output.",

        "And this trained classifier can thus make predication and assign a tag to any input data.",
        "The suggestion task in this study will be seen as a classification problem.",
        "We treat the collocation extracted from each sentence as the class tag (see examples in Table 1).",
        "Hopefully, the system can learn the rules between tagged classes (i.e. collocations) and example sentences (i.e. scholarly sentences) and can predict which collocation is the most appropriate one given attributes extracted from the sentences.",
        "Another advantage of using a classifier to automate suggestion is to provide alternatives with regard to the similar attributes shared by sentences.",
        "In Table 1, we can observe that these collocations exhibit a similar discourse function and can thus become interchangeable in these sentences.",
        "Therefore, based on the outputs along with the probability from the classifier, we can provide more than one adequate suggestions.",
