        "Despite its intuitive appeal, the incorporation of linguistic and semantic word dependencies in IR has not been shown to significantly improve over a bigram language modeling approach (Song and Croft, 1999) that encodes word dependencies assumed from mere syntactic adjacency.",
        "Both the dependence language model for IR (Gao et al., 2004), which incorporates linguistic relations between non-adjacent words while limiting the generation of meaningless phrases, and the Markov Random Field (MRF) model, which captures short and long range term dependencies (Metzler and Croft, 2005; Metzler and Croft, 2007), consistently outperform a unigram language modelling approach but are closely approximated by a bigram language model that uses no linguistic knowledge.",
        "Improving retrieval performance through application of semantic and syntactic information beyond proximity and co-occurrence features is a difficult task but remains a tantalising prospect.",
        "Our approach is like that of Gao et al.",
        "(2004) in that it considers semantic-syntactically determined relationships between words at the sentence level, but allows words to have more than one role, such as predicate and argument for different events, while link grammar (Sleator and Tem-perley, 1991) dictates that a word can only satisfy one connector in a disjunctive set.",
        "Compared to the MRF model, our approach is unsupervised where MRFs require the training of parameters using relevance judgments that are often unavailable in practical conditions.",
        "Other work incorporating syntactic and linguistic information into IR includes early research by (Smeaton, O'Donnell and Kelledy, 1995), who employed tree structured analytics (TSAs) resembling dependency trees, the use of syntax to detect paraphrases for question answering (QA) (Lin and Pantel, 2001), and semantic role labelling in",
        "QA (Shen and Lapata, 2007).",
        "Independent from IR, Padó and Lapata (2007) proposed a general framework for the construction of a semantic space endowed with syntactic information.",
        "This was represented by an undirected graph, where nodes stood for words, dependency edges stood for syntactical relations, and sequences of dependency edges formed paths that were weighted for each target word.",
        "Our work is in line with Padó and Lapata (2007) in constructing a semantic space with syntactic information, but builds our space from events, states and attributions as defined linguistically by Bach (1986).",
        "We call these simply events, and extract them automatically from predicate-argument structures and a dependency parse.",
        "We will use this space to perform query expansion in IR, a task that aims to find additional words related to original query terms, such that an expanded query including these words better expresses the information need.",
        "To our knowledge, the notion of events has not been applied to query expansion before.",
        "This paper will outline the original HAL algorithm which serves as our baseline, and the event extraction process.",
        "We then propose two methods to arm HAL with event information: direct construction of HAL from events (eHAL-1), and treating events as constraints on HAL construction from the corpus (eHAL-2).",
        "Evaluation will compare results using original HAL, eHAL1 and eHAL-2 with a widely used unigram language model (LM) for IR and a state of the art query expansion method, namely the Relevance Model (RM) (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001).",
        "We also explore whether a complementary effect can be achieved by combining HAL-based dependency modelling with the unigram-based RM."

        "Semantic space models aim to capture the meanings of words using co-occurrence information in a text corpus.",
        "Two examples are the Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996), in which a word is represented by a vector of other words co-occurring with it in a sliding window, and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas, Landauer and Harshman, 1990; Landauer, Foltz and Laham, 1998), in which a word is expressed as a vector of documents (or any other syntactical units such as sentences) containing the word.",

        "Semantic space models have been validated through various studies and demonstrate compatibility with human information processing.",
        "Recently, they have also been applied in IR, such as LSA for latent semantic indexing, and HAL for query expansion.",
        "For the purpose of this paper, we focus on HAL, which encodes word co-occurrence information explicitly and thus can be applied to query expansion in a straightforward way.",
        "HAL is premised on context surrounding a word providing important information about its meaning (Harris, 1968).",
        "To be specific, an L-size sliding window moves across a large text corpus word-by-word.",
        "Any two words in the same window are treated as co-occurring with each other with a weight that is inversely proportional to their separation distance in the text.",
        "By accumulating co-occurrence information over a corpus, a word-by-word matrix is constructed, a simple illustration of which is given in Table 1.",
        "A single word is represented by a row vector and a column vector that capture the information before and after the word, respectively.",
        "In some applications, direction sensitivity is ignored to obtain a single vector representation of a word by adding corresponding row and column vectors (Bai et al., 2005).",
        "HAL has been successfully applied to query expansion and can be incorporated into this task directly (Bai et al., 2005) or indirectly, as with the Information Flow method based on HAL (Bruza and Song, 2002).",
