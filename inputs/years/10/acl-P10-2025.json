        "Word alignment is an essential step in most phrase and syntax based statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "It is an inference problem of word correspondences between different languages given parallel sentence pairs.",
        "Accurate word alignment can induce high quality phrase detection and translation probability, which leads to a significant improvement in SMT performance.",
        "Many word alignment approaches based on generative models have been proposed and they learn from bilingual sentences in an unsupervised manner (Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003; Fraser and Marcu, 2007).",
        "One way to improve word alignment quality is to add linguistic knowledge derived from a monolingual corpus.",
        "This monolingual knowledge makes it easier to determine corresponding words correctly.",
        "For instance, functional words in one language tend to correspond to functional words in another language (Deng and Gao, 2007), and the syntactic dependency of words in each language can help the alignment process (Ma et al., 2008).",
        "It has been shown that such grammatical information works as a constraint in word alignment models and improves word alignment quality.",
        "A large number of monolingual lexical semantic resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) have been constructed in more than fifty languages (Sagot and Fiser, 2008).",
        "They include wordlevel relations such as synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms.",
        "Synonym information is particularly helpful for word alignment because we can expect a synonym to correspond to the same word in a different language.",
        "In this paper, we explore a method for using synonym information effectively to improve word alignment quality.",
        "In general, synonym relations are defined in terms of word sense, not in terms of word form.",
        "In other words, synonym relations are usually context or domain dependent.",
        "For instance, 'head' and 'chief' are synonyms in contexts referring to working environment, while 'head' and 'forefront' are synonyms in contexts referring to physical positions.",
        "It is difficult, however, to imagine a context where 'chief' and 'forefront' are synonyms.",
        "Therefore, it is easy to imagine that simply replacing all occurrences of 'chief' and 'forefront' with 'head' do sometimes harm with word alignment accuracy, and we have to model either the context or senses of words.",
        "We propose a novel method that incorporates synonyms from monolingual resources in a bilingual word alignment model.",
        "We formulate a synonym pair generative model with a topic variable and use this model as a regularization term with a bilingual word alignment model.",
        "The topic variable in our synonym model is helpful for disambiguating the meanings of synonyms.",
        "We extend HM-BiTAM, which is a HMM-based word alignment model with a latent topic, with a novel synonym pair generative model.",

        "For an empirical evaluation of the proposed method, we used a bilingual parallel corpus of English-French Hansards (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "The corpus consists of over 1 million sentence pairs, which include 447 manually word-aligned sentences.",
        "We selected 100 sentence pairs randomly from the manually word-aligned sentences as development data for tuning the regularization weight (, and used the 347 remaining sentence pairs as evaluation data.",
        "We also randomly selected 10k, 50k, and 100k sized sentence pairs from the corpus as additional training data.",

        "Note that manual word alignment of the 347 sentence pairs was not used for the unsupervised training.",
        "After the unsupervised training, we evaluated the word alignment performance of our proposed method by comparing the manual word alignment of the 347 sentence pairs with the prediction provided by the trained model.",
        "We collected English and French synonym pairs from WordNet 2.1 (Miller, 1995) and WOLF 0.1.4 (Sagot and Fiser, 2008), respectively.",

        "We adopted K = 3 topics, following the setting in (Zhao and Xing, 2006).",
        "We trained the word alignment in two directions: English to French, and French to English.",
        "The alignment results for both directions were refined with 'GROW' heuristics to yield high precision and high recall in accordance with previous work (Och and Ney, 2003; Zhao and Xing, 2006).",
        "We evaluated these results for precision, recall, F-measure and alignment error rate (AER), which are standard metrics for word alignment accuracy (Och and Ney, 2000).",
        "Table 1: Comparison of word alignment accuracy.",
        "The best results are indicated in bold type.",
        "The additional data set sizes are (a) 10k, (b) 50k, (c) 100k.",
        "Table 1 shows the word alignment accuracy of the three methods trained with 10k, 50k, and 100k additional sentence pairs.",
        "For all settings, our proposed method outperformed other conventional methods.",
        "This result shows that synonym information is effective for improving word alignment quality as we expected.",
        "As mentioned in Sections 1 and 3.1, the main idea of our proposed method is to introduce latent topics for modeling synonym pairs, and then to utilize the synonym pair model for the regularization of word alignment models.",
        "We expect the latent topics to be useful for modeling poly-semous words included in synonym pairs and to enable us to incorporate synonym information effectively into word alignment models.",
        "To confirm the effect of the synonym pair model with latent topics, we also tested GIZA++ and HM-BiTAM with what we call Synonym Replacement Heuristics (SRH), where all of the synonym pairs in the bilingual training sentences were simply replaced with a representative word.",
        "For instance, the words 'sick' and 'ill' in the bilingual sentences were replaced with the word 'sick'.",
        "As shown in Table 2, the number of vocabularies in the English and French data sets decreased as a result of employing the SRH.",

        "The GIZA++ and HM-BiTAM with the SRH slightly outperformed the standard GIZA++ and HM-BiTAM for the 10k and 100k data sets, but underperformed with the 50k data set.",
        "We assume that the SRH mitigated the over-fitting of these models into low-frequency word pairs in bilingual sentences, and then improved the word alignment performance.",
        "The SRH regards all of the different words coupled with the same word in the synonym pairs as synonyms.",
        "For instance, the words 'head', 'chief' and 'forefront' in the bilingual sentences are replaced with 'chief', since ('head', 'chief') and ('head', 'forefront') are synonyms.",
        "Obviously, ('chief', 'forefront') are not synonyms, which is detrimented to word alignment.",
        "The proposed method consistently outperformed GIZA++ and HM-BiTAM with the SRH in 10k, 50k and 100k data sets in F-measure.",
        "The synonym pair model in our proposed method can automatically learn that ('head', 'chief') and ('head', 'forefront') are individual synonyms with different meanings by assigning these pairs to different topics.",
        "By sharing latent topics between the synonym pair model and the word alignment model, the synonym information incorporated in the synonym pair model is used directly for training word alignment model.",
        "The experimental results show that our proposed method was effective in improving the performance of the word alignment model by using synonym pairs including such ambiguous synonym words.",
        "Finally, we discuss the data set size used for unsupervised training.",
        "As shown in Table 1, using a large number of additional sentence pairs improved the performance of all the models.",
        "In all our experimental settings, all the additional sentence pairs and the evaluation data were selected from the Hansards data set.",
        "These experimental results show that a larger number ofsentence pairs was more effective in improving word alignment performance when the sentence pairs were collected from a homogeneous data source.",
        "However, in practice, it might be difficult to collect a large number of such homogeneous sentence pairs for a specific target domain and language pair.",
        "One direction for future work is to confirm the effect of the proposed method when training the word alignment model by using a large number of sentence pairs collected from various data sources including many topics for a specific language pair.",
