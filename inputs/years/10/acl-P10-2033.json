        "Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is a morpho-syntactically complex language, with different phenomena from English, a fact that raises many interesting issues for natural language processing and Arabic-to-English statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "While comprehensive Arabic preprocessing schemes have been widely adopted for handling Arabic morphology in SMT (e.g., Sadat and Habash (2006), Zollmann et al.",
        "(2006), Lee (2004)), syntactic issues have not received as much attention by comparison (Green et al.",
        "(2009), Crego and Habash (2008), Habash (2007)).",
        "Arabic verbal constructions are particularly challenging since subjects can occur in pre-verbal (SV), post-verbal (VS) or pro-dropped (\"null subject\") constructions.",
        "As a result, training data for learning verbal construction translations is split between the different constructions and their patterns; and complex reordering schemas are needed in order to translate them into primarily pre-verbal subject languages (SVO) such as English.",
        "These issues are particularly problematic in phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Standard phrase-based SMT systems memorize phrasal translation of verb and subject constructions as observed in the training bitext.",
        "They do not capture any generalizations between occurrences in VS and SV orders, even for the same verbs.",
        "In addition, their distance-based reordering models are not well suited to handling complex reordering operations which can include long distance dependencies, and may vary by context.",
        "Despite these limitations, phrase-based SMT systems have achieved competitive results in Arabic-to-English benchmark evaluations.",
        "However, error analysis shows that verbs are still often dropped or incorrectly translated, and subjects are split or garbled in translation.",
        "This suggests that better syntactic modeling should further improve SMT.",
        "We attempt to get a better understanding of translation patterns for Arabic verb constructions, particularly VS constructions, by studying their occurrence and reordering patterns in a hand-aligned Arabic-English parallel treebank.",
        "Our analysis shows that VS reordering rules are not straightforward and that SMT should therefore benefit from direct modeling of Arabic verb subject translation.",
        "In order to detect VS constructions, we use our state-of-the-art Arabic dependency parser, which is essentially the CATIBEX baseline in our subsequent parsing work in Mar-ton et al.",
        "(2010), and is further described there.",
        "We show that VS subjects and their exact boundaries are hard to identify accurately.",
        "Given the noise in VS detection, existing strategies for source-side reordering (e.g., Xia and McCord (2004), Collins",
        "Table 1: How are Arabic SV and VS translated in the manually word-aligned Arabic-English parallel treebank?",
        "We check whether V and S are translated in a \"monotone\" or \"inverted\" order for all VS and SV constructions.",
        "\"Overlap\" represents instances where translations of the Arabic verb and subject have some English words in common, and are not monotone nor inverted.",
        "not effective at this stage.",
        "While these approaches have been successful for language pairs such as German-English for which syntactic parsers are more developed and relevant reordering patterns might be less ambiguous, their impact potential on Arabic-English translation is still unclear.",
        "In this work, we focus on VS constructions only, and propose a new strategy in order to benefit from their noisy detection: for the word alignment stage only, we reorder phrases detected as VS constructions into an SV order.",
        "Then, for phrase extraction, weight optimization and decoding, we use the original (non-reordered) text.",
        "This approach significantly improves both BLEU and TER on top of strong medium and large-scale phrase-based SMT baselines."
