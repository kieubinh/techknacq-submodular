        "Many situations call for a parser to return a k-best list of parses instead of a single best hypothesis.",
        "Currently, there are two efficient approaches known in the literature.",
        "The k-best algorithm of Jimenez and Marzal (2000) and Huang and Chiang (2005), referred to hereafter as Lazy, operates by first performing an exhaustive Viterbi inside pass and then lazily extracting k-best lists in top-down manner.",
        "The k-best A* algorithm of Pauls and Klein (2009), hereafter KA*, computes Viterbi inside and outside scores before extracting k-best lists bottom up.",
        "Because these additional passes are only partial, KA* can be significantly faster than Lazy, especially when a heuristic is used (Pauls and Klein, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we propose TKA*, a top-down variant of KA* that, like LAZY, performs only an inside pass before extracting k-best lists top-down, but maintains the same optimality and efficiency guarantees as KA*.",
        "This algorithm can be seen as a generalization of the lattice k-best algorithm of Soong and Huang (1991) to parsing.",

        "It can be shown that an edge e satisfying ß(e) + h(A, i, j) > ß(G, 0, n) will never be removed from the agenda, allowing some edges to be safely pruned during parsing.",
        "The more closely h(e) approximates the Viterbi outside cost a(e), the more items are pruned.",
        "The use of inside edge items in A* exploits the optimal substructure property of derivations - since a best derivation of a larger edge is always composed of best derivations of smaller edges, it is only necessary to compute the best way of building a particular inside edge item.",
        "When finding k-best lists, this is no longer possible, since we are interested in suboptimal derivations.",
        "Thus, KA*, the k-best extension of A*, must search not in the space of inside edge items, but rather in the space of inside derivation items D(TA,i, j), which represent specific derivations of the edge (A, i, j) using tree TA.",
        "However, the number of inside derivation items is exponential in the length of the input sentence, and even with a very accurate heuristic, running A* directly in this space is not feasible.",
        "Fortunately, Pauls and Klein (2009) show that with a perfect heuristic, that is, h(e) = a(e) Ve, A* search on inside derivation items will only remove items from the agenda that participate in the true k-best lists (up to ties).",

        "OUT-L and OUT-R combine, in a top-down fashion, an outside edge over a larger span and inside edge over a smaller span to form a new outside edge over a smaller span.",
        "Because these rules make reference to inside edge items I (A, i, j ), these items must also be built using the IN deduction rules from 1-best A*.",
        "Outside edge items must thus wait until the necessary inside edge items have been built.",
        "The outside pass is initialized with the item O(G, 0, n) when the inside edge item I(G, 0, n) is popped from the agenda.",
        "Once we have started populating outside scores using the outside deductions, we can initiate a search on inside derivation items.",
        "These items are built bottom-up using the IN-D deduction rule.",
        "The crucial element of this rule is that derivation items for a particular edge wait until the exact outside score of that edge has been computed.",
        "The algorithm terminates when k derivation items rooted at ( G, 0, n) have been popped from the agenda.",
        "KA* efficiently explores the space of inside derivation items because it waits for the exact Viterbi outside cost before building each derivation item.",
        "However, these outside costs and associated deduction items are only auxiliary quantities used to guide the exploration of inside derivations: they allow KA* to prioritize currently constructed inside derivation items (i.e., constructed derivations of the goal) by their optimal completion costs.",
        "Outside costs are thus only necessary because we construct partial derivations bottom-up; if we constructed partial derivations in a top-down fashion, all we would need to compute optimal completion costs are Viterbi inside scores, and we could forget the outside pass.",
        "TKA* does exactly that.",
        "Inside edge items are constructed in the same way as KA*, but once the inside edge item I(G, 0, n) has been discovered, TKA* begins building partial derivations from the goal outwards.",
        "We replace the inside derivation items of KA* with outside derivation items, which represent trees rooted at the goal and expanding downwards.",
        "These items bottom out in a list of edges called the frontier edges.",
        "See Figure 1(d) for a graphical representation.",
        "When a frontier edge represents a single word in the input, i.e. is of the form (si, i, i + 1), we say that edge is complete.",
        "An outside derivation can be expanded by applying a rule to one of its incomplete frontier edges; see Figure 2.",
        "In the same way that inside derivation items wait on exact outside scores before being built, outside derivation items wait on the inside edge items of all frontier edges before they can be constructed.",
        "Although building derivations top-down obviates the need for a 1-best outside pass, it raises a new issue.",
        "When building derivations bottom-up, the only way to expand a particular partial inside derivation is to combine it with another partial inside derivation to build a bigger tree.",
        "In contrast, an outside derivation item can be expanded anywhere along its frontier.",
        "Naively building derivations top-down would lead to a prohibitively large number of expansion choices.",
        "We solve this issue by always expanding the leftmost incomplete frontier edge of an outside derivation item.",
        "We show the deduction rule OUT-D which performs this deduction in Figure 1(d).",
        "We denote an outside derivation item as ^(TA^, i, j, F), where is a tree rooted at the goal with leftmost incomplete edge (A, i, j), and F is the list of incomplete frontier edges excluding ( A, i, j), ordered from left to right.",
        "Whenever the application of this rule \"completes\" the leftmost edge, the next edge is removed from F and is used as the new point of expansion.",
        "Once all frontier edges are complete, the item represents a correctly scored derivation of the goal, explored in a pre-order traversal.",
        "It should be clear that expanding the leftmost incomplete frontier edge first eventually explores the same set of derivations as expanding all frontier edges simultaneously.",
        "The only worry in fixing this canonical order is that we will somehow explore the Q items in an incorrect order, possibly building some complete derivation QC before a more optimal complete derivation Qc.",
        "However, note that all items Q along the leftmost construction of Qc have priority equal to or better than any less optimal complete derivation QC.",
        "Therefore, when QC is enqueued, it will have lower priority than all Q; QC will therefore not be dequeued until all Q - and hence Qc - have been built.",
        "Furthermore, it can be shown that the top-down expansion strategy maintains the same efficiency and optimality guarantees as KA* for all item types: for consistent heuristics h, the first k entirely complete outside derivation items are the true k-best derivations (modulo ties), and that only derivation items which participate in those k-best derivations will be removed from the queue (up to ties).",
        "Building derivations bottom-up is convenient from an indexing point of view: since larger derivations are built from smaller ones, it is not necessary to construct the larger derivation from scratch.",
        "Instead, one can simply construct a new tree whose children point to the old trees, saving both memory and CPU time.",
        "In order keep the same efficiency when building trees top-down, a slightly different data structure is necessary.",
        "We represent top-down derivations as a lazy list of expansions.",
        "The top node Tq is an empty list, and whenever we expand an outside derivation item Q(TG, i, j, F) with a rule r = A – B C and split point l, the resulting derivation Tq is a new list item with (r, l) as the head data, and TA as its tail.",
        "The tree can be reconstructed later by recursively reconstructing the parent, and adding the edges (B, i, l) and (C, l, j) as children of (A, i, j).",
        "Although our algorithm eliminates the 1-best outside pass of KA*, in practice, even for k = 10, the 1-best inside pass remains the overwhelming bottleneck (Pauls and Klein, 2009), and our modifications leave that pass unchanged.",
        "However, we argue that our implementation is simpler to specify and implement.",
        "In terms of deduction rules, our algorithm eliminates the 2 outside deduction rules and replaces the IN-D rule with the OUT-D rule, bringing the total number of rules from four to two.",
        "The ease of specification translates directly into ease of implementation.",
        "In particular, if high-quality heuristics are not available, it is often more efficient to implement the 1-best inside pass as an exhaustive dynamic program, as in Huang and Chiang (2005).",
        "In this case, one would only need to implement a single, agenda-based k-best extraction phase, instead of the 2 needed for KA*.",
        "The contribution of this paper is theoretical, not empirical.",
        "We have argued that TKA* is simpler than TKA* , but we do not expect it to do any more or less work than KA*, modulo grammar specific optimizations.",
        "Therefore, we simply verify, like KA* , that the additional work of extracting k-best lists with TKA* is negligible compared to the time spent building 1-best inside edges.",
        "We examined the time spent building 100-best lists for the same experimental setup as Pauls and Klein (2009).",
        "On 100 sentences, our implementation of TKA* constructed 3.46 billion items, of which about 2% were outside derivation items.",
        "Our implementation of KA* constructed 3.41 billion edges, of which about 0.1% were outside edge items or inside derivation items.",
        "In other words, the cost of k-best extraction is dwarfed by the the 1-best inside edge computation in both cases.",
        "The reason for the slight performance advantage of KA* is that our implementation of KA* uses lazy optimizations discussed in Pauls and Klein (2009), and while such optimizations could easily be incorporated in TKA* , we have not yet done so in our implementation."
