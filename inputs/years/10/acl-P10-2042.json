        "Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG) is a compelling grammar formalism which allows nonterminal rewrites in the form of trees, thereby enabling the modelling of complex linguistic phenomena such as argument frames, lexical agreement and idiomatic phrases.",
        "A fundamental problem with TSGs is that they are difficult to estimate, even in the supervised scenario where treebanked data is available.",
        "This is because treebanks are typically not annotated with their TSG derivations (how to decompose a tree into elementary tree fragments); instead the derivation needs to be inferred.",
        "In recent work we proposed a TSG model which infers an optimal decomposition under a non-parametric Bayesian prior (Cohn et al., 2009).",
        "This used a Gibbs sampler for training, which repeatedly samples for every node in every training tree a binary value indicating whether the node is or is not a substitution point in the tree's derivation.",
        "Aggregated over the whole corpus, these values and the underlying trees specify the weighted grammar.",
        "Local Gibbs samplers, although conceptually simple, suffer from slow convergence (a.k.a.",
        "poor mixing).",
        "The sampler can get easily stuck because many locally improbable decisions are required to escape from a locally optimal solution.",
        "This problem manifests itself both locally to a sentence and globally over the training sample.",
        "The net result is a sampler that is non-convergent, overly dependent on its initialisation and cannot be said to be sampling from the posterior.",
        "In this paper we present a blocked Metropolis-Hasting sampler for learning a TSG, similar to Johnson et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "The sampler jointly updates all the substitution variables in a tree, making much larger moves than the local single-variable sampler.",
        "A critical issue when developing a Metroplis-Hastings sampler is choosing a suitable proposal distribution, which must have the same support as the true distribution.",
        "For our model the natural proposal distribution is a MAP point estimate, however this cannot be represented directly as it is infinitely large.",
        "To solve this problem we develop a grammar transformation which can succinctly represent an infinite TSG in an equivalent finite Context Free Grammar (CFG).",
        "The transformed grammar can be used as a proposal distribution, from which samples can be drawn in polynomial time.",
        "Empirically, the blocked sampler converges in fewer iterations and in less time than the local Gibbs sampler.",
        "In addition, we also show how the transformed grammar can be used for parsing, which yields theoretical and empirical improvements over our previous method which truncated the grammar."

        "A Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG; Bod et al.",
        "(2003)) is a 4-tuple, G = (T, N, S, R), where T is a set of terminal symbols, N is a set of nonterminal symbols, S G N is the distinguished root nonterminal and R is a set of productions (rules).",
        "The productions take the form of tree fragments, called elementary trees (ETs), in which each internal node is labelled with a nonterminal and each leaf is labelled with either a terminal or a nonterminal.",
        "The frontier nonterminal nodes in each ET form the sites into which other ETs can be substituted.",
        "A derivation creates a tree by recursive substitution starting with the root symbol and finishing when there are no remaining frontier nonterminals.",
        "Figure 1 (left) shows an example derivation where the arrows denote substitution.",
        "A Probabilistic Tree Substitution Grammar (PTSG) assigns a probability to each rule in the grammar, where each production is assumed to be conditionally independent given its root nonterminal.",
        "A derivation's probability is the product of the probabilities of the rules therein.",
        "In this work we employ the same non-parametric TSG model as Cohn et al.",
        "(2009), which we now summarise.",
        "The inference problem within this model is to identify the posterior distribution of the elementary trees e given whole trees t. The model is characterised by the use of a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the grammar.",
        "We define the distribution over elementary trees e with root nonterminal symbol c as where P0 ( | c) (the base distribution) is a distribution over the infinite space of trees rooted with c, and ac (the concentration parameter) controls the model's tendency towards either reusing elementary trees or creating novel ones as each training instance is encountered.",
        "Rather than representing the distribution Gc explicitly, we integrate over all possible values of Gc.",
        "The key result required for inference is that the conditional distribution of e^, given e_j, = ei... en\\ei and the root category c is:",

        "A primary consideration is the definition of P0.",
        "Each can be generated in one of two ways: by drawing from the base distribution, where the probability of any particular tree is proportional to acP0(ei| c), or by drawing from a cache of previous expansions of c, where the probability of any particular expansion is proportional to the number of times that expansion has been used before.",
        "In Cohn et al.",
        "(2009) we presented base distributions that favour small elementary trees which we expect will generalise well to unseen data.",
        "In this work we show that if Po is chosen such that it decomposes with the CFG rules contained within each elementary tree, then we can use a novel dynamic programming algorithm to sample derivations without ever enumerating all the elementary trees in the grammar.",
        "The model was trained using a local Gibbs sampler (Geman and Geman, 1984), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in which random variables are repeatedly sampled conditioned on the values of all other random variables in the model.",
        "To formulate the local sampler, we associate a binary variable with each non-root internal node of each tree in the training set, indicating whether that node is a substitution point or not (illustrated in Figure 1).",
        "The sampler then visits each node in a random schedule and resamples that node's substitution variable, where the probability of the two different configurations are given by (1).",
        "Parsing was performed using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler to draw derivation samples for a string, from which the best tree was recovered.",
        "However the sampler used for parsing was biased where n_c is the number number of times has been used to rewrite c in e_j, and n_ = e n_c because it used as its proposal distribution a truncated grammar which excluded all but a handful of the unseen elementary trees.",
        "Consequently the proposal had smaller support than the true model, voiding the MCMC convergence proofs."

        "Though our model is similar to Johnson et al.",
