        "Many text understanding applications, such as Question Answering (QA) and Information Extraction (IE), need to infer a target textual meaning from other texts.",
        "This need was proposed as a generic semantic inference task under the Textual Entailment (TE) paradigm (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "A fundamental component in semantic inference is the utilization of knowledge resources.",
        "However, a major obstacle to improving semantic inference performance is the lack of such knowledge (Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007).",
        "We address one prominent type of inference knowledge known as entailment rules, focusing specifically on rules between predicates, such as 'cure X == X recover'.",
        "We aim at highly accurate rule acquisition, for which utilizing manually constructed sources seem appropriate.",
        "The most widely used manual resource is WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Yet it is incomplete for generating entailment rules between predicates (Section 2.1).",
        "Hence, other manual resources should also be targeted.",
        "In this work, we explore how FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) could be effectively used for generating entailment rules between predicates.",
        "FrameNet is a manually constructed database based on Frame Semantics.",
        "It models the semantic argument structure of predicates in terms of prototypical situations called frames.",
        "Prior work utilized FrameNet's argument mapping capabilities but took entailment relations from other resources, namely WordNet.",
        "We propose a novel method for generating entailment rules from FrameNet by detecting the entailment relations implied in FrameNet.",
        "We utilize FrameNet's annotated sentences and relations between frames to extract both the entailment relations and their argument mappings.",
        "Our analysis shows that the rules generated by our algorithm have a reasonable \"per-rule\" accuracy of about 70%.",
        "We tested the generated rule-set on an entailment testbed derived from an IE benchmark and compared it both to WordNet and to state-of-the-art rule generation from FrameNet.",
        "Our experiment shows that our method outperforms prior work.",
        "In addition, our rule-set's performance is comparable to WordNet and it is complementary to WordNet when uniting the two resources.",
        "Finally, additional analysis shows that our rule-set accuracy is 90% in practical use."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "To generate entailment rules, two issues should be addressed: a) identifying the lexical entailment relations between predicates, e.g. 'cure == recover'; b) mapping argument positions, e.g. 'cure X == X recover'.",
        "The main approach for generating highly accurate rule-sets is to use manually constructed resources.",
        "To this end, most systems mainly utilize WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), being the most prominent lexical resource with broad coverage of predicates.",
        "Furthermore, some of its relations capture types of entailment relations, including synonymy, hypernymy, morphologically-derived, entailment and cause.",
        "Yet, WordNet is limited for entailment rule generation.",
        "First, many entailment relations, notably for the WordNet entailment and cause relation types, are missing, e.g. 'elect == vote'.",
        "Furthermore, WordNet does not include argument mapping between related predicates.",
        "Thus, only substitutable WordNet relations (synonymy and hypernymy), for which argument positions are preserved, could be used to generate entailment rules.",
        "The other non-substitutable relations, e.g. cause (' kill = die ) and morphologically-derived ('meet.v o meeting.n'), cannot be used.",
        "FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) is a knowledgebase of frames, describing prototypical situations.",
        "Frames can be related to each other by inter-frame relations, e.g. Inheritance, Precedence, Usage and Perspective.",
        "For each frame, several semantic roles are specified, called frame elements (FEs), denoting the participants in the situation described.",
        "Each FE may be labeled as core if it is central to the frame.",
        "For example, some core FEs of the Commerce .pay frame are Buyer and Goods, while a non-core FE is Place.",
        "Each FE may also be labeled with a semantic type, e.g. Sentient, Event, and Time.",
        "A frame includes a list of predicates that can evoke the described situation, called lexical units (LUs).",
        "LUs are mainly verbs but may also be nouns or adjectives.",
        "For example, the frame Commerce-pay lists the LUs pay.v and payment.n.",
        "Finally, FrameNet contains annotated sentences that represent typical LU occurrences in texts.",
        "Each annotation refers to one LU in a specific frame and the FEs of the frame that occur in the sentence.",
        "An example sentence is \"IÃŸuyer have to pay the billsMoney \".",
        "Each sentence is accompanied by a valence pattern, which provides, among other info, grammatical functions of the core FEs with respect to the LU.",
        "The valence pattern of the above sentence is [{Buyer Subj), (Money Obj)].",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the only work that utilized FrameNet for entailment rule generation is LexPar (Coyne and Rambow, 2009).",
        "LexPar first identifies lexical entailment relations by going over all LU pairs which are either in the same frame or whose frames are related by one of FrameNet s inter-frame relations.",
        "Each candidate pair is considered entailing if the two LUs are either synonyms or in a direct hypernymy relation in WordNet (providing the vast majority of LexPar s relations), or if their related frames are connected via the Perspective relation in FrameNet.",
        "Then, argument mappings between each entailing LU pair are extracted based on the core FEs that are shared between the two LUs.",
        "The syntactic positions of the shared FEs are taken from the valence patterns of the LUs.",
        "A LexPar rule example is presented in Figure 3 (top part).",
        "Since most of LexPar s entailment relations are based on WordNet s relations, LexPar s rules could be viewed as an intersection of WordNet and FrameNet lexical relations, accompanied with argument mappings taken from FrameNet."

      "text": [
        "The above prior work identified lexical entailment relations mainly from WordNet, which limits the use of FrameNet in two ways.",
        "First, some relations that appear in FrameNet are missed because they do not appear in WordNet.",
        "Second, unlike FrameNet, WordNet does not include argument mappings for its relations.",
        "Thus, prior work for rule generation considered only substitutable relations from WordNet (synonyms and hypernyms), not utilizing FrameNet s capability to map arguments of non-substitutable relations.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to generate entailment rules solely from the information within FrameNet.",
        "We present a novel algorithm for generating entailment rules from FrameNet, called FRED (FrameNet Entailment-rule Derivation), which operates in three steps: a) extracting templates for each LU; b) detecting lexical entailment relations between pairs of LUs; c) generating entailment rules by mapping the arguments between two LUs in each entailing pair.",
        "Many LUs in FrameNet are accompanied by annotated sentences (Section 2.2).",
        "From each sentence of a given LU, we extract one template for each annotated FE in the sentence.",
        "Each template includes the LU, one argument corresponding to the target FE and their syntactic relation in the sentence parse-tree.",
        "We focus on extracting unary templates, as they can describe any argument mapping by decomposing templates with several arguments into unary ones (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).",
        "Figure 1 exemplifies this process.",
        "As a pre-parsing step, all FE phrases in a given sentence are replaced by their related FE names, excluding syntactic information such as prepositions or possessives (step (b) in Figure 1).",
        "Then, the sentence is parsed using the Minipar dependency parser (Lin, 1998) (step (c)).",
        "Finally, a path in the parse-tree is extracted between each FE node and the node of the LU (step (d)).",
        "Each extracted path is converted into a template by replacing the FE node with an argument variable.",
        "We simplify each extracted path by removing nodes along the path that are not part of the syntactic relation between the LU and the FE, such as conjunctions and other FE nodes.",
        "For example, 'Authorities",
        "conj .",
        "enter â€“ > arrest is simplified into ' Authorities",
        "Some templates originated from different annotated sentences share the same LU and syntactic structure, but differ in their FEs.",
        "Usually, one of these templates is incorrect, due to erroneous parse (e.g. 'Suspect arrest' is a correct template, in contrast to 'Charges â€“ â€“ arrest').",
        "We thus keep only the most frequently annotated template out of the identical templates, assuming it is the correct one.",
        "FrameNet groups LUs in frames and describes relations between frames.",
        "However, relations between LUs are not explicitly defined.",
        "We next describe how we automatically extract several types of lexical entailment relations between LUs using two approaches.",
        "In the first approach, LUs in the same frame that are morphological derivations of each other, e.g. 'negotiation.n' and 'negotiate.v', are marked as paraphrases.",
        "We take morphological derivation information from the CATVAR database (Habash and Dorr, 2003).",
        "The second approach is based on our observation that some LUs express the prototypical situation that their frame describes, which we denote dominant LUs.",
        "For example, the LU 'recover' is dominant for the Recovery frame.",
        "We mark LUs as dominant if they are morphologically derived from the frame's name.",
        "Our assumption is that since dominant LUs express the frame's generic meaning, their meaning is likely to be entailed by the other LUs in this frame.",
        "Consequently, we generate such lexical rules between any dominant LU and any other LU in a given frame, e.g. heal = recover' and convalescence = recover' for the Recovery frame.",
        "In addition, we assume that if two frames are related by some type of entailment relation, their dominant LUs are also related by the same relation.",
        "Accordingly, we extract entailment relations between dominant LUs of frames that are connected via the Inheritance, Cause and Perspective relations, where Inheritance and Cause generate directional entailment relations (e.g. choose = decide' and cure = recover', respectively) while Perspective generates bidirectional paraphrase relations (e.g. 'transfer o receive').",
        "Finally, we generate the transitive closure of the set of lexical relations identified by the above methods.",
        "For example, the combination of 'sell o buy' and buy = get' generates sell = get'.",
        "The final step in the FRED algorithm generates lexical syntactic entailment rules from the extracted templates and lexical entailment relations.",
        "For each identified lexical relation 'left == right' between two LUs, the set of FEs that are shared by both LUs is collected.",
        "Then, for each shared FE, we take the list of templates that connect this FE",
        "Lexical Relation:",
        "cure == recovery Templates:",

        "to each of the LUs, denoted by T/jjt and Tf,eght.",
        "Finally, for each template pair, l G and r G Tright, the rule 'l == r' is generated.",
        "In addition, we generate paraphrase rules between the various templates including the same FE and the same LU.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates this process.",
        "To improve rule quality, we filter out rules that map FEs of adjunct-like semantic types, such as Time and Location, since different templates of such FEs may have different semantic meanings",
        "before after",
        "(e.g. 'Time â€“ â€“ arrive' 'Time â€“ â€“ arrive').",
        "Thus, it is hard to identify those template pairs that correctly map these FEs for entailment.",
