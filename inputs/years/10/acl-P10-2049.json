        "Over the last years the task of opinion mining (OM) has been the topic of many publications.",
        "It has been approached with different goals in mind: Some research strived to perform subjectivity analysis at the document or sentence level, without focusing on what the individual opinions uttered in the document are about.",
        "Other approaches focused on extracting individual opinion words or phrases and what they are about.",
        "This aboutness has been referred to as the opinion target or opinion topic in the literature from the field.",
        "In this work our goal is to extract opinion target - opinion word pairs from sentences from movie reviews.",
        "A challenge which is frequently encountered in text mining tasks at this level of granularity is, that entities are being referred to by anaphora.",
        "In the task of OM, it can therefore also be necessary to analyze more than the content of one individual sentence when extracting opinion targets.",
        "Consider this example sentence: \"Simply put, it's unfathomable that this movie cracks the Top 250.",
        "It is absolutely awful.\".",
        "If one wants to extract what the opinion in the second sentence is about, an algorithm which resolves the anaphoric reference to the opinion target is required.",
        "The extraction of such anaphoric opinion targets has been noted as an open issue multiple times in the OM context (Zhuang et al., 2006; Hu and Liu, 2004; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003).",
        "It is not a marginal phenomenon, since Kessler and Nicolov (2009) report that in their data, 14% of the opinion targets are pronouns.",
        "However, the task of resolving anaphora to mine opinion targets has not been addressed and evaluated yet to the best ofour knowledge.",
        "In this work, we investigate whether anaphora resolution (AR) can be successfully integrated into an OM algorithm and whether we can achieve an improvement regarding the OM in doing so.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the related work on opinion target identification and OM on movie reviews.",
        "Section 3 outlines the OM algorithm we employed by us, while in Section 4 we discuss two different algorithms for AR which we experiment with.",
        "Finally, in Section 5 we present our experimental work including error analysis and discussion, and we conclude in Section 6."

        "We split the description of the related work in two parts: In Section 2.1 we discuss the related work on OM with a focus on approaches for opinion target identification.",
        "In Section 2.2 we elaborate on findings from related OM research which also worked with movie reviews as this is our target domain in the present paper.",
        "The extraction of opinions and especially opinion targets has been performed with quite diverse approaches.",
        "Initial approaches combined statistical information and basic linguistic features such as part-of-speech tags.",
        "The goal was to identify the opinion targets, here in form of products and their attributes, without a pre-built knowledge base which models the domain.",
        "For the target candidate identification, simple part-of-speech patterns were employed.",
        "The relevance ranking and extraction was then performed with different statistical measures: Pointwise Mutual Information (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), the Likelihood Ratio Test (Yi et al., 2003) and Association Mining (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "A more linguistically motivated approach was taken by Kim and Hovy (2006) through identifying opinion holders and targets with semantic role labeling.",
        "This approach was promising, since their goal was to extract opinions from professionally edited content i.e. newswire.",
        "Zhuang et al.",
        "(2006) present an algorithm for the extraction of opinion target - opinion word pairs.",
        "The opinion word and target candidates are identified in the annotated corpus and their extraction is then performed by applying possible paths connecting them in a dependency graph.",
        "These paths are combined with part-of-speech information and also learned from the annotated corpus.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is currently only one system which integrates coreference information in OM.",
        "The algorithm by Stoyanov and Cardie (2008) identifies coreferring targets in newspaper articles.",
        "A candidate selection or extraction step for the opinion targets is not required, since they rely on manually annotated targets and focus solely on the coreference resolution.",
        "However they do not resolve pronominal anaphora in order to achieve that.",
        "There is a huge body of work on OM in movie reviews which was sparked by the dataset from Pang and Lee (2005).",
        "This dataset consists of sentences which are annotated as expressing positive or negative opinions.",
        "An interesting insight was gained from the document level sentiment analysis on movie reviews in comparison to documents from other domains: Turney (2002) observes that the movie reviews are hardest to classify since the review authors tend to give information about the storyline of the movie which often contain characterizations, such as \"bad guy\" or \"violent scene\" .",
        "These statements however do not reflect any opinions of the reviewers regarding the movie.",
        "Zhuang et al.",
        "(2006) also observe that movie reviews are different from e.g. customer reviews on Amazon.com.",
        "This is reflected in their experiments, in which their system outperforms the system by Hu and Liu (2004) which attributes an opinion target to the opinion word which is closest regarding word distance in a sentence.",
        "The sentences in the movie reviews tend to be more complex, which can also be explained by their origin.",
        "The reviews were taken from the Internet Movie Database, on which the users are given a set of guidelines on how to write a review.",
        "Due to these insights, we are confident that the overall textual quality of the movie reviews is high enough for linguistically more advanced technologies such as parsing or AR to be successfully applied."
