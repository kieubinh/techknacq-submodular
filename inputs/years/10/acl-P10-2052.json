        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) has earned an important place in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as an enabling process for other tasks.",
        "When explicitly taken into account, research shows that it helps such applications achieve better performance levels (Babych and Hartley, 2003; Thompson and Dozier, 1997).",
        "NER is defined as the computational identification and classification of Named Entities (NEs) in running text.",
        "For instance, consider the following text:",
        "Barack Obama is visiting the Middle East.",
        "A NER system should be able to identify Barack Obama and Middle East as NEs and classify them as Person (PER) and Geo-Political Entity (GPE), respectively.",
        "The class-set used to tag NEs may vary according to user needs.",
        "In this research, we adopt the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) 2007 nomenclature.",
        "According to (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007), optimization of the feature set is the key component in enhancing the performance of a global NER system.",
        "In this paper we investigate the possibility of building a high performance Arabic NER system by using a large space of available feature sets that go beyond the explored shallow feature sets used to date in the literature for Arabic NER.",
        "Given current state-of-the-art syntactic processing of Arabic text and the relative small size of manually annotated Arabic NER data, we set out to explore a main concrete research goal: to fully exploit the level of advancement in Arabic lexical and syntactic processing to explore deeper linguistic features for the NER task.",
        "Realizing that the gold data available for NER is quite limited in size especially given the diverse genres in the set, we devise a method to bootstrap additional instances for the new features of interest from noisily NER tagged Arabic data."

      "heading": "2. Our Approach",
      "text": [
        "We use our state-of-the-art NER system described in (Benajiba et al., 2008) as our baseline system (BASE) since it yields, to our knowledge, the best performance for Arabic NER .",
        "BASE employs Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as Machine Learning (ML) approaches.",
        "BASE uses lexical, syntactic and morphological features extracted using highly accurate automatic Arabic POS-taggers.",
        "BASE employs a multi-classifier approach where each classifier is tagging a NE class separately.",
        "The feature selection is performed by using an incremental approach selecting the top n features (the features are ranked according to their individual impact) at each iteration and keeping the set that yields the best results.",
        "In case of conflict - a word is classified with more than one class/tag simultaneously - the global NER system selects the output of the classifier with the highest precision.",
        "The following is the feature set used in (Bena-jiba et al., 2008) and accordingly in the BASE system.",
        "1.",
        "Context: a – / + 1 token window; 2.",
        "Lexical: character n – grams where n ranges from 1 – 3; 3.",
        "Gazetteers: automatically harvested and manually cleaned Person NE class (PER), Geopolitical Entity NE class (GPE), and Organization NE class (ORG) lexica; 4.",
        "POS-tag and Base Phrase Chunk (BPC): automatically tagged using AMIRA (Diab et al., 2007) which yields Fmeasures for both tasks in the high 90's; 5.",
        "Morphological features: automatically tagged using the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic (MADA) tool to extract information about gender, number, person, definiteness and aspect for each word (Habash and Rambow, 2005); 6.",
        "Capitalization: derived as a side effect from running MADA.",
        "MADA chooses a specific morphological analysis given the context of a given word.",
        "As part of the morphological information available in the underlying lexicon that MADA exploits.",
        "As part of the information present, the underlying lexicon has an English gloss associated with each entry.",
        "More often than not, if the word is a NE in Arabic then the gloss will also be a NE in English and hence capitalized.",
        "We devise an extended Arabic NER system (EXTENDED) that uses the same architecture as BASE but employs additional features to those in BASE.",
        "EXTENDED defines new additional syn-tagmatic features.",
        "We specifically investigate the space of the surrounding context for the NEs.",
        "We explore generalizations over the kinds of words that occur with NEs and the syntactic relations NEs engage in.",
        "We use an off-the-shelf Arabic syntactic parser.",
        "State-of-the-art for Arabic syntactic parsing for the most common genre (with the most training data) of Arabic data, newswire, is in the low 80%s.",
        "Hence, we acknowledge that some of the derived syntactic features will be noisy.",
        "Similar to all supervised ML problems, it is desirable to have sufficient training data for the relevant phenomena.",
        "The size of the manually annotated gold data typically used for training Arabic NER systems poses a significant challenge for robustly exploring deeper syntactic and lexical features.",
        "Accordingly, we bootstrap more NE tagged data via projection over Arabic-English parallel data.",
        "The role of this data is simply to give us more instances of the newly defined features (namely the syntagmatic features) in the EXTENDED system as well as more instances for the Gazetteers and Context features defined in BASE.",
        "It is worth noting that we do not use the bootstrapped NE tagged data directly as training data with the gold data.",
        "For deriving our deeper linguistic features, we parse the Arabic sentences that contain an NE.",
        "For each of the NEs, we extract a number of features described as follows:",
        "- Syntactic headword (SHW): The idea here is to look for a broader relevant context.",
        "Whereas the feature lexical n-gram context feature used in BASE, and hence here for EXTENDED, considers the linearly adjacent neighboring words of a NE, SHW uses a parse tree to look at farther, yet related, words.",
        "For instance, in the Arabic phrase \"SrH Ams An bArAk AwbAma ytrAs\", which means \"declared yesterday that Barack Obama governs glossed \"SrH'declared Ams/yesterday An/that bArAk/Barack AwbAmA/Obama ytrAs/governs ...\", is parsed in Figure 1.",
        "According to the phrase structure parse, the first parent sub-tree headword of the NE \"bArAk AwbAmA\" is the verb 'ytrAs' (governs), the second one is 'An' (that) and the third one is the verb 'SrH' (declared).",
        "This example illustrates that the word \"Ams\" is ignored for this feature set since it is not a syntactic head.",
        "This is a lexicalized feature.",
        "- Syntactic Environment (SE): This follows in the same spirit as SHW, but expands the idea in that it looks at the parent non-terminal instead of the parent head word, hence it is not a lexicalized feature.",
        "The goal being to use a more abstract representation level of the context in which a NE appears.",
        "For instance, for the same example presented in Figure 1, the first, second, and third nonterminal parents of the NE \"bArAk AwbAmA\" are 'S', 'SBAR' and 'VP', respectively.",
        "In our experiments we use the Bikel implementation (Bikel, 2004) of the Collins parser (Collins, 1999) which is freely available on the web.",
        "It is a head-driven CFG-style parser trained to parse English, Arabic, and Chinese.",
        "Extracting the syntagmatic features from the training data yields relatively small number of instances.",
        "Hence the need for additional tagged data.",
        "The new Arabic NER tagged data is derived via projection exploiting parallel Arabic English data.",
        "The process depends on the availability of two key components: a large Arabic English parallel corpus that is sentence and word aligned, and a robust high performing English NER system.",
        "The process is as follows.",
        "We NE tag the",
        "English side of the parallel corpus.",
        "We project the automatically tagged NER tags from the English side to the Arabic side of the parallel corpus.",
        "In our case, we have access to a large manually aligned parallel corpus, therefore the NER projection is direct.",
        "However, the English side of the parallel corpus is not NER tagged, hence we use an off-the-shelf competitive robust automatic English NER system which has a published performance of 92% (Zitouni and Florian, 2009).",
        "The result of these two processes is a large Arabic NER, albeit noisy, tagged data set.",
        "As mentioned earlier this data is used only for deriving additional instances for training for the syntagmatic features and for the context and gazetteer features.",
        "Given this additional source of data, we changed the lexical features extracted from the BASE to the EXTENDED.",
        "We added two other lexical features: CBG and NGC, described as follows: - Class Based Gazetteers (CBG): This feature focuses on the surface form of the NEs.",
        "We group the NEs encountered on the Arabic side of the parallel corpus by class as they are found in different dictionaries.",
        "The difference between this feature and that in BASE is that the Gazetteers are not restricted to Wikipedia sources.",
        "- N-gram context (NGC): Here we disregard the surface form of the NE, instead we focus on its lexical context.",
        "For each n, where n varies from 1 to 3, we compile a list of the – n, +n, and – / + n words surrounding the NE.",
        "Similar to the CBG feature, these lists are also separated by NE class.",
        "It is worth highlighting that the NCG feature is different from the Context feature in BASE in that the window size is different +/ – 1 – 3 for",
        "EXTENDED versus +/ – 1 for BASE."
