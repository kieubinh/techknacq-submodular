        "Sequence extraction has two parts: identifying possible extractions (x, k, s) from text, and then classifying those extractions as either correct or incorrect.",
        "In the following section, we describe a way to identify candidate extractions from text using a set of lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "We then show that classifying extractions based on sentence-level features and redundancy alone yields low precision, which is improved by leveraging the functionality and density properties of sequences as done in our Seq system.",
        "Table 2: The patterns used by Seq to detect ordinal phrases are noun phrases that begin with one of the part-of-speech patterns listed above.",
        "To obtain candidate sequence extractions (x, k, s) from text, the seq system finds sentences in its input corpus that contain an ordinal phrase (OP).",
        "Table 2 lists the lexico-syntactic patterns Seq uses to detect ordinal phrases.",
        "The value of k is set to the integer corresponding to the ordinal number in the OP.",
        "Next, Seq takes each sentence that contains an ordinal phrase o, and finds candidate items of the form (x, k) for the sequence with name s. seq constrains x to be an NP that is disjoint from o, and s to be an NP (which may have post-modifying PPs or clauses) following the ordinal number in o.",
        "For example, given the sentence \"With help from his father, JFK was elected as the 35th President of the United States in 1960\", Seq finds the candidate sequences with names \"President\", \"President of the United States\", and \"President of the United States in 1960\", each of which has candidate extractions (JFK, 35), (his father, 35), and (help, 35).",
        "We use heuristics to filter out many of the candidate values (e.g., no value should cross a sentence-like boundary, and x should be at most some distance from the OP).",
        "This process of generating candidate extractions has high coverage, but low precision.",
        "The first step in identifying correct extractions is to compute a confidence measure localConf(x,k,s\\sentence), which measures how likely (x,k,s) is given the sentence it came from.",
        "We do this using domain-independent syntactic features based on POS tags and the pattern-based features \"x {is,are,was,were} the kth s\" and \"the kth s {is,are,was,were} x\".",
        "The features are then combined using a Naive Bayes classifier.",
        "In addition to the local, sentence-based features, we define the measure totalConf that takes into account redundancy in an input corpus C. As Downey et al.",

        "The sequence name \"President of the United States in 1960\" is too specific - there were not multiple U.S. presidents in 1960.",
        "These errors can be explained as violations of functionality and density.",
        "The sequence with name \"President\" will have many distinct candidate extractions in its positions, which is a violation of functionality.",
        "The sequence with name \"President of the United States in 1960\" will not satisfy density, since it will have extractions for only one position.",
        "In the next section, we present the details of how SEQ incorporates functionality and density into its assessment of a candidate extraction.",
        "Given an extraction (x,k,s), SEQ must classify it as either correct or incorrect.",
        "SEQ breaks this problem down into two parts: (1) determining whether s is a correct sequence name, and (2) determining whether (x, k) is an item in s, assuming s is correct.",
        "A joint probabilistic model of these two decisions would require a significant amount of labeled data.",
        "To get around this problem, we represent each (x, k, s) as a vector of features and train two Naive Bayes classifiers: one for classifying s and one for classifying (x,k).",

        "We now describe the features used in the two classifiers and how the classifiers are trained.",
        "Classifying Sequences To classify a sequence name s, Seq uses features to measure the functionality and density of s. Functionality means that a correct sequence with name s has one correct value x at each position k, possibly with additional noise due to extraction errors and synonymous values of x.",
