        "Our own research, and that of other contemporary projects (Janin et al., 2004) aim at meeting this demand.",
        "We are currently investigating the automatic detection of decision discussions.",
        "Our approach involves distinguishing between different dialogue act (DA) types based on their role in the decision-making process.",
        "These DA types are called Decision Dialogue Acts (DDAs).",
        "Groups of DDAs combine to form a decision region.",
        "Recent work (Bui et al., 2009) showed that Directed Graphical Models (DGMs) outperform other machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for detecting individual DDAs.",
        "However, the proposed models, which were non-hierarchical, did not significantly improve identification of decision regions.",
        "This paper tests whether giving DGMs hierarchical structure (making them HGMs) can improve their performance at this task compared with non-hierarchical DGMs.",

        "With the new availability of substantial meeting corpora such as the AMI corpus (McCowan et al., 2005), recent years have seen an increasing amount of research on decision-making dialogue.",
        "This research has tackled issues such as the automatic detection of agreement and disagreement (Galley et al., 2004), and of the level of involvement of conversational participants (Gatica-Perez et al., 2005).",

        "The authors annotated a portion of the AMI corpus, and then applied what they refer to as \"hierarchical classification.\"",
        "Here, one sub-classifier per DDA class hypothesizes occurrences of that type of DDA and then, based on these hypotheses, a super-classifier determines which regions of dialogue are decision discussions.",
        "All of the classifiers, (sub and super), were linear kernel binary SVMs.",
        "Results were better than those obtained with (Hsueh and Moore, 2007)'s approach – the Fl-score for detecting decision discussions in manual transcripts was 0.58 vs. 0.50.",

        "(2009) built on the promising results of (Fernandez et al., 2008), by employing DGMs in place of SVMs.",
        "DGMs are attractive because they provide a natural framework for modeling sequence and dependencies between variables, including the DDAs.",
        "Bui et al.",
        "(2009) were especially interested in whether DGMs better exploit non-lexical features.",
        "Fernandez et al.",
        "(2008) obtained much more value from lexical than non-lexical features (and indeed no value at all from prosodic features), but lexical features have limitations.",
        "In particular, they can be domain specific, increase the size of the feature space dramatically, and deteriorate more in quality than other features when automatic speech recognition (ASR) is poor.",
        "More detail about decision detection using DGMs will be presented in section 4.",
        "Beyond decision detection, DGMs are used for labeling and segmenting sequences of observations in many different fields – including bioin-formatics, ASR, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and information extraction.",
        "In particular, Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) are a popular model for probabilistic sequence modeling because they exploit structure in the problem to compactly represent distributions over multi-state and observation variables.",
        "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a special case of DBNs, are a classical method for important NLP applications such as unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Gael et al., 2009) and grammar induction (Johnson et al., 2007) as well as for ASR.",
        "More complex DBNs have been used for applications such as DA recognition (Crook et al., 2009) and activity recognition (Bui et al., 2002).",

        "Random Fields (CRFs), a simple UGM case, can avoid the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001) and outperform maximum entropy Markov models and HMMs.",

        "Only Sutton et al.",
        "(2007) proposed a three-level HGM (in the form of a dynamic CRF) for the joint noun phrase chunking and part of speech labeling problem; they showed that this model performs better than a non-hierarchical counterpart.",
        "For the experiments reported in this study, we used 17 meetings from the AMI Meeting Corpus, a freely available corpus of multi-party meetings with both audio and video recordings, and a wide range of annotated information including DAs and topic segmentation.",
        "The meetings last around 30 minutes each, and are scenario-driven, wherein four participants play different roles in a company's design team: project manager, marketing expert, interface designer and industrial designer.",
        "We use the same annotation scheme as Fernandez et al.",
        "(2008) to model decision-making dialogue.",
        "As stated in section 2, this scheme distinguishes between a small number of DA types based on the role which they perform in the formulation of a decision.",
        "Besides improving the detection of decision discussions (Fernandez et al., 2008), such a scheme also aids in summarization of them, because it indicates which utterances provide particular types of information.",
        "The annotation scheme is based on the observation that a decision discussion typically contains the following main structural components: (a) A topic or issue requiring resolution is raised; (b) One or more possible resolutions are considered; (c) A particular resolution is agreed upon, and so adopted as the decision.",
        "Hence the scheme distinguishes between three main DDA classes: issue (I), resolution (R), and agreement (A).",
        "Class R is further subdivided into resolution proposal (RP) and resolution restatement (RR).",
        "I utterances introduce the topic of the decision discussion, examples being \"Are we going to have a backup?\"",
        "and \"But would a backup really be necessary?\"",
        "in Table 1.",
        "In comparison, R utterances specify the resolution which is ultimately adopted as the deci-",

        "Finally, A utterances agree with the proposed resolution, signaling that it is adopted as the decision, (e.g. \"Yeah\", \"Good\" and \"Okay\").",
        "Unsurprisingly, an utterance may be assigned to more than one DDA class; and within a decision discussion, more than one utterance can be assigned to the same DDA class.",
        "We use manual transcripts in the experiments described here.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement was satisfactory, with kappa values ranging from .63 to .73 for the four DDA classes.",
        "The manual transcripts contain a total of 15,680 utterances, and on average 40 DDAs per meeting.",
        "DDAs are sparse in the transcripts: for all DDAs, 6.7% of the totality of utterances; for I,1.6%; for RP, 2%; for RR, 0.5%; and for A, 2.6%.",
