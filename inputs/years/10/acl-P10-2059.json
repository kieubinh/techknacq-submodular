        "Several authors in communication studies have pointed out that head movements are relevant to feedback phenomena (see McClave (2000) for an overview).",

        "For example, Jokinen and Ragni (2007) and Jokinen et al.",
        "(2008) find that machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognise some of the functions of head movements, while Reidsma et al.",
        "(2009) show that there is a dependence between focus of attention and assignment of dialogue act labels.",
        "Related are also the studies by Rieks op den Akker and Schulz (2008) and Murray and Renals (2008): both achieve promising results in the automatic segmentation of dialogue acts using the annotations in a large multimodal corpus.",
        "Work has also been done on prosody and gestures in the specific domain of map-task dialogues, also targeted in this paper.",
        "Sridhar et al.",
        "(2009) obtain promising results in dialogue act tagging of the Switchboard-DAMSL corpus using lexical, syntactic and prosodic cues, while Gravano and Hirschberg (2009) examine the relation between particular acoustic and prosodic turn-yielding cues and turn taking in a large corpus of task-oriented dialogues.",
        "Louwerse et al.",
        "(2006) and Louwerse et al.",
        "(2007) study the relation between eye gaze, facial expression, pauses and dialogue structure in annotated English map-task dialogues (Anderson et al., 1991) and find correlations between the various modalities both within and across speakers.",
        "Finally, feedback expressions (head nods and shakes) are successfully predicted from speech, prosody and eye gaze in interaction with Embodied Communication Agents as well as human communication (Fujie et al., 2004; Morency et al., 2005; Morency et al., 2007; Morency et al., 2009).",
        "Our work is in line with these studies, all of which focus on the relation between linguistic expressions, prosody, dialogue content and gestures.",
        "In this paper, we investigate how feedback expressions can be classified into different dialogue act categories based on prosodic and gesture features.",
        "Our data are made up by a collection of eight video-recorded map-task dialogues in Danish, which were annotated with phonetic and prosodic information.",
        "We find that prosodic features improve the classification of dialogue acts and that head gestures, where they occur, contribute to the semantic interpretation of feedback expressions.",
        "The results, which partly confirm those obtained on a smaller dataset in Paggio and Navarretta (2010), must be seen in light of the fact that our gesture annotation scheme comprises more fine-grained categories than most of the studies mentioned earlier for both head movements and face expressions.",
        "The classification results improve, however, if similar categories such as head nods and jerks are collapsed into a more general category.",

        "In addition to this, the acoustic signals are segmented into words, syllables and prosodic phrases, and annotated with POS-tags, phonological and phonetic transcriptions, pitch and intonation contours.",
        "Phonetic and prosodic segmentation and annotation were performed independently and in parallel by two annotators and then an agreed upon version was produced with the supervision of an expert annotator, for more information see Gr0nnum (2006).",

        "Weenink, 2009).",

        "They can be single words or multi-word expressions.",
        "Yes and No feedback expressions represent about 9% of the approximately 47,000 running words in the corpus.",
        "This is a rather high proportion compared to other corpora, both spoken and written, and a reason why we decided to use the DanPASS videos in spite of the fact that the gesture behaviour is relatively limited given the fact that the two dialogue participants cannot see each other.",
        "Furthermore, the restricted contexts in which feedback expressions occur in these dialogues allow for a very fine-grained analysis of the relation of these expressions with prosody and gestures.",
        "Feedback behaviour, both in speech and gestures, can be observed especially in the person who is receiving the instructions (the follower).",
        "Therefore, we decided to focus our analysis only on the follower's part of the interaction.",

        "These two sets of data were used for automatic dialogue act classification, which was run in the Weka system (Witten and Frank, 2005).",
        "We experimented with various Weka classifiers, comprising Hidden Naive Bayes, SMO, ID3, LADTree and Decision Table.",
        "The best results on most of our data were obtained using Hidden Naive Bayes (HNB) (Zhang et al., 2005).",
        "Therefore, here we show the results of this classifier.",
        "Ten-folds cross-validation was applied throughout.",
        "In the first group of experiments we took into consideration all the Yes and No expressions (420 Yes and 46 No) without, however, considering gesture information.",
        "The purpose was to see how prosodic information contributes to the classification of dialogue acts.",
        "We started by totally leaving out prosody, i.e. only the orthographic transcription (Yes and No expressions) was considered; then we included information about stress (stressed or unstressed); in the third run we added tone attributes, and in the fourth information on hesitation.",
        "Agreement and turn attributes were used in all experiments, while Dialogue act annotation was only used in the training phase.",
        "The baseline for the evaluation are the results provided by Weka's ZeroR classifier, which always selects the most frequent nominal class.",
        "In Table 5 we provide results in terms of precision (P), recall (R) and F-measure (F).",
        "These are calculated in Weka as weighted averages of the results obtained for each class.",
        "The results indicate that prosodic information improves the classification of dialogue acts with respect to the baseline in all four experiments with improvements of 10, 10.6, 10.9 and 10.8%, respectively.",
        "The best results are obtained using information on stress and tone, although the decrease in accuracy when hesitations are introduced is not significant.",
        "The confusion matrices show that the classifier is best at identifying Accept, while it is very bad at identifying RepeatRephrase.",
        "This result if not surprising since the former type is much more frequent in the data than the latter, and since prosodic information does not correlate with RepeatRephrase in any systematic way.",
        "The second group of experiments was conducted on the dataset where feedback expressions are accompanied by gestures (102 Yes and 12 No).",
        "The purpose this time was to see whether gesture information improves dialogue act classification.",
        "We believe it makes sense to perform the test based on this restricted dataset, rather than the entire material, because the portion of data where gestures do accompany feedback expressions is rather small (about 20%).",
        "In a different domain, where subjects are less constrained by the technical setting, we expect gestures would make for a stronger and more widespread effect.",
