        "The Web holds a massive number of reviews describing the sentiments of customers about products and services.",
        "These reviews can help the user reach purchasing decisions and guide companies' business activities such as product improvements.",
        "It is, however, almost impossible to read all reviews given their sheer number.",
        "These reviews are best utilized by the development of automatic text summarization, particularly sentiment summarization.",
        "It enables us to efficiently grasp the key bits of information.",
        "Sentiment summarizers are divided into two categories in terms of output style.",
        "One outputs lists of sentences (Hu and Liu, 2004; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008), the other outputs texts consisting of ordered sentences (Carenini et al., 2006; Carenini and Cheung, 2008; Lerman et al., 2009; Lerman and McDonald, 2009).",
        "Our work lies in the latter category, and a typical summary is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Although visual representations such as bar or rader charts",
        "This restaurant offers customers delicious foods and a relaxing atmosphere.",
        "The staff are very friendly but the price is a little high.",
        "are helpful, such representations necessitate some simplifications of information to presentation.",
        "In contrast, text can present complex information that can't readily be visualized, so in this paper we focus on producing textual summaries.",
        "One crucial weakness of existing text-oriented summarizers is the poor readability of their results.",
        "Good readability is essential because readability strongly affects text comprehension (Barzilay et al., 2002).",
        "To achieve readable summaries, the extracted sentences must be appropriately ordered (Barzilay et al., 2002; Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005).",

        "Lapata (2003) proposed an algorithm that computes the probability of two sentences being adjacent for ordering sentences.",
        "Both methods delink sentence extraction from sentence ordering, so a sentence can be extracted that cannot be ordered naturally with the other extracted sentences.",
        "To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm that chooses sentences and orders them simultaneously in such a way that the ordered sentences maximize the scores of informativeness and readability.",
        "Our algorithm efficiently searches for the best sequence of sentences by using dynamic programming and beam search.",
        "We verify that our method generates summaries that are significantly better than the baseline results in terms of ROUGE score (Lin, 2004) and subjective readability measures.",
        "As far as we know, this is the first work to simultaneously achieve both informativeness and readability in the area of multi-document summarization.",

        "Formally, we define a summary S* = (so,si,... ,sn,sn+1) as a sequence consisting of n sentences where so and sn+1 are symbols indicating the beginning and ending of the sequence, respectively.",
        "Summary S * is also defined as follows:",
        "where Info(S) indicates the informativeness score of S, Read(S) indicates the readability score of S, T indicates possible sequences composed of sentences in the target documents, X is a weight parameter balancing informativeness against readability, length(S) is the length of S, and K is the maximum size of the summary.",
        "We introduce the informativeness score and the readability score, then describe how to optimize a sequence.",
        "Since we attempt to summarize reviews, we assume that a good summary must involve as many sentiments as possible.",
        "Therefore, we define the informativeness score as follows:",
        "where e indicates sentiment e = (a, p) as the tuple of aspect a and polarity p = { – 1, 0,1}, E(S) is the set of sentiments contained S, and f (e) is the score of sentiment e. Aspect a represents a standpoint for evaluating products and services.",
        "With regard to restaurants, aspects include food, atmosphere and staff.",
        "Polarity represents whether the sentiment is positive or negative.",
        "In this paper, we define p = – 1 as negative, p = 0 as neutral and p = 1 as positive sentiment.",
        "Notice that Equation 2 defines the informativeness score of a summary as the sum of the score of the sentiments contained in S. To avoid duplicative sentences, each sentiment is counted only once for scoring.",
        "In addition, the aspects are clustered and similar aspects (e.g. air, ambience) are treated as the same aspect (e.g. atmosphere).",
        "In this paper we define f (e) as the frequency of e in the target documents.",
        "Sentiments are extracted using a sentiment lexicon and pattern matched from dependency trees of sentences.",
        "The sentiment lexicon consists of pairs of sentiment expressions and their polarities, for example, delicious, friendly and good are positive sentiment expressions, bad and expensive are negative sentiment expressions.",
        "To extract sentiments from given sentences, first, we identify sentiment expressions among words consisting of parsed sentences.",
        "For example, in the case of the sentence \"This restaurant offers customers delicious foods and a relaxing atmosphere.\"",
        "in Figure 1, delicious and relaxing are identified as sentiment expressions.",
        "If the sentiment expressions are identified, the expressions and its aspects are extracted as aspect-sentiment expression pairs from dependency tree using some rules.",
        "In the case of the example sentence, foods and delicious, atmosphere and relaxing are extracted as aspect-sentiment expression pairs.",
        "Finally extracted sentiment expressions are converted to polarities, we acquire the set of sentiments from sentences, for example, ( foods, 1) and ( atmosphere, 1).",
        "Note that since our method relies on only sentiment lexicon, extractable aspects are unlimited.",
        "Readability consists of various elements such as conciseness, coherence, and grammar.",
        "Since it is difficult to model all of them, we approximate readability as the natural order of sentences.",
        "To order sentences, Barzilay et al.",
        "(2002) used the publication dates of documents to catch temporally-ordered events, but this approach is not really suitable for our goal because reviews focus on entities rather than events.",
        "Lapata (2003) employed the probability of two sentences being adjacent as determined from a corpus.",
        "If the corpus consists of reviews, it is expected that this approach would be effective for sentiment summarization.",
        "Therefore, we adopt and improve Lapata's approach to order sentences.",
        "We define the readability score as follows:",
        "where, given two adjacent sentences si and si+1, wT^(si, si+1), which measures the connectivity of the two sentences, is the inner product of w and ^(si,si+1), w is a parameter vector and ^(si, si+1) is a feature vector of the two sentences.",
        "That is, the readability score ofsentence sequence S is the sum of the connectivity of all adjacent sentences in the sequence.",
        "As the features, Lapata (2003) proposed the Cartesian product of content words in adjacent sentences.",
        "To this, we add named entity tags (e.g. LOC, ORG) and connectives.",
        "We observe that the first sentence of a review of a restaurant frequently contains named entities indicating location.",
        "We aim to reproduce this characteristic in the ordering.",
        "We also define feature vector $(S) of the entire sequence S = (s0,s1,... ,sn, sn+1) as follows:",
        "Therefore, the score of sequence S is wT$(S).",
        "Given a training set, if a trained parameter w assigns a score wT$(S+) to an correct order S+ that is higher than a score wT$(S~) to an incorrect order S-, it is expected that the trained parameter will give higher score to naturally ordered sentences than to unnaturally ordered sentences.",
        "We use Averaged Perceptron (Collins, 2002) to find w. Averaged Perceptron requires an argmax operation for parameter estimation.",
        "Since we attempt to order a set of sentences, the operation is regarded as solving the Traveling Salesman Problem; that is, we locate the path that offers maximum score through all n sentences as s0 and sn+1 are starting and ending points, respectively.",
        "Thus the operation is NP-hard and it is difficult to find the global optimal solution.",
        "To alleviate this, we find an approximate solution by adopting the dynamic programming technique of the Held and Karp Algorithm (Held and Karp, 1962) and beam search.",
        "We show the search procedure in Figure 2.",
        "S indicates intended sentences and M is a distance matrix of the readability scores of adjacent sentence pairs.",
        "Hi(C,j) indicates the score of the hypothesis that has covered the set of i sentences C and has the sentence j at the end of the path, i.e. the last sentence of the summary being generated.",
        "For example, H({s0, s2, s5}, s2) indicates a hypothesis that covers s0,s2, s5 and the last sentence is s2.",
        "Initially, H({s0}, s0) is assigned the score of 0, and new sentences are then added one by one.",
        "In the search procedure, our dynamic programming based algorithm retains just the hypothesis with maximum score among the hypotheses that have the same sentences and the same last sentence.",
        "Since this procedure is still computationally hard, only the top b hypotheses are expanded.",
        "Note that our method learns w from texts automatically annotated by a POS tagger and a named entity tagger.",
        "Thus manual annotation isn't required.",
        "The argmax operation in Equation 1 also involves search, which is NP-hard as described in Section 2.2.",
        "Therefore, we adopt the Held and Karp Algorithm and beam search to find approximate solutions.",
        "The search algorithm is basically the same as parameter estimation, except for its calculation of the informativeness score and size limitation.",
        "Therefore, when a new sentence is added to a hypothesis, both the informativeness and the readability scores are calculated.",
        "The size of the hypothesis is also calculated and if the size exceeds the limit, the sentence can't be added.",
        "A hypothesis that can't accept any more sentences is removed from the search procedure and preserved in memory.",
        "After all hypotheses are removed, the best hypothesis is chosen from among the preserved hypotheses as the solution."
