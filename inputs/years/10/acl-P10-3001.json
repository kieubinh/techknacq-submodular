        "Most approaches to modeling conversation are based on a strong notion of cooperation between the dialogue participants (DPs).",
        "Traditional models using intentions (Cohen and Levesque, 1991), dialogue games (Power, 1979), shared plans (Grosz and Sidner, 1990) or collaborative problem-solving (Blaylock and Allen, 2005) explain dialogue situations in which DPs recognise each other's intentions and, at least to a certain extent, accept each other's goals when deciding on their actions.",
        "These assumptions are theoretically grounded, as most work in linguistics has considered situations in which DPs share a common goal and cooperate to achieve it by means of conversation (Grice, 1975; Clark and Schaefer, 1989).",
        "They are also practically sound: dialogue models are usually implemented in the form of dialogue systems, built for the purpose of providing a service to their users (e.g., trains (Allen and Schubert, 1991)).",
        "In this scenario, failure to cooperate, either on the side of the system or of the user, is against the premises on which the system is conceived and used.",
        "In everyday conversation, however, a great many situations escape the arguments above.",
        "Consider the following example :",
        "(interrupting) Did you threaten to overrule him?",
        "i, i, was not entitled to instruct Derek Lewis, and i did not instruct him.",
        "Did you threaten to overrule him?",
        "The truth of the matter is that Mr. Marriott was not suspended.",
        "i... (overlapping) Did you threaten to overrule him?",
        "... did not overrule Derek Lewis.",
        "Did you threaten to overrule him?",
        "i took advice on what i could or could not do...",
        "(overlapping) Did you threaten to overrule him, Mr. Howard?",
        "... and i acted scrupulously in accordance with that advice, i did not overrule Derek Lewis... (overlapping) Did you threaten to overrule him?",
        "... Mr. Marriott was not suspended.",
        "Did you threaten to overrule him?",
        "(pauses) i have accounted for my decision to dismiss Derek Lewis... (overlapping) Did you threaten to overrule him?",
        "... in great detail, before the House of Commons.",
        "i note that you're not answering the question of whether you threatened to overrule him.",
        "We take it for granted that, at some level, Paxman and Howard are sharing a goal, for otherwise they would not be having an interview.",
        "Still, the exchange is clearly conflictive, to the point that their behaviour compromises the flow of the conversation.",
        "Heritage (1998) analyses the distinctive roles of DPs in news interviews:",
        "!BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman questions former UK Home Secretary Michael Howard with respect to a meeting in 1995 between Howard and the head of the Prison Service, Derek Lewis, about the dismissal of the governor of Parkhurst Prison, John Marriott, due to repeated security failures.",
        "The case was given considerable attention in the media, as a result of accusations by Lewis that Howard had instructed him, thus exceeding the powers of his office.",

        "If 1rs restrict themselves to asking questions, then they cannot - at least overtly - express opinions, or argue with, debate or criticize the interviewees' positions nor, conversely, agree with, support or defend them.",
        "Correspondingly, if ies restrict themselves to answers (or responses) to questions, then they cannot ask questions (of irs or other ies), nor make unsolicited comments on previous remarks, initiate changes of topic, or divert the discussion into criticisms of their or the broadcasting organization.\"",
        "Now, consider the fragment below:",
        "(2) Paxman [1]: Can you clear up whether or not you did threaten to overrule Derek Lewis when you were Home Secretary?",
        "Howard [2]: Oh, come on, Jeremy, you are really going to go back over that again?",
        "As...",
        "Paxman [3]: (overlapping) You've had seven years to think about it!",
        "Howard[4]: (overlapping)...as, as it happens, I didn't.",
        "Are you satisfied now?",
        "Paxman [5]: Thank you.",
        "Why didn't you say that at the time?",
        "Howard [6]: I, well, we've been over this many, many times.",
        "I, I, I knew that everyone was crawling over every syllable I said about that, and I wanted to check very carefully what I said before answering your question.",
        "On this occasion, Howard provides an answer almost immediately and the flow of the conversation contrasts noticeably with that in (1).",
        "The investigation reported in this article aims at shedding light on the nature of non-cooperation in dialogue, by capturing the intuitions that allow us to differentiate between both conversations in terms of participant behaviour.",
        "Dialogue games supporters could say that there is a game that describes the interaction in the first example.",
        "While this might be true, such an approach would force us, in the limit, to define one game for each possible conversation that would not fit a certain standard.",
        "Walton and Krabbe (1995) attempt a game-based approach in their study of natural argumentation.",
        "They claim that a rigorous model of conversational interaction is useful, but accept that most of the huge variety of everyday conversation escapes it.",
        "Dialogue games are based on strict rules that capture typical dialogue situations while leaving out considerable detail.",
        "As example (1) shows, DPs behaviour can divert from the typical case in unexpected ways, falling outside the characterisation.",
        "Nevertheless, the rules and patterns captured by game models are useful, as they describe the expected behaviour of the DPs under a certain conversational scenario.",
        "In our research, we aim at reconciling two worlds, using the insights from dialogue games to provide a description of expected behaviour in the form of social obligations, but looking at naturally occurring cases that deviate from the norm.",
        "This, in turn, calls for a technique to measure non-cooperation in dialogue and in this paper we provide one that is theoretically sound and supported by empirical evidence.",
        "The following section discusses levels of cooperation in dialogue; Section 3 presents an empirical study and a practical measure of non-cooperation in political interviews; in Section 4 we discuss related work, our working hypothesis and a methodology; and Section 5 has the conclusions."

        "Cooperation in dialogue can happen at different levels.",
        "In most cases, conversation supports a social activity that constrains the behaviour acceptable or expected from the participants.",
        "In addition, conversational behaviour determines how cooperatively participants engage in a social activity.",
        "However, cooperation at the conversational level does not necessarily translate to the social level.",
        "Consider, for instance, a witness under interrogation in a U.S. trial refusing to answer a question by appealing to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.",
        "Such behaviour will be accepted in the conversational setting as established by law, although it is not cooperative in relation with the goals of the trial.",
        "Non-cooperation at the conversational level, on the other hand, usually results in lack of cooperation at the social level.",
        "Take as an example, the same witness remaining silent, rather than answering or appealing to the Fifth Amendment.",
        "To illustrate further, consider a fictional alternative to (1), where Howard replies by saying \"I will not answer that question, as it is not relevant to whether I exceeded the powers of my office\".",
        "This is not cooperative for the interview, but it is so at the linguistic level.",
        "It would help in preserving the flow of the conversation, e.g., by triggering a sub-dialogue to solve the disagreement.",
        "The distinction between linguistic and non-linguistic (also called task-related, high-level or social) cooperation has been addressed before.",
        "At-tardo (1997) revisits Gricean pragmatics, relating non-linguistic cooperation to participants' behaviour towards realising task-related goals, and linguistic cooperation to assumptions on their respective behaviour in order to encode and decode intended meaning.",
        "From a computational perspective, Bunt (1994) relies on a similar distinction for defining dialogue acts.",
        "Also, Traum and Allen (1994) introduce discourse obligations as an alternative to joint intentions and shared plans, to allow for models of dialogues in which participants do not share the same high-level goals and where behaviour is also determined by \"a sense of obligation to behave within limits set by the society\" (Traum and Allen, 1994, p.2).",
        "Walton and Krabbe (1995) proposed a typology of dialogue based on the initial situation triggering the exchange and participants' shared aims and individual goals.",
        "Based on their work, Reed and Long (1997) distinguish cases where participants follow a common set of dialogue rules and stay within a mutually acknowledged framework from a stronger notion in which their individual goals are in the same direction.",
        "Borrowing from the latter, in the rest of the paper, we will speak of collaboration when DPs share the same task-level goals, and use cooperation when participants follow the conversational obligations imposed by the social activity (i.e., linguistic cooperation as discussed above).",
        "We will not deal with collaboration here, though, as our focus is on non-cooperation."

        "In this section, we describe an empirical pilot study aimed at identifying a set of features that distinguish cooperative from non-cooperative conversational behaviour and at establishing a suitable domain in which to focus our work.",
        "We collected the transcripts of 10 adversarial dialogues: 4 political interviews, 2 entertainment interviews, 1 parliamentary inquiry, 1 courtroom confrontation, 1 courtroom interrogation and 1 dispute.",
        "The corpus includes 2 collaborative political interviews for result comparison and is nearly 14,500 words long.",
        "In a first analysis, we identified those surface features that characterised each conversation as conflictive: e.g., interruptions, short turns, unfinished adjacency pairs, verbatim repetition.",
        "Next, looking for a better understanding, we preformed an in-depth case study of one of the examples, approaching the analysis from different angles.",
        "By studying, e.g., the observance of turn-taking rules, the implicatures of the participants and, more extensively, how the case fitted within the normative framework proposed by Walton and Krabbe (1995), we were able to better identify the nature of non-cooperative features present in the dialogue and establish a formalisable framework for approaching non-cooperative dialogue.",
        "As for the domain, the wealth of interesting conversational situations that arise in political interviews make a suitable context for this research.",
        "In the English-speaking world, journalists are well-known for their incisive approach to public servants.",
        "At the same time, politicians are usually well trained to deliver a set of key messages when speaking in public, and to avoid issues unfavorable to their image.",
        "We will only consider naturally occurring (i.e. non-scripted) two-party interviews.",
        "Based on the analysis described above, we propose a technique for measuring non-cooperation in political interviews using a set of non-cooperative features (NCFs).",
        "The number of occurrences of these features will determine the degree of non-cooperation (DNC) of an exchange.",
        "We grouped NCFs following three aspects of conversation: turn-taking, grounding and speech acts (see Table 1 for a complete list).",
        "Turn-taking rules (Sacks et al., 1974) establish that speakers make their contributions at adequate places and in particular ways.",
        "Interlocutors in a political interview are expected to respect transition-relevance places, openings and closings according to social conventions.",
        "Failing to do so (e.g., by interrupting each other) constitutes a non-cooperative feature.",
        "Grounding (Clark and Schaefer, 1989) refers to participants' acknowledgement of each other's",
        "Table 1 : NCFs for political interviews contributions by providing evidence of understanding (e.g, continued attention, relevant next contribution).",
        "In political interviews a question is acknowledged by rejecting it or by providing a direct answer.",
        "Likewise, answers are acknowledged by rejecting their relevance, by asking a next relevant question or by moving on to a new topical issue.",
        "Failing to provide sufficient evidence of understanding is also a non-cooperative feature.",
        "Speech Act theory (Searle, 1979) classifies utterances according to their associated force and propositional content.",
        "Going back to Heritage's comment, in a political interview participants can fail to restrict their speech acts to the force and content expected for their role.",
        "Non-cooperative features related to speech acts include the interviewer expressing a personal opinion or criticising subjectively the interviewee's positions and the interviewee asking questions (except for clarification requests) or making irrelevant comments.",
        "We define the degree of non-cooperation (DNC) of a dialogue as the proportion of utterances with one of more occurrences of these non-cooperative features.",
        "Furthermore, the DNC could be thus computed for the whole conversation and also for each participant, by counting only occurrences of features and utterances from each DP.",
        "As an example, consider an extended fragment of (1) annotated with non-cooperative features (O: overlap; GF: grounding failure; UC: unsolicited comment; I: interruption; TC: topic change):",
        "(3) P[ll]:Uir.l (overlapping) Did you threaten to O overrule him?",

        "(1996), can lead to problems like infinite regress in nested beliefs.",
        "Taylor (1994) addressed non-cooperative dialogue behaviour by implementing cynic, a dialogue system able to generate and recognise deception; a notion of non-cooperation weaker than the one we address.",
        "More recently, Traum (2008) brought attention to the need for computational accounts of dialogue situations in which a broader notion of cooperation is not assumed: e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, bargaining agents, role-playing training agents.",

        "Following Traum and Allen (1994), we base on the hypothesis that non-cooperative features result from decisions that participants make during the conversation, by considering the obligations imposed by the social activity and their individual goals, with an adequate configuration of the priorities for goals and obligations.",
        "Thus, a participant with high priorities for individual goals might compromise the workings of a conversation by choosing contributions that go against the norms of the social activity.",
