        "Sentiment analysis is an important topic in computational linguistics that is of theoretical interest but also implies many real-world applications.",
        "Usually, two aspects are of importance in sentiment analysis.",
        "The first is the detection of subjectivity, i.e. whether a text or an expression is meant to express sentiment at all; the second is the determination of sentiment orientation, i.e. what sentiment is to be expressed in a structure that is considered subjective.",
        "Work on sentiment analysis most often covers resources or analysis methods in a single language, usually English.",
        "However, the transfer of sentiment analysis between languages can be advantageous by making use of resources for a source language to improve the analysis of the target language.",
        "This paper presents an approach to the transfer of sentiment information between languages.",
