        "In statistical machine translation (SMT), words are normally considered as the building blocks of translation models.",
        "However, especially for morphologically complex languages such as Finnish, Turkish, Czech, Arabic etc., it has been shown that using sub-lexical units obtained after morphological preprocessing can improve the machine translation performance over a word-based system (Habash and Sadat, 2006; Oflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout, 2007; Bisazza and Federico, 2009).",
        "However, the effect of segmentation on translation performance is indirect and difficult to isolate (Lopez and Resnik, 2006).",
        "The challenge in designing a sub-lexical SMT system is the decision of what segmentation to use.",
        "Linguistic morphological analysis is intuitive, but it is language-dependent and could be highly ambiguous.",
        "Furthermore, it is not necessarily optimal in that (i) manually engineered segmentation schemes can outperform a straightforward linguistic morphological segmentation, e.g., (Habash and Sadat, 2006), and (ii) it may result in even worse performance than a word-based system, e.g., (Durgar El-Kahlout and Oflazer, 2006).",
        "A SMT system designer has to decide what segmentation is optimal for the translation task at hand.",
        "Existing solutions to this problem are predominantly heuristic, language-dependent, and as such are not easily portable to other languages.",
        "Another point to consider is that the optimal degree of segmentation might decrease as the amount of training data increases (Lee, 2004; Habash and Sadat, 2006).",
        "This brings into question: For the particular language pair and training corpus at hand, what is the optimal (level of) sub-word segmentation?",
        "Therefore, it is desirable to learn the optimal segmentation in an unsupervised manner.",
        "In this work, we extend the method of Creutz and Lagus (2007) so as to maximize the translation posterior in unsupervised segmentation.",
        "The learning process is tailored to the particular SMT task via the same parallel corpus that is used in training the statistical translation models."

        "However, running the EM algorithm to optimization for each considered segmentation model can be computationally expensive, and can result in overtraining.",
        "Therefore, in this work we used the likelihood computed after the first EM iteration, which also has the nice property that P(/|e) can be computed incrementally from one segmentation hypothesis to the next.",
        "The incremental updates are derived from the equations for the count collection and probability estimation steps of the EM algorithm as follows.",

        "The initial experiments presented here show that the translation units learned by the proposed algorithm improves on the word-based baseline in both translation directions.",
        "One avenue for future work is to relax some of the several independence assumptions made in the generative model.",
        "For example, independence of consecutive morphs could be relaxed by an HMM model for transitions between morphs (Creutz and Lagus, 2007).",
        "Other future work includes optimizing the segmentation of both sides of the corpus and experimenting with other language pairs.",
        "It is also possible that the probability distributions are not discriminative enough to outweigh the model prior tendencies since the translation probabilities are estimated only crudely (single iteration of Model-1 EM algorithm).",
        "A possible candidate solution would be to weigh the translation likelihood more in calculating the overall cost.",
        "In fact, this idea could be generalized into a log-linear modeling (e.g., (Poon et al., 2009)) of the various components of the joint corpus likelihood and possibly other features.",
        "Finally, integration of sub-word segmentation with the phrasal lexicon learning process in SMT is desireable (e.g., translation-driven segmentation in Wu (1997)).",
        "Hierarchical models (Chiang, 2007) could cover this gap and provide a means to seamlessly integrate sub-word segmentation with statistical machine translation."
