        "Social media provides communication and interaction channels where users can freely participate in, express their opinions, make their own content, and interact with other users.",
        "Users in this new media are more comfortable in expressing their feelings, opinions, and ideas.",
        "Thus, the resulting user-generated content tends to be more subjective than other written genres, and thus, is more appealing to be investigated in terms of subjectivity and sentiment analysis.",
        "Research in sentiment analysis has recently attracted much attention (Pang and Lee, 2008), but modeling emotion patterns and studying the affective lexicon used in social media have received little attention.",
        "Work in sentiment analysis in social media is often limited to finding the sentiment sign in the dipole pattern (negative/positive) for given text.",
        "Extensions to this task include the three-class classification (adding neutral to the polarity) and locating the value of emotion the text carries across a spectrum of valence scores.",
        "On the other hand, it is well appreciated by psychologists that sentiment has much richer structures than the aforementioned simplified polarity.",
        "For example, emotion - a form of expressive sentiment - was suggested by psychologists to be measured in terms of valence and arousal (Russell, 2009).",
        "Thus, we are motivated to analyze the sentiment in blogo-sphere in a more fine-grained fashion.",
        "In this paper we study the grouping behaviors of the emotion, or emotion patterns, expressed in the blogposts.",
        "We are inspired to get insights into the question of whether these structures can be discovered directly from data without the cost of involving human participants as in traditional psychological studies.",
        "Next, we aim to study the relationship between the data-driven emotion structures discovered and those proposed by psychologists.",
        "Work on the analysis of effects of sentiment on lexical access is great in a psychology perspective.",
        "However, to our knowledge, limited work exists to examine the same tasks in social media context.",
        "The contribution in this paper is twofold.",
        "To our understanding, we study a novel problem of emotion-based pattern discovery in blogosphere.",
        "We provide an initial solution for the matter using a combination of psychological models, affective norm scores for English words, a novel feature representation scheme, and a nonparametric clustering to automatically group moods into meaningful emotion patterns.",
        "We believe that we are the first to consider the matter of data-driven emotion pattern discovery at the scale presented in this paper.",
        "Secondly, we explore a novel problem of detecting the mood - affective lexicon usage correlation in the new media, and propose a novel use of a term-goodness criterion to discover this sentiment - linguistic association."

        "Emotion patterns have often been used in sentiment analysis limited to this one-dimensional formulation.",
        "On the other hand, in psychology, emotions have often been represented in dimensional and discrete perspectives.",

        "Livejournal provides a comprehensive set of 132 moods for users to tag their moods when blogging.",
        "The provided moods range diversely in the emotion spectrum but typically are observed to fall into soft clusters such as happiness (cheerful or grateful) or sadness (discontent or uncomfortable).",
        "We call each cluster of these moods an emotion pattern and aim to detect them in this paper.",
        "We observe that the blogposts tagged with moods in the same emotion pattern have similar proportions in the usage of ANEW.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 - a plot of the usage of ANEW having arousal in the range of 7.2 - 8.2 in the blogposts - we could see that the ANEW usage patterns of happy/cheerful and angry/p*ssed off are well separated.",
        "Anger, enraged, and rage will be most likely found in the angry/p *ssed off tagged posts and least likely found in the happy/cheerful ones.",
        "In contrast, the ANEW as romantic or surprised are not commonly used in the posts tagged with angry/p *ssed off but most popularly used in the happy/cheerful ones; suggesting that, the similarity between ANEW usage patterns can be used as a basis to study the structure of mood space.",
        "Let us denote by B the corpus of all blogposts and by M= {sad, happy,...} the predefined set of moods (\\M\\ = 132).",
        "Each blogpost b e B in the corpus is labeled with a mood lb e M. Denote by n the number of ANEW (n = 1034).",
        "Let xm = [x™,x™,x™\\ be the vector representing the usage of ANEW by the mood m. Thus, XT = T,beB,ib=m cib> where cib is the counting of the ANEW i-th occurrence in the blogpost b tagged with the mood m. The usage vector is normalized so that Ya=i x™ = \\ for all m e M. To discover the grouping of the moods based on the usage vectors we use a nonparametric clustering algorithm known as Affinity Propagation (AP) (Frey and Dueck, 2007).",
        "AP is desirable here because it automatically discovers the number of clusters as well as the cluster exemplars.",
        "The algorithm only requires the pairwise similarities between moods, which we compute based on the Euclidean distances for simplicity.",
        "To map the emotion patterns detected to their psychological meaning, we proceed to measure the sentiment scores of those \\M\\ mood words.",
        "In particular, we use ANEW (Bradley and Lang, 1999), which is a set of 1034 sentiment conveying English words.",
        "The valence and arousal of moods are assigned by those of the same words in the ANEW lexicon.",
        "For those moods which are not in ANEW, their values are assigned by those of the nearest father words in the mood hierarchical tree, where those moods conveying the same meaning, to some extent, are in the same level of the tree.",
        "Thus, each member of the mood clusters can be placed onto the a 2D representation along the valence and arousal dimensions, making it feasible to compare with the core-affect model (Russell, 2009) theorized by psychologists.",
        "To study the statistical strength of an ANEW word with respect to a particular mood, the information gain measure (Mitchell, 1997) is adopted.",
        "Given a collection of blog posts B consisting of those tagged or not tagged with a target class attribute mood m. The entropy of B relative to this binary classification is",
        "where p© and pe are the proportions of the posts tagged and not tagged with m respectively.",
        "The entropy of B relative to the binary classification given a binary attribute A (e.g. if the word A present or not) observed is computed as",
        "where £>© is the subset of B for which attribute A is present in the corpus and Be is the subset of B for which attribute A is absent in the corpus.",
        "The information gain of an attribute ANEW A in classifying the collection with respect to the target class attribute mood m, IG(m, A), is the reduction in entropy caused by partitioning the examples according to the attribute A.",
        "Thus,",
        "With respect to a given mood m, those ANEW having high information gain are considered likely to be associated with the mood.",
        "This measure, also often considered a term-goodness criterion, outperforms others in feature selection in text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997)."
