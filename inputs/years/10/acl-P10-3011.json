        "The Cyc knowledge base represents general purpose knowledge across a vast array of domains.",
        "Low level event and individual facts are contained in larger definitional hierarchical representations and contextualized through microtheories (Matuszek et al., 2006).",
        "Higher order predicates built into Cyc's formal language, CycL, allow efficient inferencing about context and metalanguage reasoning above and beyond first-order logic rules (Ramachandran et al., 2005).",
        "Because of the expressiveness and size of the ontology, Cyc has been used in NL applications including word sense disambiguation and rule acquisition by reading (Curtis, Cabral, & Baxter, 2006; Curtis et al., 2009).",
        "Such applications use NL-to-Cycl parsers which use Cyc semantic frames to convert natural language into Cyc representations.",
        "These frames represent sentence content through a set of propositional logic assertions that first reify the sentence in terms of a real world event and then define the semantic relationships between the elements of the sentence, as described later.",
        "Because these parsers require semantic frames to represent sentence content, existing parsers are limited due to Cyc's limited coverage (Curtis et al., 2009).",
        "The goal is to increase this coverage by automatically translating the class frames in VerbNet into individual verb templates."

      "text": [
        "The Cyc knowledge base is continuously expanding and much work has been done on automatic fact acquisition as well as merging ontologies.",
        "However, the semantic frames remain mostly handmade in ResearchCyc and nonexistent in the open-license OpenCyc.",
        "Translating VerbNet frames into Cyc will expand the natural language capabilities of both.",
        "There has been previous research on mapping existing Cyc templates to VerbNet, but thus far these approaches have not created new templates to address Cyc's lapses in coverage.",
        "One such attempt, King and Crouch's (2005) unified lexicon, compiled many lexical resources into a unified representation.",
        "While this research created a valuable resource, it did not extend the existing Cyc coverage.",
        "Of the 45, 704 entries in the UL only 3,544 have Cyc entries (King &",
        "Crouch, 2005).",
        "Correspondences between a few VerbNet frames and ResearchCyc templates have also been mapped out through the VxC VerbNet Cyc",
        "Mapper (Trumbo 2006).",
        "These mappings became a standard that we later used to evaluate the quality of our created frames.",
        "A notable exception to the handmade paradigm is Curtis et aVs (2009) TextLearner which uses rules and existing semantic frames to handle novel sentence structures.",
        "Given an existing template that fits some of the syntactic constraints of the sentence, TextLearner will attempt to create a new frame by suggesting a predicate that fits the missing part.",
        "Often these are general underspecified predicates, but TextLearner is able to use common sense reasoning and existing facts to find better matches (Curtis et al., 2009).",
        "While TextLearner improves its performance with time, it is not an attempt to create new frames on a large scale.",
        "Creating generalized frames based on verb classes will increase the depth of the Cyc Lexicon quickly.",
        "Furthermore, automatic processes like those in TextLearner could be used to make individual verb semantic frames more specific."

        "The current version has been expanded to include class distinctions not included in Levin's original proposal (Kipper et al., 2006).",
        "VerbNet is an appealing lexical resource for this task because it represents semantic meaning as the union of both syntactic structure and semantic predicates.",
        "VerbNet uses Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar to generate the syntactic frames.",
        "The syntactic roles in the frame are appended with general thematic roles that fill arguments of semantic predicates.",
        "Each event is broken down into a tripartite structure as described by Moens & Steedman (1988) and uses a time modifier for each predicate to indicate when specific predicates occur in the event.",
        "This allows for a dynamic representation of change over an event.",
        "(Kipper et al., 2000).",
        "This approach is transferable to Cyc's semantic templates in which syntactic slots fill predicate arguments in the context of a specific syntactic frame.",

        "However, for the purposes of this study the OpenCyc KB was used.",
        "The OpenCyc KB is an open source version of ResearchCyc that contains much of the definitional information and higher order predicates, but has had much of the lower level specific facts and the entire word lexicon removed (Matuszek et al., 2006).",
        "However, the assertions generated by this method are fully usable in ResearchCyc.",
        "OpenCyc was used so as to minimize the effect of existing semantic frames on new frame creation.",
        "Since OpenCyc and VerbNet are open-licensed, our translation provides an open-license extension to OpenCyc to support its use in natural language research.",
        "The primary difficulty with integrating VerbNet frames into Cyc was overcoming differences in knowledge representation.",

        "The end result of this process was the creation of 27,909 verb semantic template assertions for 5,050 different verbs.",
        "This substantially increases the number of frames for ResearchCyc and creates frames for OpenCyc.",
        "To test the accuracy of the results and their contribution to the knowledge base we ran two tests.",
        "The first was to compare our frames with the 139 hand-checked VxC matches by hand.",
        "Of the 139 frames from VxC, 81 were qualified as \"good\" matches, and 58 as \"maybe\" (Trumbo, 2006).",
        "Since these frames already existed in Cyc and were hand matched we used them as the current gold standard for what a VerbNet frame translated into Cyc should look like.",
        "Matches between frames were evaluated along several criteria.",
        "First was whether the frame had as good a syntactic parse as the manual version.",
        "This was defined as having predicates that addressed all syntactic roles in the sentence or, if not enough, as many as the VxC match.",
        "Secondly we asked if the collection was similar to the manual version.",
        "Frames with collections that were too specific, unrelated, or just Situation were discarded.",
        "Because frame-specific predicates were not created on a large scale, a frame was not rejected for using general predicates.",
        "It is important to note a difference in matching methodology between the VxC matches and our frames.",
        "First, the VxC mappings included frames in Cyc that only partially matched more syntactically robust VerbNet frames.",
        "Our frames were only included if they matched the intended VerbNet syntactic frame.",
        "Because of this some of our frames beat the VxC gold standard for syntactic completeness.",
        "The VxC frames also included multiple similar senses for an individual verb.",
        "Our verbs had one denotation per class or subclass.",
        "Thus in some cases our frames failed not from over generalizing but because they were only meant to represent one meaning per class.",
        "Since the strength of our approach lies in generating a near exhaustive list of syntactic frames and not multiple word senses, these kinds of failures are not necessarily representative of the success of the frames as a whole.",
        "A total of 55 frames (39.5%) were correct with seventeen (30.9%) of the correct frames having a more complete syntactic parse than the manually mapped frame.",
        "48 frames (34.5%) were rejected only for having too general or specific a collection; however ten (20.8%) of the collection rejected frames had a more complete parse than their manual counterparts.",
        "Thus 103 frames (74.1%) were as syntactically correct or better than the existing Cyc frame mapped to that VerbNet frame.",
        "Nine (6.47%) frames failed syntactically, with four (44.4%) of the syntax failures also having the wrong collection.",
        "Thirteen frames ( 9.3%) were not matched.",
        "Fifteen frames (10.8%) from the Hold class, were separated out for a formatting error that resulted in a duplicate, though not syntactically incorrect, predicate.",
        "The predicate repeated was (objectsInContact :ACTION :OBJECT).",
        "12 of 15 frames (80%) had accurate collections.",
        "The second test compared the results of a natural language understanding system using either ResearchCyc alone or a version of ResearchCyc with our frames substituted for theirs.",
        "The test corpus was 50 randomly selected example sentences from the VerbNet frame examples.",
        "We used the EA NLU parser, which uses a bottom-up chart parser and compositional semantics to convert the semantic content of a sentence in CycL (Tomai & Forbus 2009).",
        "Possible frames are returned in choice sets.",
        "A parse was judged correct if it returned a verb frame for the central verb of the example sentence that either wholly or in combination with preposition frames addressed the syntactic constituents of the sentence with an acceptable collection and acceptable predicates.",
        "Again general predicates were acceptable.",
        "ResearchCyc got sixteen out of 50 frames correct (32%).",
        "Eleven frames (22%) did not return a template but did return a denotation to a Cyc collection.",
        "Twelve verbs (24%) retuned nothing, while eleven (22%) returned frames that were either not the correct syntactic frame or were a different sense of the verb.",
        "EA NLU running the VerbNet generated frames got 26 out of 50 (52%) frames correct.",
        "Twelve frames (24%) returned nothing.",
        "Eight frames, (16%) failed because of a too specific or too general collection.",
        "Four generated frames (8%) were either not the correct syntactic frame or were for a different sense of the verb.",
        "This was an overall 20% improvement in accuracy.",
        "Five (10%) parses using the VerbNet generated correct frames that were labeled as noisy.",
        "Noisy frames had duplicate predicates or more general predicates in addition to the specific ones.",
        "The Hold frames separated out in the VxC test are an example of noisy frames.",
        "None of these frames were syntactically incorrect or contradictory.",
        "The redundant predicates arise because the predicate safety net had to be greedy.",
        "This was in the interest of capturing more complex frames that may have multiple relations for the same thematic role in a sentence.",
        "This evaluation is based on parser recall and frame semantic accuracy only.",
        "As would be expected, adding more frames to the knowledge base did result in more parser retrievals and possible interpretations.",
        "The implications for this on word sense disambiguation is evaluated further in the discussion.",
        "To improve predicate specificity, the next phase of research with these frames will be to implement predicate strengthening methods that move down the hierarchy to find more specific predicates to replace the generalized ones.",
        "Thus in the future precision both in terms of frame retrieval and predicate specificity will be a vital metric for evaluating success."

        "As has been demonstrated in this approach and in previous research like Curtis et aVs (2009) TextLearner, Cyc provides powerful reasoning capabilities that can be used to successfully infer more specific information from general existing facts.",
        "We hope that future research is able to use this feature to provide more specific individual frames.",
        "Because Cyc is consistently changing and growing, an approach that uses Cyc relationships will be able to improve as the knowledge base improves its coverage.",
        "While many of the frames are general, they provide a solid foundation for further research.",
        "As they are now, the added 27,909 frames increase the language capabilities of OpenCyc which previously had none.",
        "For ResearchCyc the contribution is less clear-cut.",
        "The 27,909 VerbNet frames have approximately 7.93 times the coverage of the existing 3,517 ResearchCyc frames and they improved ResearchCyc parser performance by 20%.",
        "However, with 35% of frames in the VxC comparison and 16% in the parse test failing because of collections, and 10.8% of the VxC comparison set and 10% of correct parses classified as noisy, these frames are not as precise as the existing frames.",
        "The goal of these frames is not necessarily to replace the existing frames, but rather to extend coverage and provide a platform for further development whether by hand or through automatic methods.",
        "Precision can be improved upon in future research and is facilitated by the expressiveness of Cyc.",
        "Predicate strengthening, using existing relationships to infer more specific predicates, is the next step in creating robust frames.",
        "Additionally, there is a tradeoff between the number of frames covered and efficiency of disambiguation.",
        "More frame choices make it harder for parsers to choose the correct frame, but it will hopefully improve their handling of more complex sentence structures.",
        "One possible solution to competition and over-generality is to add verbs incrementally by class.",
        "The class based approach makes it easy to separate verbs by types, such as verbs that relate to mechanical processes or emotion verbs.",
        "One could use classes of frames to strengthen specific areas of parsing while choosing not to take verbs from a class covering a domain that the parser already performs strongly in.",
        "This approach can reduce interference with existing domains that have been hand built and extended beyond the standard Cyc KB for individual research.",
        "Furthermore, semi-automatic approaches like this generate information more quickly than one could do by hand.",
        "Thus an approach to computational verb semantic representation that is rooted in classes can take advantage of modern reasoning sources like Cyc to efficiently create semantic knowledge."
