        "Selection is the crucial point of self-training, in which the propagation of labeling noise into upcoming iterations is the major concern.",
        "One can select all of labeled examples, but usually only a number of them (n), known as growth size, based on a quality measure is selected.",

        "The selected labeled examples can be retained in unlabeled set to be labeled again in next iterations (delibility) or moved so that they are labeled only once (indelibility).",

        "While using a pool can improve the efficiency of the self-training process, there can be two other motivations behind it, concerned with the performance of the process.",

        "Limiting the labeling size to a pool and at the same time (pre)selecting divergence examples into it can remedy the problem.",
        "The other motivation is originated from the fact that the base classifier is relatively weak due to small seed size, thus its predictions, as the measure of confidence in selection process, may not be reliable.",
        "Preselecting a set of unlabeled examples more probable to be correctly labeled by the classifier in initial steps seems to be a useful strategy against this fact.",
        "We examine both ideas here, by a random preselection for the first case and a measure of simplicity for the second case.",
        "Random preselection is built into our system, since we use randomized training data.",

        "Consistent with previous work, with unbalanced selection, non-NULL-labeled unlabeled samples are selected only after the middle of the process.",
        "But, with the balanced method, selection is more evenly distributed over the roles.",

        "One apparent reason is that the classifier cannot accurately label the out-of-domain unla-beled data successively used for training.",
        "The lower quality of our out-of-domain data can be another reason for this behavior.",
