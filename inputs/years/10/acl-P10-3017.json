        "None of the previous work investigated subclassi-fying semantic relations including presupposition and entailment, two relations that are closely related, but behave differently in context.",
        "In particular, the inferential behaviour of presuppositions and entailments crucially differs in special semantic contexts.",
        "E.g., while presuppositions are preserved under negation (as in Columbus managed/didn't manage to reach India the presupposition tried to), entailments do not survive under negation (John F. Kennedy has been/has not been killed).",

        "The advantage of this resource is that it consists of pairs of verbs which stand in a semantic relation (cf.",
        "Section 2).",
        "This considerably reduces the number of verb pairs that need to be processed as candidates in our classification task.",
        "DIRT contains 5,604 verb types and 808,764 verb pair types.",
        "This still represents a huge number of verb pairs to be processed.",
        "We therefore filtered the extracted set by checking verb pair frequency in the first three parts of the ukWAC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009) (UKWAC_1... 3) and by applying the PMI test with threshold 2.0.",

        "Given these verb pairs, we extracted sentences for training and for unlabeled data set from the first three parts of the UKWAC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009).",
        "We compiled a set of CQP queries (Evert, 2005) to find sentences that contain both verbs of a verb pair and applied them on UKWAC-l... 3 to build the training and unlabeled subcorpora.",
        "We filter out sentences with more than 60 words and sentences with a distance between verbs exceeding 20 words.",
        "To avoid growing complexity, only sentences with exactly one occurrence of each verb pair are retained.",

        "Patterns.",
