        "In recent years multi-user online games in virtual worlds such as Second Life or World of Warcraft have attracted large user communities.",
        "Such virtual online game worlds provide new social and economic platforms for people to work and interact in.",
        "Furthermore, virtual worlds open new perspectives for research in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, as well as in human-centered computer science (Bainbridge, 2007).",
        "Depending on the game type, non-player characters (NPCs) are often essential for supporting the game plot, for making the artificial world more vivid and ultimately for making it more immersive.",
        "In addition, NPCs are useful to populate new worlds by carrying out jobs the user-led characters come in touch with.",
        "The range of functions to be filled by NPCs is currently still strongly restricted by their limited capabilities in autonomous acting and communication.",
        "This shortcoming creates a strong need for progress in areas such as AI and NLP, especially their planning and dialog systems.",
        "The KomParse system, described in this paper, provides NPCs for a virtual online world named Twinity, a product of the Berlin startup company Metaversum.",
        "The KomParse NPCs offer various services through conversation with game users using question-answering and dialog functionality.",
        "The utilization of Semantic Web technology with RDF-encoded generic and domain-specific ontologies furthermore enables semantic search and inference.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the NPC modelling and explains the application scenarios.",

        "Section 4 explains the system architecture and its key components.",

        "The online game Twinity extends the Second Life idea by mirroring an urban part of the real world.",
        "At the time of this writing, the simulated section of reality already contains 3D models of the cities of Berlin, Singapore and London and it keeps growing.",
        "Users can log into the virtual world, where they can meet other users and communicate with them using the integrated chat function or talk to each other via Voice-over-IP.",
        "They can style their virtual appearance, can rent or buy their own flats and decorate them as to their preferences and tastes.",
        "Out of many types of NPCs useful for this application such as pedestrians, city guides and personnel in stores, restaurants and bars, we start with two specific characters: a female furniture sales agent and a male bartender.",
        "The furniture seller is designed for helping users furnish their virtual apartments.",
        "Users can buy pieces of furniture and room decoration from the NPC by describing their demands and wishes in a text chat.",
        "During the dialog with the NPC, the preferred objects are then selected and directly put into a location in the apartment, which can be further refined with the user interfaces that Twinity provides.",
        "In the second scenario, the bartender sells virtual drinks.",
        "He can talk about cocktails with users, but moreover, he can also entertain his guests by providing trivia-type information about popular celebrities and various relations among them.",
        "We chose these two characters not only because of their value for the Twinity application but also for our research goals.",
        "They differ in many interesting aspects.",
        "First of all, the furniture sales agent is controlled by a complex task model including ontology-driven and data-driven components to guide the conversation.",
        "This agent also possesses a much more fine-grained action model, which allows several different actions to cover the potential conversation situations for the selling task.",
        "The bartender agent on the other hand is designed not to fulfill one strict task because his clients do not follow a specific goal except ordering drinks.",
        "Our bartender has the role of a conversation companion and is able to entertain clients with his broad knowledge.",
        "Thus, he is allowed to access to several knowledge bases and is able to handle questions (and later conversations) about a much larger domain called the \"gossip domain\" which enables conversation about pop stars, movie actors and other celebrities as well as the relations between these people.",
        "In order to achieve a high robustness, we integrate a chatbot into the bartender agent to catch chitchat utterances we cannot handle."

        "Semantic Web technology is employed for modelling the knowledge of the NPCs.",
        "The Resource Description Format (RDF) serves as the base for the actual encoding.",
        "An RDF statement is a binary relation instance between two individuals, that is a triple of a predicate and two arguments, called the subject and the object, and written as subj pred obj (e.g. f:Sofa_Alatea f:hasMainColour f:Burgundy).",
        "All objects and properties the NPC can talk about are modelled in this way.",
        "Therefore the knowledge base has to reflect the physical properties of the virtual objects in Twinity as faithfully as possible.",
        "For instance, specific pieces of furniture are described by their main color, material or style, whereas cocktails are characterized by their ingredients, color, consistence and taste.",
        "Furthermore, references to the 3D models of the objects are stored in order to create, find and remove such objects in the virtual world.",
        "The concepts and individuals of the particular domain are structured and organized in domain-specific ontologies.",
        "These ontologies are modelled in the Web Ontology Language (OWL).",
        "OWL allows us to define concept hierarchies, relations between concepts, domains and ranges of these relations, as well as specific relation instances between instances of a concept.",
        "Our ontologies are defined by the freely available ontology editor Protege 4.0.",
        "The advantage of using an ontology for structuring the domain knowledge is the modular non-redundant encoding.",
        "When combined with a reasoner, only a few statements about an individual have to be asserted explicitely, while the rest can be inferred from the ontology.",
        "We employ several ontologies, among which the following are relevant for modelling the specific domains of our NPCs:",
        "• An extensive furniture ontology, created by our project partner ZAS Berlin, defining kinds of furniture, room parts, colors and styles as well as the specific instances of furniture in Twinity.",
        "This knowledge base contains 95,258 triples, 123 furniture classes, 20 color classes, 243 color instances and various classes defining styles and similar concepts.",
        "• A cocktail ontology, defining 13 cocktail classes with ingredients and tastes in 21,880 triples.",
        "• A biographical ontology, the \"gossip ontology\", defining biographical and career-specific concepts for people.",
        "This ontology is accompanied by a huge database of celebrities, which has been automatically acquired from the Web and covers nearly 600,000 persons and relations between these people like family relationships, marriages and professional relations.",
        "(Adolphs et al., 2010)",
        "The furniture ontology is the only knowledge base for the furniture sales agent, whereas the bartender NPC has access to both the cocktail as well as the gossip knowledge base.",
        "We use SwiftOwlim for storing and querying the data.",
        "SwiftOwlim is a \"triple store\", a kind of database which is specifically built for storing and querying RDF data.",
        "It provides a forward-chaining inference engine which evaluates the domain definitions when loading the knowledge repository, and makes implicit knowledge explicit by asserting triples that must also hold true according to the ontology.",
        "Once the reasoner is finished, the triple store can be queried directly using the RDF query language SPARQL."

        "Figure 3 shows the overall system architecture.",
        "Twinity is a server/client application, in which the server hosts the virtual world and coordinates the user interactions.",
        "In order to use Twinity, users have to download the Twinity client.",
        "The client allows the user to control the physical representation of the user's character in the virtual world, also called the \"avatar\".",
        "Thus the client is responsible for displaying the graphics, calculating the effects of physical interactions, handling the user's input and synchronizing the 3D data and user actions with the Twinity server.",
        "Each NPC comprises two major parts: whereas its avatar is the physical appearance of the NPC in the virtual world, the \"conversational agent\" provides the actual control logic which controls the avatar autonomously.",
        "It is in particular able to hold a conversation with Twinity users in that it reacts to a user's presence, interprets user's utterances in dialog context and generates adequate responses.",
        "The KomParse server is a multi-client, multithreaded server written in lava that hosts the conversational agents for the NPCs (section 5).",
        "The NPCs avatar, on the other hand, is realized by a modified Twinity client.",
        "We utilize the Python interface provided by the Twinity client to call our own plugin which opens a bidirectional socket connection to the KomParse server.",
        "The plugin is started together with the Twinity client and serves as a mediator between the Twinity server and the KomParse server from then on (fig.",
        "3).",
        "It sends all in-game events relevant to our system to the server and translates the commands sent by the server into rwrafy-specific actions.",
        "The integration architecture allows us to be maximally independent of the specific game platform.",
        "Rather than using the particular programming language and development environment of the platform for realizing the conversational agent or reimplementing a whole client/server protocol for connecting the avatar to the corresponding agent, we use an interface tailored to the specific needs of our system.",

      "heading": "5. Conversational Agent: KomParse Dialog System",
      "text": [
        "The KomParse dialog system, the main functionality of the conversational agent, consists of the following three major components: input analyzer, dialog manager and output generator (fig.4).",
        "The input analyzer is responsible for the linguistic analysis of the user's textual input including preprocessing such as string cleaning, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, parsing and semantic interpretation.",
        "It yields a semantic representation which is the input for the dialog manager.",
        "The dialog manager takes the result of the input analyzer and delivers an interpretation based on the dialog context and the available knowledge.",
        "It also controls the task conversation chain and handles user requests.",
        "The dialog manager determines the next system action based on the interpreted parameters.",
        "The output generator realizes the action defined by the dialog manager with its multimodal generation competence.",
        "The generated results can be verbal, gestural or a combination of both.",
        "As mentioned above, our dialog system has to deal with two different scenarios.",
        "While the focal point of the bartender agent lies in the question answering functionality, the furniture sales agent is driven by a complex dialog task model based on a dialog graph.",
        "Thus, the bartender agent relies mainly on question answering technology, in that it needs to understand questions and extract the right answer from our knowledge bases, whereas the sales agent has to accommodate various dialog situations with respect to a sales scenario.",
        "It therefore has to understand the dialog acts intended by the user and trigger the corresponding reactions, such as presenting an object, memorizing user preferences, negotiating further sales goals, etc.",
        "The task model for sales conversations is inspired by a corpus resulting from the annotation of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment in the furniture sales agent scenario carried out by our project partner at ZAS (Bertomeu and Benz, 2009).",
        "In these experiments, 18 users spent one hour each on furnishing a virtual living room in a Twinity apartment by talking to a human wizard controlling the virtual sales agent.",
        "The final corpus consists of 18 dialogs containing 3,171 turns with 4,313 utterances and 23,015 alphanumerical strings (words).",
        "The following example shows a typical part of such a conversation:",
        "USR.1: And do we have a little side table for the TV?",
        "NPC.1: I could offer you another small table or a sideboard.",
        "USR.2: Then I'll take a sideboard thats similar to my shelf.",
        "NPC.2: Let me check if we have something like that.",
        "The flow of the task-based conversation is controlled by a data-driven finite-state model, which is the backbone of the dialog manager.",
        "During a sales conversation, objects and features of objects mentioned by the NPC and the user are extracted from the knowledge bases and added into the underspecified graph nodes and egdes at runtime.",
        "This strategy keeps the finite-state graph as small as possible.",
        "Discussed objects and their features are stored in a frame-based subcomponent named \"form\".",
        "The form contains entries which correspond to ontological concepts in the furniture ontology.",
        "During conversation, these entries will be specified with the values of the properties of the discussed objects.",
        "This frame-based approach increases the flexibility of the dialog manager (McTear, 2002) and is particularly useful for a task-driven dialog system.",
        "As long as the negotiated object is not yet fully specified, the form represents the underspecified object description according to the ontology concept.",
        "Every time the user states a new preference or request, the form is enriched with additional features until the set of objects is small enough to be presented to the user for final selection.",
        "Thus the actual flow of dialog according to the task model does not have to be expressed by the graph but can be derived on demand from the knowledge and handled by the form which in turn activates the appropriate dialog subgraphs.",
        "This combination of graph-based dialog models and form-based task modelling effectively accounts for the interaction of sequential dialog strategies and the non-sequential nature of complex dialog goals.",
        "Given a resolved semantic representation, the dialog manager triggers either a semantic search in the knowledge bases to deliver factual answers as needed in a gossip conversation or a further dialog response for example providing choices for the user in a sales domain.",
        "The semantic search is needed in both domains.",
        "In case that the semantic representation can neither be resolved in the task domain nor in the gossip domain, it gets passed to the embedded A.L.I.C.E.",
        "chatbot that uses its own understanding and generation components (Wallace and Bush, 2001).",
        "The input understanding of the system is implemented as one single understanding pipeline.The understanding pipeline delivers a semantic representation which is the basis for the decision of the dialog manager which action to perform next.",
        "This semantic representation can be extracted from the user input by our understanding component via a robust hybrid approach: either via a number of surface patterns containing regular expressions or via patterns reflecting the syntactic analysis of a dependency parser (de Marneffe and",
        "Manning, 2008).",
        "The representation's structure is inspired by our knowledge representation design described in section 3 as well as by predicate logic.",
        "The core of the representation is a predicate-argument structure limited to two arguments including message type and the whole syntactic information found by the analysis pipeline.",
        "The field \"Message Type\" can have one of the following values: wh-question, yes/no-question, declarative.",
        "Predicates can often be instantiated with the lemmatized matrix verb of the successfully analysed piece of the input.",
        "If the input contains a wh-question, the questioned fact is marked as an unfilled argument slot.",
        "The general structure can be simplified described as:",
        "The following examples show the structure used for different input:",
        "• \"Who is the boyfriend of Madonna?\"",
        "Both scenarios make use of state-of-the-art information extraction approaches to extract the important pieces from the user input.",
        "While the bartender depends on relation extraction to detect the fact or relation questioned by the user (Xu et al., 2007), the sales agent uses information extraction methods to recognize user wishes and demands.",
        "As a result, the questioned fact or the demanded object feature equals the ontology structure containing the knowledge needed to handle the user input.",
        "The input \"Do you have any red couches?\"",
        "for example needs to get processed by the system in such a way that the information regarding the sofa with red color is extracted.",
        "This is done by the system in a data-driven way.",
        "The input analysis first tries to find a demanded object in the input via asking the ontology: Every object which can be discussed in the scenario is encoded in the sales agents knowledge base.",
        "This can be seen as a Named Entity Recognition step.",
        "In case of success, the system tries to detect one of the possible relations of the object found in the input.",
        "This is achieved by querying the ontology about what kind of relations the identified object can satisfy.",
        "Possible relations are encoded in the class description of the given object.",
        "As a result the system can detect a relation \"hasColour\" for the found object \"sofa\" and the color value \"red\".",
