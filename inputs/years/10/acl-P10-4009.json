        "We have employed an HMM statistical framework for both speech recognition and synthesis which provides transformation mechanisms to adapt the synthesized voice in TTS (text-to-speech) using the recognized voice in ASR (automatic speech recognition).",
        "An important application for this research is personalised speech-to-speech translation that will use the voice of the speaker in the input language to utter the translated sentences in the output language.",
        "In mobile environments this enhances the users' interaction across language barriers by making the output speech sound more like the original speaker's way of speaking, even if she or he could not speak the output language."

        "A mobile real-time speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) device is one of the grand challenges in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "It involves several important NLP research areas: automatic speech recognition (ASR), statistical machine translation (SMT) and speech synthesis, also known as text-to-speech (TTS).",
        "In recent years significant advance have also been made in relevant technological devices: the size of powerful computers has decreased to fit in a mobile phone and fast WiFi and 3G networks have spread widely to connect them to even more powerful computation servers.",
        "Several hand-held S2ST applications and devices have already become available, for example by IBM, Google or Jibbigo, but there are still serious limitations in vocabulary and language selection and performance.",
        "When an S2ST device is used in practical human interaction across a language barrier, one feature that is often missed is the personalization of the output voice.",
        "Whoever speaks to the device in what ever manner, the output voice always sounds the same.",
        "Producing high-quality synthesis voices is expensive and even if the system had many output voices, it is hard to select one that would sound like the input voice.",
        "There are many features in the output voice that could raise the interaction experience to a much more natural level, for example, emotions, speaking rate, loudness and the speaker identity.",
        "After the recent development in hidden Markov model (HMM) based TTS, it has become possible to adapt the output voice using model transformations that can be estimated from a small number of speech samples.",
        "These techniques, for instance the maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), are adopted from HMM-based ASR where they are very powerful in fast adaptation of speaker and recording environment characteristics (Gales, 1998).",
        "Using hierarchical regression trees, the TTS and ASR models can further be coupled in a way that enables unsupervised TTS adaptation (King et al., 2008).",
        "In unsupervised adaptation samples are annotated by applying ASR.",
        "By eliminating the need for human intervention it becomes possible to perform voice adaptation for TTS in almost real-time.",
        "The target in the EMIME project is to study unsupervised cross-lingual speaker adaptation for S2ST systems.",
        "The first results of the project have been, for example, to bridge the gap between the ASR and TTS (Dines et al., 2009), to improve the baseline ASR (Hirsimaki et al., 2009) and SMT (de Gispert et al., 2009) systems for morphologically rich languages, and to develop robust TTS (Yamagishi et al., 2010).",
        "The next step has been preliminary experiments in intra-lingual and cross-lingual speaker adaptation (Wu et al., 2008).",
        "For cross-lingual adaptation several new methods have been proposed for mapping the HMM states, adaptation data and model transformations (Wu et al., 2009).",
        "In this presentation we can demonstrate the various new results in ASR, SMT and TTS.",
        "Even though the project is still ongoing, we have an initial version of mobile S2ST system and cross-lingual speaker adaptation to show."

        "The baseline ASR systems in the project are developed using the HTK toolkit (Young et al., 2001) for Finnish, English, Mandarin and Japanese.",
        "The systems can also utilize various real-time decoders such as Julius (Kawahara et al., 2000), Juicer at IDIAP and the TKK decoder (Hirsimaki et al., 2006).",
        "The main structure of the baseline systems for each of the four languages is similar and fairly standard and in line with most other state-of-the-art large vocabulary ASR systems.",
        "Some special flavors for have been added, such as the morphological analysis for Finnish (Hirsimaki et al., 2009).",
        "For speaker adaptation, the MLLR transformation based on hierarchical regression classes is included for all languages.",
        "The baseline TTS systems in the project utilize the HTS toolkit (Yamagishi et al., 2009) which is built on top of the HTK framework.",
        "The HMM-based TTS systems have been developed for Finnish, English, Mandarin and Japanese.",
        "The systems include an average voice model for each language trained over hundreds of speakers taken from standard ASR corpora, such as Speecon (Iskra et al., 2002).",
        "Using speaker adaptation transforms, thousands of new voices have been created (Yamagishi et al., 2010) and new voices can be added using a small number of either supervised or unsupervised speech samples.",
        "Cross-lingual adaptation is possible by creating a mapping between the HMM states in the input and the output language (Wu et al., 2009).",
        "Because the resources of the EMIME project have been focused on ASR, TTS and speaker adaptation, we aim at relying on existing solutions for SMT as far as possible.",
        "New methods have been studied concerning the morphologically rich languages (de Gispert et al., 2009), but for the S2ST system we are currently using Google translate."

        "In robust speech synthesis, a computer can learn to speak in the desired way after processing only a relatively small amount of training speech.",
        "The training speech can even be a normal quality recording outside the studio environment, where the target speaker is speaking to a standard microphone and the speech is not annotated.",
        "This differs dramatically from conventional TTS, where building a new voice requires an hour or more careful repetition of specially selected prompts recorded in an anechoic chamber with high quality equipment.",
        "Robust TTS has recently become possible using the statistical HMM framework for both ASR and TTS.",
        "This framework enables the use of efficient speaker adaptation transformations developed for ASR to be used also for the TTS models.",
        "Using large corpora collected for ASR, we can train average voice models for both ASR and TTS.",
        "The training data may include a small amount of speech with poor coverage of phonetic contexts from each single speaker, but by summing the material over hundreds of speakers, we can obtain sufficient models for an average speaker.",
        "Only a small amount of adaptation data is then required to create transformations for tuning the average voice closer to the target voice.",
        "In addition to the supervised adaptation using annotated speech, it is also possible to employ ASR to create annotations.",
        "This unsupervised adaptation enables the system to use a much broader selection of sources, for example, recorded samples from the internet, to learn a new voice.",

        "This is necessary for morphologically rich languages where, due to inflection, derivation and composition, there exists so many different word forms that word based language modeling becomes impractical.",

        "The morpheme-based approach is particularly useful for language pairs where one or both languages are morphologically rich ones where the amount and complexity of different word forms severely limits the performance for word-based translation.",
        "The morpheme-based systems can learn translation models for phrases where morphemes are used instead of words (de Gispert et al., 2009).",
        "Recent evaluations (Ku-rimo et al., 2009) have shown that the performance of the unsupervised data-driven morpheme segmentation can rival the conventional rule-based ones.",
