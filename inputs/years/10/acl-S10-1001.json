        "The league is reviewing security at all ballparks to crack down on spectator violence.",
        "Using coreference information has been shown to be beneficial in a number of NLP applications including Information Extraction (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), Text Summarization (Steinberger et al., 2007), Question Answering (Morton, 1999), and Machine Translation.",
        "There have been a few evaluation campaigns on coreference resolution in the past, namely MUC (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997), ACE (Doddington et al., 2004), and ARE (Orasan et al., 2008), yet many questions remain open:",
        "• To what extent is it possible to implement a general coreference resolution system portable to different languages?",
        "How much language-specific tuning is necessary?",
        "• How helpful are morphology, syntax and semantics for solving coreference relations?",
        "How much preprocessing is needed?",
        "Does its quality (perfect linguistic input versus noisy automatic input) really matter?",
        "• How (dis)similar are different coreference evaluation metrics – MUC, B-CUBED, CEAF and BLANC?",
        "Do they all provide the same ranking?",
        "Are they correlated?",
        "Our goal was to address these questions in a shared task.",
        "Given six datasets in Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian, and Spanish, the task we present involved automatically detecting full coreference chains – composed of named entities (NEs), pronouns, and full noun phrases – in four different scenarios.",

        "As task organizers, we intend to facilitate the sharing of datasets, scorers, and documentation by keeping them available for future research use.",
