      "text": [
        "While there has been a lot of discussion on the relevant sense distinctions for monolingual WSD systems, for machine translation applications there is a consensus that the relevant sense distinctions are those that reflect different translations.",
        "One early and notable work was the Senseval-2 Japanese Translation task (Kurohashi, 2001) that obtained alternative translation records of typical usages of a test word, also referred to as a translation memory.",
        "Systems could either select the most appropriate translation memory record for each instance and were scored against a gold-standard set of annotations, or they could provide a translation that was scored by translation experts after the results were submitted.",
        "In contrast to this work, in our task we provided actual translations for target instances in advance, rather than predetermine translations using lexicographers or rely on post-hoc evaluation, which does not permit evaluation of new systems after the competition.",
        "Previous standalone WSD tasks based on parallel data have obtained distinct translations for senses as listed in a dictionary (Ng and Chan, 2007).",
        "In this way fine-grained senses with the same translations can be lumped together, however this does not fully allow for the fact that some senses for the same words may have some translations in common but also others that are not (Sinha et al., 2009).",
        "In our task, we collected a dataset which allows instances of the same word to have some translations in common, while not necessitating a clustering of translations from a specific resource into senses (in comparison to Lefever and Hoste (2010)).",
        "Resnik and Yarowsky (2000) also",
        "'Though in that task note that it is possible for a translation to occur in more than one cluster.",
        "It will be interesting to",
        "conducted experiments using words in context, rather than a predefined sense-inventory however in these experiments the annotators were asked for a single preferred translation.",
        "In our case, we allowed annotators to supply as many translations as they felt were equally valid.",
        "This allows us to examine more subtle relationships between usages and to allow partial credit to systems that get a close approximation to the annotators' translations.",
        "Unlike a full blown machine translation task (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), annotators and systems are not required to translate the whole context but just the target word."

    {
      "heading": "3. Background: The English Lexical Substitution Task",
      "text": [
        "The English Lexical substitution task (hereafter referred to as lexsub) was run at SemEval-2007 (McCarthy andNavigli, 2007; McCarthy and Navigli, 2009).",
        "lexsub was proposed as a task which, while requiring contextual disambiguation, did not presuppose a specific sense inventory.",
        "In fact, it is quite possible to use alternative representations of meaning, such as those proposed by Sch√ºtze (1998) and Pantel and Lin (2002).",
        "The motivation for a substitution task was that it would reflect capabilities that might be useful for natural language processing tasks such as paraphrasing and textual entailment, while not requiring a complete system that might mask system capabilities at a lexical level and make participation in the task difficult for small research teams.",
        "The task required systems to produce a substitute word for a word in context.",
        "The data was collected for 201 words from open class parts-of-speech (PoS) (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs).",
        "Words were selected that have more than one meaning with at least one near synonym.",
        "Ten sentences for each word were extracted from the English Internet Corpus (Sharoff, 2006).",
        "There were five annotators who annotated each target word as it occurred in the context of a sentence.",
        "The annotators were each allowed to provide up to three substitutes, though they could also provide a NIL response if they could not come up with a substitute.",
        "They had to indicate if the target word was an integral part of a multiword.",
        "see the extent that this actually occurred in their data and the extent that the translations that our annotators provided might be clustered."

        "The Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution task follows lexsub except that the annotations are translations rather than paraphrases.",
        "Given a target word in context, the task is to provide several correct translations for that word in a given language.",
        "We used English as the source language and Spanish as the target language.",
        "We provided both development and test sets, but no training data.",
        "As for lexsub, any systems requiring training data had to obtain it from other sources.",
        "We included nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in both development and test data.",
        "We used the same set of 30 development words as in lexsub, and a subset of 100 words from the lexsub test set, selected so that they exhibit a wide variety of substitutes.",
        "For each word, the same example sentences were used as in lexsub.",
        "We used four annotators for the task, all native Spanish speakers from Mexico, with a high level of proficiency in English.",
        "As in lexsub, the annotators were allowed to use any resources they wanted to, and were required to provide as many substitutes as they could think of.",
        "The inter-tagger agreement (ITA) was calculated as pairwise agreement between sets of substitutes from annotators, as done in lexsub.",
        "The ITA without mode was determined as 0.2777, which is comparable with the ITA of 0.2775 determined for lexsub.",
        "One significant outcome of this task is that there are not necessarily clear divisions between usages and senses because we do not use a predefined sense inventory, or restrict the annotations to distinctive translations.",
        "This means that there can be usages that overlap to different extents with each other but do not have identical translations.",
        "An example is the target adverb severely.",
        "Four sentences are shown in Figure 1 with the translations provided by one annotator marked in italics and {} braces.",
        "Here, all the token occurrences seem related to each other in that they share some translations, but not all.",
        "There are sentences like 1 and 2 that appear not to have anything in common.",
        "However 1, 3, and 4 seem to be partly related (they share sever cimente), and 2, 3, and 4 are also partly related (they share seriamente).",
        "When we look again, sentences 1 and 2, though not directly related, both have translations in common with sentences 3 and 4.",
        "We adopted the best and out-of-ten precision and recall scores from lexsub (oot in the equations below).",
        "The systems were allowed to supply as many translations as they feel fit the context.",
        "The system translations are then given credit depending on the number of annotators that picked each translation.",
        "The credit is divided by the number of annotator responses for the item and since for the best score the credit for the system answers for an item is also divided by the number of answers the system provides, this allows more credit to be given to instances where there is less variation.",
        "For that reason, a system is better guessing the translation that is most frequent unless it really wants to hedge its bets.",
        "Thus if i is an item in the set of instances I, and Tj is the multiset of gold standard translations from the human annotators for i, and a system provides a set of answers Si for i, then the best score for item i is:",

        "We note that there was an issue that the original lexsub out-of-ten scorer allowed duplicates (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009).",
        "The effect of duplicates is that systems can get inflated scores because the credit for each item is not divided by the number of substitutes and because the frequency of each annotator response is used.",
        "McCarthy and Navigli (2009) describe this oversight, identify the systems that had included duplicates and explain the implications.",
        "For our task, we decided to continue to allow for duplicates, so that systems can boost their scores with duplicates on translations with higher probability.",
        "For both the best and out-of-ten measures, we also report a mode score, which is calculated against the mode from the annotators responses as was done in lexsub.",
