        "Word Sense Disambiguation, the task of selecting the correct sense of an ambiguous word in a given context, is a well-researched NLP problem (see for example Agirre and Edmonds (2006) and Navigli (2009)), largely boosted by the various Senseval and SemEval editions.",
        "The SemEval-2010 Cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task focuses on two bottlenecks in current WSD research, namely the scarcity of sense inventories and sense-tagged corpora (especially for languages other than English) and the growing tendency to evaluate the performance of WSD systems in a real application such as machine translation and cross-language information retrieval (see for example Agirre et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "The Cross-lingual WSD task aims at the development of a multilingual data set to test the feasibility of multilingual WSD.",
        "Many studies have already shown the validity of this cross-lingual evidence idea (Gale et al., 1993; Ide et al., 2002; Ng et al., 2003; Apidianaki, 2009), but until now no benchmark data sets have been available.",
        "For the SemEval-2010 competition we developed (i) a sense inventory in which the sense distinctions were extracted from the multilingual corpus Europarl and (ii) a data set in which the ambiguous words were annotated with the senses from the multilingual sense inventory.",
        "The Cross-Lingual WSD task is a lexical sample task for English nouns, in which the word senses are made up of the translations in five languages, viz. Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish and German.",
        "Both the sense inventory and the annotated data set were constructed for a sample of 25 nouns.",
        "The data set was divided into a trial set of 5 ambiguous nouns and a test set of 20 nouns.",
        "The participants had to automatically determine the contextually appropriate translation for a given English noun in each or a subset of the five target languages.",
        "Only translations present in Europarl were considered as valid translations.",
        "The remainder of this article is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 focuses on the task description and gives a short overview of the construction of the sense inventory and the annotation of the benchmark data set with the senses from the multilingual sense inventory.",
        "Section 3 clarifies the scoring metrics and presents two frequency-based baselines.",
        "The participating systems are presented in Section 4, while the results of the task are discussed in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 concludes this paper.",
        "Two types of data sets were used in the Cross-lingual WSD task: (a) a parallel corpus on the basis of which the gold standard sense inventory was created and (b) a collection of English sentences containing the lexical sample words annotated with their contextually appropriate translations in five languages.",
        "xhttp://www.statmt.org/europarl/",
        "Below, we provide a short summary of the complete data construction process.",

        "The gold standard sense inventory was derived from the Europarl parallel corpus, which is extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament (Koehn, 2005).",
        "We selected 6 languages from the 11 European languages represented in the corpus, viz. English (our target language), Dutch, French, German, Italian and Spanish.",
        "All data were already sentence-aligned using a tool based on the Gale and Church (1991) algorithm, which was part of the Europarl corpus.",
        "We only considered the 1-1 sentence alignments between English and the five other languages.",
        "These sentence alignments were made available to the task participants for the five trial words.",
        "The sense inventory extracted from the parallel data set (Section 2.2) was used to annotate the sentences in the trial set and the test set, which were extracted from the JRC-ACQUIS Multilingual Parallel Corpus and BNC.",
        "Two steps were taken to obtain a multilingual sense inventory: (1) word alignment on the sentences to find the set of possible translations for the set of ambiguous nouns and (2) clustering by meaning (per target word) of the resulting translations.",
        "GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) was used to generate the initial word alignments, which were manually verified by certified translators in all six involved languages.",
        "The human annotators were asked to assign a \"NULL\" link to words for which no valid translation could be identified.",
        "Furthermore, they were also asked to provide extra information on compound translations (e.g. the Dutch word In-vesteringsbank translation of the English multiword Investment Bank), fuzzy links, or target words with a different PoS (e.g. the verb to bank).",
        "The manually verified translations were clustered by meaning by one annotator.",
        "In order to do so, the translations were linked across languages on the basis of unique sentence IDs.",
        "After the selection of all unique translation combinations, the translations were grouped into clusters.",
        "The clusters were organized in two levels, in which the top level reflects the main sense categories (e.g. for the word coach we have (1) (sports) manager, (2) bus, (3) carriage and (4) part of a train), and the subclusters represent the finer sense distinctions.",
        "Translations that correspond to English multiword units were identified and in case of non-apparent compounds, i.e. compounds which are not marked with a the different compound parts were separated by §§ in the clustering file (e.g. the German Postkutsche).",
        "All clustered translations were also manually lemmatized.",
        "The resulting sense inventory was used to annotate the sentences in the trial set (20 sentences per ambiguous word) and the test set (50 sentences per ambiguous word).",
        "In total, 1100 sentences were annotated.",
        "The annotators were asked to (a) pick the contextually appropriate sense cluster and to (b) choose their three preferred translations from this cluster.",
        "In case they were not able to find three appropriate translations, they were also allowed to provide fewer.",
        "These potentially different translations were used to assign frequency weights (shown in example (2)) to the gold standard translations per sentence.",
