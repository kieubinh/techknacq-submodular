        "We first decided on an inventory of semantic relations.",
        "Ideally, it should be exhaustive (enable the description of relations between any pair of nominals) and mutually exclusive (each pair of nominals in context should map onto only one relation).",
        "The literature, however, suggests that no relation inventory satisfies both needs, and, in practice, some trade-off between them must be accepted.",
        "As a pragmatic compromise, we selected nine relations with coverage sufficiently broad to be of general and practical interest.",
        "We aimed at avoiding semantic overlap as much as possible.",
        "We included, however, two groups of strongly related relations (entity-origin / entity-destination and Content-Container / Component-Whole / Member-Collection) to assess models' ability to make such fine-grained distinctions.",

        "Our objective is to annotate instances of semantic relations which are true in the sense of holding in the most plausible truth-conditional interpretation of the sentence.",
        "This is in the tradition of the Textual Entailment or Information Validation paradigm (Dagan et al., 2009), and in contrast to \"aboutness\" annotation such as semantic roles (Carreras and Marquez, 2004) or the BioNLP 2009 task (Kim et al., 2009) where negated relations are also labelled as positive.",
        "Similarly, we exclude instances of semantic relations which hold only in speculative or counterfactural scenarios.",
        "In practice, this means disallowing annotations within the scope of modals or negations, e.g., \"Smoking may/may not have caused cancer in this case.\"",
        "We accept as relation arguments only noun phrases with common-noun heads.",
        "This distinguishes our task from much work in Information Extraction, which tends to focus on specific classes of named entities and on considerably more finegrained relations than we do.",
        "Named entities are a specific category of nominal expressions best dealt",
        "!The full task guidelines are available at http : / / docs .",
        "google.com/View?id=dfhkmm46_0f63mfvf7",
        "with using techniques which do not apply to common nouns.",
        "We only mark up the semantic heads of nominals, which usually span a single word, except for lexicalized terms such as science fiction.",
        "We also impose a syntactic locality requirement on example candidates, thus excluding instances where the relation arguments occur in separate sentential clauses.",
        "Permissible syntactic patterns include simple and relative clauses, compounds, and pre-and post-nominal modification.",
        "In addition, we did not annotate examples whose interpretation relied on discourse knowledge, which led to the exclusion of pronouns as arguments.",
        "Please see the guidelines for details on other issues, including noun compounds, aspectual phenomena and temporal relations.",
        "The annotation took place in three rounds.",
        "First, we manually collected around 1,200 sentences for each relation through pattern-based Web search.",
        "In order to ensure a wide variety of example sentences, we used a substantial number of patterns for each relation, typically between one hundred and several hundred.",
        "Importantly, in the first round, the relation itself was not annotated: the goal was merely to collect positive and near-miss candidate instances.",
        "A rough aim was to have 90% of candidates which instantiate the target relation (\"positive instances\").",
        "In the second round, the collected candidates for each relation went to two independent annotators for labeling.",
        "Since we have a multi-way classification task, the annotators used the full inventory of nine relations plus other.",
        "The annotation was made easier by the fact that the cases of overlap were largely systematic, arising from general phenomena like metaphorical use and situations where more than one relation holds.",
        "For example, there is a systematic potential overlap between Content-Container and Entity-Destination depending on whether the situation described in the sentence is static or dynamic, e.g., \"When I came, the <el>apples</el> were already put in the <e2>basket</e2>.\"",
        "is CC(el, e2), while \"Then, the <el>apples</el> were quickly put in the <e2>basket</e2>\" is ED(el, e2).",
        "In the third round, the remaining disagreements were resolved, and, if no consensus could be achieved, the examples were removed.",
        "Finally, we merged all nine datasets to create a set of 10,717 instances.",
        "We released 8,000 for training and kept the rest for testing.",
        "Table 1 shows some statistics about the dataset.",
        "The first column (Freq) shows the absolute and relative frequencies of each relation.",
        "The second column (Pos) shows that the average share of positive instances was closer to 75% than to 90%, indicating that the patterns catch a substantial amount of \"near-miss\" cases.",
        "However, this effect varies a lot across relations, causing the non-uniform relation distribution in the dataset (first column).",
        "After the second round, we also computed inter-annotator agreement (third column, IAA).",
        "Inter-annotator agreement was computed on the sentence level, as the percentage of sentences for which the two annotations were identical.",
        "That is, these figures can be interpreted as exact-match accuracies.",
        "We do not report Kappa, since chance agreement on preselected candidates is difficult to estimate.",
        "IAA is between 60% and 95%, again with large relation-dependent variation.",
        "Some of the relations were particularly easy to annotate, notably Content-Container, which can be resolved through relatively clear criteria, despite the systematic ambiguity mentioned above.",
        "Entity-Origin was the hardest relation to annotate.",
        "We encountered ontological difficulties in defining both Entity (e.g., in contrast to Effect) and Origin (as opposed to Cause).",
        "Our numbers are on average around 10% higher than those reported by Girju et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "This may be a side effect of our data collection method.",
        "To gather 1,200 examples in realistic time, we had to seek productive search query patterns, which invited certain homogeneity.",
        "For example, many queries for Content-Container centered on \"usual suspect\" such as box or suitcase.",

        "The systems use a variety of resources.",
        "Generally, richer feature sets lead to better performance (although the differences are often small - compare the different FBKJRST systems).",
        "This improvement can be explained by the need for semantic generalization from training to test data.",
        "This need can be addressed using WordNet (contrast ECNU-1 to 3 with ECNU-4 to -6), the Google n-gram collection (see ISI and UTD), or a \"deep\" semantic resource (FBKJRST uses Cyc).",

        "A combination of the top five systems using the same method shows a worse performance, however (80.42%).",
        "This suggests that the best system outperforms the rest by a margin that cannot be compensated with system combination, at least not with a crude majority vote.",
