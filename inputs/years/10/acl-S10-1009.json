        "Parser Evaluation using Textual Entailments (PETE) is a shared task that involves recognizing textual entailments based on syntactic information alone.",
        "Given two text fragments called \"text\" and \"hypothesis\", textual entailment recognition is the task of determining whether the meaning of the hypothesis is entailed (can be inferred) from the text.",
        "In contrast with general RTE tasks (Dagan et al., 2009) the PETE task focuses on syntactic entailments:",
        "Text: The man with the hat was tired.",
        "Hypothesis-1: The man was tired, (yes) Hypothesis-2: The hat was tired, (no)",
        "PETE is an evaluation scheme based on a natural human linguistic competence (i.e. the ability to comprehend sentences and answer simple yes/no questions about them).",
        "We believe systems should try to model natural human linguistic competence rather than their dubious competence in artificial tagging tasks.",
        "The parseval measures introduced nearly two decades ago (Black et al., 1991) still dominate the field of parser evaluation.",
        "These methods compare phrase-structure bracketings produced by the parser with bracketings in the annotated corpus, or \"treebank\".",
        "Parser evaluation using short textual entailments has the following advantages compared to treebank based evaluation.",
        "Consistency: Recognizing syntactic entailments is a more natural task for people than treebank annotation.",
        "Focusing on a natural human competence makes it practical to collect high quality evaluation data from untrained annotators.",
        "The PETE dataset was annotated by untrained Amazon Mechanical Turk workers at an insignificant cost and each annotation is based on the unanimous agreement of at least three workers.",
        "In contrast, of the 36306 constituent strings that appear multiple times in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994), 5646 (15%) have multiple conflicting annotations.",
        "If indicative of the general level of inconsistency, 15% is a very high number given that the state of the art parsers claim f-scores above 90% (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",
        "Relevance: PETE automatically focuses attention on semantically relevant phenomena rather than differences in annotation style or linguistic convention.",
        "Whether a phrase is tagged adjp vs advp rarely affects semantic interpretation.",
        "Attaching the wrong subject to a verb or the wrong prepositional phrase to a noun changes the meaning of the sentence.",
        "Standard treebank based evaluation metrics do not distinguish between semantically relevant and irrelevant errors (Bonnema et al., 1997).",
        "In PETE semantically relevant differences lead to different entailments, semantically irrelevant differences do not.",
        "Framework independence: Entailment recognition is a formalism independent task.",
        "A common evaluation method for parsers that do not use the Penn Treebank formalism is to automatically convert the Penn Treebank to the appropriate formalism and to perform treebank based evaluation (Nivre et al., 2007a; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007).",
        "The inevitable conversion errors compound the already mentioned problems of treebank based evaluation.",
        "In addition, manually designed treebanks do not naturally lend themselves to unsupervised parser evaluation.",
        "Unlike treebank based evaluation, PETE can compare phrase structure parsers, dependency parsers, unsupervised parsers and other approaches on an equal footing.",
        "PETE was inspired by earlier work on representations of grammatical dependency, proposed for ease of use by end users and suitable for parser evaluation.",
        "These include the grammatical relations (GR) by (Carroll et al., 1999), the PARC representation (King et al., 2003), and Stanford typed dependencies (SD) (De Marneffe et al., 2006) (See (Bos and others, 2008) for other proposals).",
        "Each use a set of binary relations between words in a sentence as the primary unit of representation.",
        "They share some common motivations: usability by people who are not (computational) linguists and suitability for relation extraction applications.",
        "Here is an example sentence and its SD representation (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008):",
        "Bell, based in Los Angeles, makes and distributes electronic, computer and building products.",
        "PETE goes one step further by translating most of these dependencies into natural language entailments.",
        "Bell makes something.",
        "Bell distributes something.",
        "Someone is based in Los Angeles.",
        "Someone makes products.",
        "PETE has some advantages over representations based on grammatical relations.",
        "For example SD defines 55 relations organized in a hierarchy, and it may be non-trivial for a non-linguist to understand the difference between ccomp (clausal complement with internal subject) and xcomp (clausal complement with external subject) or between nsubj (nominal subject) and xsubj (controlling subject).",
        "In fact it could be argued that proposals like SD replace one artificial annotation formalism with another and no two such proposals agree on the ideal set of binary relations to use.",
        "In contrast, untrained annotators have no difficulty unanimously agreeing on the validity of most PETE type entailments.",
        "However there are also significant challenges associated with an evaluation scheme like PETE.",
        "It is not always clear how to convert certain relations into grammatical hypothesis sentences without including most of the original sentence in the hypothesis.",
        "Including too much of the sentence in the hypothesis would increase the chances of getting the right answer with the wrong parse.",
        "Grammatical hypothesis sentences are especially difficult to construct when a (negative) entailment is based on a bad parse of the sentence.",
        "Introducing dummy words like \"someone\" or \"something\" alleviates part of the problem but does not help in the case of clausal complements.",
        "In summary, PETE makes the annotation phase more practical and consistent but shifts the difficulty to the entailment creation phase.",
        "PETE gets closer to an extrinsic evaluation by focusing on semantically relevant, application oriented differences that can be expressed in natural language sentences.",
        "This makes the evaluation procedure indirect: a parser developer has to write an extension that can handle entailment questions.",
        "However, given the simplicity of the entailments, the complexity of such an extension is comparable to one that extracts grammatical relations.",
        "The balance of what is being evaluated is also important.",
        "A treebank based evaluation scheme may mix semantically relevant and irrelevant mistakes, but at least it covers every sentence at a uniform level of detail.",
        "In this evaluation, we focused on sentences and relations where state of the art parsers disagree.",
        "We hope this methodology will uncover weaknesses that the next generation systems can focus on.",
        "The remaining sections will go into more detail about these challenges and the solutions we have chosen to implement.",
        "Section 2 explains the method followed to create the PETE dataset.",
        "Section 3 evaluates the baseline systems the task organizers created by implementing simple entailment extensions for several state of the art parsers.",
        "Section 4 presents the participating systems, their methods and results.",

        "we construct the entailment \"John kissed somebody.\")",
