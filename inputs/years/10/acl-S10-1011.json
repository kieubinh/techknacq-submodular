        "In this task, participants were required to induce the senses of 100 target words using a training set, and then disambiguate unseen instances of the same words using the induced senses.",

        "Word senses are more beneficial than simple word forms for a variety of tasks including Information Retrieval, Machine Translation and others (Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "However, word senses are usually represented as a fixed-list of definitions of a manually constructed lexical database.",
        "Several deficiencies are caused by this representation, e.g. lexical databases miss main domain-specific senses (Pantel and Lin, 2002), they often contain general definitions and suffer from the lack of explicit semantic or contextual links between concepts (Agirre et al., 2001).",
        "More importantly, the definitions of hand-crafted lexical databases often do not reflect the exact meaning of a target word in a given context (Veronis, 2004).",
        "Unsupervised Word Sense Induction (WSI) aims to overcome these limitations of hand-constructed lexicons by learning the senses of a target word directly from text without relying on any hand-crafted resources.",
        "The primary aim of SemEval-2010 WSI task is to allow comparison of unsupervised word sense induction and disambiguation systems.",
        "Sameer S. Pradhan",
        "BBN Technologies Cambridge, USA",
        "The target word dataset consists of 100 words, 50 nouns and 50 verbs.",
        "For each target word, participants were provided with a training set in order to learn the senses of that word.",
        "In the next step, participating systems were asked to disambiguate unseen instances of the same words using their learned senses.",
        "The answers of the systems were then sent to organisers for evaluation."

        "Figure 1 provides an overview of the task.",
        "As can be observed, the task consisted of three separate phases.",
        "In the first phase, training phase, participating systems were provided with a training dataset that consisted of a set of target word (noun/verb) instances (sentences/paragraphs).",
        "Participants were then asked to use this training dataset to induce the senses of the target word.",
        "No other resources were allowed with the exception of NLP components for morphology and syntax.",
        "In the second phase, testing phase, participating systems were provided with a testing dataset that consisted of a set of target word (noun/verb) instances (sentences/paragraphs).",
        "Participants were then asked to tag (disambiguate) each testing instance with the senses induced during the training phase.",
        "In the third and final phase, the tagged test instances were received by the organisers in order to evaluate the answers of the systems in a supervised and an unsupervised framework.",
        "Table 1 shows the total number of target word instances in the training and testing set, as well as the average number of senses in the gold standard.",
        "The main difference of the SemEval-2010 as compared to the SemEval-2007 sense induction task is that the training and testing data are treated separately, i.e the testing data are only used for sense tagging, while the training data are only used",

        "Treating the testing data as new unseen instances ensures a realistic evaluation that allows to evaluate the clustering models of each participating system.",
        "The evaluation framework of SemEval-2010 WSI task considered two types of evaluation.",
        "In the first one, unsupervised evaluation, systems' answers were evaluated according to: (1) V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007), and (2) paired F-Score (Artiles et al., 2009).",
        "Neither of these measures were used in the SemEval-2007 WSI task.",
        "Manandhar & Klapaftis (2009) provide more details on the choice of this evaluation setting and its differences with the previous evaluation.",
        "The second type of evaluation, supervised evaluation, follows the supervised evaluation of the SemEval-2007 WSI task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007).",
        "In this evaluation, induced senses are mapped to gold standard senses using a mapping corpus, and systems are then evaluated in a standard WSD task.",
        "The target word dataset consisted of 100 words, i.e. 50 nouns and 50 verbs.",
        "The training dataset for each target noun or verb was created by following a web-based semi-automatic method, similar to the method for the construction of Topic Signatures (Agirre et al., 2001).",
        "Specifically, for each WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) sense of a target word, we created a query of the following form:",
        "<Target Word> AND <Relative Set>",
        "The <Target Word> consisted of the target word stem.",
        "The <Relative Set> consisted of a disjunctive set of word lemmas that were related to the target word sense for which the query was created.",
        "The relations considered were WordNet's hypernyms, hyponyms, synonyms, meronyms and holonyms.",
        "Each query was manually checked by one of the organisers to remove ambiguous words.",
        "The following example shows the query created for the first and second WordNet sense of the target noun failure.",
        "The created queries were issued to Yahoo!",
        "search API and for each query a maximum of 1000 pages were downloaded.",
        "For each page we extracted fragments of text that occurred in <p> </p> html tags and contained the target word stem.",
        "In the final stage, each extracted fragment of text was POS-tagged using the Genia tagger (Tsu-ruoka and Tsujii, 2005) and was only retained, if the POS of the target word in the extracted text matched the POS of the target word in our dataset.",
        "The testing dataset consisted of instances of the same target words from the training dataset.",
        "This dataset is part of OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).",

        "Hence, instead of taking the raw conditional entropy, V-Measure normalises it by the maximum reduction in entropy the clustering information could provide, i.e. H(S).",
