        "This paper reports an overview of the SemEval2 Japanese Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task.",
        "It can be considered an extension of the SENSEVAL-2 Japanese monolingual dictionary-based task (Shirai, 2001), so it is a lexical sample task.",
        "Word senses are defined according to the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten (Nishio et al., 1994), a Japanese dictionary published by Iwanami Shoten.",
        "It was distributed to participants as a sense inventory.",
        "Our task has the following two new characteristics:",
        "1.",
        "All previous Japanese sense-tagged corpora were from newspaper articles, while sense-tagged corpora were constructed in English on balanced corpora, such as Brown corpus and BNC corpus.",
        "The first balanced corpus of contemporary written Japanese (BCCWJ corpus) is now being constructed as part of a national project in Japan (Maekawa, 2008), and we are now constructing a sense-tagged corpus based on it.",
        "Therefore, the task will use the first balanced Japanese sense-tagged corpus.",
        "Because a balanced corpus consists of documents from multiple genres, the corpus can be divided into multiple sub-corpora of a genre.",
        "In supervised learning approaches on word sense disambiguation, because word sense distribution might vary across different sub-corpora, we need to take into account the genres of training and test corpora.",
        "Therefore, word sense disambiguation on a balanced corpus requires tackling a kind of domain (genre) adaptation problem (Chang and Ng, 2006; Agirre and de Lacalle, 2008).",
        "2.",
        "In previous WSD tasks, systems have been required to select a sense from a given set of senses in a dictionary for a word in one context (an instance).",
        "However, the set of senses in the dictionary is not always complete.",
        "New word senses sometimes appear after the dictionary has been compiled.",
        "Therefore, some instances might have a sense that cannot be found in the dictionary's set.",
        "The task will take into account not only the instances that have a sense in the given set but also the instances that have a sense that cannot be found in the set.",
        "In the latter case, systems should output that the instances have a sense that is not in the set.",
        "Training data, a corpus that consists of three genres (books, newspaper articles, and white papers) and is manually annotated with sense IDs, was also distributed to participants.",
        "For the evaluation, we distributed a corpus that consists of four genres (books, newspaper articles, white papers, and documents from a Q&A site on the WWW) with marked target words as test data.",
        "Participants were requested to assign one or more sense IDs to each target word, optionally with associated probabilities.",
        "The number of target words was 50, with 22 nouns, 23 verbs, and 5 adjectives.",
        "Fifty instances of each target word were provided, consisting of a total of 2,500 instances for the evaluation.",
        "In what follows, section two describes the details of the data used in the Japanese WSD task.",
        "Section three describes the process to construct the sense tagged data, including the analysis of an inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Section four briefly introduces participating systems and section five describes their results.",
        "Finally, section six concludes the paper.",
        "In the Japanese WSD task, three types of data were distributed to all participants: a sense inventory, training data, and test data.",
        "As described in section one, word senses are defined according to a Japanese dictionary, the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten.",
        "The number of headwords and word senses in the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten is 60,321 and 85,870.",
        "As described in the task description of SENSEVAL-2 Japanese dictionary task (Shirai, 2001), the Iwanami Kokugo Jiten has hierarchical structures in word sense descriptions.",
        "The Iwanami Kokugo Jiten has at most three hierarchical layers.",
        "An annotated corpus was distributed as the training data.",
        "It consists of 240 documents of three genres (books, newspaper articles, and white papers) from the BCCWJ corpus.",
        "The annotated information in the training data is as follows:",
        "• Morphological information The document was annotated with morphological information (word boundaries, a part-of-speech (POS) tag, a base form, and a reading) for all words.",
        "All the morphological information was automatically annotated using chasen with unidic and was manually post-edited.",
        "'Due to space limits, we unfortunately cannot present the statistics of the training and test data, such as the number of instances in different genres, the number of instances for a new word sense, and the Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence (Lin, 1991; Dagan et al., 1997) between the word sense distributions of two different genres.",
        "We hope we will present them in another paper in the near future.",
        "• Genre code",
        "Each document was assigned a code indicating its genre from the aforementioned list.",
        "• Word sense IDs",
        "3,437 word types in the data were annotated for sense IDs, and the data contain 31,611 sense-tagged instances that include 2,500 instances for the 50 target words.",

        "3.",
        "They were ambiguous, that is, there were more than two word senses for them in the dictionary.",
        "Word sense IDs were manually annotated.",
        "2.3 Test Data",
        "The test data consists of 695 documents of four genres (books, newspaper articles, white papers, and documents from a Q&A site on the WWW) from the BCCWJ corpus, with marked target words.",
        "The documents used for the training and test data are not mutually exclusive.",
        "The number of overlapping documents between the training and test data is 185.",
        "The instances used for the evaluation were not provided as the training data.",

        "All morphological information was automatically annotated using chasen with unidic and was manually post-edited.",
