        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) competitions have focused on general domain texts, as attested in previous Senseval and SemEval competitions (Kilgarriff, 2001; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007).",
        "Specific domains pose fresh challenges to WSD systems: the context in which the senses occur might change, different domains involve different sense distributions and predominant senses, some words tend to occur in fewer senses in specific domains, the context of the senses might change, and new senses and terms might be involved.",
        "Both supervised and knowledge-based systems are affected by these issues: while the first suffer from different context and sense priors, the later suffer from lack of coverage of domain-related words and information.",
        "The main goal of this task is to provide a multilingual testbed to evaluate WSD systems when faced with full-texts from a specific domain.",
        "All datasets and related information are publicly available from the task websites.",
        "This task was designed in the context of Kyoto (Vossen et al., 2008), an Asian-European project that develops a community platform for modeling knowledge and finding facts across languages and cultures.",
        "The platform operates as a Wiki system with an ontological support that social communities can use to agree on the meaning of terms in specific domains of their interest.",
        "Kyoto focuses on the environmental domain because it poses interesting challenges for information sharing, but the techniques and platforms are",
        "!http://xmlgroup.iit.cnr.it/SemEval2 010/ and http://semeval2.fbk.eu/",
        "independent of the application domain.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first present the preparation of the data.",
        "Section 3 reviews participant systems and Section 4 the results.",
        "Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions."

        "The document content is comparable across languages.",
        "Table 1 shows the numbers for the datasets.",
        "Although the original plan was to annotate multiword terms, and domain terminology, due to time constraints we focused on single-word nouns and verbs.",
        "The test set clearly marked which were the words to be annotated.",
        "In the case of Dutch, we also marked components of single-word compounds.",
        "The format of the test set followed that of previous all-word exercises, which we extended to accommodate Dutch compounds.",
        "For further details check the datasets in the task website.",
        "The sense inventory was based on publicly available wordnets of the respective languages (see task website for details).",
        "The annotation procedure involved double-blind annotation by experts plus adjudication, which allowed us to also provide Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) figures for the dataset.",
        "The procedure was carried out using KAFnotator tool (Tesconi et al., 2010).",
        "Due to limitations in resources and time, the English dataset was annotated by a single expert annotator.",
        "For the rest of languages, the agreement was very good, as reported in Table 1.",
        "Table 1 includes the results of the random baseline, as an indication of the polysemy in each dataset.",

        "Although it's early to reach hard conclusions, the results show that in each of the datasets, knowledge-based systems are able to improve their results using background text, and in two datasets the adaptation of knowledge-based systems leads to results over the MFS baseline.",
        "The evidence of domain adaptation of supervised systems is weaker, as only one team tried, and the differences with respect to MFS are very small.",
        "The best results for English are obtained by a system that combines a knowledge-based system with some targeted hand-tagging.",
        "Regarding the techniques used, graph-based methods over WordNet and distributional thesaurus acquisition methods have been used by several teams.",
