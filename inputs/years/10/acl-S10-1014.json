        "In recent years, sentiment analysis has attracted considerable attention (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "It is the task of mining positive and negative opinions from natural language, which can be applied to many natural language processing tasks, such as document summarization and question answering.",
        "Previous work on this problem falls into three groups: opinion mining of documents, sentiment classification of sentences and polarity prediction of words.",
        "Sentiment analysis both at document and sentence level rely heavily on word level.",
        "The most frequently explored task at word level is to determine the semantic orientation (SO) of words, in which most work centers on assigning a prior polarity to words or word senses in the lexicon out of context.",
        "However, for some words, the polarity varies strongly with context, making it hard to attach each to a specific sentiment category in the lexicon.",
        "For example, consider \"low cost\" versus \"low salary\".",
        "The word \"low\" has a positive orientation in the first case but a negative orientation in the second case.",
        "Turney and Littman (2003) claimed that sentiment ambiguous words could not be avoided easily in a real-world application in the future research.",
        "But unfortunately, sentiment ambiguous words are discarded by most research concerning sentiment analysis (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004).",
        "The exception work is Ding et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "They call these words as context dependant opinions and propose a holistic lexicon-based approach to solve this problem.",
        "The language they deal with is English.",
        "The disambiguation of sentiment ambiguous words can also be considered as a problem of phrase-level sentiment analysis.",
        "Wilson et al.",
        "(2005) present a two-step process to recognize contextual polarity that employs machine learning and a variety of features.",
        "Takamura et al.",
        "(2006, 2007) propose latent variable model and lexical network to determine SO of phrases, focusing on \"noun+adjective\" pairs.",
        "Their experimental results suggest that the classification of pairs containing ambiguous adjectives is much harder than those with unambiguous adjectives.",
        "The task 18 at SemEval 2010 provides a benchmark data set to encourage studies on this problem.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 defines the task.",
        "Section 3 describes the data annotation.",

        "In this task, we focus on 14 frequently used sentiment ambiguous adjectives in Chinese, which all have the meaning of measurement, as shown below.",
        "(1) Sentiment ambiguous adjectives(SAAs) ={ jç.",
        "da \"large\", # duo \"many\", M gao \"high\", W hou \"thick\", m shen \"deep\", S zhong \"heavy\", Iêl;^ ju-da \"huge\", J!y^ zhong-da \"great\", // xiao \"small\", 4 shao \"few\", {Ë di \"low\", M bao \"thin\", m qian \"shallow\", g qing \"light\"}",
        "These adjectives are neutral out of context, but when they co-occur with some target nouns, positive or negative emotion will be evoked.",
        "Although the number of such ambiguous adjectives is not large, they are frequently used in real text, especially in the texts expressing opinions and emotions.",
        "The task is designed to automatically determine the SO of these sentiment ambiguous adjectives within context: positive or negative.",
        "For example, M gao \"high\" should be assigned as positive in I§M gong-zi-gao \"salary is high\" but negative in ifrfè-Flï jia-ge-gao \"price is high\".",
        "This task was carried out in an unsupervised setting.",
        "No training data was provided, but external resources are encouraged to use.",
        "We collected data from two sources.",
        "The main part was extracted from Xinhua News Agency of Chinese Gigaword (Second Edition) released by LDC.",
        "The texts were automatically word-segmented and POS-tagged using the open software ICTCLAS.",
        "In order to concentrate on the disambiguation of sentiment ambiguous adjectives, and reduce the noise introduced by the parser, we extracted sentences containing strings in pattern of (2), where the target nouns are modified by the adjectives in most cases.",
        "(2) noun+adverb+adjective (adjective G SAAs) e.g. J^c^/n $J/d {ft/a cheng-ben-jiao-di",
        "Another small part of data was extracted from the Web.",
        "Using the search engine Google, we searched the queries as in (3):",
        "(3) hen \"very\"+ adjective (adjective G SAAs )",
        "From the returned snippets, we manually picked out some sentences that contain the strings of (2).",
        "Also, the sentences were automatically segmented and POS-tagged using ICTCLAS.",
        "Sentiment ambiguous adjectives in the data were assigned as positive, negative or neutral, independently by two annotators.",
        "Since we focus on the distinction between positive and negative categories, the neutral instances were removed.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement is in a high level with a kappa of 0.91.",
        "After cases with disagreement were negotiated between the two annotators, a gold standard annotation was agreed upon.",
        "In total 2917 instances were provided as the test data in the task, and the number of sentences of per target adjective is listed in Table 2.",
        "Evaluation was performed in micro accuracy and macro accuracy:",
        "where N is the number of all target words, ni is the number of all test instances for a specific word, and mi is the number of correctly labeled instances.",
        "We group 14 sentiment ambiguous adjectives into two categories: positive-like adjectives and negative-like adjectives.",
        "The former has the connotation towards large measurement, whereas the latter towards small measurement.",
        "We conduct a baseline in the dataset.",
        "Not considering the context, assign all positive-like adjectives as positive and all negative-like adjectives as negative.",
        "The micro accuracy of the baseline is 61.20%.",

        "The accuracy of the best three systems is even higher than inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The performance of the worst system is only a little higher than random baseline, which is 50% when we randomly assign the SO of sentiment ambiguous adjectives.",
        "Table 2 shows that the performance of different systems differs greatly on each of 14 target adjectives.",

        "HITSZ_CITYU_2 and HITSZ_CITYU_1: Using HowNet-based word similarity as clue, the authors expand the seed collocations on both ambiguous adjectives side and collocated targets side.",
        "The authors then exploit sentence-level opinion analysis to further improve performance.",
        "The strategy is that if the neighboring sentences on both sides have the same polarity, the ambiguous adjective is assigned as the same polarity; if the neighboring sentences have conflicted polarity, the SO of ambiguous adjective is determined by its context words and the transitive probability of sentence polarity.",
        "The two systems use different parameters and combination strategy.",
        "OpAL This system combines supervised methods with unsupervised ones.",
        "The authors employ Google translator to translate the task dataset from Chinese to English, since their system is working in English.",
        "The system explores three types of judgments.",
        "The first one trains a SVM classifier based on NTCIR data and EmotiBlog annotations.",
        "The second one uses search engine, issuing queries of \"noun + SAA + AND + non-ambiguous adjective\".",
        "The non-ambiguous adjectives include positive set (\"positive, beautiful, good\") and negative set (\"negative, ugly, bad\").",
        "An example is \"price high and good\".",
