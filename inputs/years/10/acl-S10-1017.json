        "RelaxCor have participated in the Semeval task for English, Catalan and Spanish.",
        "The system does not detect the mentions of the text by itself.",
        "Thus, the participation has been restricted to the gold-standard evaluation, which includes the manual annotated information and also provides the mention boundaries.",
        "All the knowledge required by the feature functions (Figure 1) is obtained from the annotations of the corpora and no external resources have been used, with the exception of WordNet (Miller, 1995) for English.",
        "In this case, the system has been run two times for English: English-open, using WordNet, and English-closed, without WordNet.",
        "The whole methodology of RelaxCor including the resolution algorithm and the training process is totally independent of the language of the document.",
        "The only parts that need few adjustments are the preprocess and the set of feature functions.",
        "In most cases, the modifications in the feature functions are just for the different format of the data for different languages rather than for specific language issues.",
        "Moreover, given that the task includes many information about the mentions of the documents such as part of speech, syntactic dependency, head and semantic role, no preprocess has been needed.",
        "One of the problems we have found adapting the system to the task corpora was the large amount of available data.",
        "As described in Section 2.2, the training process generates a feature vector for each pair of mentions into a document for all the documents of the training data set.",
        "However, the great number of training documents and their length overwhelmed the software that learns the constraints.",
        "In order to reduce the amount of pair examples, we run a clustering process to reduce the number of negative examples using the positive examples as the centroids.",
        "Note that negative examples are near 94% of the training examples, and many of them are repeated.",
        "For each positive example (a corefering pair of mentions), only the negative examples with distance less than a threshold d are included in the final training data.",
        "The distance is computed as the number of different values inside the feature vector.",
        "After some experiments over development data, the value of d was assigned to 3.",
        "Thus, the negative examples were discarded when they have more than three features different than any positive example.",
        "Our results for the development data set are shown in Table 1.",
        "Results of RelaxCor for the test data set are shown in Table 2.",
        "One of the characteristics of the system is that the resolution process always takes into account the whole set of mentions and avoids any possible pair-linkage contradiction as well as forces transitivity.",
        "Therefore, the system favors the precision, which results on high scores with metrics CEAF and B.",
        "However, the system is penalized with the metrics based on pair-linkage, specially with MUC.",
        "Although RelaxCor has the highest precision scores even for MUC, the recall is low enough to finally obtain low scores for Fi.",

        "This confirms the robustness of the results of RelaxCor but also remarks that more knowledge or more information is needed to increase the recall of the system without loosing this precision",
        "The incorporation of WordNet to the English run is the only difference between English-open and English-closed.",
        "The scores are slightly higher when using WordNet but not significant.",
        "Analyzing the MUC scores, note that the recall is improved, while precision decreases a little which corresponds with the information and the noise that WordNet typically provides.",
        "The results for the test and development are very similar as expected, except the Spanish (es) ones.",
        "The recall considerably falls from development to test.",

      "text": [
        "The participation of RelaxCor to the Semeval coreference resolution task has been useful to evaluate the system in multiple languages using data never seen before.",
        "Many published systems typically use the same data sets (ACE and MUC) and it is easy to unintentionally adapt the system to the corpora and not just to the problem.",
        "This kind of tasks favor comparisons between systems with the same framework and initial conditions.",
        "The results obtained confirm the robustness of the RelaxCor, and the performance is considerably good in the state of the art.",
        "The system avoids contradictions in the results which causes a high precision.",
        "However, more knowledge is needed about the mentions in order to increase the recall without loosing that precision.",
        "A further error analysis is needed, but one of the main problem is the lack of semantic information and world knowledge specially for the nominal mentions - the mentions that are NPs but not including named entities neither pronouns-."
