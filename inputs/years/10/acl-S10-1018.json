        "In this paper, we introduce a new software tool for coreference resolution.",
        "Coreference resolution is the process of finding discourse entities (mark-ables) referring to the same real-world entity or concept.",
        "In other words, this process groups the markables of a document into equivalence classes (coreference entities) so that all markables in an entity are coreferent.",
        "There are various publicly available systems that perform coreference resolution, such as BART (Versley et al., 2008) and GUITAR (Stein-berger et al., 2007).",
        "A considerable engineering effort is needed for the full coreference resolution task, and a significant part of this effort concerns feature engineering.",
        "Thus, a system which is able to extract the features based on a feature definition language can help the researcher reduce the implementation effort needed for feature extraction.",
        "Most methods of coreference resolution, if providing a baseline, usually use a feature set similar to (Soon et al., 2001) or (Ng and Cardie, 2002) and do the feature extraction in the preprocessing stage.",
        "SUCRE has been developed to provide a more flexible method for feature engineering of coreference resolution.",
        "It has a novel approach to model an unstructured text corpus in a structured framework by using a relational database model and a regular feature definition language to define and extract the features.",
        "Relational databases are a well-known technology for structured data modeling and are supported by a wide array of software and tools.",
        "Converting a text corpus to/from its equivalent relational database model is straightforward in our framework.",
        "A regular language for feature definition is a very flexible method to extract different features from text.",
        "In addition to features defined directly in SUCRE, it accepts also externally extracted/generated features.",
        "Its modular architecture makes it possible to use any externally available classification method too.",
        "In addition to link features (features related to a markable pair), it is also possible to define other kinds of features: atomic word and markable features.",
        "This approach to feature engineering is suitable not only for knowledge-rich but also for knowledge-poor datasets.",
        "It is also language independent.",
        "The results of SUCRE in SemEval-2010 Task 1 show the promise of our framework."

        "In the word table, Word-ID is the index of the word, starting from the beginning of the corpus.",
        "It is used as the primary key to uniquely identify each token.",
        "Document-ID, Paragraph-ID and Sentence-ID are each counted from the beginning of the corpus, and also act as the foreign keys pointing to the primary keys of the document, paragraph and sentence tables, which are optional (the system can also work without them).",
        "It is obvious that the raw text as well as any other format of the corpus can be generated from the word table.",
        "Any word features (Word-Feature-#X columns) can be defined and will then be added to the word table in preprocessing.",
        "In the markable table, Markable-ID is the primary key.",
        "Begin-Word-ID, End-Word-ID and Head-Word-ID refer to the word table.",
        "Like the word features, the markable features are not mandatory and in the preprocessing we can decide which features are added to the table.",
        "In the link table, Link-ID is the primary key; First-Markable-ID and Second-Markable-ID refer to the markable table.",
        "For training, the system generates a positive training instance for each adjacent coreferent markable pair and negative training instances for a markable m and all markables disreferent with m that occur before m (Soon et al., 2001).",
        "For decoding it generates all the possible links inside a window of 100 markables.",
        "There are two main categories of features in SUCRE: Atomic Features and Link Features",
        "We first explain atomic features in detail and then turn to link features and the extraction method we use.",

        "An atomic feature is an attribute.",
        "For example the position of the word in the corpus is an atomic word feature.",
        "Atomic word features are stored in the columns of the word table called Word-Feature-X.",
        "In addition to word position in the corpus, document number, paragraph number and sentence number, the following are examples of atomic word features which can be extracted in preprocessing: Part of speech tag, Grammatical Gender (male, female or neutral), Natural Gender (male or female), Number (e.g. singular, plural or both), Semantic Class, Type (e.g. pronoun types: personal, reflexive, demonstrative ...), Case (e.g. nominative, accusative, dative or genitive in German) and Pronoun Person (first, second or third).",

        "In this case, the head words and the first four words of each markable are the same but they can not be coreferent; this can be detected only by looking at the last words.",
        "Sometimes we need to consider all words in the two markables, or even define a feature for a markable as a unit.",
        "To cover all such cases we need a regular feature definition language with some keywords to select different word combinations of two markables.",
        "For this purpose, we define the following variables, ml is the first markable in the pair, mlb, mle and mlh are the first, last and head words of the first markable in the pair, mla refers to all words of the first markable in the pair, ml, m2b, m2e, m2h and m2a have the same definitions as above but for the second markable in the pair.",
