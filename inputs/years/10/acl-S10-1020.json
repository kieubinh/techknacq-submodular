        "In our previous study (Uryupina, 2008) we have shown that up to 35% recall and 20% precision errors in coreference resolution for MUC corpora are due to inaccurate mention detection.",
        "We have therefore invested substantial efforts into our mention detection module.",
        "Most state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems operate either on gold markables or on the output of an ACE-style mention detection module.",

        "The remaining candidates are aligned with NE-mentions if an NE and an NP have the same last word, they are considered the same mention of a special type.",
        "Finally, the list of candidates is optionally filtered using a small stop-list (for example, all the \"there\" NPs in \"There is ..\" are discarded).",

        "We use the SVM-Light package (Joachims, 1999) for learning our classifiers.",
        "The strength of our system lies in its rich feature set for the coreference classifier.",
        "In our previous studies (Uryupina, 2006; 2007) we have tested up to 351 nominal/continuous (1096 boolean/continuous) features showing significant improvements over basic feature sets advocated in the literature.",
        "For the SemEval task 1, we have reduced our rich feature set to 64 nominal/continuous features for efficiency reasons: on the one hand, our new set is large enough to cover complex linguistic patterns of coreference, on the other hand, it allows us to test different settings and investigate possibilities for global modeling.",
        "Our anaphoricity classifier is used by the ILP model.",

        "During testing, a greedy clustering algorithm (link-first) is next used to build coreference chains on the output of the classifier.",
        "We have slightly extended this model to allow separate classifiers for different mention types: each candidate anaphor receives a type (e.g. \"pronoun\") and is processed with a corresponding classifier.",
        "We, thus, rely on a family of classifiers, with the same feature set and the same machine learner.",
        "The exact definition of mention types is a parameter to be determined empirically on the development set.",
        "Our global model is largely motivated by Denis and Baldridge (2007; 2008) and Finkel and Manning (2008).",
        "Following these studies, we use Integer Linear Programming to find the most globally optimal solution, given the decisions made by our coreference and anaphoricity classifiers.",
        "In general, an ILP problem is determined by an objective function to be maximized (or minimized) and a set of task-specific constraints.",
        "The function is defined by costs link<ij>, and dnewj reflecting potential gains and losses for committing to specific variable assignments.",
        "We assume that costs can be positive (for pairs of markables that are likely to be coreferent) or negative (for pairs of markables that are unlikely to be coreferent).",
        "The costs are computed by an external module (such as a family of local classifiers described above).",

        "Binary variables Dj indicate that the markable Mj is considered anaphoric in the output assignment.",

        "We take the transitive closure of all the proposed L<ij> to build the output partition.",
        "Note that the objective in (1) is not constrained in any way and will thus allow illegal variable assignments.",
        "For example it does not constrain the assignment of L and D variables to be consistent with one another and does not enforce transitivity.",
        "The following constraints suggested in the literature (Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Denis and Baldridge, 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008) ensure that these and other coreference properties are respected:"
