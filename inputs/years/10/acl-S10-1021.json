        "BART has originally been created and tested for English, but its flexible modular architecture ensures its portability to other languages and domains.",
        "In SemEval-2010 task 1 on Coreference Resolution, BART has shown reliable performance for English, German and Italian.",

        "Given a corpus in a new language, one can retrain BART to obtain baseline results.",

        "The BART toolkit has five main components: preprocessing pipeline, mention factory, feature extraction module, decoder and encoder.",
        "In addition, an independent LanguagePlugin module handles all the language specific information and is accessible from any component.",
        "The architecture is shown on Figure 1.",
        "Each module can be accessed independently and thus adjusted to leverage the system's performance on a particular language or domain.",
        "The preprocessing pipeline converts an input document into a set of lingustic layers, represented as separate XML files.",
        "The mention factory uses these layers to extract mentions and assign their basic properties (number, gender etc).",
        "The feature extraction module describes pairs of mentions {Mi, Mj}, i < j as a set of features.",
        "The decoder generates training examples through a process of sample selection and learns a pairwise classifier.",
        "Finally, the encoder generates testing examples through a (possibly distinct) process of sample selection, runs the classifier and partitions the mentions into coreference chains."

        "For English and German, we use the Parsing Pipeline and Mention Factory to extract mentions.",
        "The parse trees are used to identify minimal and maximal noun projections, as well as additional features such as number, gender, and semantic class.",
        "For English, we use parses from a state-of-the-art constituent parser (Petrov et al., 2006) and extract all base noun phrases as mentions.",
        "For German, the SemEval dependency tree is transformed to a constituent representation and minimal and maximal phrases are extracted for all nominal elements (pronouns, common nouns, names), except when the noun phrase is in a non-referring syntactic position (for example, expletive \"es\", predicates in copula constructions).",
        "For Italian, we use the EMD Pipeline and Mention Factory.",
        "The Typhoon (Zanoli et al., 2009) and DEMention (Biggio et al., 2009) systems were used to recognize mentions in the test set.",
        "For each mention, its head and extension were considered.",
        "The extension was learned by using the mention annotation provided in the training set (13th column) whereas the head annotation was learned by exploiting the information produced by MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "In addition to the features extracted from the training set, such as prefixes and suffixes (1-4 characters) and orthographic information (capitalization and hyphenation), a number of features extracted by using external resources were used: mentions recognized by TextPro (http://textpro.fbk.eu), gazetteers of generic proper nouns extracted from the Italian phone-book and Wikipedia, and other features derived from WordNet.",

        "Initially, BART creates the following semantic trees: \"(type: software) (relation: from(India))\", \"(type: software)\" and \"(type: software) (relation: from(China))\" When the second mention gets resolved to the first one, their semantic trees are merged to \"(type: software) (relation: from(India)\".",
        "Therefore, when we attempt to resolve the third mention, both candidate antecedents are rejected, as their relation attributes are incompatible with \"from(China)\" This approach helps us avoid erroneous links (such as the link between the second and the third mentions in our example) by leveraging entity-level information."
