        "We used a bilingual statistical dictionary, which is calculated with Giza++ by using the EU-ROPARL parallel corpus, in order to calculate the probability of a source word to be translated to a target word (which is assumed to be the correct sense of the source word but in a different language).",

        "The obtained values show that the unweighted version performs better thant the weighted one."

        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is considered one of the most important problems in Natural Language Processing (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006).",
        "It is claimed that WSD is essential for those applications that require of language comprehension modules such as search engines, machine translation systems, automatic answer machines, second life agents, etc.",
        "Moreover, with the huge amounts of information in Internet and the fact that this information is continuosly growing in different languages, we are encourage to deal with cross-lingual scenarios where WSD systems are also needed.",
        "Despite the WSD task has been studied for a long time, the expected feeling is that WSD should be integrated into real applications such as mono and multilingual search engines, machine translation systems, automatic answer machines, etc (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006).",
        "Different studies on this issue have demonstrated that those applications benefit from WSD, such as in the case of machine translation (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu., 2007).",
        "On the other hand, Lexical Substitution (LS) refers to the process of finding a substitute word for a source word in a given sentence.",
        "The LS task needs to be approached by firstly disambiguating the source word, therefore, these two tasks (WSD and LS) are somehow related.",
        "Since we are describing the modules of our system, we did not provide information of the datasets used.",
        "For details about the corpora, see the task description paper for both tasks (#2 and #3) in this volume (Mihalcea et al., 2010; Lefever and Hoste, 2010).",

        "In particular, we used the Naive Bayes classifier in two different ways.",
        "First, we calculated the probability of each word in the source language of being associated/translated to the corresponding word (in the target language).",
