        "The goal of the Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution task in Semeval-2010 (Mihalcea et al., 2010) is to find the best {best subtask) Spanish translation or the 10-best (pot subtask) translations for 100 different English source words depending on their context of occurrence.",
        "Source words include nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs.",
        "1,000 occurrences of such words are given along with a short context (a sentence).",
        "This task resembles that of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) within Machine Translation (MT).",
        "A few approaches have recently been proposed using standard WSD features to learn models using translations instead of senses (Specia et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan and Ng, 2007).",
        "In such approaches, the global WSD score is added as a feature to statistical MT systems, along with additional features, to help the system on its choice for the best translation of a source word or phrase.",
        "We exploit contextual information in alternative ways to standard WSD features and supervised approaches.",
        "Our two systems - USPw/v and WLV usp - use two main components: (i) a list of possible translations for the source word regardless of its context; and (ii) a contextual model that ranks such translations for each occurrence of the source word given its context.",
        "While these components constitute the core of most WSD systems, the way they are created and integrated in our systems differs from standard approaches.",
        "Our systems do not require a model to disambiguate / translate each particular source word, but instead use general models.",
        "We experimented with both corpus-based and standard dictionaries, and different learning methodologies to rank the candidate translations.",
        "Our main goal was to maximize the accuracy of the system in choosing the best translation.",
        "WlXusp is a very simple system based essentially on (i) a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system trained using a large parallel corpus to generate the n-best translations for each occurrence of the source words and (ii) a standard English-Spanish dictionary to filter out noisy translations and provide additional translations in case the SMT system was not able to produce a large enough number of legitimate translations, particularly for the oot subtask.",
        "USPw/v uses a dictionary built from a large parallel corpus using inter-language information theory metrics and an online-learning supervised algorithm to rank the options from the dictionary.",
        "The ranking is based on global and local contextual features, such as the mutual information between the translation and the words in the source context, which are trained using human annotation on the trial dataset."

        "Europarl was used both to train the SMT system and to generate dictionaries based on inter-language mutual information.",

        "Regular expressions were used to extract the content of the webpages, keeping only the translations of the words or phrasal expressions, and the outcome was manually revised.",
        "The manual revision was necessary to remove translations of long idiomatic expressions which were only defined through examples, for example, for the verb check: \"we checked up and found out he was lying - hicimos averiguaciones y comprobamos que mentfa\".",
        "The resulting dictionary contains a number of open domain (single or multi-word) translations for each of the 100 source words.",

        "Since the task specifies that translations should be given in their basic forms, and also in order to decrease the sparsity due to the rich morphology of Spanish, the parallel corpus was lemmatized using TreeTagger (Schmid, 2006), a freely available part-of-speech (POS) tagger and lemmatizer.",

        "Moses produces its own dictionary from the parallel corpus by using a word alignment tool and heuristics to build parallel phrases of up to seven source words and their corresponding target words, to which are assigned translation probabilities using frequency counts in the corpus.",
        "This methodology provides some very localized contextual information, which can help guiding the system towards choosing a correct translation.",
        "Additional contextual information is used by the language model component in Moses, which considers how likely the sentence translation is in the Spanish language (with a 5-gram language model).",
        "Using the phrase alignment information, the translation of each occurrence of a source word is identified in the output of Moses.",
        "Since the phrase translations are learned using the Europarl corpus, some translations are very specific to that domain.",
        "Moreover, translations can be very noisy, given that the process is unsupervised.",

        "This is a general-domain dictionary, but it is less likely to contain noise.",

        "The distributions pen and pes are monolingual and can been extracted from any monolingual corpus.",
        "To prevent discontinuities in Equation 3, we used a smoothing technique to avoid null probabilities.",
        "We assume that any monolingual event occurs at least once and the joint distribution is smoothed by a Guo's factor a = 0.1 (Guo et al., 2004):",
        "For each English source word, a list of Spanish translations was produced and ranked according to inter-language ML From the resulting list, the 50-best translations constrained by the POS of the original English word were selected.",
        "Features The inter-language MI is a feature which indicates the global suitability of translating a source token s into a target one t. However, inter-language MI is not able to provide local contextual information, since it does not take into account the source context sentence c. The following features were defined to achieve such capability:",
        "Weighted Average MI (aMI) consists in averaging the inter-language MI between the target word tj and every source word s in the context sentence c (Raybaud et al., 2009).",
        "The MI component is scaled in a way that long range dependencies are considered less important, as shown in Equation 4.",
        "The scaling factor «;(•) is assigned 1 for verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs up to five positions from the source word, and 0 otherwise.",
        "This feature gives an idea of how well the elements in a window centered in the source word head (Sj) align to the target word tj, representing the suitability of tj translating Sj in the given context.",
        "Modified Weighted Average MI (mMI) takes the average MI as previously defined, except that the source word head is not taken into account.",
        "In other words, the scaling function in Equation 4 equals 0 also when \\ i – j\\ =0.",

        "Based on whether or not that orientation is the same as that of the reference , the algorithm takes the decision between updating or not the parameters.",
        "When an update occurs, it is the one that results in the minimal changes in the parameters leading to correct labeling x, that is, guaranteeing that after the update the system will rank (a, b) correctly.",

        "For certain source words, our resulting set of translations is smaller than 10.",
        "For example, in the WlXusp system, whenever the set of alternative translations identified in Moses' top 1000-best list did not contain 10 legitimate translations, that is, 10 translations also found in the handcrafted dictionary, we simply copied other translations from that dictionary to amount 10 different translations.",
        "If they did not sum to 10 because the list of translations in the dictionary was too short, we left the set as it was.",
        "As a result, 58% of the 1000 test cases had fewer than 10 translations, many of them with as few as two or three translations.",

        "After receiving the gold-standard data, we computed the scores for a number of variations of our two systems.",
        "For example, we checked whether the performance of USPw/v is too dependent on the handcrafted dictionary, via the features B and T. Table 3 presents the performance of two variations of USPw/v: MI-aMI-mMI was trained without the two contextual flag features which depend on WlXusp.",

        "This can be explained by the little variation in the n-best lists produced by Moses: most of the variations account for word-order, punctuation, etc.",
