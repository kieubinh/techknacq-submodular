        "The out-of-ten score, henceforth oot, limited systems to a maximum of 10 responses for each test item.",
        "Unlike the best scoring method, the final score for each test item in the oot method is not divided by the actual number of responses provided by the system; therefore, systems could maximize their score by always providing exactly 10 responses.",
        "In addition, since Si is a multiset, the 10 responses in Si need not be unique.",
        "Further details on the oot scoring method and its impact on our systems can be found in Section 3.4.",
        "The final best and oot score for the system is computed by summing the individual scores for each item and, for recall, dividing by the number of tests items, and for precision, dividing by the number of test items answered.",
        "Our systems provided a response to every test item, so precision and recall are the same by this definition.",
        "For both best and oot, the Mode recall (similarly, Mode precision) measures the system's ability to identify the substitute that was the annotators' most frequently chosen substitute, when such a most frequent substitute existed (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007)."

        "The Swat-S system performed these two steps in the reverse order: first, the English sentences were translated into Spanish and then the monolingual lexical substitution algorithm was run on the translated output to provide a ranked list of Spanish substitutes.",
        "The monolingual lexical substitution algorithm used by both systems is an implementation of the syntagmatic coherence criterion used by the IRST2 system (Giuliano et al., 2007) in the SemEval-2007 Lexical Substitution task.",
        "For a sentence Hw containing the target word w, the IRST2 algorithm first compiles a set, E, of candidate substitutes for w from a dictionary, thesaurus, or other lexical resource.",
        "For each e e E, He is formed by substituting e for w in Hw.",
        "Each n-gram (2 < n < 5) of He containing the substitute e is assigned a score, /, equal to how frequently the n-gram appeared in a large corpus.",
        "For all triples (e, n, /) where / > 0, we add (e, n, /) to E'.",
        "E' is then sorted by n, with ties broken by /.",
        "The highest ranked item in E', therefore, is the triple containing the synonym e that appeared in the longest, most frequently occurring n-gram.",
        "Note that each candidate substitute e can appear multiple times in E'\\ once for each value of n.",
        "The list E' becomes the final output of the syntagmatic coherence criterion, providing a ranking for all candidate substitutes in E.",
        "The Swat-E system used the English Web IT 5-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006), the Spanish section of the WeblT European 5-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2009), Roget's online thesaurus, NLTK's implementation of the Lancaster Stemmer (Loper and Bird, 2002), Google's online English-Spanish dictionary, and SpanishDict's online dictionary.",

        "For each English test sentence Hw containing the target word w, we use the syntagmatic coherence criterion described above to create E, a ranking of the synonyms of w taken from Roget's thesaurus.",
        "We use the Lancaster stemmer to ensure that we count all morphologically similar lexical substitutes.",
        "Next, we use a bilingual dictionary to convert our candidate English substitutes into candidate Spanish substitutes, forming a new ranked list S'.",
        "For each item (e, n, /) in E', and for each Spanish translation s of e, we add the triple (s, n, /) to S'.",
        "Since different English words can have the same Spanish translation s, we can end up with multiple triples in S' that have the same values for s and n. For example, if s\\ is a translation of both e\\ and e2, and the triples (ei, 4,87) and (e2,4,61) appear in E', then S' will contain the triples (si, 4, 87) and (si, 4,61).",
        "We merge all such \"duplicates\" by summing their frequencies.",
        "In this example, we would replace the two triples containing s\\ with a new triple, (si, 4,148).",
        "After merging all duplicates, we resort S' by n, breaking ties by /.",
        "Notice that since triples are merged only when both s and n are the same, Spanish substitutes can appear multiple times in S'\\ once for each value of n.",
        "At this point, we have a ranked list of candidate Spanish substitutes, S'.",
        "From this list S', we keep only those Spanish substitutes that are direct translations of our original word w. The reason for doing this is that some of the translations of the synonyms of w have no overlapping meaning with w. For example, the polysemous English noun \"bug\" can mean a flaw in a computer program (cf. test item 572).",
        "Our thesaurus lists \"hitch\" as a synonym for this sense of \"bug\".",
        "Of course, \"hitch\" is also polysemous, and not every translation of \"hitch\" into Spanish will have a meaning that overlaps with the original \"bug\" sense.",
        "Translations such as \"enganche\", having the \"trailer hitch\" sense, are certainly not appropriate substitutes for this, or any, sense of the word \"bug\".",
        "By keeping only those substitutes that are also translations of the original word w, we maintain a cleaner list of candidate substitutes.",

        "(See Section 3.4 for further details on this process.)",
        "If there were no items in our ranked list, we returned the most frequent translations of w as determined by the un-igram counts of these translations in the Spanish Web IT corpus.",
        "For our best answer, we returned multiple responses when the highest ranked substitutes had similar frequencies.",
        "Since S was formed by transferring the frequency of each English substitute e onto all of its Spanish translations, a single English substitute that had appeared with high frequency would lead to many Spanish substitutes, each with high frequencies.",
        "(The frequencies need not be exactly the same due to the merging step described above.)",

        "We experimented with using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) to perform the machine translation and produce a word alignment but we found that Google's online translation tool produced better translations than Moses did when trained on the Europarl data we had available.",
        "In the original English sentence, the target word is marked with an XML tag.",
        "We had hoped that Google's translation tool would preserve the XML tag around the translated target word, but that was not the case.",
        "We also experimented with using quotation marks around the target word instead of the XML tag.",
        "The translation tool often preserved quotation marks around the target word, but also yielded a different, and anecdotally worse, translation than the same sentence without the quotation marks.",
        "(We will, however, return to this strategy as a backoff method.)",
        "Although we did not experiment with using a standalone word alignment algorithm to find the target word in the Spanish sentence, Section 4.3 provides insights into the possible performance gains possible by doing so.",
        "Without a word alignment, we were left with the following problem: Given a translated Spanish sentence H, how could we identify the word w that is the translation of the original English target word, vl Our search strategy proceeded as follows.",
        "1.",
        "We looked up v in our English-Spanish dictionary and searched H for one of these translations (or a morphological variant), choosing the matching translation as the Spanish target word.",
        "If the search yielded multiple matches, we chose the match that was in the most similar position in the sentence to the position of v in the English sentence.",
        "This method identified a match in 801 of the 1000 test sentences.",
        "2.",
        "If we had not found a match, we translated each word in H back into English, one word at a time.",
        "If one of the re-translated words was a synonym of v, we chose that word as the target word.",
        "If there were multiple matches, we again used position to choose the target.",
        "3.",
        "If we still had no match, we used Yahoo's translation tool instead of Google's, and repeated steps 1. and 2. above.",
        "4.",
        "If we still had no match, we reverted to using Google's translation tool, this time explicitly offsetting the English target word with quotation marks.",
        "In 992 of the 1000 test sentences, this four-step procedure produced a Spanish sentence Hw with a target w. For each of these sentences, we produced E', the list of ranked Spanish substitutes using the syntagmatic selection coherence criterion described in Section 3.1.",
        "We used the Spanish Web IT corpus as a source of n-gram counts, and we used the Spanish translations of v as the candidate substitution set E. For the remaining 8 test sentences where we could not identify the target word, we set E' equal to the top 10 most frequently occurring Spanish translations of v as determined by the unigram counts of these translations in the Spanish Web IT corpus.",
        "For each English sentence in the test set, we selected the single best item in E as our answer for the best scoring method.",
        "For the oot scoring method, we wanted to ensure that the translated target word w, identified in Section 3.3.2, was represented in our output, even if this substitute was poorly ranked in E'.",
        "Ifw appeared in E', then our oot answer was simply the first 10 entries in E'.",
        "\\îw was not in E', then our answer was the top 9 entries in E' followed by w.",
        "As we had done with our swat-E system, if the oot answer contained less than 10 items, we repeated answers until we had made 10 guesses.",
        "See the following section for more information.",
        "The metric used to calculate oot precision in this task (Mihalcea et al., 2010) favors systems that always propose 10 candidate substitutes over those that propose fewer than 10 substitutes.",

        "EseSi frequency(s g T) oot score =--- – --",
        "The final oot recall is just the average of these scores over all test items.",

        "A system that produces Si = {feliz, contento} would receive a score of = 0.75.",
        "However a system that produces Si with feliz and contento each appearing 5 times would receive a score of 5*2+5*1 =3.75.",
        "Importantly, a system that produced Si = {feliz, contento} plus 8 other responses that were not in the gold standard would receive the same score as the system that produced only Si = {feliz, contento}, so there is never a penalty for providing all 10 answers.",
        "For this reason, in both of our systems, we ensure that our oot response always contains exactly 10 answers.",
        "To do this, we repeatedly append our list of candidates to itself until the length of the list is equal to or exceeds 10, then we truncate the list to exactly 10 answers.",
        "For example, if our original candidate list was [a, b, c, d], our final oot response would be [a, b, c, d, a, b, c, d, a, b].",
        "Notice that this is not the only way to produce a response with 10 answers.",
        "An alternative would be to produce a response containing [a, b, c, d] followed by 6 other unique translations from the English-Spanish dictionary.",
        "However, we found that padding the response with unique answers was far less effective than repeating the answers returned by the syntagmatic coherence algorithm."

        "All test instances were answered, so precision equals recall.",
        "dict and dictcorp are the two baselines.",
        "Like the IRST2 system (Giuliano et al., 2007) submitted in the 2007 Lexical Substitution task, our system performed extremely well on the oot scoring method while performing no better than average on the best method.",
        "Further analysis should be done to determine if this is due to a flaw in the approach, or if there are other factors at work.",
        "Our oot performance was certainly helped by the fact that we chose to provide 10 answers for each test item.",
        "One way to measure this is to score both of our systems with all duplicate candidates removed.",
        "We can see that the recall of both systems drops off sharply: swat-E drops from 174.6 to 36.3, and Swat-S drops from 98.0 to 46.7.",
        "As was shown in Section 3.4, the oot system should always provide 10 answers; however, 12.8% of the Swat-S test responses, and only 3.2% of the Swat-E test responses contained no duplicates.",
        "In fact, 38.4% of the Swat-E responses contained only a single unique answer.",
        "Providing duplicate answers allowed us to express confidence in the substitutes found.",
        "If duplicates were forbidden, simply filling any remaining answers with other translations taken from the English-Spanish dictionary could only serve to increase performance.",
        "Another way to measure the effect of always providing 10 answers is to modify the responses provided by the other systems so that they, too, always provide 10 answers.",
        "Of the 14 submitted systems, only 5 (including our systems) provided 10 answers for each test item.",
        "Neither of the two baseline systems, dict and dictcorp, provided 10 answers for each test item.",
        "Using the algorithm described in Section 3.4, we re-scored each of the systems with answers duplicated so that each response contained exactly 10 substitutes.",

        "Although the swat-E system outperformed the Swat-S system in best recall, best Mode recall (\"Mode R\"), and oot recall, the Swat-S system outperformed the swat-E system by a large margin in oot Mode R (see Table 1).",
        "This result is easily explained by first referring to the method used to compute Mode recall: a score of 1 was given to each test instance where the oot response contained the annotators' most frequently chosen substitute; otherwise 0 was given.",
        "The average of these scores yields Mode R. A system can maximize its Mode R score by always providing 10 unique answers.",
        "Swat-E provided an average of 3.3 unique answers per test item and Swat-S provided 6.9 unique answers per test item.",
        "By providing more than twice the number of unique answers per test item, it is not at all surprising that swat-S outperformed Swat-E in the Mode R measure.",
