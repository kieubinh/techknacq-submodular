        "Acronyms.",
        "Acronyms usually replace long or frequently referenced terms.",
        "Results are improved by analysing acronyms (Krulwich and Burkey, 1996) because most of the times the expanded acronym is reported as a keyphrase, not the acronym and because our rank is sensitive to the number of words in a keyphrase.",
