        "Keyphrases are words, or groups of words, that capture the key ideas of a document.",
        "They represent important information concerning a document and constitute an alternative, or a complement, to full-text indexing.",
        "Pertinent keyphrases are also useful to potential readers who can have a quick overview of the content of a document and can select easily which document to read.",
        "Currently, the most powerful keyphrases extraction algorithms are based on supervised learning.",
        "These methods address the problem of associating keyphrases to documents as a classification task.",
        "However, the fact that this approach requires a corpus of similar documents, which is not always readily available, constitutes a major drawback.",
        "For example, if one encounters a new Web page, one might like to know quickly the main topics addressed.",
        "In this case, a domain-independent keyword extraction system that applies to a single document is needed.",
        "Several methods have been proposed for extracting keywords from a single document (Mat-suo and Ishizuka, 2004; Palshikar, 2007).",
        "The reported performances were slightly higher than that obtained using a corpus and selecting the words with the highest TF-IDF measure (Salton et al., 1975).",
        "The paper describes a new keyphrase extraction algorithm from a single document.",
        "We show that our system performs well without the need for a corpus.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section describes the principles of our keyphrase extraction system.",
        "We present the main parts of the algorithm in section 3, we detail the methods in section 4 and we conclude the paper."

        "When authors write documents, they have to think first at the way they will present their ideas.",
        "Most of the time, they establish content summaries that highlight the main topics of their texts.",
        "Then, they write the content of the documents by carefully selecting the most appropriate words to describe each topic.",
        "In this paper, we make the assumption that the words, or the set of words, that are representative of each topic constitute the keyphrases of the document.",
        "In the following of this paper, we call terms, the components of a document that constitute the vocabulary (see the detail of the identification of terms in subsection 4.3).",
        "In statistical natural language processing, one common way ofmodeling the contributions ofdif-ferent topics to a document is to treat each topic as a probability distribution over words.",
        "Therefore, a document is considered as a probabilistic mixture of these topics (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "Generative models can be used to relate a set of observations (in our case, the terms used in a document) to a set of latent variables (the topics).",
        "A particular generative model, which is well suited for the modeling of text, is called Latent Dirichlet",
        "Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Given a set of documents, the algorithms describes each document as a mixture over topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words.",
        "The idea is to perform first a clustering of the sentences of the document based on their semantic similarity.",
        "Intuitively, one can see each cluster as a part of the text dealing with semantically related content.",
        "Therefore, the initial document is divided into a set of clusters and LDA can then be applied on this new representation."

        "The local weighting function measures the importance of a term within a sentence and the global weighting function measures the importance of a term across the entire document.",
        "Three local weighting functions were investigated: term frequency, log of term frequency and binary.",
        "Five global weighting functions were also investigated: Normal, GfIdf (Global frequency x Inverse document frequency, Idf (Inverse document frequency), Entropy and none (details of calculation can be found in Dumais (1991) paper).",

        "where U is an m x m matrix, X is a m x n diagonal matrix with nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal, and VT denotes the transpose oîV ,wnxn matrix.",
        "It is often useful to approximate X using only r singular values (with r < min(m, n)), so that we have X = U^Vj + E, where E is an error or residual matrix, Ur is an m x r matrix, Sr is a k x r diagonal matrix, and Vr is an n x r matrix.",
        "NMF is a matrix factorization algorithm that decomposes a matrix with only positive elements into two positive elements matrices, with X = WH+E.",
        "Usually, only r components are fit, so E is an error or residual matrix, W is a non-negative m x r matrix and H is a non-negative r x n matrix.",
