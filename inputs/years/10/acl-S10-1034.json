        "Keyphrase extraction is a natural language processing task for collecting the main topics of a document into a list of phrases.",
        "Keyphrases are supposed to be available in the processed documents themselves, and the aim is to extract these most meaningful words and phrases from the documents.",
        "Keyphrase extraction summarises the content of a document as few phrases and thus provides a quick way to find out what the document is about.",
        "Keyphrase extraction is a basic text mining procedure that can be used as a ground for other, more sophisticated text analysis methods.",
        "Automatically extracted keyphrases may be used to improve the performance of information retrieval, automatic user model generation, document collection clustering and visualisation, summarisation and question-answering, among others.",
        "This article describes the participation of the Likey method in the Task 5 of the SemEval 2010 challenge, automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles (Kim et al., 2010).",
        "In statistical keyphrase extraction, many variations for term frequency counts have been proposed in the literature including relative frequencies (Dam-erau, 1993), collection frequency (Hulth, 2003), term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) (Salton and Buckley, 1988), among others.",
        "Additional features to frequency that have been experimented are e.g., relative position of the first occurrence of the term (Frank et al., 1999), importance of the sentence in which the term occurs (HaCohen-Kerner, 2003), and widely studied part-of-speech tag patterns, e.g. Hulth (2003).",
        "Matsuo and Ishizuka (2004) present keyword extraction method using word co-occurrence statistics.",
        "An unsupervised keyphrase extraction method by Liu et al.",
        "(2009) uses clustering to find exemplar terms that are then used for keyphrase extraction.",
        "Most of the presented methods require a reference corpus or a training corpus to produce keyphrases.",
        "Statistical keyphrase extraction methods without reference corpora have also been proposed, e.g. (Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2004; Bracewell et al., 2005).",
        "The later study is carried out for bilingual corpus.",
        "The data used in this work are from the SemEval 2010 challenge Task 5, automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles.",
        "The data consist of train, trial, and test data sets.",
        "The number of scientific articles and the total number of word tokens in each of the original data sets (before preprocessing) are given in Table 1.",
        "Three sets of \"correct\" keyphrases are provided for each article in each data set: reader-assigned keyphrases, author-provided keyphrases, and a combination of them.",
        "All reader-assigned keyphrases have been extracted manually from the papers whereas some of author-provided keyphrases may not occur in the content.",
        "The numbers of correct keyphrases in each data set are shown in Table 2.",

      "text": [
        "Likey keyphrase extraction approach comes from the tradition of statistical machine learning (Paukkeri et al., 2008).",
        "The method has been developed to be as language-independent as possible.",
        "The only language-specific component needed is a corpus in each language.",
        "This kind of data is readily available online or from other sources.",
        "Likey selects the words and phrases that best crystallize the meaning of the documents by comparing ranks of frequencies in the documents to those in the reference corpus.",
        "The Likey ratio (Paukkeri et al., 2008) for each phrase is defined as rankd(p) where rankd{p) is the rank value of phrase p in document d and rankr{p) is the rank value of phrase p in the reference corpus.",
        "The rank values are calculated according to the frequencies of phrases of the same length n. If the phrase p does not exist in the reference corpus, the value of the maximum rank for phrases of length n is used: rankr{p) = max-rankr{n) + 1.",
        "The Likey ratio orders the phrases in a document in such a way that the phrases that have the smallest ratio are the best candidates for being a keyphrase.",
        "As a post-processing step, the phrases of length n > 1 face an extra removal process: if one of the words composing the phrase has a rank of less than a threshold £ in the reference corpus, the phrase is removed from the keyphrase list.",
        "This procedure excludes phrases that contain function words such as \"of or \"the\".",
        "As another postprocessing step, phrases that are subphrases of those that have occurred earlier on the keyphrase list are removed, excluding e.g. \"language model\" if \"unigram language model\" has been already accepted as a keyphrase.",
        "Likey needs a reference corpus that is seen as a sample of the general language.",
        "In the present study, we use a combination of the English part of Europarl, European Parliament plenary speeches (Koehn, 2005) and the preprocessed training set as the reference corpus.",
        "All XML tags of meta information are excluded from the Europarl data.",
        "The size of the Europarl corpus is 35 800 000 words after removal of XML tags.",
        "The scientific articles are preprocessed by removing all headers including the names and addresses of the authors.",
        "Also the reference section is removed from the articles, as well as all tables, figures, equations and citations.",
        "Both scientific articles and the Europarl data is lowercased, punctuation is removed (the hyphens surrounded by word characters and apostrophes are kept) and the numbers are changed to <NUM> tag.",
        "The data is stemmed with English Porter stem-mer implementation provided by the challenge organizers, which differs from our earlier experiments.",
        "We use three baseline methods for keyphrase extraction.",
        "The baselines use uni-, bi-, and trigrams as candidates of keyphrases with tf-idf weighting scheme.",
        "One of the baselines is unsupervised and the other two are supervised approaches.",
        "The unsupervised method is to rank the candidates according to their tf-idf scores.",
        "The supervised methods are Naïve Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy (ME) implementations from WEKA package.",
