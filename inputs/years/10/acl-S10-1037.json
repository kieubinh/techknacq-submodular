        "The task of automatic keyphrase extraction has been studied for several years.",
        "Firstly, as semantic metadata useful for tasks such as summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Lawrie et al., 2001; DAvanzo and Magnini, 2005), but later recognizing the impact that good keyphrases would have on the quality of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications (Frank et al., 1999; Witten et al., 1999; Turney, 1999; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Medelyan and Witten, 2008).",
        "Thus, the selection of important, topical phrases from within the body of a document may be used in order to improve the performance of systems dealing with different NLP problems such as, clustering, question-answering, named entity recognition, information retrieval, etc.",
        "In general, a keyphrase may be considered as a sequence of one or more words that capture the main topic of the document, as that keyphrase is expected to represent one of the key ideas expressed by the document author.",
        "Following the previously mentioned hypothesis, we may take advantage of two different techniques of text analysis: maximal frequent sequences to extract a sequence of one or more words from a given text, and pageranking, expecting to extract those word sequences that represent the key ideas of the author.",
        "The interest on extracting high quality keyphrases from raw text has motivated forums, such as SemEval, where different systems may evaluate their performances.",
        "The purpose of SemEval is to evaluate semantic analysis systems.",
        "In particular, in this paper we are reporting the results obtained in Task #5 of SemEval-2 2010, which has been named: \"Automatic Keyphrase Extraction from Scientific Articles\".",
        "We focused this paper on the description of our approach and, therefore, we do not describe into detail the task nor the dataset used.",
        "For more information about this information read the \"Task #5 Description paper\", also published in this proceedings volume (Nam Kim et al., 2010).",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes into detail the components of the proposed approach.",

        "Definition: A sequence p = a\\ ■ ■ ■ cik is a subsequence of a sequence q if all the items ai occur in q and they occur in the same order as in p. If a sequence p is a subsequence of a sequence q we say that p occurs in q.",

        "The algorithm of PageRanking was defined by Brin and Page in (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "It is a graph-based algorithm used for ranking webpages.",

        "There are some other propossals, like the one presented in (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), where a textranking algorithm is presented.",
        "The authors consider a weighted version of PageRank and present some applications to NLP using unigrams.",
        "They also construct multi-word terms by exploring the conections among ranked words in the graph.",

        "The complete algoritmic description of the presented approach is given in Algorithm 1.",
        "Readers and writers keyphrases may be quite different.",
        "In particular, writers usually introduce acronyms in their text, but they use the complete or expanded representation of these acronyms for their keyphrases.",

        "In fact, we use a neighborhood criterion (a pair of MF S in the same sentence) for determining the links between those MFS's.",
        "Once the ranking is calculated, we may select those sequences of a given length (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams) as output of our system.",
