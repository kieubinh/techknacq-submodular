        "Key phrases are a set of words to capture the main topic of the document.",
        "Since key phrases contain the substance of the document, they are used in the large spectrum of areas; from applications which explicitly use key phrases such as automatic indexing, documents classification and search engine optimization in information retrieval, to applications which implicitly use key phrases such as summarization and question-answering systems.",
        "During the last decade, many previous works have dealt with the various methods for automatically extracting key phrases (e.g., Frank et al., 1999; Barker and Corrnacchia, 2000; Turney, 2003; Medelyan and Witten, 2006; Nguyen and Kan, 2007; Wan and Xiao, 2008).",
        "The task of extracting key phrases would be considered as a subtask of extracting terminology if key phrases are a kind of terms.",
        "Typical approaches for automatically extracting terms use linguistic preprocessing which involves morpho-syntactic analysis such as part-of-speech tagging and phrase chunking, and statistical postprocessing such as log likelihood which compares the term frequencies in a document against their expected frequencies derived in a bigger text.",
        "Besides, extracting terms prefers syntactically plausible noun phrases (NPs) which are mainly multi-words terms.",
        "Kim and Kan (2009) report that most of key phrases are often simple words than less often compound words.",
        "The task for extracting key phrases tend to include analyzing the document structure.",
        "Especially, extracting key phrases from well-structured scientific articles should consider cross-section information (Nguyen and Kan, 2007).",
        "This information has been explored to assess the suitability of features during learning in Kim and Kan (2009).",
        "Extracting key phrases, however, is more than to extracting terminology or analyzing the document structure.",
        "While terms are words which appear in specific contexts and analyse concept structures in domains of human activity, key phrases are words that capture the key idea of documents.",
        "In addition, while terms usually occur in the given document more often than we would expect to occur, key phrases do not necessarily occur frequently or key phrases do not occur at all in the document.",
        "Consequently, the task for extracting key phrases should not be considered as the subtask of extracting terminology and we are not able to directly apply general-purpose term extractors to extract key phrases.",
        "In this paper, we describe our method for \"Automatic Keyphrase Extraction from Scientific Artides\", the shared task of SemEval-2 Evaluation Exercise which we participated in.",
        "Although term extractors along with linguistically-motivated analysis allow us to extract even elaborated morpho-syntactic variation forms of terms, the naive statistic approach proposed in this paper is very simple and quite efficient for extracting keyphrases especially from well-structured scientific articles.",
        "In a nutshell, our method is based on empirical rules without any linguistically-motivated preprocessing.",
        "Empirical rules are obtained from the analysis of the characteristics of keyphrases by observing training data.",
        "The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the characteristics of keyphrases in scientific articles.",
        "Section 3 and 4 detail our naive statistic approach and experiment, respectively.",
        "We conclude this paper and discuss a further improvement in Section 6."
