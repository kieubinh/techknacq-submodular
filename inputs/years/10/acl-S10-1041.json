        "KP-Miner (El-Beltagy, 2006) (El-Beltagy, 2009) is a system for the extraction of keyphrases from English and Arabic documents.",
        "When developing the system, the goal was to build a general purpose keyphrase extraction system that can be easily configured by users based on their understanding of the documents from which keyphras-es are to be extracted and without the need for any training documents or the use of any sophisticated natural language processing or linguistic tools.",
        "As such, the keyphrase extraction process in KP-Miner is an unsupervised one.",
        "When building a general purpose keyphrase extraction system, this was an important objective, as training data is not always readily available for any type of data.",
        "The goal of entering the KP-Miner system into the SemEval-2 competition, was to see how well it will perform on a specific task, without making any changes in its default parameters."

      "text": [
        "Keyphrase extraction in the KP-Miner system is a three step process: candidate keyphrase selection, candidate keyphrase weight calculation and finally keyphrase refinement.",
        "Each of these steps, is explained in the following sub-sections.",
        "More details about the employed algorithm, and justification for using certain values for selected parameters, can be found in (El-Beltagy, 2009).",
        "In KP-Miner, a set of rules is employed in order to elicit candidate keyphrases.",
        "As a phrase will never be separated by punctuation marks within some given text and will rarely have stop words within it, the first condition a sequence of words has to display in order to be considered a candidate keyphrase, is that it is not be separated by punctuation marks or stop words.",
        "A total of 187 common stopwords (the, then, in, above, etc) are used in the candidate keyphrase extraction step.",
        "After applying this first condition on any given document, too many candidates will be generated; some of which will make no sense to a human reader.",
        "To filter these out, two further conditions are applied.",
        "The first condition states that a phrase has to have appeared at least n times in the document from which keyphrases are to be extracted, in order to be considered a candidate keyphrase.",
        "This is called the least allowable seen frequency(lasf) factor and in the English version of the system, this is set to 3.",
        "However, if a document is short, n is decremented depending on the length of the document.",
        "The second condition is related to the position where a candidate keyphrase first appears within an input document.",
        "Through observation as well as experimentation, it was found that in long documents, phrases occurring for the first time after a given threshold, are very rarely keyphras-es.",
        "So a cutoff constant CutOff is defined in terms of a number of words after which if a phrase appears for the first time, it is filtered out and ignored.",
        "The initial prototype of the KP-Miner system (El-Beltagy, 2006), set this cutoff value to a constant (850).",
        "Further experimentation carried out in (El-Beltagy, 2009) revealed that an optimum value for this constant is 400.",
        "In the implementation of the KP-Miner system, the phrase extraction step described above is carried out in two phases.",
        "In the first phase, words are scanned until either a punctuation mark or a stop word is encountered.",
        "The scanned sequence of words and all possible n-grams within the encountered sequence where n can vary from 1 to sequence length-1, are stemmed and stored in both their original and stemmed forms.",
        "If the phrase (in its stemmed or original form) or any of its sub-phrases, has been seen before, then the count of the previously seen term is incremented by one, otherwise the previously unseen term is assigned a count of one.",
        "Very weak stemming is performed in this step using only the first step of the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980).",
        "In the second phase, the document is scanned again for the longest possible sequence that fulfills the conditions mentioned above.",
        "This is then considered as a candidate keyphrase.",
        "Unlike most of the other keyphrase extraction systems, the devised algorithm places no limit on the length of keyp-hrases, but it was found that extracted keyphrases rarely exceed three terms.",
        "Single key features obtained from documents by models such as TF-IDF (Salton and Buckley, 1988) have already been shown to be representative of documents from which they've been extracted as demonstrated by their wide and successful use in clustering and classification tasks.",
        "However, when applied to the task of keyphrase extraction, these same models performed very poorly (Turney, 1999).",
        "By looking at almost any document, it can be observed that the occurrences of phrases is much less frequent than the occurrence of single terms within the same document.",
        "So it can be concluded that one of the reasons that TF-IDF performs poorly on its own when applied to the task of keyphrase extraction, is that it does not take this fact into consideration which results in a bias towards single words as they occur in larger numbers.",
        "So, a boosting factor is needed for compound terms in order to balance this bias towards single terms.",
        "In this work for each input document d from which keyphras-es are to be extracted, a boosting factor Bd is calculated as follows:",
        "and if Bd > a then Bd = a",
        "Here INdI is the number of all candidate terms in document d, IPdI is the number of candidate terms whose length exceeds one in document d and « and a are weight adjustment constants.",
        "The values used by the implemented system are 3 for a and 2.3 for « .",
        "To calculate the weights of document terms, the TF-IDF model in conjunction with the introduced boosting factor, is used.",
        "However, another thing to consider when applying TF-IDF for a general application rather than a corpus specific one, is that keyphrase combinations do not occur as frequently within a document set as do single terms.",
        "In other words, while it is possible to collect frequency information for use by a general single keyword extractor from a moderately large set of random documents, the same is not true for keyphrase information.",
        "There are two possible approaches to address this observation.",
        "In the first, a very large corpus of a varied nature can be used to collect keyphrase related frequency information.",
        "In the second, which is adopted in this work, any encountered phrase is considered to have appeared only once in the corpus.",
        "This means that for compound phrases, frequency within a document as well as the boosting factor are really what determine its weight as the idf value for all compound phrases will be a constant c determined by the size of the corpus used to build frequency information for single terms.",
        "If the position rules described in (El-Beltagy, 2009) are also employed, then the position factor is also used in the calculation for the term weights.",
        "In summary, the following equation is used to calculate the weight of candidate keyphrases whether single or compound:",
        "wij = tfi* idf* Bi* Pf Where:",
        "wij = weight of term tj in Document Ditfij = frequency of term tj in Document Diidf = log2 N/n where N is the number of documents in the collection and n is number of documents where term tj occurs at least once.",
        "If the term is compound, n is set to 1.",
        "Bi = the boosting factor associated with document Di",
        "Pf= the term position associated factor.",
        "If position rules are not used this is set to 1.",
        "The KP-Miner system, allows the user to specify a number n of keyphrases s/he wants back and uses the sorted list to return the top n keyphrases requested by the user.",
        "The default number of n is five.",
        "As stated in step one, when generating candidate keyphrases, the longest possible sequence of words that are uninterrupted by possible phrase terminators, are sought and stored and so are sub-phrases contained within that sequence provided that they appear somewhere in the text on their own.",
        "For example, if the phrase 'excess body weight' is encountered five times in a document, the phrase itself will be stored along with a count of five.",
        "If the sub-phrase , 'body weight', is also encountered on its own, than it will also be stored along with the number of times it appeared in the text including the number of times it appeared as part of the phrase 'excess body weight'.",
        "This means that an overlap between the count of two or more phrases can exist.",
        "Aiming to eliminate this overlap in counting early on can contribute to the dominance of possibly noisy phrases or to overlooking potential keyphrases that are encountered as sub-phrases.",
        "However, once the weight calculation step has been performed and a clear picture of which phrases are most likely to be key ones is obtained, this overlap can be addressed through refinement.",
        "To refine results in the KP-Miner system, the top n keys are scanned to see if any of them is a sub-phrase of another.",
        "If any of them are, then its count is decremented by the frequency of the term of which it is a part.",
        "After this step is completed, weights are recalculated and a final list of phrases sorted by weight, is produced.",
        "The reason the top n keys rather than all candidates, are used in this step is so that lower weighted keywords do not affect the outcome of the final keyphrase list.",
        "It is important to note that the refinement step is an optional one, but experiments have shown that in the English version of the system, omitting this step leads to the production of keyphrase lists that match better with author assigned keyword.",
        "In (El-Beltagy, 2009) the authors suggested that employing this step leads to the extraction of higher quality keyphrases.",
        "Experimentation carried out on the Gold standard dataset provided by the organizers of the SemEval-2 competition on \"Keyphrase Extraction from Scientific Documents\" and described in the next section, seems to suggest that this idea is a valid one."

        "In this competition, participants were provided with 40 trial documents, 144 training documents, and 100 test documents.",
