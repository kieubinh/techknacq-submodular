        "Thus we conclude that the SR features with the encoded external knowledge helped the maxent model to learn a hypothesis that clearly generalized better.",
        "Second, we notice that the combined SR measure proved to be more useful than the standard ESA measure (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) improving the performance by approximately 1 percent over ESA, both in terms of macro averaged F-measure and overall accuracy.",

        "Since this class is an umbrella class for unrelated nominals and the numerous semantic relations not considered in the challenge, it proved to be extremely difficult to accurately characterize this class.",
        "On the other hand, the confusion of the 9 specified relations (between each other) and directionality were less prominent error types.",

        "A second run (WP) complemented this baseline configuration with a set of features that used Explicit Semantic Analysis (Wikipedia) to model the SR of the nominals to be classified and a set of clue words characteristic of the relations used in the challenge.",
        "Our third run (cSR) used a combined semantic relatedness measure that exploits multiple lexical semantic resources (Wikipedia, Wiktionary and WordNet) to provide more reliable relatedness estimates.",
        "Our final run (cSR-t) exploited that our system in general was inaccurate in predicting instances of the other class.",
        "Thus, it used the same predictions as cSR, but favored the prediction of one of the 9 specified classes instead of other, when a comparably high posterior for such a class was predicted by the system.",
        "Our approach is fairly simple, in the sense that it used mostly just local information collected from the sentence.",
        "It is clear though that encoding as much general world knowledge to the representation as possible is crucial for efficient classification of semantic relations.",
        "In the light of the above fact, the results we obtained are reasonable.",
        "As the main goal of our study, we attempted to use semantic relatedness features that exploit texts in an external knowledge source (Wikipedia, Wiktionary or WordNet in our case) to incorporate some world knowledge in the form of term cooccurrence scores.",
        "We found that our SR features significantly contribute to system performance.",
        "Thus, we think this kind of information is useful in general for relation classification.",
        "The experimental results showed that our combined SR measure performed better than the standard ESA using Wikipedia.",
        "This confirms our hypothesis that exploiting multiple resources for modeling term relatedness is beneficial in general.",
        "Obviously, our system leaves much space for improvement - the feature selection parameters and the clue word set for the SR features were chosen manually, without any cross-validation (on the training set), due to lack of time.",
        "One of the participating teams used an SVM-based system and gained a lot from manipulating the decision thresholds.",
        "Thus, despite our preliminary results, it is also an interesting option to use SVMs.",
        "In general, we think that more features are needed to achieve significantly better performance than we reported here.",
        "Top performing systems in the challenge typically exploited web frequency information (n-gram data) and manually encoded relations from an ontology (mainly WordNet).",
        "Thus, future work is to incorporate such features.",
        "We demonstrated that SR features are helpful to move away from lexicalized systems using token-or lemma-based features.",
        "Probably the same holds for web-based and ontology-based features extensively used by top performing systems.",
        "This suggests that experimenting with all these to see if their value is complementary is an especially interesting piece of future work."
