        "The SemEval-2010 Task 8 \"Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Relations Between Pairs of Nominals\" consists in identifying which semantic relation holds between two nominals in a sentence (Hendrickx et al., 2010).",
        "The set of relations is composed of nine mutually exclusive semantic relations and the Other relation.",
        "Specifically, the task requires to return the most informative relation between the specified pair of nominals ei and e2 taking into account their order.",
        "Annotation guidelines show that semantic knowledge about ei and e2 plays a very important role in distinguishing among different relations.",
        "For example, relations Cause-Effect and Product-Producer are closely related.",
        "One of the restrictions which might help to distinguish between them is that products must be concrete physical entities, while effects must not.",
        "Recently, there has emerged a large number of freely available large-scale knowledge bases.",
        "The ground idea of our research is to use them as source of semantic information.",

        "On the one hand, DBpedia and YAGO have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia.",
        "They have a good coverage of named entities, but their coverage of common nouns is poorer.",
        "They seem to be more suitable for relation extraction between named entities.",
        "On the other hand, Cyc is a manually designed knowledge base, which describes actions and entities both in common life and in specific domains (Fenat, 1995).",
        "Cyc has a good coverage of common nouns, making it interesting for our task.",
        "The full version of Cyc is freely available to the research community as ResearchCyc.",
        "We approached the task using the system introduced by Giuliano et al.",
        "(2007) as a basis.",
        "They exploited two information sources: the whole sentence where the relation appears, and WordNet synonymy and hyperonymy information.",
        "In this paper, we (i) investigate usage of Cyc as a source of semantic knowledge and (ii) linguistic information, which give useful clues to semantic relation extraction.",
        "From Cyc, we obtain information about super-classes (in the Cyc terminology generalizations) of the classes which correspond to nominals in a sentence.",
        "The sentence itself provides linguistic information, such as local contexts of entities, bag of verbs and distance between nominals in the context.",

        "They were combined by exploiting the closure properties of kernels.",
        "We define the composite kernel Kc(x\\,X2) as follows.",
        "Each basic kernel K% is normalized.",

        "The resulting feature space has high dimensionality.",

        "Local context is represented by terms, lemmata, PoS tags, and orthographic features extracted from a window around the nominals considering the token order.",
        "Formally, given a relation example R, we represent a local context LC = t-w,t-\\,to, t+w as a row vector where tfa is a feature function which returns 1 if the feature is active in the specified position of LC; 0 otherwise.",
        "The local context kernel Klc (Ri, R2) is defined as where -fCccLei and K^c_e2 are defined by substituting the embedding of the local contexts of e\\ and e2 into Equation 2, respectively.",
        "The verb kernel operates on the verbs present in the sentence, representing it as a bag-of-verbs.",
        "More formally, given a relation example R, we represent the verbs from it as a row vector where the binary function vf(vi, R) shows if a particular verb is used in R. By substituting ipv(R) into Equation 2 we obtain the bag-of-verbs kernel Ky.",
        "Given a relation example R(ei,e2), we represent the distance between the nominals as a one-dimensional vector where dist(ei,e2) is number of tokens between the nominals e\\ and e2 in a sentence.",

        "The open-source version of Cyc named Open-Cyc, which contains the full Cyc ontology and restricted number of assertions, is freely available on the web.",
        "Also the full power of Cyc has been made available to the research community via Re-searchCyc.",
