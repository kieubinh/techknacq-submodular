        "The UvT-WSDl system described in this paper took part in two similar SemEval-2 tasks: Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation (Lefever and Hoste, 2010) and Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2010).",
        "In each task, a number of words is selected for which the senses are to be determined for a number of instances of these words.",
        "For each word, a number of samples in context is provided, where each sample consists of one sentence, with the word to be disambiguated marked.",
        "Because of the cross-lingual nature of the tasks, a word sense corresponds to a translation in another language, rather than a sense description in the same language.",
        "In the Cross-lingual Lexical Substitution task, the target language is Spanish.",
        "The task is to find Spanish substitutes for the English words marked in the test samples.",
        "In the",
        "Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task, we participate for English-Dutch and English-Spanish.",
        "The Word Sense Disambiguation task provides training data for all five languages, in the form of the sentence-aligned EuroParl parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005).",
        "This is the source of training data the UvT-WSDl system uses for both tasks.",
        "The system may output several senses per instance, rather than producing just one sense prediction.",
        "These are evaluated in two different ways.",
        "The scoring type \"best\" expects that the system outputs the best senses, in the order of its confidence.",
        "The scoring type \"out of five/ten\" expects five or ten guesses, and each answer weighs the same.",
        "These metrics are more extensively described in (Mihalcea et al., 2010).",
        "The UvT-WSDl system participates in both scoring types, for both tasks.",
        "The system put forth in this paper follows a similar approach as described in earlier research by (Hoste et al., 2002)."

      "heading": "2. System Description",
      "text": [
        "The UvT-WSDl system uses machine learning techniques to learn what senses/translations are associated with any of the target words.",
        "It does so on the basis of a variety of local and global context features, discussed in Section 2.2.",
        "At the core of the system are the classifiers, or so called \"word experts\", one per target word.",
        "These are built using the Tilburg Memory Based Learner (TiMBL) (Daelemans et al., 2009), making use of the IB 1 algorithm, an implementation of the k-nearest neighbour classifier.",
        "The core of the system can be subdivided into roughly three stages.",
        "In the first stage, the word-aligned parallel corpus is read and for each found instance of one of the target words, features are extracted to be used in the classifier.",
        "The class consists of the word aligned to the found instance of the target word, i.e. the translation/sense.",
        "In this way a word expert is built for each of the target words in the task, yielding a total amount of classifiers equal to the total amount of target words.",
        "The test data is processed in a similar way, for each marked occurrence of any of the target words, features are extracted and test instances are created.",
        "Subsequently, the word experts are trained and tested, and on the basis of the training data, a parameter search algorithm (Van den Bosch, 2004) determines the optimal set of classifier parameters for each word expert, including for example the value of k and the distance weighting metric used.",
        "In the last phase, the classifier output of each word expert is parsed.",
        "The classifiers yield a distribution of classes per test instance, and these are converted to the appropriate formats for \"best\" and \"out of five/ten\" evaluation.",
        "For the latter scoring type, the five/ten highest scoring senses are selected, for the former scoring type, all classes scoring above a certain threshold are considered \"best\".",
        "The threshold is set at 90% of the score of the highest scoring class.",
        "2.1 Word-Alignment, Tokenisation, Lemmatisation and Part-of-Speech-tagging",
        "The Europarl parallel corpus, English-Spanish and English-Dutch, is delivered as a sentence-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "We subsequently run GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) to compute a word-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "This, however, is not the sole input.",
        "The target words in both tasks are actually specified as a lemma and part-of-speech tag pair, rather than words.",
        "In the Word Sense Disambiguation task, all target lemmas are simply nouns, but in the Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution task, they can also be verbs, adjectives or adverbs.",
        "Likewise, both tasks expect the sense/translation output to also be in the form of lemmas.",
        "Therefore the system internally has to be aware of the lemma and part-of-speech tag of each word in the parallel corpus and test data, only then can it successfully find all occurrences of the target words.",
        "In order to get this information, both sides of the word-aligned parallel corpus are run through tokenisers, lemmatisers and Part-of-Speech taggers, and the tokenised output is realigned with the untokenised input so the word alignments are retained.",
        "The test data is also processed this way.",
        "For English and Spanish, the software suite Freeling (Atserias et al., 2006) performed all these tasks, and for Dutch it was done",
        "The system can extract a variety of features to be used in training and testing.",
        "A distinction can be made between local context features and global context features.",
        "Local context features are extracted from the immediate neighbours of the occurrence of the target word.",
        "One or more of the following local context features are extractable by the UvT-WSDl system: word features, lemma features, and part-of-speech tag features.",
        "In each case, n features both to the right and left of the focus word are selected.",
        "Moreover, the system also supports the extraction of bigram features, but these did not perform well in the experiments.",
        "The global context features are made up of a bag-of-words representation of keywords that may be indicative for a given word to sense/translation mapping.",
        "The idea is that words are collected which have a certain power of discrimination for the specific target word with a specific sense, and all such words are then put in a bag-of-word representation, yielding as many features as the amount of keywords found.",
        "A global count over the full corpus is needed to find these keywords.",
        "Each keyword acts as a binary feature, indicating whether or not that particular keyword is found in the context of the occurrence of the target word.",
        "The context in which these keywords are searched for is exactly one sentence, i.e. the sentence in which the target word occurs.",
        "This is due to the test data simply not supplying a wider context.",
        "The method used to extract these keywords (k) is proposed by (Ng and Lee, 1996) and used also in the research of (Hoste et al., 2002).",
        "Assume we have a focus word /, more precisely, a lemma and part-of-speech tag pair of one of the target words.",
        "We also have one of its aligned translations/senses s, which in this implementation is also a lemma.",
        "We can now estimate P(s\\k), the probability of sense s, given a keyword k, by dividing Ns>klocal.",
        "(the number of occurrences of a possible local context word k with particular focus word lemma-PoS combination and with a particular sense s) by Nkloral (the number of occurrences of a possible local context keyword k\\oc with a particular focus word-PoS combination regardless of its sense).",
        "If we also take into account the frequency of a possible keyword k in the complete training corpus (Nif ), we get:",
        "(Hoste et al., 2002) select a keyword k for inclusion in the bag-of-words representation if that keyword occurs more than T\\ times in that sense s, and if P(s\\k) > T2.",
        "Both Ti and T2 are predefined thresholds, which by default were set to 3 and 0.001 respectively.",
        "In addition, UvT-WSDl contains an extra parameter which can be enabled to automatically adjust the T\\ threshold when it yields too many or too few keywords.",
        "The selection of bag-of-word features is computed prior to the extraction of the training instances, as this information is a prerequisite for the successful generation of both training and test instances.",
        "The local and global context features, and the various parameters that can be configured for extraction, yield a lot of possible classifier combinations.",
        "Rather than merging all local context and global context features together in a single classifier, they can also be split over several classifiers and have an arbiter voting system do the final classification step.",
        "UvT-WSDl also supports this approach.",
        "A voter is constructed by taking as features the class output of up to three different classifiers, trained and tested on the training data, and mapping these features onto the actual correct sense in the training data.",
        "For testing, the same approach is taken: up to three classifiers run on the test data; their output is taken as feature vector, and the voting system predicts a sense.",
        "This approach may be useful in boosting results and smoothing out errors.",
        "In our experiments we see that a voter combination often performs better than taking all features together in one single classifier.",
        "Finally, also in the voter system there is a stage of automatic parameter optimisation for TiMBL."

        "Selecting different feature extraction configurations per word expert would be a logical next step to attempt to boost results even further, as been done in (Decadt et al., 2004).",
