        "The goal of the Cross-Lingual Lexical Substitution (CLLS) task is to substitute a word in a language Ls, which occurs in a particular context, by providing the best substitutions in a different language Lt.",
        "In SemEval-2010 the source language Ls is English, while the target language Lt is Spanish.",
        "Clearly, this task is related to Lexical Giovanni Semeraro",
        "Substitution (LS) (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) which consists in selecting an alternative word for a given one in a particular context by preserving its meaning.",
        "The main difference between the LS task and the CLLS one is that in LS source and target languages are the same.",
        "CLLS is not a easy task since neither a list of candidate words nor a specific parallel corpus are supplied by the organizers.",
        "However, this opens the possibility of using several knowledge sources, instead of a single one fixed by the task organizers.",
        "Therefore, the system must identify a set of candidate words in Lt and then select only those words which fit the context.",
        "From another point of view, the cross-lingual nature of the task allows to exploit automatic machine translation methods, hence the goal is to find as many good translations as possible for the given target word.",
        "A thorough description of the task can be found in (Mihalcea et al., 2010; Sinhaetal.,2009).",
        "To easily understand the task, an example follows.",
        "Consider the sentence:",
        "During the siege, George Robertson had appointed Shuja-ul-Mulk, who was a bright boy only 12 years old and the youngest surviving son of Aman-ul-Mulk, as the ruler of Chitral.",
        "In the previous sentence the target word is \"bright\".",
        "Taking into account the meaning of the word \"bright\" in this particular context, the best substitutions in Spanish are: \"inteligente\", \"brillante\" and \"listo\".",
        "We propose two systems to tackle the problem of CLLS: the first is based on an automatic translation system which exploits the API of Google Translator, the second is based on a parallel corpus approach which relies on Wikipedia.",
        "In particular, in the second approach we use a structured version of Wikipedia called DBpedia (Bizer et al., 2009).",
        "Both systems adopt several lexical resources to select the list of possible substitutions for a given word.",
        "Specifically, we use three different dictionaries: Google Dictionary, Babylon Dictionary and Spanishdict.",
        "Then, we combine the dictionaries into a single one, as described in Section 2.1.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the strategy we adopted to tackle the CLLS task, while results of an experimental session we carried out in order to evaluate the proposed approaches are presented in Section 3.",
        "Conclusions are discussed in Section 4."

      "heading": "2. Methodology",
      "text": [
        "Generally speaking, the problem of CLLS can be coped with a strategy which consists of two steps, as suggested in (Sinha et al., 2009):",
        "• candidate collection: in this step several resources are queried to retrieve a list of potential translation candidates for each target word and part of speech;",
        "• candidate selection: this step concerns the ranking of potential candidates, which are the most suitable ones for each instance, by using information about the context.",
        "Regarding the candidate collection, we exploit three dictionaries: Google Dictionary, Babylon Dictionary and Spanishdict.",
        "Each dictionary is modeled using a strategy described in Section 2.1.",
        "We use the same approach to model each dictionary in order to make easy both the inclusion of future dictionaries and the integration with the candidate selection step.",
        "Candidate selection is performed in two different ways.",
        "The first one relies on the automatic translation of the sentence in which the target word occurs, in order to find the best substitutions.",
        "The second method uses a parallel corpus built on DBpedia to discover the number of documents in which the target word is translated by one of the potential translation candidates.",
        "Details about both methods are reported in Section 2.2",
        "This section describes the method adopted to retrieve the list of potential translation candidates for each target word and part of speech.",
        "Our strategy combines several bilingual dictionaries and builds a single list of candidates for each target word.",
        "The involved dictionaries meet the following requirements:",
        "1. the source language Ls must be English and the target one Lt must be Spanish;",
        "2. each dictionary must provide information about the part of speech; 3. the dictionary must be freely available.",
        "Moreover, each candidate has a score Sij computed by taking into account its rank in the list of possible translations supplied by the i – th dictionary.",
        "Formally, let us denote by D = {d\\, d2, ■ ■ ■, dn} the set of n dictionaries and by Li = {ci, C2,..., cmi} the list of potential candidates provided by di.",
        "The score is computed by the following equation:",
        "Since each list Li has a different size, we adopt a score normalization strategy based on Z-score to merge the lists in a unique one.",
        "Z-score normalizes the scores according to the average ß and standard deviation a.",
        "Given the list of scores L = {s\\, S2, ■ ■ ■, sn}, ß and a are computed on L and the normalized score is defined as:",
        "Then, all the lists Li are merged in a single list M. The list M contains all the potential candidates belonging to all the dictionaries with the related score.",
        "If a candidate occurs in more than one dictionary, only the occurrence with the maximum score is chosen.",
        "At the end of the candidate collection step the list M of potential translation candidates for each target word is computed.",
        "It is important to point out that the list M is sorted and supplies an initial rank, which can be then modified by the candidate selection step.",
        "While the candidate collection step is common to the two proposed systems, the problem of candidate selection is faced by using different strategies in the two systems.",
        "The first system, called unibaTranslate, uses a method based on google-api-translate-java.",
        "The main idea behind unibaTranslate is to look for a potential candidate in the translation of the target sentence.",
        "Sometimes, no potential candidates occur into the translation.",
        "When this happens the system uses some heuristics to discover a possible translation.",
        "For example, given the target word \"raw\" and the potential candidates M ={puro, crudo, sin re-finar, de baja calidad, agrietado, al natural, bozal, asado,frito andbruto}, the two possible scenarios are:"

        "To implement this step, the two bigrams which contain the target word and the only trigram in which the target word is the 2ndterm are taken into to account.",
        "Coming back to the first sentence in the previous example, the following n-grams are built: \"the raw\", \"raw honesty\" and \"the raw honesty\".",
        "For each n-gram, candidate translations are looked for using Google Dictionary.",

        "If no exact/partial match is found in the previous steps, probably the target word is translated with a word which does not belong to M. To overcome this problem, we implement a strategy able to discover a possible translation in Ses which is not in M. This approach involves three steps:",
        "(a) for each word Wi in Sen, a list of potential translations Pi is retrieved;",
        "(b) if a word in Pi is found in Ses, the word is removed from Ses ;",
        "(c) at this point, Ses contains a list R of words with no candidate translations.",

        "The output of this process is the ranked list of potential candidates.",

        "In CLLS task, we use the extended abstracts of English and Spanish provided by DBpedia.",
        "For each extended abstract in Spanish which has the corresponding extended abstract in English, we build a document composed by two fields: the former contains the English text (texten) and the latter contains the Spanish text (textes)- We adopt Lucene as storage and retrieval engine to make the documents access fast and easy.",
        "The idea behind unibaWiki is to count, for each potential candidate, the number of documents in which the target word occurs in textenand the potential candidate occurs in textes- A score equal to the number of retrieved documents is assigned, then the candidates are sorted according to that score.",
        "Given the list M of potential candidates and the target word t, for each e M we perform the following query:",
        "texten '■ t AND textes '■ Ck where the field name is followed by a colon and by the term you are looking for.",
        "It is important to underline here that multiword expressions require a specific kind of query.",
        "For each multiword expression we adopt the Phrase-Query which is able to retrieve documents that contain a specific sequence of words instead of a single keyword.",
