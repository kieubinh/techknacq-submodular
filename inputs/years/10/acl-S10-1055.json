        "Key terms (or keyphrases or keywords) are metadata providing general information about the content of a document.",
        "Their selection by authors or readers is, to a large extent, subjective which makes automatic extraction difficult.",
        "This is, however, a valuable exercise, because such key terms constitute good topic descriptions of documents which can be used in particular for information retrieval, automatic document clustering and classification.",
        "Used as subject headings, better keywords can lead to higher retrieval rates of an article in a digital library.",
        "We view automatic key term extraction as a subtask of the general problem of extraction of technical terms which is crucial in technical and scientific documents (Ahmad and Collingham, 1996).",
        "Among the extracted terms for a given scientific document in a given collection, which key terms best characterize this document?",
        "This article describes the system realized for the Semeval 2010 task 5, based on GROBID's (GeneRation Of Bibliographie Data) module dedicated to key term extraction.",
        "GROBID is a tool for analyzing technical and scientific documents, focusing on automatic bibliographical data extraction (header, citations, etc.)",
        "(Lopez, 2009) and structure recognition (section titles, figures, etc).",
        "As the space for the system description is very limited, this presentation focuses on key aspects.",
        "We present first an overview of our approach, then our selection of features (section 3), the different tested machine learning models (section 4) and the final post-ranking (section 5).",
        "We briefly describe our unsuccessful experiments (section 6) and we conclude by discussing future works."

        "One of the goals of GROBID is to realize reliable conversions of technical and scientific documents in PDF to fully compliant TEI documents.",
        "This conversion implies first the recognition of the different sections of the document, then the extraction of all header metadata and references.",
        "The analysis is realized in GROBID with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Peng and McCal-lum, 2004) exploiting a large amount of training data.",
        "We added to this training set a few ACM documents manually annotated and obtained a very high performance for field recognitions, between 97% (section titles, reference titles) and 99% (title, abstract) accuracy for the task's collection.",
        "Authors commonly introduce the main concepts of a written communication in the header (title, abstract, table of contents), the introduction, the section titles, the conclusion and the reference list.",
        "Similarly human readers/annotators typically focus their attention on the same document parts.",
        "We introduced thus the following 6 binary features characterizing the position of a term with respect to the document structure for each candidate: present in the title, in the abstract, in the introduction, in at least one section titles, in the conclusion, in at least one reference or book title.",
        "In addition, we used the following standard feature: the position of the first occurrence, calculated as the number of words which precede the first occurrence of the term divided by the number of words in the document, similarly as, for instance, (Witten et al., 1999).",
        "The second set of features used in this work tries to captures distributional properties of a term relatively to the overall textual content of the document where the term appears or the collection.",
        "Phraseness The phraseness measures the lexical cohesion of a sequence of words in a given document, i.e. the degree to which it can be considered as a phrase.",
        "This measure is classically used for term extraction and can rely on different techniques, usually evaluating the ability of a sequence of words to appear as a stable phrase more often than just by chance.",
        "We applied here the Generalized Dice Coeficient (GDC) as introduced by (Park et al., 2002), applicable to any arbitrary n-gram of words (n > 2).",

        "We used a default value for a single word, because, in this case, the association measure is not meaningful as it depends only on the frequency.",
        "Informativeness The informativeness of a term is the degree to which the term is representative of a document given a collection of documents.",
        "Once again many measures can be relevant, and we opt for the standard TF-IDF value which is used in most of the keyphrase extraction systems, see for instance (Witten et al., 1999) or (Medelyan and",
        "Witten, 2008).",
        "The TF-IDF score for a Term T in document D is given by:",
        "where | D | is the number of words in D, count(T) is the number of occurrence of the term T in the global corpus, and N is the number of documents in the corpus.",
        "Keywordness Introduced by (Witten et al., 1999), the keywordness reflects the degree to which a term is selected as a keyword.",
        "In practice, it is simply the frequency of the keyword in the global corpus.",
        "The efficiency of this feature depends, however, on the amount of training data available and the variety of technical domains considered.",
        "As the training set of documents for this task is relatively large and narrow in term of technical domains, this feature was relevant.",
        "GRISP is a large scale terminological database for technical and scientific domains resulting from the fusion of terminological resources (MeSH, the Gene Ontology, etc.",
        "), linguistic resources (part of WordNet) and part of Wikipedia.",
        "It has been created for improving patent retrieval and classification (Lopez and Romary, 2010).",
        "The assumption is that a phrase which has been identified as controlled term in these resources tend to be a more important keyphrase.",
        "A binary feature is used to indicate if the term is part of GRISP or not.",
        "We use Wikipedia similarly as the Wikipedia keyphraseness in Maui (Medelyan, 2009).",
        "The Wikipedia keyphraseness of a term T is the probability of an appearance of T in a document being an anchor (Medelyan, 2009).",
        "We use Wikipedia Miner for obtaining this value.",
