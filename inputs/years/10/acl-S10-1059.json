        "The theory of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982) holds that meaning is largely structured by holistic units of knowledge, called frames.",
        "Each frame encodes a conventionalized gestalt event or scenario, often with conceptual dependents (participants, props, or attributes) filling roles to elaborate the specific instance of the frame.",
        "In the FrameNet lexicon (Fillmore et al., 2003), each frame defines core roles tightly coupled with the particular meaning of the frame, as well as more generic non-core roles (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006).",
        "Frames can be evoked with linguistic predicates, known as lexical units (LUs); role fillers can be expressed overtly and linked to the frame via (morpho)syntactic constructions.",
        "However, a great deal of conceptually-relevant content is left unexpressed or is not explicitly linked to the frame via linguistic conventions; rather, it is expected that the listener will be able to infer the appropriate relationships pragmatically.",
        "Certain types of implicit content and implicit reference are formalized in the theory of null instantiations (NIs) (Fillmore, 1986; Ruppenhofer, 2005).",
        "A complete frame-semantic analysis of text thus incorporates covert and overt predicate-argument information.",
        "In this paper, we describe a system for frame-semantic analysis, evaluated on a semantic role labeling task for explicit and implicit arguments (§2).",
        "Extending the SEMAFOR 1.0 frame-semantic parser (Das et al., 2010a; outlined in §3), we detect null instantiations via a simple two-stage pipeline: the first stage predicts whether a given role is null-instantiated, and the second stage (§4) predicts how it is null-instantiated, if it is not overt.",
        "We report performance on the SemEval 2010 test set under the full-SRL and Nl-only conditions.",
        "The SemEval 2007 task on frame-semantic parsing (Baker et al., 2007) provided a small (about 50,000 words and 2,000 sentences) dataset of news text, travel guides, and bureaucratic accounts of weapons stockpiles.",
        "Sentences in this dataset were fully annotated with frames and their arguments.",
        "The SemEval 2010 task (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) adds annotated data in the fiction domain: parts of two Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle.",
        "The SemEval 2010 training set consists of the SemEval 2007 data plus one document from the new domain.",
        "This document has about 7800 words in 438 sentences; it has 1492 annotated frame instances, including 3169 (overt and null-instantiated) argument annotations.",
        "The test set consists of two chapters from another story: Chapter 13 contains about 4000 words, 249 sentences, and 791 frames; Chapter 14 contains about 5000 words, 276 sentences, and 941 frames (see also Table 3).",
