        "SemEval-2010 Task 12, Parser Evaluation using Textual Entailment (PETE) (Yuret et al., 2010), was designed as a new, formalism-independent type of parser evaluation scheme.",
        "The task is broadly Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), but unlike typical RTE tasks, its intention is to focus on purely syntactic entailments, assuming no background knowledge or reasoning ability.",
        "For example, given a text (T) The man with the hat was tired., the hypothesis (H) The man was tired.",
        "is entailed, but The hat was tired, is not.",
        "A correct decision on whether H is entailed can be used as a diagnostic for the parser's analysis of (some aspect of) T. By requiring only a binary decision on the entailment, instead of a full syntactic analysis, a parser can be evaluated while its underlying formalism remains a \"black box\".",
        "Our system had two components: a parser, and an entailment system which decided whether T entails H based on the parser's output.",
        "We distinguish two types of evaluation.",
        "Task evaluation, i.e. the official task scoring, indicates whether the entailment decisions - made by the parser and entailment system together - tally with the gold standard dataset.",
        "Entailment system evaluation, on the other hand, indicates whether the entailment system is an appropriate parser evaluation tool.",
        "In the PETE task the parser is not evaluated directly on the dataset, since the entailment system acts as intermediary.",
        "Therefore, for PETE to be a viable parser evaluation scheme, each parser must be coupled with an entailment system which accurately reflects the parser's analysis of the data."

        "We used the c&c parser (Clark and Curran, 2007), which can produce output in the form of grammatical relations (GRs), i.e. labelled head-dependencies.",
        "For example, (nsubj tired man) for the example in Section 1 represents the fact that the NP headed by man is the subject of the predicate headed by tired.",
        "We chose to use the Stanford Dependency GR scheme (de Marneffe et al., 2006), but the same approach should work for other schemes (and other parsers producing GRs).",
        "Our entailment system was very simple, and based on the assumption that H is a simplified version of T (true for this task though not for RTE in general).",
        "We parsed both T and H with the c&c parser.",
        "Let grs(S) be the GRs the parser produces for a sentence S. In principle, if grs(H) Ç grs(T), then we would consider H an entailment.",
        "In practice, a few refinements to this rule are necessary.",
        "We identified three exceptional cases.",
        "First, syntactic transformations between T and H may change GR labels.",
        "The most common transformation in this dataset was passivization, meaning that a direct object in T could be a passive subject in H.",
        "Second, H could contain tokens not present in T. Auxiliary verbs were introduced by passivization.",
        "Pronouns such as somebody and something were introduced into some H sentences to indicate an NP or other phrase not targeted for evaluation.",
        "Determiners were sometimes introduced or changed, e.g. prices to the prices.",
        "Expletive subjects were also sometimes introduced.",
        "Third, the parses of T and H might be inconsistent in an incidental way.",
        "Consider the pair / reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress.",
        "=> The pocket is high up on something.",
        "The intended focus of the evaluation (as indicated by the content word pair supplied as a supplement to the gold standard development data) is (pocket, high).",
        "As long as the parser analyzes pocket as the subject of high, we want to avoid penalizing it for, say, treating the PP up on X differently in T and H.",
        "To address these issues we used a small set of heuristics.",
        "First, we ignored any GR in grs(H) containing a token not in T. This addressed the passive auxiliaries, pronouns, determiners, and expletive subjects.",
        "Second, we equated passive subjects with direct objects.",
        "Similar rules could be defined for other transformations, but we implemented only this one based on the prevalence of passivization in the development data.",
        "Third, when checking whether grs(H) Ç grs(T), we considered only the core relations subject and object.",
        "The intention was that incidental differences between the parses of T and H would not be counted as errors.",
        "We chose these GR types based on the nature of the entailments in the development data, but the system could easily be reconfigured to focus on other relation types.",
        "Finally, we required grs(H) n grs(T) to be non-empty (no vacuous positives), but did not restrict this criterion to subjects and objects.",
        "We used a PTB tokenizer for consistency with the parser's training data.",
        "We used the morpha lemmatizer (Minnen et al., 2000), which is built into the c&c tools, to match tokens across T and H; and we converted all tokens to lowercase.",
        "If the parser failed to find a spanning analysis for either T or H, the entailment decision was NO.",
        "The full pipeline is shown in Figure 1."

        "This GR was not in grs(T), so the correct NO decision was made.",

        "=> He would wake up., the parser produces incorrect analyses for the VP would wake up for both T and H. However, these GRs are ignored since they are non-core (not subject or object), and a YES decision is based on the single GR match (nsubj would he).",
        "This is not entirely a lucky guess, since the entailment system has correctly ignored the odd analyses of would wake up and focused on the role of he as the subject of the sentence.",
        "However, especially since the target content word pair was (he, wake), more positive evidence would be desirable.",
        "Of the 22 correct YES decisions, only two were truly lucky guesses in that the single match was a determiner; others had at least one core match.",
        "Table 3 shows the breakdown of errors.",
        "The largest category was false negatives due to unbounded dependencies not recovered by the parser, for example It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father.",
        "=> Somebody no longer possessed the energy..",
        "Here the parser fails to recover the direct object relation between possess and energy in T. It is known that parsers have difficulty with unbounded dependencies (Rimell et al., 2009, from which the unbounded examples in this dataset were obtained), so this result is not surprising.",
        "The next category was other parser errors.",
        "This is a miscellaneous category including e.g. errors on coordination, parenthetical elements, identifying the head of a clausal subject, and one due to the POS tagger.",
        "For example, for Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on.",
        "=> He would have something to work on., the parser incorrectly coordinated tools and something for T. As a result (dobj have something) was in grs(H) but not grs(T), yielding an incorrect NO.",

        "We achieved a successful result on the PETE task using a state-of-the-art parser and a simple entailment system, which tested syntactic entailments by comparing the GRs produced by the parser for T and H. We also showed that our entailment system had accuracy of approximately 90% as a tool for evaluating the C&C parser (or potentially any parser producing GR-style output) on the PETE development data.",
        "This latter result is perhaps even more important than the task score since it suggests that PETE is worth pursuing as a viable approach to parser evaluation.",
        "The second-highest scoring system, SCHWA (University of Sydney), was also based on the c&c parser and used a similar approach (though using CCG dependency output rather than GRs).",
        "It achieved almost identical task accuracy to the Cambridge system, but interestingly with higher accuracy on YES entailments, while our system was more accurate on NO entailments (Table 1).",
        "We attribute this difference to the decision criteria: both systems required at least one matching relation between T and H for a YES answer; but we additionally answered NO if any core GR in grs(H) was not in grs(T).",
        "This difference shows that a GR-based entailment system can be tuned to favour precision or recall.",
        "Finally, we note that although this was a simple entailment system with some dataset-specific characteristics - such as a focus on subject and object relations rather than, say, PP-attachment these aspects should be amenable to customization or generalization for other related tasks."
