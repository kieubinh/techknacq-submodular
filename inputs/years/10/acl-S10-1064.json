        "This paper describes our system participating in task 18 of SemEval-2010, i.e. disambiguating Sentiment-Ambiguous Adjectives (SAAs).",
        "To disambiguating SAAs, we compare the machine learning-based and lexicon-based methods in our submissions: 1) Maximum entropy is used to train classifiers based on the annotated Chinese data from the NTCIR opinion analysis tasks, and the clause-level and sentence-level classifiers are compared; 2) For the lexicon-based method, we first classify the adjectives into two classes: intensifiers (i.e. adjectives intensifying the intensity of context) and suppressors (i.e. adjectives decreasing the intensity of context), and then use the polarity of context to get the SAAs' contextual polarity based on a sentiment lexicon.",
        "The results show that the performance of maximum entropy is not quite high due to little training data; on the other hand, the lexicon-based method could improve the precision by considering the polarity of context."

        "In recent years, sentiment analysis, which mines opinions from information sources such as news, blogs, and product reviews, has drawn much attention in the NLP field (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "It has many applications such as social media monitoring, market research, and public relations.",
        "Some adjectives are neutral in sentiment polarity out of context, but they could show positive, neutral or negative meaning within specific context.",
        "Such words can be called dynamic sentiment-ambiguous adjectives (SAAs).",
        "However, SAAs have not been intentionally tackled in the researches of sentiment analysis, and usually have been discarded or ignored by most previous work.",
        "Wu et al., (2008) presents an approach of combining collocation information and SVM to disambiguate SAAs, in which the collocation-based method was first used to disambiguate adjectives within the context of collocation (i.e. a sub-sentence marked by comma), and then the SVM algorithm was explored for those instances not covered by the collocation-based method.",
        "According to their experiments, their supervised algorithm achieves encouraging performance.",
        "The task 18 at SemEval-2010 is intended to create a benchmark dataset for disambiguating SAAs.",
        "Given only 100 trial sentences, but not provided with any official training data, participants are required to tackle this problem data by unsupervised approaches or use their own training data.",
        "The task consists of 14 SAAs, which are all high-frequency words in Mandarin Chinese.",
        "They are y^jbig, /hjsmall, #|many, ;P |few, rftjhigh, {Ëjlow, fl^jthick, #|thin, ^jdeep, ^shallow, J!|heavy, gjlight, lÊL^jhuge, J!",
        ";^ |grave.",
        "This task deals with Chinese SAAs, but the disambiguating techniques should be language-independent.",
        "Please refer to (Wu and Jin, 2010) for more descriptions of the task.",
        "In our participating system, the annotated Chinese data from the NTCIR opinion analysis tasks is used as training data with the help of a combined sentiment lexicon.",
        "A machine learning-based method (namely maximum entropy) and the lexicon-based method are compared in our submissions.",
        "The results show that the performance of maximum entropy is not quite high due to little training data; on the other hand, the lexicon-based method could improve the precision by considering the context of SAAs.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly describe data preparation of sentiment lexicon and training data.",
        "Our approaches for disambiguating SAAs are given in Section 3.",

        "Sentimentbearing items marked with the SENTIMENT_KW tag (SKPI), including only positive and negative items but not neutral ones, were also automatically extracted from the Chinese sample these polar item lexicons were combined, and the combined polar item lexicon consists of 13,437 positive items and 18,365 negative items, a total of 31,802 items.",
        "The training data is extracted from the Chinese sample and test data from the NTCIR opinion analysis task, including NTCIR-6 (Seki et al., 2007), NTCIR-7 (Seki et al., 2008) and NTCIR-8 (Seki et al., 2010).",
        "The NTCIR opinion analysis tasks provide an opportunity to evaluate the techniques used by different participants based on a common evaluation framework in Chinese (simplified and traditional), Japanese and English.",
        "For data from NTCIR-6 and NTCIR-7, three annotators manually marked the polarity of each opinionated sentence, and the lenient polarity is used here as the gold standard (please refer to Seki et al., 2008 for explanation of lenient and strict standard).",
        "For each opinionated sentence from NTCIR-8, only two annotators marked and the strict polarity is used as the gold standard.",
        "The traditional Chinese sentences are transferred into simplified Chinese.",
        "In total, there are about 12K opinionated sentences annotated with polarity, out of which about 9K are marked as positive or negative, and others neutral.",
        "All the 9K sentences plus the 100 sentences from the trial data are used as the sentence-level training data.",
        "Meanwhile, we also try to get the clause-level training data since the context of collocation within sub-sentences are quite crucial for disambiguating SAAs according to Wu et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "From the 9K positive/ negative sentences above, we automatically extract the clause for each occurrence of SAAs.",
        "Note the polarity for a whole sentence is not necessarily the same with that of the clause containing SAAs.",

        "ûù tittf 3 MM # , #m MB tâ5 3c&",
        "(In the current large circumstance of the world, China and Russia support each other).",
        "The polarity of the whole sentence is positive, while the clause &ÈHÊîfffiiâj?-j:M-MtP (In the current large circumstance of the world) containing a SAA 3 (large) is neutral, and the polarity lies in the second part of the whole sentence, i.e. fBS (support each other).",
        "Thus, we manually checked the polarity of clauses containing SAAs.",
        "Due to time limitation, we only checked 465 clauses.",
