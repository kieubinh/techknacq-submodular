        "On the one hand it is possible to measure the systems' performance under standardized metrics, sharing datasets and other resources.",
        "On the other hand, it is possible to make comparative evaluations among distinct participants looking forward the same objectives but using different approaches.",
        "Until recently, most of temporally annotated corpora, as well as temporal taggers, were available in English.",
        "Since languages as Spanish start to become prominent in the field it seems interesting the development of specific resources.",

        "The system follows a ruled-based approach whose knowledge base has been inducted from the study of annotated temporal corpora (Vicente-Diez et al., 2008).",
        "A machine learning approach was initially discarded due to the limitation of annotated Spanish corpora.",
        "The aims of this work were to improve the coverage of the original system and test its performance against new available datasets with a view to its integration in future domains of application.",
        "Main challenges were to move to a new temporal model where interval is considered as the basic time unit as well as the isolation of the internal representation of temporal information from the annotation schema.",

        "The UC3M system recognizes and annotates temporal expressions in texts based on a linguistic rules engine for Spanish language.",
        "Our system is divided into three different parts: recognition of temporal expressions, normalization of the detections, and annotation of the temporal expressions according to the TimeML schema.",
        "Following the definition of the Task A, the system is able to determine not only the extent of the temporal expressions but also the value of the features TYPE and VAL.",
        "It differentiates among the four TYPE values (dates, durations, sets and times) thanks to the classification of the recognition rules.",
        "The system straightforwardly provides a VAL attribute that accomplishes the format defined by TIMEX2 and TIMEX3 standards through its internal model for representing time.",
        "The recognizer detects temporal expressions by means of a set of linguistic rules, focusing on those which are most frequent in Spanish.",
        "We adopted an empirical inductive approach through the analysis of the different types of temporal expressions in news corpora, and we could outline a typology of most common time expressions in the language.",
        "The typology together with the patterns that define these expressions form up the knowledge base for a successful automatic identification and resolution of temporal expressions.",
        "The rule engine allows managing different sets of rules independently of the target.",
        "In this case, the rules have been created attending to each pattern that is likely to match a temporal expression.",
        "Each rule determines the set of tokens that form an expression, the normalization type to be applied and the expression type.",
        "In Table 1 an example of a rule to identify dates is shown.",
        "The first line represents the name of the rule.",
        "The second line specifies the normalization method that will be used once the expression is recognized.",
        "The third line specifies the type of the temporal expression and the annotation pattern.",
        "Finally, the fourth line shows the tokens that trigger the rule."

      "text": [
        "The operation of the system is described as follows: first, the text is parsed token by token.",
        "Then, for each token, every rule is checked to find out if it triggers through a given token and the following ones.",
        "This operation implies that the higher the number of rules, the slower the text processing.",
        "The disadvantage of the processing speed has been accepted as a design criterion for the sake of the simplicity of creating new rules.",
        "The temporal expression normalization is done as an intermediate step between recognition and annotation, isolating the extraction of semantics from the annotation schema while trying to facilitate the second step.",
        "Normalization is important since recognized time expressions are managed and returned in a standard format that avoids semantic ambiguities.",
        "UC3M system applies an interval-based temporal normalization.",
        "It means that every temporal expression is represented as an interval with two boundaries: an initial and a final date (including time).",
        "This approach is motivated by the belief that the use of intervals as a basic time unit leads to a lower loss of semantics.",
        "For instance, when an expression like \"en enero\" (\"in January\") is detected, current task proposes the annotation \"2010-01\".",
        "However, we think that for many applications that are likely to use this system it would be more useful to have the complete interval that the expression refers (\"2010-01-01 - 2010-01-31\").",
        "Through a set of procedures (as getting the length of a given month), our system tries to define the interval boundaries as much as possible.",
