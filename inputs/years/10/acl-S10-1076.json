        "Time plays a key role in narrative.",
        "However, correctly recognizing temporal order among events is a challenging task.",
        "As a follow-up to the first TempEval competition, TempEval-2 addresses this challenge.",
        "Among the three proposed tasks of TempEval-2, we address the temporal relations task consisting of four subtasks: predicting temporal relations that hold between events and time expressions in the same sentence (Task C), events and the document creation time (Task D), main events in adjacent sentences (Task E), and main events and syntactically dominated events, such as those in subordinated clauses (Task F).",
        "We are primarily concerned with Task C, E, and F, because D is not relevant to our application domain.",
        "However, rather than eliminating Task D altogether, we build a very simple model for this task by using only those features that are shared with other task models (i.e., the document creation time data are not used because none of the other task models need them as features).",
        "It was expected that this approach would support more interesting comparisons with other systems that take a more sophisticated approach to the task.",
        "Further, we experiment with a joint modeling technique to examine if the communication with other task models brings a boost to a performance of the simple model.",
        "Taking a supervised machine-learning approach with Markov Logic (ML) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), we constructed two systems, NCSU-indi and NCSU-joint.",
        "NCSU-indi consists of four independently trained classifiers, one for each task, whereas NCSU-joint models all four tasks jointly.",
        "The choice of ML as learning technique for temporal relations is motivated both theoretically and practically.",
        "Theoretically, it is a statistical relational learning framework that does not make the i.i.d.",
        "assumption for the data.",
        "This is a desirable characteristic for complex problems such as temporal relation classification, as well as many other natural language problems, in which the features representing a given problem are often correlated with one another.",
        "Practically, ML allows us to build both individual and joint models in a uniform framework; individual models can be easily combined together into a joint model with a set of global formulae governing over them.",
        "In previous work (Yoshikawa et al., 2009), ML was successfully applied to temporal relation classification task.",
        "Our approach is different from this work in two primary respects.",
        "First, we introduce new lexical relation features derived from English lexical ontologies.",
        "Second, our model addresses a new task introduced in Tem-pEval-2, which is to identify temporal relations between main and syntactically dominated events in the same sentence.",
        "We also employ phrase-based syntactic features (Bethard and",
        "Martin 2007) rather than dependency-based syntactic features."

        "We consider three types of features: basic, syntactic, and lexical relation features.",
        "Basic features represent the information directly available from the original data provided by the task organizer; syntactic features are extracted from syntactic parses generated by Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000); and lexical semantic relations that are derived from two external lexical databases, VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Basic features include the word tokens, stems of the words, and the manually annotated attributes of events and time expressions.",
        "In the TempEval-2 data, an event always consists of a single word token, but time expressions often consist of multiple tokens.",
        "We treat each word in time expressions as a different feature.",
        "For example, two word features, 'this ' and 'afternoon ', are extracted from a given time expression 'this afternoon '.",
        "Stemming is done with the Porter Stemmer in NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002).",
        "The value attributes of time expressions are treated as symbolic features, rather than being decomposed into actual integer values representing dates and times.",
        "Our syntactic features draw upon the features previously shown to be effective for temporal relation classification (Bethard and Martin, 2007), including the following:",
        "• pos: the part-of-speech (pos) tags of the event and the time expression word tokens, assigned by Charniak parser.",
        "• gov-prep: any prepositions governing the event or time expression (e.g., 'for' in 'for ten years ').",
        "• gov-verb: the verb governing the event or time expression, similar to gov-prep.",
        "• gov-verb-pos: the pos tag of the governing verb.",
        "We also investigate both full and partial syntactic paths between a pair of event and time expressions, but including these features does not improve the classification results on our development data set.",
        "VERBOCEAN is a graph of semantic relations between verbs.",
        "There are 22,306 relations between 3,477 verbs that have been mined using Google searches for lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "VERBOCEAN contains five different types of relations (Table 1).",
        "Verbs are stored in the lemma-tized forms and senses are not disambiguated.",
        "A connection between two verbs indicates that the relation holds between some senses of the verbs.",
        "VerbOcean's database is presented as a list of verb pair relations, along with a confidence score.",
        "Both the transitive and symmetric closure over the relations were taken before storage in a SQLite database for queries.",
        "The transitive closure was calculated using the Warshall algorithm (Agrawal and Jagadish, 1990).",
        "The confidence score for the new arc was calculated as the average of the two constituents.",
        "The symmetric closure was calculated using a simple pass.",
        "The confidence score is the same as the reflected edge for symmetric relations.",
        "A set of VerbOcean features were calculated for each target event pair within each of the temporal relations tasks.",
        "Each verb was lemmatized using the WordNet lemmatizer in NLTK before being compared against the database.",
        "Rather than focusing only on HAPPENS-BEFORE relation as in Mani et al.",
        "(2006), we consider all five verb relations in two different versions, unweighted and weighted.",
        "The unweighted version is a binary feature indicating the existence of an arc between the two target verbs in VerbOcean.",
        "In the weighted version, the existence of an arc is weighted by the associated confidence score.",
        "In addition to VerbOcean, WordNet was used for its conceptual relations.",

        "Interestingly, none of the time expression features were effective on the development data.",
