        "The Duluth systems in the sense induction task of SemEval-2 (Manandhar et al., 2010) were based on SenseClusters (v1.01), a freely available open source software package which relies on the premise that words with similar meanings will occur in similar contexts (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004).",
        "The data for the sense induction task included 100 ambiguous words made up of50 nouns and 50 verbs.",
        "There were a total of 8,915 test instances and 879,807 training instances provided.",
        "Note that neither the training nor the test data was sense tagged.",
        "The training data was made available as a resource for participants, with the understanding that system evaluation would be done on the test instances only.",
        "The organizers held back a gold standard annotation of the test data that was only used for evaluation.",
        "Five Duluth-WSI systems participated in this task, six Duluth-Mix systems, and five Duluth Random systems.",
        "The WSI and Mix systems almost always represented the test instances using second order co-occurrences, where each word in a test instance is replaced by a vector that shows the words with which it co-occurs.",
        "The word vectors that make up a test instance are averaged together to make up a new representation for that instance.",
        "All the test instances for a word are clustered, and the number of senses is automatically predicted by either the PK2 measure or Adapted Gap Statistic (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2006).",
        "In the Duluth systems the co-occurrence matrices are either based on order-dependent bigrams or unordered pairs of words, both of which can be separated by up to some given number of intervening words.",
        "Bigrams are used to preserve distinctions between collocations such as cat house and house cat, whereas co-occurrences do not consider order and would treat these two as being equivalent."

        "Any bigram (bi) or co-occurrence (co) that occurs more than 5 times with up to the allowed number of intervening words and has statistical significance of 0.95 or above according to the left-sided Fisher's exact test was selected (Pedersen et al., 1996).",
        "Some of the WSI systems reduce the co-occurrence matrix to 300 dimensions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",

        "The evaluation of unsupervised sense discrimination and induction systems is still not standardized, so an important part of any exercise like SemEval-2 is to scrutinize the evaluation measures used in order to determine to what degree they are providing a useful and reasonable way of evaluating system results.",
        "Each participating system was scored by three different evaluation methods: the V-measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007), the supervised recall measure (Agirre and Soroa, 2007), and the paired F-score (Artiles et al., 2009).",
        "The results of the evaluation are in some sense confusing - a system that ranks near the top according to one measure may rank at the bottom or middle of another.",
        "There was not any single system that did well according to all of the different measures.",
        "The situation is so extreme that in some cases a system would perform near the top in one measure, and then below random baselines in another.",
        "These stark differences suggest a real need for continued development of other methods for evaluating unsupervised sense induction.",
        "One minimum expectation of an evaluation measure is that it should expose and identify random baselines by giving them low scores that clearly distinguish them from actual participating systems.",
        "The scores of all the evaluation measures used in this task when applied to different random baseline systems are summarized in Table 2.",
        "These include a number of post-evaluation random clustering systems, which are referred to as post-R1k, where k is the number of random clusters.",
        "The V-measure appears to be quite easily mislead by random baselines.",
        "As evidence of that, the Duluth-R (random) systems got increasingly better scores the more random they became, and in fact the post-evaluation random systems reached levels of performance better than any of the participating systems.",
        "Table 2 shows that the V-measure continues to improve (rather dramatically) as randomness increases.",
        "The average number of senses in the gold standard data for all 100 words was 3.79.",
        "The official random baseline assigned one of four random senses to each instance of a word, and achieved a V-measure of 4.40.",
        "Duluth-R15 improved the V-measure to 5.30 by assigning one of five random senses, and Duluth-R110 improved it again to 8.60 by assigning one of ten random senses.",
        "The more random the result, the better the score.",
        "In fact Duluth-R110 placed sixth in the sense induction task according to the V-measure.",
        "In postevaluation experiments a number of additional random baselines were explored, where instances were assigned senses randomly from 20, 33, and 50 possible values per word.",
        "The V-measures for these random systems were 13.9, 18.7, and 23.2 respectively, where the latter two were better than the first place participating system (which scored 16.2).",
        "In a post-evaluation experiment, the task organizers found that assigning one sense per instance resulted in a V-measure of 31.7.",

        "The supervised recall measure takes the sense induction results (on the 8,915 test instances) as submitted by a participating system and splits that into a training and test portion for supervised learning.",
        "The recall attained on the test split by a classifier learned on the training split becomes the measure of the unsupervised system.",
        "Two different splits were used, with 80% or 60% of the test instances for training, and the remainder for testing.",
        "This evaluation method was also used in SemEval-1, where (Pedersen, 2007) noted that it seemed to compress the results of all the systems into a narrow band that converged around the Most Frequent Sense result.",
        "The same appears to have happened in 2010.",
        "The supervised recall of the Most Frequent Sense baseline (MFS) is 58 or .59 (depending on the split), and the majority of participating systems (and even some of the random baselines) fall in a range of scores from .56 to .62 (a band of .06).",
        "This blurs distinctions among participating systems with each other and with random baselines.",
        "The number of senses actually assigned by the classifier learned from the training split to the instances in the test split is quite small, regardless of the number of senses discovered by the participating system.",
        "There were at most 2.06 senses identified per word based on the 80-20 split, and at most 2.27 senses per word based on the 60-40 split.",
        "For most systems, regardless of their underlying methodology, the number of senses the classifier actually assigns is approximately 1.5 per word.",
        "This shows that the supervised learning algorithm that underlies this evaluation method gravitates towards a very small number of senses and therefore tends to converge on the MFS baseline.",
        "This could be caused by noise in the induced senses, a small number of examples in the training split for a sense, or it may be that the supervised recall measure is making different distinctions than are found by the unsupervised sense induction method it seeks to evaluate.",
        "The paired F-score was the only evaluation measure that seemed able to identify and expose random baselines.",
        "Duluth-R110 was by far the most random of the officially participating systems, and it was by far the lowest ranked system according to the paired F-score, which assigned it a score of 16.1.",
        "All the Duluth-R systems ranked relatively low (20th or below).",
        "When presented with the 20, 33, and 50 random sense post-evaluation systems, the F-score assigned those scores of 7.46, 4.00, and 2.33, which placed them far below any ofthe other systems.",
        "However, the paired F-score also showed that the Most Frequent Sense baseline outperformed all of the participating systems.",
        "The systems that scored close to the MFS tended to predict very small numbers of senses, and so were in effect acting much like the MFS baseline themselves.",
        "The F-score is not bounded by MFS and in fact it is possible (theoretically) to reach a score of 1.00 with a perfect assignment of instances to senses.",
        "The lesson learned in this task is that it would have been more effective to simply assume that there was just one sense per word, rather than using the senses induced by participating systems.",
        "While this may be a frustrating conclusion, in fact it is a reasonable observation given that in many domains a single sense for a given word can tend to dominate.",
