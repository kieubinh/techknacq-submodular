        "The meaning of a word can be defined by the words that accompany it in the text.",
        "This is the principle often used in previous studies on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Ide and Véronis, 1998; Navigli, 2009).",
        "In general, the accompanying words form a context vector of the target word, or a probability distribution of the context words.",
        "For example, under the unigram bag-of-word assumption, this means building p(x\\t) = count(xt) where count(xA) is the count of co-occurrences of word x with the target word t under a certain criterion.",
        "In most studies, x and t should co-occur within a window of up to k words or sentences.",
        "The bounds are usually selected as to maximize system performance.",
        "Occurrences inside the window usually weight the same without regard to their position.",
        "This is counterintuitive.",
        "Indeed, a word closer to the target word usually has a greater semantic constraint on the target word than a more distant word.",
        "Some studies have also proposed decaying factors to decrease the importance of more distant words in the context vector.",
        "However, the decaying functions are defined manually.",
        "It is unclear that the functions defined can capture the true impact of the context words on the target word.",
        "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to automatically learn the optimal weight of a word according to its distance to the target word.",
        "The general idea used to determine such weight is that, if we randomly determine two sets of texts containing the target word, the resulting probability distributions for its context words in the two sets should be similar.",
        "Therefore, the weights of context words at different distance are determined so as to maximize the mutual generation probabilities of two sets of samples.",
        "Experimentation on Semeval-2007 English and Semeval-2010 lapanese lexical sample task data shows that improvements can automatically be attained on simple Naive Bayes (NB) systems in comparison to the best manually selected fixed window system.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: example uses of text windows and related work are presented in Section 2.",
        "Our method is presented in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 and 5, we show experimental results on English and lapanese WSD.",

        "Modeling the distribution of words around one target word has many uses.",
        "For instance, the Xu&Croft co-occurrence-based stemmer (Xu and Croft, 1998) uses window co-occurrence statistics to calculate the best equivalence classes for a group of word forms.",
        "They suggest using windows of up to 100 words.",
        "Another example can be found in WSD systems, where a shorter window is preferred.",
        "In Semeval-2007, top performing systems on WSD tasks, such as NUS-ML (Cai et al., 2007), made use of bag-of-word features around the target word.",
        "In this case, they found that the best results can be achieved using a window size of 3.",
        "Both these systems limit the size of their windows for different purposes.",
        "The former aims to model the topic of the documents containing the word rather than the word's meaning.",
        "The latter limits the size because bag-of-word features further from the target word would not be sufficiently related to its meaning (Ide and Véronis, 1998).",
        "We see that because of sparsity issues, there is a compromise between taking few, highly related words, or taking several, lower quality words.",
        "In most current systems, all words in a window are given equal weight, but we can easily understand that the occurrences of words should generally count less as they become farther; they form a long tail that we should use.",
        "Previous work proposed using non-linear functions of the distance to model the relation between two words.",
        "For instance, improvements can be obtained by using an exponential function (Gao et al., 2002).",
        "Yet, there is no evidence that the exponential - with its manually selected parameter - is the best function."

        "In other words, we want to represent how much an occurrence at distance i models the context better than the collection language model, whose counts are controlled by the Dirichlet pseudo-count.",
        "We hypothesize that target words occurs in limited contexts, and as we get farther from them, the possibilities become greater, resulting in sparse and less related counts.",
        "We propose a simple gradient descent minimizing (4) over a.",
        "For the following experiments, we used one single curve for all words in a task.",
        "We used the mini-batch type of gradient descent: the gradients of a fixed amount of target words are summed, a gradient step is done, and the procès is repeated while cycling the data.",
        "The starting state was with all to one, the batch size of 50 and a learning rate of 1.",
        "We notice that as the algorithm progress, weights on close distances increase and the farthest decrease.",
        "As further distances contribute less and less, middle distances start to decay more and more, until at some point, all distances but the closest start to decrease, heading towards a degenerate solution.",

        "Words were stemmed with the Porter stemmer and text windows were grouped for all words.",
        "For simplicity and efficiency, windows to the right and to the left were considered independent, and we only kept words with between 30 and 1000 windows.",
        "Also, only windows with a size of 100, which was considered big enough without any doubt, were kept.",
