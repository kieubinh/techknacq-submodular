        "As empirically demonstrated by the last SensEval and SemEval exercises, assigning the appropriate meaning to words in context has resisted all attempts to be successfully addressed.",
        "In fact, supervised word-based WSD systems are very dependent of the corpora used for training and testing the system (Escudero et al., 2000).",
        "One possible reason could be the use of inappropriate level of abstraction.",
        "Most supervised systems simply model each polysemous word as a classification problem where each class corresponds to a particular synset of the word.",
        "But, WordNet (WN) has been widely criticized for being a sense repository that often provides too fine-grained sense distinctions for higher level applications like Machine Translation or Question & Answering.",
        "In fact, WSD at this level of granularity has resisted all attempts of inferring robust broad-coverage models.",
        "It seems that many word-sense distinctions are too subtle to be captured by automatic systems with the current small volumes of word-sense annotated examples.",
        "Thus, some research has been focused on deriving different word-sense groupings to overcome the fine-grained distinctions of WN (Hearst and Schütze, 1993), (Peters et al., 1998), (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), (Agirre and LopezDeLa-Calle, 2003), (Navigli, 2006) and (Snow et al., 2007).",
        "That is, they provide methods for grouping senses of the same word, thus producing coarser word sense groupings for better disambiguation.",
        "In contrast, some research have been focused on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al., 1997), (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003), (Villarejo et al., 2005), (Curran, 2005), (Kohomban and Lee, 2005) and (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).",
        "That is, grouping senses of different words into the same explicit and comprehensive semantic class.",
        "Most of the later approaches used the original Lexicographical Files of WN (more recently called Su-perSenses) as very coarse-grained sense distinctions.",
        "We suspect that selecting the appropriate level of abstraction could be on between both levels.",
        "Thus, we use the semantic classes modeled by the Basic Level Concepts (BLC) (Izquierdo et al., 2007).",
        "Our previous research using BLC empirically demonstrated that this automatically derived set of meanings groups senses into an adequate level of abstraction in order to perform class-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Izquierdo et al., 2009).",
        "Now, we also show that class-based WSD allows to successfully incorporate monosemous examples from the domain text.",
        "In fact, the robustness of our class-based WSD approach is shown by our system that just uses the SemCor examples (SC).",
        "It performs without any kind of domain adaptation as the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline.",
        "This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2010 Task 17 (Agirre et al., 2010).",
        "In section 2 semantic classes used and selection algorithm used to obtain them automatically from WordNet are described.",
        "In section 3 the technique employed to extract monosemous examples from background data is described.",
        "Section 4 explains the general approach of our system, and the experiments designed, and finally, in section 5, the results and some analysis are shown."

        "The set of semantic classes used in this work are the Basic Level Concepts (BLC) (Izquierdo et al., 2007).",
        "These concepts are small sets of meanings representing the whole nominal and verbal part of WN.",
        "BLC can be obtained by a very simple method that uses basic structural WordNet properties.",
        "In fact, the algorithm only considers the relative number of relations of each synset along the hypernymy chain.",
        "The process follows a bottom-up approach using the chain of hypernymy relations.",
        "For each synset in WN, the process selects as its BLC the first local maximum according to the relative number of relations.",
        "The local maximum is the synset in the hypernymy chain having more relations than its immediate hyponym and immediate hypernym.",
        "For synsets having multiple hypernyms, the path having the local maximum with higher number of relations is selected.",
        "Usually, this process finishes having a number of preliminary BLC.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of selection of a BLC.",
        "The figure represents the hypernymy hierarchy of WordNet, with circles representing synsets, and links between them representing hypernym relations.",
        "The algorithm selects the D synset as BLC for J, due to D is the first maximum in the hypernymy chain, according to the number of relations (F has 2 hyponyms, D has 3, and A has 2, so D is the first maximum).",
        "Figure 1 : Example of BLC selection",
        "Obviously, while ascending through this chain, more synsets are subsumed by each concept.",
        "The process finishes checking if the number of concepts subsumed by the preliminary list of BLC is higher than a certain threshold.",
        "For those BLC not representing enough concepts according to the threshold, the process selects the next local maximum following the hypernymy hierarchy.",
        "Thus, depending on the type of relations considered to be counted and the threshold established, different sets of BLC can be easily obtained for each WN version.",
        "We have selected the set which considers WN version 3.0, the total number of relations per synset, and a minimum threshold of 20 concepts to filter out not representative BLC (BLC-20).",
        "This set has shown to reach good performance on previous SensEval and SemEval exercices (Izquierdo et al., 2009).",
        "There are 649 different BLC for nouns on WordNet 3.0, and 616 for verbs.",

        "We create a classifier for each semantic class.",
        "This approach has several advantages compared to word-based approach.",
        "The training data per classifier is increased (we can use examples of different target words for a single classifier, whenever all examples belong to the same semantic class), the polysemy is reduced (some different word senses can be collapsed into the same semantic class), and, finally, semantic classes provide higher levels of abstraction.",
        "For each polysemous word occurring in the test corpus, we obtain its potential BLC-20 classes.",
        "Then, we only apply the classifiers corresponding to the BLC-20 classes of the polysemous word.",
        "Finally, our system simply selects the BLC-20 class with the greater prediction.",
        "In order to obtain the correct WordNet 3.0 synset required by the task, we apply a simple heuristic that has shown to be robust and accurate (Kohomban and Lee, 2005).",
        "Our classifiers obtain first the semantic class, and then, the synset of the first WordNet sense that fits with the semantic class is assigned to the word.",
        "We selected a simple feature set widely used in many WSD systems.",
        "In particular, we use a window of five tokens around the target word to extract word forms, lemmas; bigrams and trigrams of word forms and lemmas; trigrams of PoS tags, and also the most frequent BLC-20 semantic class of the target word in the training corpus.",

        "The figures for the first sense (1 sense) and random sense (Random) baselines are included.",
        "In general, the results obtained are not very high.",
        "The best system only achieves a precision of 0.570, and the first sense baseline reaches a precision of 0.505.",
        "This shows that the task is hard to solve, and the domain adaptation of WSD systems is not an easy task.",
        "Interestingly, our worst result is obtained by the system using only the monosemous background examples (BG).",
        "This system ranks 23th with a Precision and Recall of 0.380 (0.385 for nouns and 0.366 for verbs).",
        "The system using only SemCor (SC) ranks 6th with Precision and Recall of 0.505 (0.527 for nouns and 0.443 for verbs).",
        "This is also the performance of the first sense baseline.",
        "As expected, the best result of our three runs is obtained when combining the examples from SemCor and the background (SCBG).",
        "This supervised system obtains the 5th position with a Precision and Recall of 0.513 (0.534 for nouns, 0.454 for verbs) which is slightly above the baseline.",
        "Possibly, the reason of low performance of the BG system is the high correlation between the features of the target word and its semantic class.",
        "In this case, these features correspond to the monosemous word while when testing corresponds to the target word.",
        "However, it also seems that class-based systems are robust enough to incorporate large sets of monosemous examples from the domain text.",
        "In fact, to our knowledge, this is the first time that a supervised WSD algorithm have been successfully adapted to an specific domain.",
        "Furthermore, our system trained only on SemCor also achieves a good performance, reaching the first sense baseline, showing that class-based WSD approaches seem to be robust to domain variations."
