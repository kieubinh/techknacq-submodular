        "Given a test word, disambiguation is performed by considering only those candidate synsets that belong to the top-k largest connected components.",
        "The second approach is a weakly supervised approach which relies on the \"One Sense Per Domain\" heuristic and uses a few hand labeled examples for the most frequently appearing words in the target domain.",
        "Once the most frequent words have been disambiguated they can provide strong clues for disambiguating other words in the sentence using an iterative disambiguation algorithm.",

        "Domain specific WSD exhibits high level of accuracy even for the all-words scenario (Khapra et al., 2010) - provided training and testing are on the same domain.",
        "However, the effort of creating the training corpus - annotated sense marked corpora - for every domain of interest has always been a matter of concern.",
        "Therefore, attempts have been made to develop unsupervised (McCarthy et al., 2007; Koeling et al., 2005) and knowledge based techniques (Agirre et al., 2009) for WSD which do not need sense marked corpora.",
        "However, such approaches have not proved effective, since they typically do not perform better than the Wordnet first sense baseline accuracy in the all-words scenario.",
        "Motivated by the desire to develop annotation-lean all-words domain specific techniques for WSD we propose two resource conscious approaches.",
        "The first approach is a knowledge based approach which focuses on retaining only domain specific synsets in the Wordnet using a two step pruning process.",
        "In the first step, the Wordnet graph is restricted to only those synsets which contain words appearing in an untagged domain-specific corpus.",
        "In the second step, the graph is pruned further by retaining only the largest connected components of the pruned graph.",
        "Each target word in a given sentence is then disambiguated using an iterative disambiguation process by considering only those candidate synsets which appear in the top-k largest connected components.",
        "Our knowledge based approach performed better than current state of the art knowledge based approach (Agirre et al., 2009).",
        "Also, the precision was better than the Wordnet first sense baseline even though the F-score was slightly lower than the baseline.",
        "The second approach is a weakly supervised approach which uses a few hand labeled examples for the most frequent words in the target domain in addition to the publicly available mixed-domain SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) corpus.",
        "The underlying assumption is that words exhibit \"One Sense Per Domain \" phenomenon and hence even as few as 5 training examples per word would be sufficient to identify the predominant sense of the most frequent words in the target domain.",
        "Further, once the most frequent words have been disambiguated using the predominant sense, they can provide strong clues for disambiguating other words in the sentence.",
        "Our weakly supervised system gave the best performance across all systems that participated in the task even when it used as few as 100 hand labeled examples from the target domain.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2 we describe related work on domain-specific WSD.",
        "In section 3 we discuss an Iterative Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm which lies at the heart of both our approaches.",
        "In section 4 we describe our knowledge based approach.",

        "There are two important lines of work for domain specific WSD.",
        "The first focuses on target word specific WSD where the results are reported on a handful of target words (41-191 words) on three lexical sample datasets, viz., DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996), MEDLINE corpus (Weeber et al., 2001) and the corpus of Koeling et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "The second focuses on all-words domain specific WSD where the results are reported on large annotated corpora from two domains, viz., TOURISM and HEALTH (Khapra et al., 2010).",
        "In the target word setting, it has been shown that unsupervised methods (McCarthy et al., 2007) and knowledge based methods (Agirre et al., 2009) can do better than wordnet first sense baseline and in some cases can also outperform supervised approaches.",
        "However, since these systems have been tested only for certain target words, the question of their utility in all words WSD it still open .",
        "In the all words setting, Khapra et al.",
        "(2010) have shown significant improvements over the wordnet first sense baseline using a fully supervised approach.",
        "However, the need for sense annotated corpus in the domain of interest is a matter of concern and provides motivation for adapting their approach to annotation scarce scenarios.",
        "Here, we take inspiration from the target-word specific results reported by Chan and Ng (2007) where by using just 30% of the target data they obtained the same performance as that obtained by using the entire target data.",
        "We take the fully supervised approach of (Khapra et al., 2010) and convert it to a weakly supervised approach by using only a handful of hand labeled examples for the most frequent words appearing in the target domain.",
        "For the remaining words we use the sense distributions learnt from SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) which is a publicly available mixed domain corpus.",
        "Our approach is thus based on the \"annotate-little from the target domain \" paradigm and does better than all the systems that participated in the shared task.",
        "Even our knowledge based approach does better than current state of the art knowledge based approaches (Agirre et al., 2009).",
        "Here, we use an untagged corpus to prune the Wordnet graph thereby reducing the number of candidate synsets for each target word.",
        "To the best of our knowledge such an approach has not been tried earlier."

        "The scoring function can thus be easily adapted depending upon the amount of information available.",

        "Wordnet can be viewed as a graph where synsets act as nodes and the semantic relations between them act as edges.",
        "It should be easy to see that given a domain-specific corpus, synsets from some portions of this graph would be more likely to occur than synsets from other portions.",
        "For example, given a corpus from the HEALTH domain one might expect synsets belonging to the sub-trees of \"doctor\", \"medicine\", \"disease\" to appear more frequently than the synsets belonging to the sub-tree of \"politics\".",
        "Such dominance exhibited by different components can be harnessed for domain-specific WSD and is the motivation for our work.",
        "The crux of the approach is to identify such domain specific components using a two step pruning process as described below:",
        "Step 1: First, we use an untagged corpus from the environment domain to identify the unique words appearing in the domain.",
        "Note that, by unique words we mean all content words which appear at least once in the environment corpus (these words may or may not appear in a general mixed domain corpus).",
        "This untagged corpus containing 15 documents (22K words) was downloaded from the websites of WWF and ECNCand contained articles on Climate Change, Deforestation, Species Extinction, Marine Life and Ecology.",
        "Once the unique words appearing in this environment-specific corpus are identified, we restrict the Wordnet graph to only those synsets which contain one or more of these unique words as members.",
        "This step thus eliminates all spurious synsets which are not related to the environment domain.",
        "Step 2: In the second step, we perform a Breadth-First-Search on the pruned graph to identify the connected components of the graph.",
        "While traversing the graph we consider only those edges which correspond to the hypernymy-hyponymy relation and ignore all other semantic relations as we observed that such relations add noise to the components.",
        "The top-h largest components thus identified were considered to be environment-specific components.",
        "A subset of synsets appearing in one such sample component is listed in Table 1.",
        "Each target word in a given sentence is then disambiguated using the IWSD algorithm described in section 3.",
        "However, now the arg max of Equation (1) is computed only over those candidate synsets which belong to the top-h largest components and all other candidate synsets are ignored.",
        "The suggested pruning technique is indeed very harsh and as a result there are many words for which none of their candidate synsets belong to these top-h largest components.",
        "These are typically domain-invariant words for which pruning does not make sense as the synsets of such generic words do not belong to domain-specific components of the Wordnet graph.",
        "In such cases, we consider all the candidate synsets of these words while computing the arg max of Equation (1)."
