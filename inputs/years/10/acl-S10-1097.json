        "The dataset of the SemEval task (Wu and lin, 2010) consists of short texts in Chinese containing target adjectives whose sentiments need to be disambiguated in the given contexts.",
        "Those adjectives are: y*v big, JN small, many, ^ few, r(i high, low, jf£ thick, W thin, ffî.",
        "deep, shallow, Jt heavy, light, huge, Jty*v grave.",
        "Disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives is a challenging task for NLP.",
        "Previous studies were mostly focused on word sense disambiguation rather than sentiment disambiguation.",
        "Although both problems look similar, the latter is more challenging in our opinion because impregnated with more subjectivity.",
        "In order to solve the task, one has to deal not only with the semantics of the context, but also with the psychological aspects of human perception of emotions from the written text.",
        "In our approach, we use Twitter microblogging platform to retrieve emotional messages and form two sets of texts: messages with positive emotions and those with negative ones (Pak and Paroubek, 2010).",
        "We use emoticons as indicators of an emotion (Read, 2005) to automatically classify texts into positive or negative sets.",
        "The reason we use Twitter is because it allows us to collect the data with minimal supervision efforts.",
        "It provides an API which makes the data retrieval process much more easier then Web based search or other resources.",
        "After the dataset of emotional texts has been obtained, we build a classifier based on n-grams Naïve Bayes approach.",
        "We tested two approaches to build a sentiment classifier:",
        "1.",
        "In the first one, we collected Chinese texts from Twitter and used them to train a classifier to annotate the test dataset.",
        "2.",
        "In the second one, we used machine translator to translate the dataset from Chinese to English and annotated it using collected English texts from Twitter as the training data.",
        "We have made the second approach because we were able to collect much more of English texts from Twitter than Chinese ones and we wanted to test the impact of machine translation on the performance of our classifier.",
        "We have experimented with Google Translate and Yahoo Ba-belfish.",
        "Google Translate yielded better results."

        "@alex - with symbol @ indicating a user name), Twitter special words (such as \"RT\"), and emoticons.",
        "2.",

        "Such a procedure improves the accuracy of the classification since the negation plays a special role in opinion and sentiment expression (Wilson et al., 2005).",
