        "We participated in disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives task of SemEval-2010(Wu and Jin, 2010).",
        "Together 14 sentiment ambiguous adjectives are chosen by the task organizers, which are all high-frequency words in Mandarin Chinese.",
        "They are: y^|big, /h|small, #|many, ^|few, rft |high, {Ë |low, W |thick, M |thin, $H |deep, B |shallow, S |heavy, $5 |light, |ÊL;^|huge, SJ\\ |grave.",
        "These adjectives are neutral out of context, but when they co-occur with some target nouns, positive or negative emotion will be evoked.",
        "The task is designed to automatically determine the semantic orientation of these sentiment ambiguous adjectives within context: positive or negative (Wu and Jin, 2010).",
        "For instance, \"ifrfê-rt|the price is high\" indicates negative meaning, while ^|the quality is high\" has positive connotation.",
        "Considering the grammar system of contemporary Chinese, a word is one of the most basic linguistic granularities consisting of a sentence.",
        "Therefore, as for the sentiment classification of a sentence, the sentiment tendency of a sentence can be identified on the basis of that of a word.",
        "Wiebe et al.",
        "(2004) proposed that whether a sentence is subjective or objective should be discriminated according to the adjectives in it.",
        "On the basis of General Inquirer Dictionary, A Learner's Dictionary of Positive and Negative Words, HowNet, A Dictionary of Positive Words and A Dictionary of Negative Words etc., Wang et al.",
        "(2009) built a word library for Chinese sentiment words to discriminate the sentiment category of a sentence using the weighted linear combination method.",
        "Unlike the previous researches which have not taken SAA into consideration specially in discriminating the sentiment tendency of a sentence, in the SemEval-2010 task of disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjectives, systems have to predict the sentiment tendency of these fourteen adjectives within specific context.",
        "From the view of linguistics, first we developed a SAA-oriented keyword library, then analyzed the relationship between the keywords in the clauses and SAA, and classified its positive or negative meaning of SAA by extracting the clauses related to SAA in the sentence."

      "text": [
        "We create a SAA-oriented library marked as SAAOL which is made up of positive and negative words irrelevant to context, negative words related to SAA (NSAA), positive words related to SAA (PSAA), and inverse words.",
        "The above five categories of words are called keywords for short in the paper.",
        "Positive and negative words irrelevant to context refer to the traditional positive or negative words which are gathered from The Dictionary of Positive Words(Shi, 2005), The Dictionary of Negative Words(Yang, 2005), HowNet and other network resources, such as Terms of Adverse Drug Reaction, Codes of Diseases and Symptoms, etc.",
        "Distinguishing from the traditional positive and negative words, NSAA and PSAA in our SAAOL refer to those positive and negative words which are related to SAA, yet not classified into the positive and negative words irrelevant to context mentioned above.",
        "We divide SAA into two categories: A category and B category listed in Table 1.",
        "We identify whether a word belongs to NSAA or not on the following principle: any words when used with A category are negative; conversely, when used with B category, they are positive.",
        "For example, in the following clauses, \"}'É'MFÏ|oil prices are high\" , \"Sf{3:ÎË^|the responsibility is important\", \"{î^4IIÎË| the task is very heavy\", \"If^Ä^H^the workload is very large\" , \"^ifMoil prices\", \"fHî|responsibility\", \"ft #|task\", \"I^S|workload\" are NSAA.",
        "Correspondingly, we identify whether a word belongs to PSAA or not on the following principle: any words when used with A category are positive; however, when used with B category, they are negative.",
        "In the clauses, much food\",",
        "efficiency is extremely low\" , \"#S^0$iI] [interest rate on deposit is high\", \"food\", \"W| efficiency\", \" |interest rate on deposit\" are PSAA.",
        "In general, when two negative words are used together, the sentiment tendency that they show is negative.",
        "For instances, \" |incidence of diabetes\", \" ^î|]Ë§J?c|virus infection\", \"i^^5jji^|destruction of wars\".",
        "However, in certain cases, some words play a part in eliminating negative meaning when used with negative words, for example, \" Jx.",
        "|anti-\" , \" fflM |restrain\", \" |avoid\", \" K |resist\", \" |reduce\", \"F$ipS|fell\", \"M4>|decrease\", \"fèflj |control\", \" Jt*|cost\", \" Suppose\", \" TM |decrease\", \" # |non-\", \" |not\".",
        "These special words are called inverse words in our SAAOL.",
        "In the following instances, \"MfefëS|reduce the injury\", \" »JffiJH curb inflation\", \"S$4 |anti-war\", the words \"ffif||injury\", inflation\", and \" ^^|war\" themselves are all negative.",
        "When used with the inverse words\" M$r |reduce \", curb\", \"Jx|anti-\", they express positive meaning instead.",
        "On the basis of the above collected word library, we discriminate manually the positive and negative meaning, PSAA, NSAA, and inverse words in 50,000 Chinese words according to Richard Xiao's Top 50,000 Chinese Word Frequency List, which collects the frequency of the top 50000 Chinese words covered in the just published frequency dictionary of Mandarin Chinese based on a balanced corpus of ca.",

        "The list is available at http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/projects /corpus/data/top50000 Chinese words.",
        "zip.",
        "Based on HowNet lexical semantic similarity computing(Liu, 2002), Yang and Wu(2009) selected the new positive and negative benchmark words to identify the sentiment tendency by adopting the improved benchmark words and the modified method of computing similarity between words and benchmark words.",
        "Their accuracy rate arrived at 98.94%.",
        "In light of the errors of manual calibration, we extended the keywords in SAAOL by applying Yang and Wu's (2009) method and added synonymic and antonymous words in it.",
        "Eventually we proofread and revised manually the new extended keywords."
