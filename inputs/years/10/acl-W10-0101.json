        "Using supervised machine learning methods is very popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "However, these methods are not applicable for most of the NLP tasks due to the lack of labeled data.",
        "Although a huge amount of unlabeled data is freely available, labeling them for supervised learning techniques is very tedious, expensive, time consuming, and error prone.",
        "Active learning is a supervised machine learning method in which informative instances are chosen by the classifier for labeling.",
        "Unlike the normal supervised set-up where data annotation and learning are completely independent, active learning is a sequential process (Settles, 2009; Busser and Morante, 2005).",
        "This learning method is used in a variety of",
        "NLP tasks such as information extraction (Thompson et al., 1999), semantic role labeling (Busser and Morante, 2005), machine translation (Haffari and Sarkar, 2009), and name entity recognition (Laws and Schütze, 2008).",
        "In our study, we apply this method for the frame assignment task as a kind of semantic analysis.",
        "The process of active learning is as follows: the learner takes a set of labeled instances, called seed data, as an input for initial training of the classifier; and then a larger set of unlabeled instances will be selected by the classifier to be labeled with the human interaction.",
        "Even a small set of well selected samples for labeling can achieve the same level of performance of a large labeled data set; and the oracle's effort will be reduced as a result.",
        "The motivation behind active learning is selecting the most useful examples for the classifier and thereby minimizing the annotation effort while still keeping up the performance level (Thompson et al., 1999).",
        "There are two major learning scenarios in active learning which are very popular among researchers and frequently used in various NLP tasks: stream-based sampling (Cohn et al., 1994) and pool-based sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994).",
        "The samples that are selected should be hard and very informative.",
        "There are different query methods for sample selection which are independent of the active learning scenarios (Settles, 2009).",
        "Among them, uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) is the most well-known and the simplest sample selection method which only needs one classifier (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004).",
        "In this query method, the samples that the classifier is least con-",
        "Algorithm 1 Uncertainty Sampling in Active Learning Input: Seed data S, Pool of unlabeled samples U Use S to train the classifier C while the stopping criterion is met do Use C to annotate U",
        "Select the top K samples from U predicted by C which have the lowest confidence Label K, augment S with theK samples, and remove K from U Use S to retrain C end while fident on their labels are selected and handed out to the oracle.",
        "To this aim, a confidence score is required which is in fact the prediction of the classifier with the highest probability for the label of the sample (Busser and Morante, 2005).",
        "The approach taken in active learning for our task is based on the uncertainty of the classifier with access to the pool of data.",
        "The learning process is presented in Algorithm 1.",
        "Since active learning is an iterative process (Busser and Morante, 2005), it should be stopped at some point which is optimum or at least near-optimum.",
        "A learning curve is used as a means to illustrate the learning progress of the learner, so that we can monitor the performance of the classifier.",
        "In fact, the curve signals when the learning process should stop as almost no increase or even a drop in the performance of the classifier is observed.",
        "At this point, additional training data will not increase the performance any more.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new stopping criterion based on the variability of the classifier's confidence score on the selected unlabeled data so that we avoid using the labeled gold standard.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly describe frame semantics as it is the domain of application for our model.",
        "Section 3 introduces our stopping criterion and describes the idea behind it.",
        "In Section 4, we describe our data set and present the experimental results.",

      "text": [
        "The main idea behind the stopping criteria is to stop the classifier when it has reached its maximum performance and labeling of further examples from the unlabeled data set will not increase the classifier's performance any more.",
        "Determining this point is very difficult experimentally without access to the gold standard labels to evaluate the performance; however, we should find a criterion to stop active learning in a near-optimum point.",
        "To this aim, we propose a novel stopping criterion which uses the variance of the classifier's confidence score for the predicted labels to represent the degree of spreading out the confidence scores around their mean.",
        "We hypothesize that there is a correlation between the performance saturation of the classifier and the variability on the confidence of the selected instances.",
        "Generally, as we will see in Section 5, a stopping criterion could be based either on the performance of the classifier on the test data, or on the confidence score of the classifier on the unlabeled data.",
        "In our method, we used the second approach.",
        "The biggest advantage of this model is that no gold standard data is required to evaluate the performance of the system in each iteration.",
        "Mean and variance are two of the well-known statistical metrics.",
        "Mean is a statistical measurement for determining the central tendency among a set of scores.",
        "In our study, we have computed the mean (M) of the classifier's confidence score for the predicted labels of 5 samples selected in each iteration.",
        "Variance is the amount of variability of the scores around their mean.",
        "To compute the variability of the classifier's confidence score for the selected samples in each iteration, the following equation is used in our task:",
        "where Ci is the confidence score of each selected sample in each iteration, M is the mean of the confidence scores for the predicted labels, and K is the number of samples selected in the same iteration (K=5 in our study).",
        "According to the pool-based scenario, in each iteration K samples of the extra unlabeled data which have the lowest confidence score are selected, and after labeling by the oracle they are added to the training data.",
        "In the early iterations, the mean of the classifier's confidence score for the selected samples is low.",
        "Since the classifier is not trained enough in these iterations, most of the scores are low and they do not have a high degree of variability.",
        "As a result the variance of the confidence score for these samples is low.",
        "We call this step the untrained stage of the classifier.",
        "As the classifier is training with more data, the confidence score of the samples will gradually increase; as a result, there will be a high degree of variability in the confidence scores which spread out around their mean.",
        "In these iterations, the classifier is relatively in the borderline of the training stage, passing from untrained to trained; so that there will be a high variability of confidence scores which leads to have a high variance.",
        "This is the training stage of the classifier.",
        "When the classifier is trained, the confidence score of the classifier on the selected samples will increase.",
        "However, from a certain point that the classifier is trained enough, all of the confidence scores are located tightly around their mean with a low degree of variability; as a result, the variance of the samples decreases.",
        "This is the stage that the classifier is trained.",
        "The curve in Figure 1 represents the behavior of the variance in different iterations such that the x axis is the number of iterations, and the y axis is the variance of the confidence scores in each iteration.",

        "Based on our assumption, the best stopping point is when variance reaches its global peak and starts to decrease.",
        "In this case, the classifier passes the training stage and enters into the trained stage.",
        "It is difficult to determine the peak of the variance on the fly, i.e. without going through all iterations.",
        "One easy solution is to stop the learning process as soon as there is a decrease in the variance.",
        "However, as it is very likely to stick in the local maxima of the variance curve, this criterion does not work well.",
        "In other words, it is possible to have small peaks before reaching the global peak, the highest variability of the classifier's confidence score; so that we might stop at some point we are not interested in and it should be ignored.",
        "To avoid this problem, we propose a model, called variance model (VM), to stop active learning when variance (V) decreases in n sequential iterations; i.e.",
        "Vi < Vii < ... < Vi-n.",
        "There is a possibility that this condition is not satisfied at all in different iterations.",
        "In such cases, active learning will not stop and all data will be labeled.",
        "This condition is usually met when there are instances in the data which are inherently ambiguous.",
        "Having such data is generally unavoidable and it is often problematic for the learner.",
        "Although the above model can deal with the local maxima problem, there is a possibility that the decreased variance in n sequential iterations is very small and it is still possible to stick in the local maxima.",
        "To avoid this problem and have a better stopping point, we extend the proposed model by setting a threshold m, called the Extended Variance Model (EVM), in which the minimum variance decrement in n sequential iterations must be m; i.e.",

        "The simplest stopping criterion for active learning is when the training set has reached a desirable size or a predefined threshold.",
        "In this criterion, the active learning process repeatedly provides informative examples to the oracle for labeling, and updates the training set, until the desired size is obtained or the predefined stopping criterion is met.",
        "Practically, it is not clear how much annotation is sufficient for inducing a classifier with maximum effectiveness (Lewis and Gale, 1994).",
        "Schohn and Cohn (2000) have used support vector machines (SVM) for document classification using the selective sampling method and they have proposed a criterion to stop the learning process in their task.",
        "Based on their idea, when there is no informative instance in the pool which is closer to the separating hyperplane than any of the support vectors, the margin exhausts and the learning process stops.",
        "Zhu and Hovey (2007) have used a confidence-based approach for the stopping criteria by utlizing the maximum confidence and the minimum error of the classifier.",
        "The maximum confidence is based on the uncertainty measurement when the entropy of the selected unlabeled sample is less than a predefined threshold close to zero.",
        "The minimum error is the feedback from the oracle when active learning asks for the true label of the selected unlabeled sample and the accuracy prediction of the classifier for the selected unlabeled sample is larger than a predefined accuracy threshold.",
        "These criteria are considered as upper-bound and lower-bound of the stopping condition.",
        "Zhu et al.",
        "(2008) proposed another stopping criterion based on a statistical learning approach called minimum expected error strategy.",
        "In this approach, the maximum effectiveness of the classifier is reached when the classifier's expected errors on future unlabeled data is minimum.",
        "Vlachos (2008) has used the classifier confidence score as a stopping criterion for the uncertainty sampling.",
        "He has applied his model to two NLP tasks: text classification and named entity recognition.",
        "He has built his models with the SVM and the maximum entropy.",
        "The idea is when the confidence of the classifier remains at the same level or drops for a number of consecutive iterations, the learning process should terminate.",
        "Laws and Schütze (2008) suggested three criteria minimal absolute performance, maximum possible performance, and convergence-to stop active learning for name entity recognition using the SVM model with the uncertainty sampling method.",
        "In minimal absolute performance, a threshold is predefined by the user; and then the classifier estimates its own performance by using only the unla-beled reference test set.",
        "Since there is no available labeled test set, the evaluation performance is not possible.",
        "The maximum possible performance is a confidence-based stopping criterion in which active learning is stopped where the optimal performance of the classifier is achieved.",
        "Again, in this approach there is no labeled test data to evaluate the performance.",
        "The convergence criterion is met when more examples from the pool of unlabeled data do not contribute more information to the classifier's performance, so that the classifier has reached its maximum performance.",
        "Laws and Schütze computed the convergence as the gradient of the classifier's estimated performance or uncertainty.",

        "In their criterion, they approximated the progression of the learning curve based on the disagreement among the committee members.",
        "They have used the validation set agreement curve as an adequate approximation for the progression of the learning curve.",
        "This curve was based on the data in each active learning iteration that makes the agreement values comparable between different active learning iterations.",
        "Bloodgood and Vijay-Shanker (2009) explained three areas of stopping active learning that should be improved: applicability (restricting the usage in certain situation), lack of aggressive stopping (finding the stopping points which are too far, so more examples than necessary are annotated), instability (well working of a method on some data set but not the other data set).",
        "Further, they presented a stopping criterion based on stabilizing predictions that addresses each of the above three areas and provides a user-adjustable stopping behavior.",
        "In this method, the prediction of active learning was tested on examples which do not have to be labeled and it is stopped when the predictions are stabilized.",
        "This criterion was applied to text classification and named entity recognition tasks using the SVM and the maximum entropy models."

        "In this paper, after a brief overview of frame semantics and active learning scenarios and query methods, we performed the frame assignment in the poolbased active learning with the uncertainty sampling method.",
        "To this end, we chose 14 frequent targets from FrameNet data set for our task.",
        "One of the properties of active learning is its itera-tivness which should be stopped when the classifier has reached its maximum performance.",
        "Reaching this point is very difficult; therefore, we proposed a stopping criterion which stops active learning in a near-optimum point.",
        "This stopping criterion is based on the confidence score of the classifier on the extra unlabeled data such that it uses the variance of the classifier's confidence score for the predicted labels of a certain number of samples selected in each iteration.",
        "The advantage of this criterion is that there is no need to the labeled gold standard data and testing the performance of the classifier in each iteration.",
        "Based on this idea, we proposed a model which is satisfied by n sequential decrease on a variance curve.",
        "The original model is expanded by setting a threshold m on the amount of the decrement of variance in n sequential iterations.",
        "We believe that our proposed criterion can be applied to any active learning setting based on uncertainty sampling and it is not limited to the frame assignment.",
        "To find out how effective our model is, we compared the achieved results of our variance model with the maximum performance of the classifier and we found that 92.66% of the performance is kept in the test data.",
        "In the extended variance model, we achieved a higher performance of the classifier in which 93.67% of the performance is kept.",
        "For the future word, while in our current research the learner selects 5 instances in each iteration, this number could be different and investigation is needed to find out how much our proposed criterion depends on the K. The other possibility to expand our proposed model is using the variance of the classifier's confidence score for the predicted labels of the whole unlabeled data in each iteration and not the selected samples."
