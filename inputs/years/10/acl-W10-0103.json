        "On a highly imbalanced class distribution, it is particularly demanding to identify examples from minority classes.",
        "These, however, may be important in terms of representativeness.",
        "Failing to identify cases from under-represented classes may have costs.",
        "Minority classes may correspond to specific information needs which are relevant for specific subgroups of users.",
        "In many situations, such as fraud detection, clinical diagnosis, news (Ribeiro and Escudeiro, 2008) and Web resources (Escudeiro and Jorge, 2006), we face the problem of imbalanced class distributions.",
        "The aim of our current work is to get a classification model that is able to fully recognize the target concept, including all the classes to learn no mater how frequent or rare they are.",
        "Our main goal is to identify representative examples for each class in the absence of previous descriptions of some or all the classes.",
        "Furthermore, this must be achieved with a reduced number of labeled examples in order to reduce the labeling effort.",
        "There are several learning schemes available for classification.",
        "The supervised setting allows users to specify arbitrary concepts.",
        "However, it requires a fully labeled training set, which is prohibitive when the labeling cost is high and, besides that, it requires labeled cases from all classes.",
        "Semi-supervised learning allows users to state specific needs without requiring extensive labeling (Chapelle et al., 2006) but still requires that labeled examples fully cover the target concept.",
        "Unsupervised learning does not require any labeling but users have no chance to tailor clusters to their specific needs and there is no guarantee that the induced clusters are aligned with the classes to learn.",
        "In active learning, that seems more adequate to our goals, the learner is allowed to ask an oracle (typically a human) to label examples - these requests are called queries.",
        "The most informative queries are selected by the learning algorithm instead of being randomly selected as is the case in supervised learning.",
        "In this paper we evaluate the performance of d-Confidence (Escudeiro and Jorge, 2009) on text corpora.",
        "D-Confidence is an active learning approach that tends to explore unseen regions in case space, thus selecting cases from unseen classes faster with fewer queries - than traditional active learning approaches.",

        "The charts in Figures 3 and 4 confirm the results that have been previously reported for standard nontextual datasets (Escudeiro and Jorge, 2009), w.r.t.",
        "identification of cases from unknown classes, i.e., d-Confidence reduces the labeling effort that is required to identify examples from all classes.",
        "However, the error rate gets worse in the R52 dataset.",
        "D-Confidence gets to know more classes from the target concept earlier although less sharply.",
        "In the R52 dataset we are exchanging accuracy by representativeness.",
        "This might be desirable or not, depending on the specifc task we are dealing with.",
        "If we are trying to learn a target concept but we do not know examples from all the classes to learn - for instance if we are in the early stage of a classification problem - this effect might be desirable so we can get a full specification of the target concept with a reduced labeling effort.",
        "It is interesting to notice that d-Confidence outperforms confidence to a greater extent on minority classes.",
        "This is obvious in R52 if we compute the cumulative average of the gain in labeling effort that is provided by d-Confidence when compared to confidence (Figure 7).",
        "The gain for each class is defined as the number of queries required by d-Confidence to first hit the class minus the ones that are required by confidence.",
        "To compute the moving average, these gains are sorted in increasing order of the class frequency.",
        "The average gain starts at -128, for a class with frequency 2, and decreases to the overall average of -36 as class frequency increases up to 435.",
        "The bigger gains are observed in the minority classes.",
        "Although not as obvious as in R52 this same behaviour is also observed in the NG dataset.",
        "Figures 5 and 6, as well as Tables 2 to 4, show that d-Confidence reduces the labeling effort required to identify unknown classes when compared to confidence.",
        "When selecting cases to label randomly, the first bunch of 10 distinct classes is found as fast as with d-Confidence but, from there on, when rare classes come by, d-Confidence takes the lead.",
        "The outcome is quite different in the NG dataset.",
        "In this dataset d-Confidence still outperforms confidence but it is beaten by random selection of cases after identifying 13.3 classes on average (after 22 queries on average).",
        "This observation led us to suspect that when in presence of balanced datasets, d-Confidence identifies new classes faster than random selection in the initial phase of the learning process but selecting cases by chance is better to identify cases in the latest stage of collecting exemplary cases, when few classes remain undetected."

        "The evaluation procedure that we have performed provided statistical evidence on the performance of d-Confidence over text corpora when compared to confidence.",
        "Although the evaluation has been performed only on two datasets, the conclusions we have reached point out some interesting results.",
        "D-Confidence reduces the labeling effort and identifies exemplary cases for all classes faster that confidence.",
        "This gain is bigger for minority classes, which are the ones where the benefits are more relevant.",
        "D-Confidence performs better in imbalanced datasets where it provides significant gains that greatly reduce the labeling effort.",
        "For balanced datasets, d-Confidence seems to be valuable in the early stage of the classification task, when few classes are known.",
        "In the later stages, random selection of cases seems faster in identifying the few missing classes.",
        "However, d-Confidence consistently outperforms confidence.",
        "The main drawback of d-Confidence when applied on imbalanced text corpora is that the reduction in the labeling effort that is achieved in identifying unknown classes is obtained at the cost of increasing error.",
        "This increase in error is probably due to the fact that we are diverting the classifier from focusing on the decision function of the majority classes to focus on finding new, minority, classes.",
        "As a consequence the classification model generated by d-Confidence is able of identifying more distinct classes faster but gets less sharp in each one of them.",
        "This is particularly harmful for accuracy since a more fuzzy decision boundary for majority classes might cause many erroneous guesses with a negative impact on error.",
        "We are now exploring semi-supervised learning to leverage the intrinsic value of unlabeled cases so we can benefit from the reduction in labeling effort provided by d-Confidence without increasing error."
