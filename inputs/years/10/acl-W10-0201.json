        "The automatic detection of emotions in text is a necessary preprocessing step in many different fields touching on affective computing (Picard, 1997), such as natural language interfaces (Cosatto et al., 2003), e-learning environments (Ryan et al., 2000), educational or entertainment games (Pivec and Kearney, 2007), opinion mining and sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008), humor recognition (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2006), and security informatics (Abbasi, 2007).",
        "In the latter case, for example, it can be used for monitoring levels of hateful or violent rhetoric (perhaps in multilingual settings).",
        "More generally, emotion detection is of great interest in human-computer interaction: if a system determines that a user is upset or annoyed, for instance, it could switch to a different mode of interaction (Liscombe et al., 2005).",
        "And of course, it plays a critical role in the generation of expressive synthetic speech (Schroder, 2006).",
        "Emphasis has traditionally been placed on the set of six \"universal\" emotions (Ekman, 1993): ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR, JOY, SADNESS, and SURPRISE (Alm et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2003; Subasic and Huet-tner, 2001).",
        "Emotion analysis is typically carried out using a simplified description of emotional states in a low-dimensional space, which normally comprises dimensions such as valence (positive/negative eva-lution), activation (stimulation of activity), and/or control (dominant/submissive power) (Mehrabian, 1995; Russell, 1980; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008).",
        "Classification proceeds based on an underlying emotional knowledge base, which strives to provide adequate distinctions between different emotions.",
        "This affective information can either be built entirely upon manually selected vocabulary as in (Whissell, 1989), or derived automatically from data based on expert knowledge of the most relevant features that can be extracted from the input text (Alm et al., 2005).",
        "In both cases, the resulting system tends to rely, for the most part, on a few thousand annotated \"emotional keywords,\" the presence of which triggers the associated emotional label(s).",
        "The drawback of such confined lexical affinity is that the analysis tends to be hampered by the bias inherent in the underlying taxonomy of emotional states.",
        "Because this taxonomy only supports simplified relationships between affective words and emotional categories, it often fails to meaningfully generalize beyond the relatively few core terms explicitly considered in its construction.",
        "This has sparked interest in data-driven approaches based on latent semantic analysis (LSA), a paradigm originally developed for information retrieval (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "Upon suitable training using a large corpus of texts, LSA allows a similarity score to be computed between generic terms and affective categories (Strapparava et al., 2006).",
        "This way, every word can automatically be assigned some fractional affective influence.",
        "Still, the affective categories themselves are usually specified with the help of a reference lexical database like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The purpose of this paper is to more broadly leverage the principle of latent semantics in emotion analysis.",
        "We cast the problem as a general application of latent semantic mapping (LSM), an extrapolation of LSA for modeling global relationships implicit in large volumes of data (Bellegarda, 2005; Belle-garda, 2008).",
        "More specifically, we use the LSM framework to describe two distinct semantic levels: one that encapsulates the foundations of the domain considered (e.g., broadcast news, email messages, SMS conversations, etc.",
        "), and one that specifically accounts for the overall affective fabric of the language.",
        "Then, we leverage these two descriptions to appropriately relate domain and affective levels, and thereby inform the emotion classification process.",
        "This de facto bypasses the need for any explicit external knowledge.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section provides some motivation for, and gives an overview of, the proposed latent affective framework.",
        "In Sections 3 and 4, we describe the two main alternatives considered, latent folding and latent embedding.",
        "In Section 5, we discuss the mechanics of emotion detection based on such latent affective processing.",
        "Finally, Section 6 reports the outcome of experimental evaluations conducted on the \"Affective Text\" portion of the SemEval-2007 corpus (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007)."

        "words have inherently clear, unambiguous emotional meaning.",
        "For example, happy and sad encapsulate joy and sadness, respectively, in all conceivable scenarios.",
        "But is thrilling a marker of joy or surprise?",
        "Does awful capture sadness or disgust?",
        "It largely depends on contextual information: thrilling as a synonym for uplifting conveys joy (as in a thrilling speech), while thrilling as a synonym for amazing may well mark surprise (as in a thrilling waterfall ride); similarly, awful as a synonym for grave reflects sadness (as in an awful car accident), while awful as a synonym for foul is closer to disgust (as in an awful smell).",
        "The vast majority of words likewise carry multiple potential emotional connotations, with the degree of affective polysemy tightly linked to the granularity selected for the underlying taxonomy of emotions.",
        "Data-driven approaches based on LSA purport to \"individuate\" such indirect affective words via inference mechanisms automatically derived in an unsupervised way from a large corpus of texts, such as the British National Corpus (Strapparava et al., 2006).",
        "By looking at document-level cooccurrences, contextual information is exploited to encapsulate semantic information into a relatively low dimensional vector space.",
        "Suitable affective categories are then constructed in that space by \"folding in\" either the specific word denoting the emotion, or its associated synset (say, from WordNet), or even the entire set of words in all synsets that can be labelled with that emotion (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008).",
        "This is typically done by placing the relevant word(s) into a \"pseudo-document,\" and map it into the space as if it were a real one (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "Finally, the global emotional affinity of a given input text is determined by computing similarities between all pseudo-documents.",

        "This solution is attractive, if for no other reason than it allows every word to automatically be assigned some fractional affective influence.",
        "However, it suffers from two limitations which may well prove deleterious in practical situations.",
        "First, the inherent lack of supervision routinely leads to a latent semantic space which is not particularly representative of the underlying domain of discourse.",
        "And second, the construction of the affective categories still relies heavily on predefined lexical affinity, potentially resulting in an unwarranted bias in the taxonomy of affective states.",
        "The first limitation impinges on the effectiveness of any LSA-based approach, which is known to vary substantially based on the size and quality of the training data (Bellegarda, 2008; Mohler and Mihal-cea, 2009).",
        "In the present case, any discrepancy between latent semantic space and domain of discourse may distort the position of certain words in the space, which could in turn lead to subsequent suboptimal affective weight assignment.",
        "For instance, in the examples above, the word smell is considerably more critical to the resolution of awful as a marker of DISGUST than the word car.",
        "But that fact may never be uncovered if the only pertinent documents in the training corpus happen to be about expensive fragrances and automobiles.",
        "Thus, it is highly desirable to derive the latent semantic space using data representative of the application considered.",
        "This points to a modicum of supervision.",
        "The second limitation is tied to the difficulty of coming up with an a priori affective description that will work universally.",
        "Stipulating the affective categories using only the specific word denoting the emotion is likely to be less robust than using the set of words in all synsets labelled with that emotion.",
        "On the other hand, the latter may well expose some inherent ambiguities resulting from affective polysemy.",
        "This is compounded by the relatively small number of words for which an affective distribution is even available.",
        "For example, the well-known General Inquirer content analysis system (Stone, 1997) lists only about 2000 words with positive outlook and 2000 words with negative outlook.",
        "There are exactly 1281 words inventoried in the affective extension of WordNet (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), and the affective word list from (Johnson-Laird and Oatley, 1989) comprises less than 1000 words.",

        "Compared to Fig. 1, we inject some supervision at two separate levels: not only regarding the particular domain considered, but also how the affective categories themselves are defined.",
        "The first task is to exploit a suitable training collection to encapsulate into a (domain) latent semantic space the general foundations of the domain at hand.",

        "This blueprint is then folded into the domain space in one of two ways.",
        "The easiest approach, called latent affective folding, is simply to superimpose affective anchors inferred in the space for every affective category.",
        "This is largely analogous to what happens in Fig. 1, with a crucial difference regarding the representation of affective categories: in latent affective folding, it is derived from a corpus of texts as opposed to a pre-specified keyword or keyset.",
        "This is likely to help making the categories more robust, but may not satisfactorily resolve subtle distinctions between emotional connotations.",

        "In order to evaluate the latent affective framework described above, we used the data set that was developed for the SemEval 2007 task on \"Affective Text\" (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007).",
        "This task was focused on the emotion classification of news headlines.",
        "Headlines typically consist of a few words and are often written by creative people with the intention to \"provoke\" emotions, and consequently attract the readers attention.",
        "These characteristics make this kind of data particularly suitable for use in an automatic emotion recognition setting, as the affective/emotional features (if present) are guaranteed to appear in these short sentences.",
        "The test data accordingly consisted of 1,250 short news headlines extracted from news web sites (such as Google news, CNN) and/or newspapers, and annotated along L = 6 emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) by different evaluators.",
        "For baseline purposes, we considered the following approaches: (i) a simple word accumulation system, which annotates the emotions in a text based on the presence of words from the WordNet-Affect lexicon; and (ii) three LSA-based systems implemented as in Fig. 1, which only differ in the way each emotion is represented in the LSA space: either based on a specific word only (e.g., joy), or the word plus its WordNet synset, or the word plus all WordNet synsets labelled with that emotion in WordNet-Affect (cf. (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007)).",
        "In all three cases, the large corpus used for LSA processing was the Wall Street Journal text collection (Graff et al., 1995), comprising about 86,000 articles.",
        "For the latent affective framework, we needed to select two separate training corpora.",
        "For the \"domain\" corpus, we selected a collection of about N1 = 8, 500 relatively short English sentences (with a vocabulary of roughly M1 = 12, 000 words) originally compiled for the purpose of a building a concatenative text-to-speech voice.",
        "Though not completely congruent with news headlines, we felt that the type and range of topics covered was close enough to serve as a good proxy for the domain.",
        "For the \"affective\" corpus, we relied on about N2 = 5 , 000 mood-annotated blog entries from LiveJour-nal.com, with a filtered vocabulary of about M2 = 20, 000 words.",
        "The indication of mood being explicitly specified when posting on LiveJournal, without particular coercion from the interface, mood-annotated posts are likely to reflect the true mood of the blog authors (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008).",
        "The moods were then mapped to the L =6emotions considered in the classification.",
        "Next, we formed the domain and affective matrices W1 and W2 and processed them as in (2) and (5).",
        "We used R1 = 100 for the dimension of the domain space L1 and R2 = L = 6 for the dimension of the affective space L2.",
        "We then compared latent affective folding and embedding to the above systems.",
        "The results are summarized in Table I.",
        "Consistent with the observations in (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), word accumulation secures the highest precision at the cost of the lowest recall, while LSA-based systems achieve high recall but significantly lower precision.",
        "Encouragingly, the F-measure obtained with both latent affective mapping techniques is substantially higher than with all four baseline approaches.",
        "Of the two techniques, latent embedding performs better, presumably because the embedded affective anchors are less sensitive than the folded affective anchors to the distribution of words within the affective corpus.",
        "Both techniques seem to exhibit an improved ability to resolve distinctions between emotional connotations."

      "text": [
        "We have proposed a data-driven strategy for emotion analysis which focuses on two coupled phases: (i) separately encapsulate both the foundations of the domain considered and the overall affective fabric of the language, and (ii) exploit the emergent relationship between these two semantic levels of description in order to inform the emotion classification process.",
        "We address (i) by leveraging the latent topicality of two distinct corpora, as uncovered by a global LSM analysis of domain-oriented and emotion-oriented training documents.",
        "The two descriptions are then superimposed to produce the desired connection between all terms and emotional categories.",
        "Because this connection automatically takes into account the influence of the entire training corpora, it is more encompassing than that based on the relatively few affective terms typically considered in conventional processing.",
        "Empirical evidence gathered on the \"Affective Text\" portion of the SemEval-2007 corpus (Strap-parava and Mihalcea, 2007) shows the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",
        "Classification performance with latent affective embedding is slightly better than with latent affective folding, presumably because of its ability to more richly describe the affective space.",
        "Both techniques outperform standard LSA-based approaches, as well as affectively weighted word accumulation.",
        "This bodes well for the general deployability of latent affective processing across a wide range of applications.",
        "Future efforts will concentrate on characterizing the influence of the parameters R1 and R2 on the vector spaces L1 and L2, and the corresponding trade-off between modeling power and generalization properties.",
        "It is also of interest to investigate how incorporating higher level units (such as common lexical compounds) into the LSM procedure might further increase performance.",
