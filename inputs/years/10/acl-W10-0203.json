        "In the 1980s, plot units (Lehnert, 1981) were proposed as a knowledge structure for representing narrative stories and generating summaries.",
        "Plot units are fundamentally different from the story representations that preceded them because they focus on the emotional states and tensions between characters as the driving force behind interesting plots and cohesive stories.",
        "Plot units were used in narrative summarization studies, both in computer science and psychology (Lehnert et al., 1981), but the computational models of plot units relied on tremendous amounts of manual knowledge engineering.",
        "Given the recent swell of activity in automated methods for sentiment analysis, we embarked on a project to see whether current techniques could automatically detect the affect states needed for plot unit analysis.",
        "Plot units are complex structures that include affect states, causal links, and cross-character links, and generating complete plot unit structures is beyond the scope of this work.",
        "As an initial step toward the long-term goal of automatically generating plotunits, we began by creating asystem to automatically identify the affect states associated with characters.",
        "An affect state represents the emotional state of a character, based on their perspective of events in the story.",
        "Plots units include three types of affect states: positive (+) states, negative (-) states, and mental (M) states that have neutral emotion (these are often associated with plans and goals).",
        "Our system, called AESOP, pulls together a variety of existing technologies in sentiment analysis to automatically identify words and phrases that have positive/negative polarity or that correspond to speech acts (for mental states).",
        "However, we needed to develop a method to automatically map these affect tags onto characters in the story.",
        "To address this issue, we created affect projection rules that propagate affect tags from words and phrases to characters in the story via syntactic relations.",
        "During the course of our research, we came to appreciate that affect states, of the type required for plot units, can represent much more than just direct expressions of emotion.",
        "A common phenomena are affect states that result from a character being acted upon in a positive or negative way.",

        "Plot unit structures can be used for tasks such as narrative summarization and question answering.",
        "Plot unit structures consist of affect states for each character in a narrative, and links explaining the relationships between these affect states.",
        "The affect states themselves each have a type: (+) for positive states, (-) for negative states, and (M) for mental states (with neutral affect).",
        "Although affect states are not events per se, events often trigger affect states.",
        "If an event affects multiple characters, it can trigger multiple affect states, one for each character.",
        "Affect states are further connected by causal links, which explain how the narrative hangs together.",
        "These include motivations (m), actualizations (a), terminations (t) and equivalences (e).",

        "Cross-character links explain how single events affect two characters.",
        "For instance, if one character requests something of the other, this is an M-to-M link, since it spans a shared mental affect for both characters.",
        "Other speech acts can be represented as M to + (promise) or M to - (threat).",
        "To get a better feeling of the plot unit representation, a short fable, \"The Father and His Sons,\" is shown in Figure 1(a) and our annotation of its plot unit structure is shown in Figure 1(b).",
        "In this fable, there are two characters (the \"Father\" and the \"Sons\") who go through a series of affect states, depicted chronologically in the two columns.",
        "In this example, the first affect state is a negative state for the sons, who are quarreling (at).",
        "This state is shared by the father (via a cross-character link) who has a negative annoyance state (a2).",
        "The father then decides that he wants to stop the sons from quarreling, which is a mental event (a3).",
        "The causal link from a2 to a3 with an m label indicates a \"motivation.\"",
        "His first attempt is by exhortations (a4).",
        "This produces an M (a3) linked to an M (a4) with a m (motivation) link, which represents subgoaling.",
        "The father's overall goal is to stop the quarreling (a3) and in order to do so, he creates a subgoal of exhorting the sons to stop (a4).",
        "The exhortations fail, which produces a negative state (a5) for the father.",
        "The a causal link indicates an \"actualization\", representing the failure of the plan (a4).",
        "The failure of the father's exhortations leads to a new subgoal: to teach the sons a lesson (a6).",
        "The m link from a5 to a6 is an example of \"enablement.\"",
        "At a high level, this subgoal has two parts, indicated by the two gray regions (a7 – a10 and all – a14).",
        "The first gray region begins with a cross-character link (M to M), which indicates a request (in this case, to break a bundle of sticks).",
        "The sons fail at this, which upsets them (a9) but pleases the father (a10).",
        "The second gray region depicts the second part of the father's subgoal; he makes a second request (all to a12) to separate the bundle and break the sticks, which the sons successfully do, making them happy (a13) and the father happy (a14).",
        "This latter structure (the second gray region) is an HONORED REQUEST plot unit.",
        "At the end, the father's plan succeeds (a15) which is an actualization (a link) of his goal to teach the sons a lesson (a6).",
        "In this example, as well as the others that we annotated in our gold standard, (see Section 5.1), we annotated conservatively In particular, in reading the story, we may assume that the father's original plan of stopping the son's quarrelling also succeeded.",
        "However, this is not mentioned in the story and therefore we chose not to represent it.",
        "It is also important to note that plot unit representations can have t (termination) and e (equivalence) links that point backwards in time, but they do not occur in the Father and Sons fable."

        "We began this research with the hope that recent research in sentiment analysis would supply us with effective tools to recognize affect states.",
        "However, we soon realized that affect states, as required for plot unit analysis, go well beyond the notions of positive/negative polarity and private states that have been studied in recent sentiment analysis work.",
        "In this section, we explain the wide variety of situations that can produce an affect state, based on our observations in working with fables.",
        "Most likely, an even wider variety of situations could produce affect states in other text genres.",
        "Plot units can include affect states that correspond to explicit expressions of positive/negative emotional states, as has been studied in the realm of sentiment analysis.",
        "For example, \"Max was disappointed\" produces a negative affect state for Max, and \"Max was pleased\" produces a positive affect state for Max.",
        "However, the affect must relate to an event that occurs in the story's plot.",
        "For example, a hypothetical expression of emotion would not yield an affect state (e.g., \"if the rain stops, she will be pleased\").",
        "Positive and negative affect states also frequently represent good and bad situational states that characters find themselves in.",
        "These states do not represent emotion, but indicate whether a situation is good or bad for a character based on world knowledge.",
        "For example, \"Wolf, who had a bone stuck in his throat, \" produces a negative affect state for the wolf.",
        "Similarly, \"The Old Woman recovered her sight \" produces a positive affect state.",
        "Sentiment analysis is not sufficient to generate these affect states.",
        "Sometimes, however, a direct expression of emotion will also be present (e.g., \"Wolf was unhappy because he had a bone stuck \"), providing redundancy and multiple opportunities to recognize the correct affect state for a character.",
        "Situational affect states are common and often motivate plans and goals that are central to the plot.",
        "Plans and goals are another common reason for affect states.",
        "The existence of a plan or goal is usually represented as a mental state (M).",
        "Plans and goals can be difficult to detect automatically.",
        "A story may reveal that a character has a plan or goal in a variety of ways, such as:",
        "Direct expressions of plans/goals: a plan or goal may be explicitly stated (e.g., \"the lion wanted to find food\").",
        "In this case, a mental state (M) should be generated.",
        "Speech acts: a plan or goal may be revealed through a speech act between characters.",
        "For example, \"the wolfasked an eagle to extract the bone\" is a directive speech act that indicates the wolf's plan to resolve its negative state (having a bone stuck).",
        "This example illustrates how a negative state (bone stuck) can motivate a mental state (plan).",
        "When a speech act involves multiple characters, it produces multiple mental states.",
        "For example, a mental state should also be produced for the eagle, because it now has a plan to help the wolf (by virtue of being asked).",
        "Inferred plans/goals: plans and goals sometimes must be inferred from actions.",
        "For example, \"the lion hunted deer\" reveals the lion's plan to obtain food.",
        "Similarly, the serpent spat poison into the man's water\" implies that the serpent had a plan to kill the man.",
        "Plans and goals also produce positive/negative affect states when they succeed/fail.",
        "For example, if the eagle successfully extracts the bone from the wolf's throat, then both the wolf and the eagle will have positive affect states, because both were successful in their respective goals.",
        "A directive speech act between two characters coupled with positive affect states for both characters is a common plot unit structure called an HONORED REQUEST, depicted by the second gray block shown in Fig.1(b).",
        "The affect state for a character is always with respect to its view of the situation.",
        "For example, consider: \"The owl besought a grasshopper to stop chirping The grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped louder and louder.\"",
        "Both the owl and the grasshopper have M affect states representing the request from the owl to the grasshopper (i.e., the owl's plan to stop the chirping is to ask the grasshopper to knock it off).",
        "The grasshopper refuses the request, so a negative affect state is produced for the owl, indicating that its plan failed.",
        "However, a positive affect state is produced for the grasshopper, because its goal was to continue chirping which was accomplished by refusing the request.",
        "This scenario is also a common plot unit structure called a DENIED REQUEST.",
        "Many affect states come directly from events.",
        "In particular, when a character is acted upon (the theme or patient of an event), a positive or negative affect state often results for the character.",
        "These affect states reflect world knowledge about what situations are good and bad.",
        "For example:",
        "Negative patient roles: killed X, ate X, chased X, captured X, fired X, tortured X Positive patient roles: rescued X, fed X, adopted X, housed X, protected X, rewarded X",
        "For example, \"a man captured a bear\" indicates a negative state for the bear.",
        "Overall, this sentence would generate a SUCCESS plot unit consisting of an M state and a + state for the man (with an actualization a causal link between them representing the plan's success) and a - state for the bear (as a cross-character link indicating that what was good for the man was bad for the bear).",
        "A tremendous amount of world knowledge is needed to generate these states from such a seemingly simple sentence.",

        "As we discussed in Section 3.4, existing resources are not sufficient to identify affect states that arise from a character being acted upon.",
        "Sentiment lexicons, for example, assign polarity to verbs irrespective of their agents or patients.",
        "To fill this gap, we tried to automatically acquire verbs that have a strong patient polarity (i.e., the patient will be in a good or bad state by virtue of being acted upon).",
        "We used corpus statistics to identify verbs that frequently occur with agents who typically have evil (negative) or charitable (positive) intent.",
        "First, we identified 40 words that are stereotypically evil agents, such as monster, villain, terrorist, and murderer, and 40 words that are stereotypically charitable agents, such as hero, angel, benefactor, and rescuer.",
        "Next, we searched the google Web 1T 5-gram corpus using patterns designed to identify verbs that co-occur with these words as agents.",
        "For each agent term, we applied the pattern \"*ed by [a,an,the] AGENT\" and extracted the list of matching verbs.Next, we rank the extracted verbs by computing the ratio between the frequency of the verb with a negative agent versus a positive agent.",
        "If this ratio is > 1, then we save the verb as a negative patient polarity verb (i.e., it imparts negative polarity to its patient).",
        "This process produced 408 negative patient polarity verbs, most of which seemed clearly negative for the patient.",
        "Table 1 shows the top 20 extracted verbs.",
        "We also tried to identify positive patient polarity verbs using a positive-to-negative ratio, but the extracted verbs were often neutral for the patient, so we did not use them.",

        "So three of the authors discussed and iteratively refined manual annotations for the development and tuning set stories until we became comfortable that we had a common understanding for the annotation task.",
        "Then to create our gold standard test set, two authors independently created annotations for the test set, and a third author adjudicated the differences.",
        "The gold standard contains complete plot unit annotations, including affect states, causal links, and cross-character links.",
        "For the experiments in this paper, however, only the affect state annotations were used.",
        "We created two baselines to measure what would happen if we use all 4 sentiment analysis resources without any projection rules.",
        "The first one (Bsent) operates at the sentence level.",
        "It naively projects every affect tag that occurs in a sentence onto every character in the same sentence.",
        "The second baseline (Bclause) operates identically, but at the clause level.",
        "As our evaluation metrics we used recall (R), precision (P), and F-measure (F).",
        "We evaluate each system on individual affect states (+, - and M) as well as across all affect states.",
        "The evaluation is done at the sentence level.",
        "Meaning, if a system produces the same affect state as present in the gold standard for a sentence, we count it as a correct affect state.",
        "Our main evaluation also requires each affect state to be associated with the correct character.",
        "Table 2 shows the coverage of our two baseline systems as well as the four Sentiment Analysis Resources used with our projection rules.",
        "We can make several observations:",
        "• As expected, the baselines achieve relatively high recall, but low precision.",
        "• Each of the sentiment analysis resources alone is useful, and using them with the projection rules leads to improved performance over the baselines (10 points in F score for M and 6 points overall).",
        "This shows that the projection rules are helpful in identifying the characters associated with each affect state.",
        "• The PPV Lexicon, alone, is quite good at capturing negative affect states.",
        "Together with the projection rules, this leads to good performance on identifying mental states as well.",
        "To better assess our projection rules, we evaluated the systems both with respect to characters and without respect to characters.",
        "In this evaluation, system-produced states are correct even if they are assigned to the wrong character.",
        "Table 3 reveals several results: (1) For the baseline: there is a large drop when evaluated with respect to the correct character.",
        "(2) For AESOP: there is a smaller drop in both precision and recall for M and -, suggesting that our projection rules are doing well for these affect states.",
        "(3) For AESOP: there is a large drop in both precision and recall for +, suggesting that there is room for improvement of our projection rules for positive affect.",
