        "Even though considerable attention has been given to semantic orientation of words and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons.",
        "In this paper, we show how we create a high-quality, moderate-sized emotion lexicon using Mechanical Turk.",
        "In addition to questions about emotions evoked by terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level).",
        "We perform an extensive analysis of the annotations to better understand the distribution of emotions evoked by terms of different parts of speech.",
        "We identify which emotions tend to be evoked simultaneously by the same term and show that certain emotions indeed go hand in hand."

        "When analyzing text, automatically detecting emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise is useful for a number of purposes, including identifying blogs that express specific emotions towards the topic of interest, identifying what emotion a newspaper headline is trying to evoke, and devising automatic dialogue systems that respond appropriately to different emotional states of the user.",
        "Often different emotions are expressed through different words.",
        "For example, delightful and yummy indicate the emotion of joy, gloomy and cry are indicative of sadness, shout and boiling are indicative of anger, and so on.",
        "Therefore an emotion lexicon – a list of emotions and words that are indicative of each emotion – is likely to be useful in identifying emotions in text.",
        "Words may evoke different emotions in different contexts, and the emotion evoked by a phrase or a sentence is not simply the sum ofemotions conveyed by the words in it, but the emotion lexicon will be a useful component for any sophisticated emotion detecting algorithm.",
        "The lexicon will also be useful for evaluating automatic methods that identify the emotions evoked by a word.",
        "Such algorithms may then be used to automatically generate emotion lexicons in languages where no such lexicons exist.",
        "As of now, high-quality high-coverage emotion lexicons do not exist for any language, although there are a few limited-coverage lexicons for a handful of languages, for example, the WordNet Affect Lexicon (WAL) (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) for six basic emotions and the General Inquirer (GI) (Stone et al., 1966), which categorizes words into a number of categories, including positive and negative semantic orientation.",
        "Amazon has an online service called Mechanical Turk that can be used to obtain a large amount of human annotation in an efficient and inexpensive manner (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009).However, one must define the task carefully to obtain annotations ofhigh quality.",
        "Several checks must be placed to ensure that random and erroneous annotations are discouraged, rejected, and re-annotated.",
        "In this paper, we show how we compiled a moderate-sized English emotion lexicon by manual annotation through Amazon's Mechanical Turk service.",
        "This dataset, which we will call EmoLex, is many times as large as the only other known emotion lexicon, WordNet Affect Lexicon.",
        "More importantly, the terms in this lexicon are carefully chosen to include some of the most frequent nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.",
        "Beyond unigrams, it has a large number of commonly used bigrams.",
        "We also include some words from the General Inquirer and some from WordNet Affect Lexicon, to allow comparison of annotations between the various resources.",
        "We perform an extensive analysis of the annotations to answer several questions that have not been properly addressed so far.",
        "For instance, how hard is it for humans to annotate words with the emotions they evoke?",
        "What percentage of commonly used terms, in each part of speech, evoke an emotion?",
        "Are emotions more commonly evoked by nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs?",
        "Is there a correlation between the semantic orientation of a word and the emotion it evokes?",
        "Which emotions tend to go together; that is, which emotions are evoked simultaneously by the same term?",
        "This work is intended to be a pilot study before we create a much larger emotion lexicon with tens of thousands of terms.",
        "We focus on the emotions of joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust, surprise, and anticipation – argued by many to be the basic and prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980).",
        "Complex emotions can be viewed as combinations of these basic emotions."

        "WordNet Affect Lexicon (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) has a few hundred words annotated with the emotions they evoke.",
        "It was created by manually identifying the emotions of a few seed words and then marking all their WordNet synonyms as having the same emotion.",
        "The General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) has 11,788 words labeled with 182 categories of word tags, including positive and negative semantic orientation.",
        "It also has certain other affect categories, such as pleasure, arousal, feeling, and pain but these have not been exploited to a significant degree by the natural language processing community.",
        "Work in emotion detection can be roughly classified into that which looks for specific emotion denoting words (Elliott, 1992), that which determines tendency of terms to co-occur with seed words whose emotions are known (Read, 2004), that which uses hand-coded rules (Neviarouskaya et al., 2009), and that which uses machine learning and a number of emotion features, including emotion denoting words (Alm et al., 2005).",
        "Much of this recent work focuses on six emotions studied by Ekman (1992).",
        "These emotions – joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise – are a subset of the eight proposed in Plutchik (1980).",
        "We focus on the Plutchik emotions because the emotions can be naturally paired into opposites – joy-sadness, anger-fear, trust-disgust, and anticipation-surprise.",
        "Natural symmetry apart, we believe that prior work on automatically computing word-pair antonymy (Lin et al., 2003; Mohammad et al., 2008; Lobanova et al., 2010) can now be leveraged in automatic emotion detection."

        "In the subsections below we present the challenges in obtaining high-quality emotion annotation, how we address those challenges, how we select the target terms, and the questionnaire we created for the annotators.",
        "Words used in different senses can evoke different emotions.",
        "For example, the word shout evokes a different emotion when used in the context of admonishment, than when used in \"Give me a shout if you need any help.\"",
        "Getting human annotations on word senses is made complicated by decisions about which sense-inventory to use and what level ofgran-ularity the senses must have.",
        "On the one hand, we do not want to choose a fine-grained sense-inventory because then the number of word-sense combinations will become too large and difficult to easily distinguish, and on the other hand we do not want to work only at the word level because when used in different senses a word may evoke different emotions.",
        "Yet another challenge is how best to convey a word sense to the annotator.",
        "Long definitions will take time to read and limit the number of annotations we can obtain for the same amount of resources.",
        "Further, we do not want to bias the annotator towards an emotion through the definition.",
        "We want the users to annotate a word only if they are already familiar with it and know its meanings.",
        "And lastly, we must ensure that malicious and erroneous annotations are rejected.",
        "In order to overcome the challenges described above, before asking the annotators questions about what emotions are evoked by a target term, we first present them with a word choice problem pertaining to the target.",
        "They are provided with four different words and asked which word is closest in meaning to the target.",
        "This single question serves many purposes.",
        "Through this question we convey the word sense for which annotations are to be provided, without actually providing annotators with long definitions.",
        "If an annotator is not familiar with the target word and still attempts to answer questions pertaining to the target, or is randomly clicking options in our questionnaire, then there is a 75% chance that they will get the answer to this question wrong, and we can discard all responses pertaining to this target term by the annotator (that is, we discard answers to the emotion questions provided by the annotator for this target term).",
        "We generated these word choice problems automatically using the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1986).",
        "Published thesauri, such as Roget's andMac-quarie, divide the vocabulary into about a thousand categories, which may be interpreted as coarse senses.",
        "If a word has more than one sense, then it can be found in more than one thesaurus category.",
        "Each category also has a head word which best captures the meaning of the category.",
        "Most of the target terms chosen for annotation are restricted to those that are listed in exactly one thesaurus category.",
        "The word choice question for a target term is automatically generated by selecting the following four alternatives (choices): the head word of the thesaurus category pertaining to the target term (the correct answer); and three other head words of randomly selected categories (the distrac-tors).",
        "The four alternatives are presented to the annotator in random order.",
        "Only a small number of the words in the WordNet Affect Lexicon are listed in exactly one thesaurus category (have one sense), and so we included target terms that occurred in two thesaurus categories as well.",
        "For these questions, we listed head words from both the senses (categories) as two ofthe alternatives (probability of a random choice being correct is 50%).",
        "Depending on the alternative chosen, we can thus determine the sense for which the subsequent emotion responses are provided by the annotator.",
        "In order to generate an emotion lexicon, we first identify a list of words and phrases for which we want human annotations.",
        "We chose the Macquarie Thesaurus as our source pool for unigrams and bi-grams.",
        "Any other published dictionary would have worked well too.",
        "However, apart from over 57,000 commonly used English word types, the Macquarie Thesaurus also has entries for more than 40,000 commonly used phrases.",
        "From this list of unigrams and bigrams we chose those that occur frequently in the Google n-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "Specifically we chose the 200 most frequent n-grams in the following categories: noun unigrams, noun bigrams, verb unigrams, verb bigrams, adverb un-igrams, adverb bigrams, adjective unigrams, adjective bigrams, words in the General Inquirer that are marked as having a negative semantic orientation, words in General Inquirer that are marked as having a positive semantic orientation.",
        "When selecting these sets, we ignored terms that occurred in more than one Macquarie Thesaurus category.",
        "Lastly, we chose all words from each of the six emotion categories in the WordNet Affect Lexicon that had at most two senses in the thesaurus (occurred in at most two thesaurus categories).",
        "The first and second column of Table 1 list the various sets of target terms as well as the number of terms in each set for which annotations were requested.",
