        "These wishes are sentences in which authors make suggestions (especially for improvements) about a product or service or show intentions to purchase a product or service.",

        "Various products and business services are used by millions of customers each day.",
        "For the makers of these products & services, studying these customer experiences is critical to understanding customer satisfaction and making decisions about possible improvements to the products.",
        "Thanks to the advent of weblogs, online consumer forums, and product comparison sites, consumers are actively expressing their opinions online.",
        "Most of these reviews are now available on the web, usually at little or no cost.",
        "Moreover, these are available for a variety of domains, such as financial services, telecom services, consumer goods etc.",
        "Automated analysis of opinions using such reviews could provide a cheaper and faster means of obtaining a sense of such customer opinions, thus supplementing more traditional survey methods.",
        "In addition, automated analysis can significantly shorten the time taken to find insights into the customer's mind and actions.",
        "Sentiment analysis of texts such as product reviews, call center notes, and customer surveys aims to automatically infer opinions expressed by people with regards to various topics of interest.",
        "A sentiment analysis exercise classifies the overall opinion of a review document into positive, neutral, or negative classes.",
        "It may also identify sentiments at a finer granularity, i.e. recognizing the mix of opinions about the topic(s) expressed in the text.",
        "However, industry analysts (Strickland, 2009) report some common problems with the results of these exercises:",
        "1.",
        "The results (usually numerical scores split across positive, negative, neutral classes) are hard to meaningfully interpret.",
        "2.",
        "These results are more useful to certain roles and domains.",
        "Brand, reputation, and service managers in media and retail industries find sentiment analysis more useful than product managers or sales teams in various industries.",
        "3.",
        "The results do not 'indicate user action' i.e. opinions do not help identify a future action of the author based on the comments.",
        "An example of this is: does the consumer indicate that he intends to stop using a service after a negative experience?",
        "4.",
        "The reader of the report often asks \"what do I do next?\"",
        "i.e. the results are not always 'actionable'.",
        "There is a gap between understanding the results and taking an appropriate action.",
        "This has led to interest in identifying aspects indirectly related to sentiment analysis, such as gauging possible loss of clientele or tapping into desires to purchase a product.",
        "Many of these methods attempt to identify 'user intent' .",
        "In this paper, we propose rule-based methods to identify two kinds of 'wishes' - one, the desire to see improvement in a product, and the other to purchase a product.",
        "These methods have been designed & tested using a variety of corpora containing product reviews, customer surveys, and comments from consumer forums in domains such as electronics and retail banking.",
        "From our reading, there has been only one published account of identifying 'wishes' (including suggestions) and no known work on identifying purchasing wishes.",

        "This paper described two novel problems in the world of opinion and intention mining, that of identifying 'wishes' relating to improvements in products and for purchasing them.",
        "These are likely to be directly useful to business users.",
        "We build approaches towards such detections, by the use of English-language patterns.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at solving such problems.",
        "The approach for identifying suggestions works best for texts that contain explicit wishes, especially customer surveys.",
        "They work reasonably well for (electronic) product reviews.",
        "In contrast, reviews about banking services tend to contain narratives and have more implicit opinions and wishes.",
        "Similarly, the algorithm to detect buy wishes works well for electronic product reviews in comparison to banking products.",
        "Wish statements appear very infrequently in reviews.",
        "Existing sentiment analysis corpora may not be sufficient to use in creating wish detectors.",
        "Augmenting corpora such as the WISH dataset or creating even more robust and representative corpora would be a must for such exercises.",
        "A possible source could be the \"Make A Wish\" foundation.",
        "One of the possible future directions could be to look at tense and mood analysis of sentences.",
        "Wish sentences come under the 'optative' mood.",
        "Techniques that help identify such a mood could provide additional hints to the nature of the sentence.",
        "More features related to parts of speech and semantic roles could be explored.",
        "We also plan to look at machine learning approaches, but the availability of good quality training data is a limiting factor.",
        "The emergence of social networking sites may provide more challenges for such detectors.",
        "Sites like Twitter are already being used to advertise intentions to buy or sell.",
        "However, the nature of discourse in these media is markedly different to regular reviews and forums due to size restrictions.",
