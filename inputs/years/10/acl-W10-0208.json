        "Supervised learning techniques have the disadvantage that large annotated datasets are required for training.",
        "Since the emotional interpretations of a text can be highly subjective, more than one annotator is needed, and this makes the process of the annotation very time consuming and expensive.",
        "For this reason, unsupervised methods are normally preferred in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and emotions.",
        "Supervised and unsupervised techniques have been compared before.",

        "These techniques have been applied to many areas, particularly in improving Intelligent Tutoring Systems.",
        "For example, (D'Mello, Craig et al.",
        "2008) used LSA but for detecting utterance types and affect in students' dialogue within Autotutor.",
        "(D'Mello, Graesser et al.",
        "2007) proposed five categories for describing the affect states in student-system dialogue.",
        "Significant differences arise not only between these two types of techniques but also between different emotion models, and these differences have significant implications in all these areas.",
        "While considering emotions and learning, (Kort, Reilly et al.",
        "2001) proposed (but provided no empirical evidence) a model that combines two emotion models, placing categories in a valence-arousal plane.",
        "This mixed approach has also been used in other domains such as blog posts where (Aman and Szpakowicz 2007) studied how to identify emotion categories as well as emotion intensity.",
        "To date, many researchers have, however, utilized and evaluated supervised methods, mainly based on the categorical emotion model.",

        "There are two significantly different models for representing emotions: the categorical model and dimensional model (Russell 2003).",
        "The categorical model assumes that there are discrete emotional categories such as Ekman's six basic emotions - anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise - (Ekman 1992).",
        "There are a number of primary and unrelated emotions in the model.",
        "Each emotion is characterized by a specific set of features, expressing eliciting conditions or responses.",
        "Some researchers have argued that a different set of emotions is required for different domains.",
        "For instance, the following emotion classes are used in the field of teaching and education: boredom, delight, flow, confusion, frustration, and surprise.",
        "The advantage of such a representation is that it represents human emotions intuitively with easy to understand emotion labels.",
        "A second approach is the dimensional model, which represents affects in a dimensional form (Russell 2003).",
        "Emotional states are related each other by a common set of dimensions (e.g. valence or arousal) and are generally defined in a two or three dimensional space.",
        "Each emotion occupies some location in this space.",
        "A valence dimension indicates positive and negative emotions on different ends of the scale.",
        "The arousal dimension differentiates excited vs. calm states.",
        "Sometimes a third, dominance dimension is used to differentiate if the subject feels in control of the situation or not.",
        "The categorical model and the dimensional model have two different methods for estimating the actual emotional states of a person.",
        "In the former, a person is usually required to choose one emotion out of an emotion set that represents the best feeling.",
        "On the other hand, the latter exploits rating scales for each dimension like the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) (Lang 1980), which consists of pictures of manikins, to estimate the degree of valence, arousal, and dominance."

        "There are publicly available lists relevant to the six basic emotion categories extracted from WordNet-Affect and we used four of the six lists of emotional words among them for our experiment.",
        "In addition to WordNet-Affect, we exploited a Vector Space Model (VSM) in which terms and textual documents can be represented through a term-by-document matrix.",

        "Frequencies are weighted according to the log-entropy with respect to a tf-idf weighting schema (Yates and Neto 1999).",
        "Finally, the number of dimensions is reduced through the dimension reduction methods.",
        "The vector-based representation enables words, sentences, and sets of synonyms (i.e. WordNet synsets) to be represented in a unifying way with vectors.",
        "VSM provides a variety of definitions of distance between vectors, corresponding to different measures of semantic similarity.",
        "In particular, we take advantage of cosine angle between an input vector (input sentence) and an emotional vector (i.e. the vector representing an emotional synset) as similarity measures to identify which emotion the sentence connotes.",

        "Otherwise, it is labeled with one emotion associated with the closest emotional vector having the highest similarity value.",
        "We use a predetermined threshold (t = 0.65) for the purpose of validating a strong emotional analogy between two vectors (Penumatsa, Ventura et al.",
        "2006).",
