        "The design of more natural or believable conversational agents (Bates, 1994; Pelachaud and Bilvi, 2003) requires the need for such agents to communicate affectively, by the display of emotion or attitude towards objects, other agents, or states of affairs.",
        "More engaging or influential agents may seek to actually affect their conversational partner at a deeper level, for example, by influencing their emotional state (van der Sluis and Mellish, 2008).",
        "Previous work in this area has explored the use ofgestures and facial expression (Caridakis et al., 2007) and rhythm and prosody of speech (Zovato et al., 2008) for expressing affect; however there has been little work on generation of affective language in dialogue.",
        "Our general approach is inspired by (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002)'s work on generating different surface-level versions of utterance content, depending on an agent's appraisals towards objects, characters and events in its environment.",
        "While their approach is effective, it relies on manual creation of lexical alternatives, customized to the application domain.",
        "We are interested in approaches that will scale, and can be applied domain-independently.",
        "While our ultimate aim is generation of language that relects emotional state, in this work we investigate the automatic generation of varying \"sentiment\" in output utterances; we focus on sentiment mainly due to the recent development of useful resources for this task.",
        "(Guerini et al., 2008)'s Valentino system is an approach to automatically generating candidate output utterances with different sentiment from an original; the authors suggest ECAs as a possible application scenario for their techniques.",
        "We explore this suggestion, implementing a lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) approach to dialogue generation with sentiment, using the Valentino approach and associated resources.",
        "Lexical substitution approaches raise well-known challenges, and we investigate a number of techniques to address these in Section 4; for example, using bigrams and grammatical relations to determine which substitutions are acceptable based on their context in a sentence.",
        "Our techniques show improvement over naive lexical substitution; however, an evaluation with human subjects suggests that a deeper problem is that even \"acceptable\" candidate sentences generated by the method do not match human judgements with respect to sentiment shift: i.e., alternatives labeled as more positive (resp., negative) than the original by the system are often seen as a sentiment shift in the opposite direction by human judges (Section 5)."

        "We take this bigram approach as our base-line.",
        "This simple technique has reasonable accuracy (0.752: see Table 5) but this is due largely to the high number of true negatives produced.",
        "The false negatives are mainly caused by the BNC's relatively limited bigram coverage.",
        "To address this issue, we sourced our bigrams from the Google Web 1T Corpus, which covers approximately one trillion words of English text sourced from publicly accessible web pages.",
        "Compared with the BNC, it has much greater coverage, containing <~314 million bigrams.",
        "However, Web 1T does not contain POS information, and due to its size we did not lemmatise the bigrams.",
        "Using a smaller corpus, these differences may reduce coverage and bigram matching accuracy.",
        "However we hypothesise that using the Web 1T corpus, such limitations should be outweighed by its sheer size.",
        "From Table 5, we see a substantial increase in recall over our previous baseline, which supports our hypothesis that using a larger corpus would increase true positives and reduce false negatives.",
        "However, the increased coverage of the Web 1T corpus brings with it more opportunities for false positives, the number of which has increased dramatically from our baseline, causing a reduction in precision and accuracy.",
        "Despite this, due to increased recall, we achieved an improvement in overall F-score.",
        "Due to its web-based nature, the Web 1T corpus will contain more errors than a corpus sourced from published print, such as the BNC.",
        "Bigrams which occur infrequently may be a source of noise.",
        "We hypothesized that a substitution is acceptable if its replacement bigrams occur in some reasonable proportion to the original bigrams.",
        "Hence, we experimented with bigram frequency ratios, where a candidate is accepted only if its ratio exceeds a given threshold The ratio is calculated as fr /fo, where fr and fo represent the replacement and original bigram frequencies, respectively.",
        "We repeated our Web 1T bigrams experiment for several ratio thresholds between 0 and 0.9, and measured the changes in accuracy, precision and recall.",
        "Our results showed that frequency ratio thresholding can reduce false positives, leading to slightly increased precision for certain ratios.",
        "However, true positives are also reduced, and we sacrifice significant recall for only minor gains in precision.",
        "Candidate selection using bigrams is a somewhat naive approach, as it considers only the surface text without regard for the underlying grammatical relations (GRs) between terms.",
        "To illustrate, consider the example shown in Table 4.",
        "We observed that alternatives for 'lovely' such as 'picturesque' and 'scenic' were falsely rejected using BNC bigrams.",

        "of describing a family.",
        "However, in this context 'lovely' modifies 'holiday', not 'family': this distinction is not picked up using simple bigrams.",
        "To address this limitation, we extended our bigram candidate selection technique to consider grammatical relations (GRs).",
        "Our GR technique uses an input sentence in RASP format.",
        "We only change one term per sentence as before; however we first extract the term's GRs from the RASP annotation.",
        "We convert each binary GR into a GR-bigram using the original ordering of terms in the sentence.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the GRs for our example sentence, and how such translate into GR-bigrams.",
        "By converting GRs into bigrams, we can take advantage of Web 1T's extensive coverage.",
        "However, due to our restrictions on GR types, it is possible to obtain zero GR-bigrams for some words in a sentence.",

        "Note first that, while all methods increased the number of true positives and decreased false negatives, any performance gains were simply drowned out by the massive increases in false positives that occurred: this is the main cause of our low precision and recall.",
        "For the following discussion, we focus on the use of Web IT bigrams, which was the best performing filtering technique.",
        "Since false positives are the most important source of error to avoid in an ECA, we focus on these.",
        "We examined the false positive instances and categorised each error into the following four groups.",
        "The distribution of errors into these categories is shown in Table 6.",
        "A major limitation of the OVVT resource is that several of the alternative terms simply cause too much semantic change even when the correct sense of the original term is detected.",
        "For example, some alternatives for 'winner' are words such as 'sleeper', 'upsetter', and 'walloper'.",
        "In the context of the phrase \"Cash prizes will be offered to the winners\", we will almost always prefer the generic 'winner'.",
        "We suspect this limitation arises due to the methods used to construct the OVVTs; in particular the use of the WordNet hyponym and hypernym relations.",
        "For example, the 'thing' category in WordNet encompasses a multitude of more specific terms, such as 'ornament', 'structure', 'surface', and 'installation'.",
        "These terms all made their way into the OVVT for 'thing', yet they are rarely appropriate substitutions for 'thing'.",
        "Conversely, we may not wish to replace any specific terms with the more generic 'thing' as this removes too much meaning.",
        "As this kind of error accounted for almost half of our false positives, addressing this limitation may lead to significant gains in performance.",
        "This likely requires a more conservative approach to constructing the OVVTs themselves, e.g., by incorporating corpus-based information, as per (Guerini et al., 2008)'s approach to constructing the Modifier-OVVTs): the technique for mining appropriate verbadverb pairings from the BNC could be generalised to include other POS types.",
        "Related to the problem of semantic change is the idea of context-dependent semantics.",
        "For example, certain qualifiers have opposing effects depending on the appraisal of the subject: consider a \"long term illness\" compared to a \"long term vacation\".",
        "One possible solution to this problem is to modify the way valences are calculated to take into account which terms modify one another.",
        "The WSD approach used in our work adapted from (Guerini et al., 2008) is only a crude approximation to a complex problem; the WSD-related problems could at least be alleviated by incorporating a more sophisticated WSD approach into the pipeline.",

        "Our six subjects had no specialised knowledge of the task and were all native English speakers.",
        "Subjects were asked to judge the modified sentence for change in sentiment relative to the original according to the five shift categories described earlier (i.e., major/minor positive/negative/no shift).",
        "In order to avoid bias and to clarify the task, we explained that sentiment should be separated from changes in meaning, or the reader's opinions about the sentences.",
        "Instead, we urged subjects to ask themselves the question: \"Is the author of the second sentence saying what they're saying in a more positive or more negative way, compared to the first sentence?\"",
        "The sentences used were extracted from the BNC at random, using the restrictions listed above.",
        "We extracted 250 sentences to be used as the originals, each of which was used as input to our sentiment shifting system.",
        "For each original sentence, we produced all possible candidates using our best performing candidate selection method, Web 1T Bi-grams.",
        "We also limited our generation to changing one term per sentence, as to not produce a combinatorial explosion in the number of candidates generated.",
        "This produced approximately 3000 modified candidates, including several candidates with no sentiment shift.",
        "Upon inspection, we found many generated candidates contained the types of errors described above.",
        "Hence, we manually extracted original and modified sentences until we had a total of 50 originals, and 100 shifted sentences.",
        "In selecting which sentences to keep, we chose ones which sounded the most natural, or had the least amount of semantic change from the original.",
        "Manual selection was performed in order to prevent introducing any bias into judgements when a subject is confronted with a grammatically incorrect or unnatural sentence.",
        "We also aimed for a fairly even distribution of the shifted sentences into the five sentiment shift intervals.5.1 Results and analysis",
        "We performed a pairwise Kendall's Tau rank correlation (Kendall and Gibbons, 1962), which compares each human's judgements with the system's sentiment shift, for all 100 generated sentences.",
        "Kendall's Tau measures the correlation between two distributions on a scale of 1 to 1, with 1 indicating total agreement; 1 indicating total disagreement; and 0 indicating no (or random) correlation.",
        "We measured the correlation using the five sentiment shift intervals, and also using judgement polarities, i.e. whether a score is positive, negative or zero.",
        "We only report on polarity results as the finer-grained comparison showed similar results with slightly less correlation.",
        "Our results are shown in Table 7; Kendall's Tau correlations are shown above the shaded diagonal, while the corresponding p-values for statistical significance are shown below the diagonal.",
        "Kendall's Tau Correlation",
        "Although the correlation observed between inter-annotator judgements of polarity was fairly low, it is statistically significant in all cases using a confidence level of p < 0.05.",
        "While this indicates there was some agreement between human annotators, the relatively low correlation indicates that judging sentiment is a fairly subjective task.",
        "However, we saw no correlation between the human judgements and our system's representation of sentiment shift.",
        "The poor correlation between human and system polarities can possibly be attributed to a number of reasons.",
        "(Guerini et al., 2008) mention that in SentiWordNet, several of the WordNet synsets are valenced incorrectly, with many having a valence of zero, which we also observed in the OVVT resource.",
        "Our survey results suggest that SentiWordNet in its current form is not ideally suited to the task of generating sentiment in text using the Valentino method.",
        "SentiWordNet may be effective when classifying the sentiment of large texts; the valence scores can be considered to reflect the degree to which each word represents a sentiment \"feature\".",
        "However, it is somewhat unrealistic to assume that every term will have the same effect on sentiment in all contexts; assigning words a 'universal' sentiment score seems non-intuitive, and a finer-grained representation of sentiment is needed for short texts such as dialogue utterances.",
        "In sentiment generation, when choosing a replacement term from a set of alternatives, we are more interested in each candidate's effect on sentiment, relative to the other candidates.",
        "While a resource of semantically clustered terms is needed for this task (such as the OVVTs), terms within each cluster need to be ranked for sentiment in a localised way, taking account of positivity or negativity relative to other terms in the cluster.",
        "Upon inspection of several OVVTs, this ranking is a straightforward task for a human to perform (if time-consuming).",
        "However, the context of a substitution often determines its effects of sentiment.",
        "Hence, we argue that future work in sentiment generation using knowledge-based techniques should extend existing resources to encompass ranking of candidates in a contextual way, rather than ranking them statically out of context.",
        "For example, an MRE-style (Traum et al., 2003) approach could be used which goes beyond scoring the overall sentiment of an utterance, but considers how sentiment (or attitude) is directed towards agents, objects and events.",
