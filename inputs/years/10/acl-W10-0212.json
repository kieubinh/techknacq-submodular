        "As a first step towards developing an emotion analysis (EA) system simülating hüman emotional perception of text, it is important to research the natüre of the emotion analysis performed by hümans and examine whether they can reliably perform the task.",

        "The participants had to choose from a set of fifteen emotion categories, a significantly larger set than typically üsed in EA, and assign them to an ünrestricted range of text.",
        "To explore whether hüman annotators can reliably perform a task, inter-annotator agreement (IAA) (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) is the relevant measüre.",
        "This measüre can be calcülated between every two individüal annotations in order to find pairs or even teams of annotators whose strategies seem to be consistent and coherent enoügh so that they can be üsed fürther as the gold-standard annotation süited to train a machine learning approach for aütomatic EA analysis.",
        "A resülting EA system, capable of simülating hüman emotional perception of text, woüld be üsefül for information retrieval and many other fields.",
        "There are two main aspects of the resülting annotations to be researched.",
        "First, how consistently can people perceive and locate the emotional aspect of fairy tale texts?",
        "Second, how do they express their perception of text by means of annotation strategies?",
        "In the next sections, we address these qüestions and provide details of an experiment we condücted to empirically advance oür ünderstanding of the issües."

        "In oür case, the intended application of the EA system predominantly is emotion enhancement of hüman-compüter interaction, especially in virtüal or aügmented reality.",
        "Emotion enhancement of compüter animation, especially when it deals with spoken or written text, is primarily done throügh manüal annotation of text, even if a rich database of perceptüally güided animations for behavioral scripts compilation is available (Cünningham and Wallraven, 2009).",
        "The resülting system of oür project is meant to be a bridge between ünprocessed inpüt text (generated or provided) and visüal and aüditory information, coming from the virtüal character, like generated speech, facial expressions and body langüage.",

        "The labels received in these cases were either {positive, neutral} or {negative, neutral}.",

        "Due to this relative simplicity of the content, we expect the participants' emotional reactions to folk fairy tale texts to be more coherent than to other texts of fiction literature.",

        "The only positive emotion category salient for the The Poor Boy in the Grave story is compassion, which is also mostly triggered by sad events happening to a positive character.",
        "The emotional flow in the fairy tales is illustrated by the graph presented in Figure 4.",
        "In order to build it, we used the numerical evaluations obtained in the first part of the experiment and described in section 4.1.",
        "For each fairy tale text, each word token was mapped to the absolute value of the average numerical evaluation of its emotional categories assigned by all participants.",
        "The word tokens also received its relative position in the text, where the first word was at position 0.0 and the last at 1.0.",
        "Thus, the emotional trajectories of all texts were correlated despite the fact that their actual lengths differed.",

        "emotional trajectory reported by Alm and Sproat (2005).",
        "The emotional charge increases and falls steeply in the beginning of the fairy tale, then cycles though rise and fall phases (which do not exceed in their intensity the average rate of 0.6) and then ascents steeply at the end of the story.",
        "We agree with the explanation of such a trajectory, given by Propp and Dundes (1977) and also elaborated by Alm and Sproat (2005) – the first emotional intensity peak in the story line corresponds to the rising action, after the main characters have been introduced and the plot develops through a usually unexpected event.",
        "At the end of the story the intensity is highest, regardless whether the denouement is a happy ending or a tragedy.",
        "The fact that the fairy tale texts we chose for the experiment are relatively short is probably responsible for the steep peak of intensity in the very beginning of the story – the stories are too short to include a proper exposition.",
        "However, we need to investigate further how much of this is a property of texts themselves and how much – the perception (and thus annotation) of emotions."

        "The IAA scores were calculated using the emotion clusters information, for according to the results, participants would often stably use different emotions from same clusters at the same stretch of text.",
        "Four out of ten participants, two from each group (marked gray in Table 1), had very low IAA scores (k < 0.40 average per participant), a high proportion of unmarked text, and they used few emotion categories ( < 7 categories average per participant), so for the evaluation part their data was discarded.",
        "The final IAA evaluation was calculated on all the annotation pairs obtained from the six remaining participants (marked black in table 1), whose average agreement score in the original set of participants was originally higher than 0.50.",
        "The total number of annotation pairs amounted to 48: two texts annotated by all the six annotators, six texts annotated by three annotators for each of the two annotation sets.",
        "According to the interpretation of k by (Landis and Koch, 1977), the annotator agreement was moderate on average (0.53), and some pairs approached the almost perfect IAA rate (0.83).",
        "The IAA rates, calculated on the full set of fifteen emotions, without taking the emotion clusters into consideration, gave a moderate IAA rate on average (0.34) and reached substantial level (0.62) at maximum.",
        "The k rates are considerably high for the hard task and are comparable with the results presented in (Alm and Sproat, 2005).",
        "The word lists have a somewhat lower k IAA (0.45 on average, 0.72 at maximum), which is due to the low number of categories and the heavy bias towards the neutral category.",
        "The observed agreement on word lists is considerably high: 0.81 on average, reaching 0.91 at maximum.",
        "While our approach may seem very similar to the one of Alm (2005), there are some important differences.",
        "We gave the participants the freedom of using flexible annotation units, which allowed the annotators to define the source of emotion more precisely and mark several emotions in one sentence.",
        "In fact, in 39% of all annotated sentences represented a mixture of the neutral category and \"polarized\" categories, 20% of which included more than one \"polarized\" categories.",
        "Another difference is the rich set of emotion categories, with equal number of positive and negative items.",
        "The results show that people can successfully use the large set to express their emotional perception of text (e.g., see Figures 3 and 2).",
        "Other important findings include the fact that short phrases are the naturally preferred annotation unit among our participants and that the emotional trajectory of a general story line corresponds to the one proposed by Propp and Dundes (1977)."

        "In the near future, we will expand the collections of annotated text in order to compile a substantially large training corpus.",
        "We plan to work further with three annotators that have formed a natural team, since their group has always attained the highest annotation scores for their annotation set, exceeding the highest scores in the other annotation set.",
        "The task defined for the three annotators is similar to the experiment described in the paper, with several differences.",
        "For the corpus expansion we chose 85 stories by the Grimm Brothers 1400 - 4500 tokens long.",
        "We expect that longer texts have more potential space for an emotionally rich plot.",
        "Each text will be annotated by two people, the third annotator will tie-break disagreements by choosing the most appropriate of the conflicting categories, similar to the method described by (Alm and Sproat, 2005).",
        "It is also probable that a basic annotation unit will be defined and imposed on the annotators, for, as the studies discussed in Section 6 show, short phrases are a language unit most often naturally chosen by annotators.",
        "Each of the annotators will also work with a single word list, compiled from all texts and filtered for the most common stop-words.",
        "Each of the words on the word list should be annotated with its inherent polarity (positive, negative or neutral).",
        "Since each word on the list is free of its context, the lists provide valuable information about the word and its context interaction in full texts, which can be further used for machine learning architecture training.",
        "We also plan to keep the fifteen emotion categories and their clustering, since it gives the annotator more freedom of expression and simultaneously allows the researches to find the common cognitive ground behind the labels if they vary within one cluster",
        "8.2 Feature Extraction and Machine Learning Architecture Training",
        "When the corpus is large enough, the relevant features will be extracted automatically by means of existing NLP tools, followed by training a machine learning architecture, most probably TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2004), to map textual units to the emotion categories.",
        "It is yet to be determined which features to use, one compulsory parameter is that all the features should be available through automatic processing tools.",
        "This is crucial, since the resulting EA system has to be fully automated with no manual work involved.",
        "We also plan to collect data from other information sources, like video and audio recordings, by inviting amateur actors for storytelling sessions.",
        "This will allow emotion retrieval from the speech melody, facial expressions and body language.",
        "The manual annotation and the extra data sources can be aligned by means of Text and Speech Aligner (Rapp, 1995), which allows to track correspondences between them.",
        "This alignment would most certainly benefit the facial and body animation of the virtual characters, since there is no clear understanding of time correlation between emotions labeled in written text and the ones expressed through speech and facial clues in a story telling scenario.",
        "An EA system could also be perfected through a careful analysis of recorded speech and video of story telling sessions – regular recurrence of subjectivity of certain contexts will be even more significant if the transmission of the emotions from the story teller to the listener via mentioned information sources is successful."

        "In this paper, we reported on an experiment investigating the inter-annotator agreement levels which can be achieved by untrained human annotators performing emotion analysis of variable units of text.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at emotion analysis that operates on flexible, annotator defined units and uses a relatively rich inventory of emotion categories.",
        "We consider the resulting IAA rates to be high enough to accept the annotations as suitable for gold-standard corpus compilation in the frame of this research.",
        "As such, we view this work as the first step towards the development of a more complex EA system, which aims to simulate the actual human emotional perception of text."
