        "In this paper, a novel system for the automatic identification and conjugation of Spanish verb neologisms is presented.",
        "The paper describes a rule-based algorithm consisting of six steps which are taken to determine whether a new verb is regular or not, and to establish the rules that the verb should follow in its conjugation.",
        "The method was evaluated on 4,307 new verbs and its performance found to be satisfactory both for irregular and regular neologisms.",
        "The algorithm also contains extra rules to cater for verb neologisms in Spanish that do not exist as yet, but are inferred to be possible in light of existing cases of new verb creation in Spanish."

      "text": [
        "This paper presents a new method consisting of a set of modules which are implemented as part of a free online conjugator called Onoma.",
        "The novelty of this system lies in its ability to identify and conjugate existing verbs and potential new verbs in Spanish with a degree of coverage that cannot completely be achieved by other existing conjugators that are available.",
        "Other existing systems do not cope well with the productively rich word formation processes that apply to Spanish verbs and lead to complexities in their inflectional forms that can present irregularities.",
        "The operation of these processes mean that each Spanish verb can comprise 135 different forms, including compound verb forms.",
        "Onoma can be accessed at http://conjugador.onoma.es",
        "Several researchers have developed tools and methods related to Spanish verbs.",
        "These include morphological processors (Tzoukermann and Liber-man, 1990), (Santana et al., 1997), (Santana et al., 2002), semantic verb classification (Esteve Ferrer, 2004) or verb sense disambiguation (Lapata and Brew, 2004).",
        "Nevertheless, to our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to automatically identify, classify and conjugate new Spanish verbs.",
        "Our method identifies new and existing Spanish verbs and categorises them into seven classes: one class for regular verbs and six classes of irregular verbs depending on the type of the irregularity rule whose operation produced it.",
        "This algorithm is implemented by means of six modules or transducers which process each new infinitive form and classify the neologism.",
        "Once the new infinitive is classified, it is conjugated by the system using a set of high accuracy conjugation rules according to its class.",
        "One of the advantages of this procedure is that only very little information about the new infinitive form is required.",
        "The knowledge needed is exclusively of a formal kind.",
        "Extraction of this information relies on the implementation and use of two extra modules: one to detect Spanish syllables, and the other to split the verb into its root and morphological affixes.",
        "In cases where the neologism is not an infinitive form, but a conjugated one, the system generates a hypothetical infinitive form that the user can corroborate as a legitimate infinitive.",
        "Given that the transducers used in this system are easy to learn and remember, the method can be employed as a pedagogic tool itself by students of",
        "Spanish as a foreign language.",
        "It helps in the learning of the Spanish verb system since currently existing methods (e.g. (Puebla, 1995), (Gomis, 1998), (Mateo, 2008)) do not provide guidance on the question of whether verbs are regular or irregular.",
        "This is due to the fact that our method can identify the nature of any possible verb by reference only to its infinitive form.",
        "The application of other kinds of knowledge about the verb to this task are currently being investigated to deal with those rare cases in which reference to the infinitive form is insufficient for making this classification.",
        "This study first required an analysis of the existing verb paradigms used in dictionary construction (DRAE, 2001) followed by the detailed examination of new verbs' conjugations (Gomis, 1998), (Santana et al., 2002), (Mateo, 2008) compiled in a database created for that purpose.",
        "For the design of the algorithm, in order to validate the rules and patterns, an error-driven approach was taken.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents a description of the corpora used.",
        "In Section 3, the different word formation processes that apply to Spanish verbs are described, while Section 4 is devoted to the detailed description of the rules used by the system to classify the neologisms, which are evaluated in Section 5.",
        "Finally, in Section 6 we draw the conclusions.",
        "Two databases were used for the modeling process.",
        "The first (named the DRAE Verb Conjugation Database (DRAEVC-DB)) is composed of all the paradigms of the verbs contained in the 22nd edition of the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy (DRAE, 2001).",
        "This database contains 11,060 existing Spanish verbs and their respective conjugations.",
        "The second database (named the MolinoIdeas Verb Conjugation Database (MIVC-DB)), created for this purpose, contains 15,367 verbs.",
        "It includes all the verbs found in the DRAE database plus 4,307 conjugated Spanish verbs that are not registered in the Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary (DRAE, 2001), which are found in standard and colloquial Spanish and whose use is frequent on the web.",
        "The MIVC-DB contains completely conjugated verbs occurring in the Spanish Wikipedia and in a collection of 3 million journalistic articles from newspapers in Spanish from America and Spain.",
        "Verbs which do not occur in the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy (DRAE, 2001) are considered neologisms in this study.",
        "Thus 4,307 of the 15,367 verbs in the MIVC-DB are neologisms.",
        "The paradigms of the new verbs whose complete conjugation was not found in the sources were automatically computed and manually revised in order to ensure their accuracy.",
        "The result of this semiautomatic process is a database consisting only of attested Spanish verbs."

        "The creation of new verbs in Spanish is especially productive due to the rich possibilities of the diverse morphological schema that are applied to create neologisms (Almela, 1999).",
        "New Spanish verbs are derived by two means: either (1) morphological processes applied to existing words or (2) incorporating foreign verbs, such as digitalizar from to digitalize.",
        "Three morphological mechanisms can be distinguished: prefixation, suffixation and parasynthe-sis.",
        "Through prefixation a bound morpheme is attached to a previously existing verb.",
        "The most common prefixes used for new verbs found in our corpus are the following: a (abastillar), des- (de-sagrupar), inter (interactuar), pre (prefabricar), re (redecorar), sobre- (sobretasar), sub (subval-uar) and super (superdotar).",
        "On the other hand, the most frequent suffixes in Spanish new verbs are -ar (palar), ear (panear), -ificar (cronificar) and -izar (superficializar).",
        "Finally, parasynthesis occurs when the suffixes are added in combination with a prefix (bound morpheme).",
        "Although parasynthesis is rare in other grammatical classes, it is quite relevant in the creation of new Spanish verbs (Serrano, 1999).",
        "The most common prefixes are a or en in conjunction with the suffixes -ar, -ear, -ecer and -izar (acuchillear, enmarronar, enlanguidecer, aban-dalizar).",
        "In this paper, the term derivational base is used to denote the immediate constituent to which a morphological process is applied to form a verb.",
        "In order to obtain the derivational base, it is necessary to determine whether the last vowel of the base is stressed.",
        "When the vowel is unstressed, it is removed from the derivational base while a stressed vowel remains as part of the derivational base.",
        "If a consonant is the final letter of the derivational base it remains a part of it as well."

        "Broadly speaking, the algorithm is implemented by six transduction modules arranged in a switch structure.",
        "The operation of most of the transducers is simple, though Module 4 is implemented as a cascade of transduction modules in which inputs may potentially be further modified by subsequent modules (5 and 6).",
        "The modules were implemented to determine the class of each neologism.",
        "Depending on the class to which each verb belongs, a set of rules and patterns will be applied to create its inflected forms.",
        "The proposed verb taxonomy generated by these transducers is original and was developed in conjunction with the method itself.",
        "The group of patterns and rules which affect each verb are detailed in previous work (Basterrechea and Rello, 2010).",
        "The modules described below are activated when they receive as input an existing or new infinitive verb form.",
        "When the infinitive form is not changed by one transducer, it is tested against the next one.",
        "If not adjusted by any transducer, then the new infinitive verb is assumed to have a regular conjugation.",
        "Module 1: The first transducer checks whether the verb form is an auxiliary verb (haber), a copulative verb (ser or estar), a monosyllabic verb (ir, dar or ver), a Magnificent verb, or a prefixed form whose derivational base matches one of these aforementioned types of verbs.",
        "If the form matches one of these cases, the verb is irregular and will undergo the rules and patterns of its own class.",
        "(Basterrechea and Rello, 2010).",
        "Module 2: If the infinitive or prefixed infinitive form finishes in -quirir (adquirir) or belongs to the list: dormir, errar, morir, oler, erguir or desosar, the form is recognized as an irregular verb and will be conjugated using the irregularity rules which operate on the root vowel, which can be either diphthongized or replaced by another vowel (adquiero from adquirir, duermo and durmioi from dormir).",
        "Module 3: The third transducer identifies whether the infinitive form root ends in a vowel.",
        "If the verb belongs to the second or third conjugation (-er and -ir endings) (leer, oir), it is an irregular verb, while if the verb belongs to the first conjugation (-ar ending) then it will only be irregular if its root ends with an u or i (criar, actuar).",
        "For the verbs assigned to the first conjugation, diacritic transduction rules are applied to their inflected forms (crio from criar, actiuo from actuary, in the case of verbs assigned to the second and third conjugations, the alterations performed on their inflected forms are mainly additions or subtitutions of letters (leyo de leer, oigo de oir).",
        "There are some endings such as (-ier, -uer and -iir) which are not found in the MIVC-DB.",
        "In the hypothetical case where they are encountered, their conjugation would have followed the rules detailed earlier.",
        "Rules facilitating the conjugation of potential but non-existing verbs are included in the algorithm.",
        "Module 4: When an infinitive root form in the first conjugation ends in -c, -z, g or -gu (secar, trazar, delegar) and in the second and third conjugation ends in -c, -g, -gu or -qu (conocer, corregir, seguir), that verb is affected by consonantal orthographic adjustments (irregularity rules) in order to preserve its pronunciation (sequei from secar, tracei from trazar, deleguei from delegar, conozco from conocer, corrijo from corregir, sigo from seguir).",
        "In case the infinitive root form of the second and third conjugation ends in n or ll (tanner, engullir), the vowel i is removed from some endings of the paradigm following the pattern detailed in (Baster-rechea and Rello, 2010).",
        "Verbs undergoing transduction by Module 4 can undergo further modification by Modules 5 and 6.",
        "Any infinitive form which failed to meet the triggering conditions set by Modules 1-4 is also tested against 5 and 6.",
        "Module 5: This module focuses on determining the vowel of the infinitive form root and the verb's derivational base.",
        "If the vowel is e or o in the first conjugation and the verb derivational base includes diphthongs ie or ue (helar, contar), or if the vowel is e in the infinitive forms belonging to the second and third conjugation (servir, herir), then the verb is irregular and it is modified by the irregularity rules which perform either a substitution of this vowel (sirvo from servir) or a diphthongization (hielo from helar, cuento from contar or hiero from herir).",
        "Module 6: Finally, the existence of a diphthong in the infinitive root is examined (reunir, europeizar).",
        "If the infinitive matches the triggering condition for this transducer, its paradigm is considered irregular and the same irregularity rules from module 3 inserting a written accent in certain inflected forms-are applied (reUno from reunir, europeizo from eu-ropeizar).",
        "Any verb form that fails to meet the triggering conditions set by any of these six transducers has regular conjugation.",
        "It is assumed that these 6 modules cover the full range of both existing and potential verbs in Spanish.",
        "The modules' reliability was tested using the full paradigms of 15,367 verbs.",
        "As noted earlier, there are some irregularity rules in module 3 which predict the irregularities of non existing but possible neologisms in Spanish.",
        "Those rules, in conjunction with the rest of the modules, cover the recognition and conjugation of the potential new verbs."

        "The processing of these neologisms poses the added difficulty of their rich inflectional morphology which can be also irregular.",
        "Therefore, the automatic and accurate recognition and generation of new verbal paradigms is a substantial advance in neologism processing in Spanish.",
        "In future work we plan to create other algorithms to treat the rest of the open-class grammatical categories and to identify and generate inflections of new words not prescribed by dictionaries.",
