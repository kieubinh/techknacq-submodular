        "al., 2009) explains an approach for automatically generating Tamil lyrics, given a melody, which attempts to generate meaningful lyrics that match the melody.",
        "The existing approach (Ananth et.",
        "al., 2009) to automatically generate Tamil lyrics that match the given tune in ABC format (Gonzato, 2003) involves two steps.",
        "The first step is to analyze the input melody and output a series of possible syllable patterns in KNM representation scheme - a scheme for representing all words in the language, where, K stands for Kuril ((C)V, where V is a short vowel), N stands for Nedil ((C)V, where V is a long vowel) and M stands for Mei or Ottru (consonants) - that match the given melody, along with tentative word and sentence boundary.",
        "This melody analysis system was trained with sample film songs and their corresponding lyrics collected from the web.",
        "The tunes were converted to ABC Notation (Gonzato, 2003) and their lyrics were represented in KNM scheme.",
        "The trained model was then used to label the given input melody.",
        "The subsequent step uses a Sentence Generator module to generate lines that match the given syllable pattern with words satisfying the following constraints: a) Words should match the syllable pattern and b) The sequence of words should have a meaning.",
        "This was achieved by using n-Gram models learnt from a Tamil text corpus.",
        "Though the system manages to generate sentences that match the syllable pattern, it has the following limitations:",
        "1) When no words are found matching a given syllable pattern, alternate patterns that are close to the given pattern, as suggested by the Edit Distance Algorithm, are considered.",
        "This algorithm treats the syllable patterns as strings for finding close patterns and hence, can provide choices that do not agree with the input melody.",
        "2) The Sentence Generation is based on the n-Gram model learnt from a text corpus.",
        "This can result in sentences that do not have a coherent meaning.",

        "In the existing system, when no words are found matching the given syllable pattern (either due to a small corpus or rarity of the pattern), the closest patterns are considered as alternatives.",

        "For example, if the input sequence is given as \"NKN\" (long vowel short vowel - long vowel) and if no words are found matching NKN, closest matches for NKN are generated.",
        "Thus, if an edit distance of 1 is considered, the alternate pattern choices are \"KKN\", these syllable patterns can fit the original music notes.",
        "As an example, consider the Tamil word \"thA-ma-rai\" (lotus) that fits the pattern NKN.",
        "Suppose no words that match the pattern NKN was present in the corpus and other close patterns were opted for, we get:",
        "None of the above words can be used in the place of \"thA-ma-rai\", a good fit for a NKN pattern, as they don't phonetically match (except for a close-but-not-exact \"kO-sA-lai\") and hence cannot be used as part of the lyric without affecting the intended melody.",
        "The Sentence Generation algorithm was based on the n-Gram model built from a text corpus.",
        "Given that n-Gram based generation schemes have inbuilt bias towards shorter strings, it can end-up generating meaningless and ungrammatical sentences.",
        "As observed in (Ananth et.al., 2009), we can get sentences such as:",
        "3< q] ear rj)i_rj>gii Qj audit or (* avan-He-3sm nadandhu-walk sendrAlY-3sf) (He reached by walking)",
        "Here, the subject avan (He), which is a 3rd person, singular, masculine noun, does not agree with the verb sendrAlY , which is 3rd person, singular, feminine.",
        "Thus, the noun and the verb do not agree on the gender.",

        "Though performing a joint probability across words would help in reducing such errors, it would slow down the generation process.",
        "In addition to the above ungrammatical generation problem, the system can also generate meaningless sentences.",

        "These longest-matching basic asai patterns are expanded to represent non-monosyllabic words, but for our needs, we use these two basic asai patterns for the new representation scheme.",
