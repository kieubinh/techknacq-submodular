        "The paper presented a preliminary work aimed at representing storytelling knowledge in SUMO and using Sigma as inference engine to assist the planner in generating story plans.",
        "Further work focuses on modeling the emotional state of the character as a result of some event (e.g., feeling worried, guilty or scared due to causing some problems in the world state), changes in character traits as the story progresses (e.g., from negative trait to positive trait as the story flows from rule violation to value acquisition), and enhancing the representation for story themes.",
        "Once a set of knowledge has been developed, these should be evaluated systematically through validation of the rules for logical consistency with the theorem prover.",
        "A future goal is to apply the metrics proposed by Callaway & Lester (2002) in StoryBook to evaluate with actual users if the generated stories are better and more varied as compared to that of Picture Books.",
        "Although SUMO is quite capable of representing time and sequences, reasoning with temporally qualified expression is challenging for any theorem prover.",
        "The works of (Sutcliffe et al., 2009) to extend the inference engine to handle reasoning over temporal relations should be explored further to allow SUMOs to generate story plans that consider temporal relations between actions and events.",
        "Finally, story generators will benefit its readers if the generated stories are narrated orally.",
        "SUMOs can be explored further to model various emotions to provide annotations in the surface story text which will then be fed to a text to speech tool for speech generation."
