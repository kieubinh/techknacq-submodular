        "In Technical Documentation, Authoring Tools are used to maintain a consistent text quality – especially with regard to the often followed translation of the original documents into several languages using a Translation Memory System.",
        "Hitherto these tools have often been used separately one after the other.",
        "Additionally Authoring tools often have no linguistic intelligence and thus the quality level of the automated checks is very poor.",
        "In this paper I will describe the integration of a linguistically intelligent Authoring Tool into a Translation Memory System, thereby combining linguistic intelligence with the advantages of both systems in a single environment.",
        "The system allows you not only the use of common authoring aids (spell, grammar and style checker) in source and target language – by using a single environment the terminology database of the Translation Memory System can be used by the authoring aid to control terminology both in the source and target document.",
        "Moreover, the linguistically intelligent Authoring Tool enables automatic extraction of term candidates from existing documents directly to the terminology database of the Translation Memory System."

      "text": [
        "The benefit of Authoring Tools, especially in the area of Technical Documentation, is beyond debate (cf. Brockmann, 1997, Huijsen, 1998, Nyberg et al., 2003, Spyridakis et al., 1997).",
        "Combined with linguistic intelligence besides spell and grammar checking Authoring Tools are used to check terminology, style, and abbreviations in texts (cf. Bredenkamp et al., 2000, Carl et al., 2002b, Haller 2000, Reuther and Wigger, 2000).",
        "In most cases this is done in relation to special style guides and terminology, both given by the respective company 1995).",
        "Due to the fact that Authoring Aids are mostly used as a single application, style rules and terminology are kept and maintained in a special database together with the application.",
        "Moreover linguistically intelligent Authoring Aids also help the author to extract terminology candidates.",
        "Subsequently, where required, these candidates can be directly imported into the stored terminology.",
        "To enable this function it is also necessary to have the terminology database integrated in the application.",
        "When translating technical documents it has for many years been common practice to use Translation Memory Systems to improve the consistency of translations.",
        "Translation Memory Systems store whole sentences or clauses (segments) and their translations in a multi-language translation memory.",
        "When the translator is translating a new document the segments are matched against those already present in the translation memory.",
        "This is done with the help of a fuzzy match algorithm, which calculates the degree of similarity between the current source segment and matching source segments from the translation memory.",
        "The degree of similarity is expressed as a percentage value (100% match means identical match).",
        "The matches are afterwards presented in descending order and the translator can paste them into the new translation.",
        "Besides the translation memory most of the Translation Memory Systems also have an integrated terminology database.",
        "On the basis of this database the system is able to suggest translations of single terms even when there is no match on sentence or clause level.",
        "The matching of terms is also done with fuzzy matching algorithms.",
        "Therefore related as well as identical terms are found in the database.",
        "With this function the Translation Memory System offers to some extent a feature similar to the Authoring Tools mentioned above.",
        "Yet the quality of the feature implemented in Translation Memory Systems is not the same due to the fact that in most cases this feature in Translation Memory Systems works without linguistic intelligence.",
        "When using both tools, the Authoring Tool as well as the Translation Memory System as a single application, the main problem becomes immediately apparent: the double terminology database.",
        "Two terminology databases – Authoring Tool and Translation Memory System – , which have to be maintained in different applications, mean a lot of redundant work.",
        "The other possibility – regular synchronizing of the databases – is very difficult, because it is not clear, which of the databases is the core database.",
        "Generally speaking, the author manually enters new terms in the context of translations into the terminology database of the Translation Memory System, whereas the results of automatic term extractions are stored in the terminology database of the Authoring Tool.",
        "In the following I will present a system where the Authoring Tool is directly integrated in the Translation Memory workflow, thus allowing the handling of terminology in only one core database.",
        "It is the integration of CLAT (Controlled Language Authoring Tool) into the Across Translation Memory System – the crossAuthor Linguistic."

        "For the understanding of the system and how the particular components work together it is necessary to begin with a description of the underlying modules.",
        "The system consists mainly of three modules: the CLAT/UMMT software package, the Across Language Server and the crossAuthor / crossAuthor Linguistic add-on.",
        "CLAT/UMMT is a software package from the IAI (Institut der Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Angewandten Informationsforschung an der Universität des Saarlandes – Institute of the Society for the Promotion of Applied Information Sciences at Saarland University).",
        "CLAT is a tool designed to support technical authors in producing high-quality documentation (e.g., according to specific standards (cf. DIN ISO 12620, 1999, Herzog and Mühlbauer, 2007)).",
        "This is reached through linguistic correctness and compliance with company-specific requirements.",
        "CLAT offers",
        "• spell and grammar checking to verify linguistic correctness",
        "• style and terminology checking to verify compliance with company-specific writing guidelines",
        "The CLAT spelling checker elicits incorrectly spelt or unknown words (e.g., proplusion).",
        "Besides that the CLAT spelling checker can also be used to check British versus American English (e.g., organise vs. organize).",
        "The CLAT grammar checker elicits grammatically incorrect sentences or parts of sentences (e.g., He come).",
        "In addition, typography errors that involve more than one word or character are also detected.",
        "Stylistic weaknesses in terms of clarity, understandability, and stylistic appropriateness of sentences or parts of sentences are corrected by the CLAT style checker.",
        "Especially complexity issues (e.g., too many uses of and and or), ambiguity issues (e.g., indefinite or anaphoric expressions, such as it, they, these, those), as well as stylistic problems (e.g., contracted forms such as they've) are detected.",
        "Typically this is done on the basis of company-specific writing rules.",
        "Finally, the CLAT terminology checker elicits variants of preferred terms, as well as deprecated terms and admitted terms.",
        "When the terminology checker finds a deprecated term in the text, a message is displayed with the corresponding preferred term (e.g., electric engine – deprecated term, electric motor – preferred term) for correction.",
        "In addition to the four standard checking functions CLAT also offers a function for eliciting term candidates.",
        "This function is not a checking function in the sense that it finds linguistic errors or weaknesses.",
        "Rather, it supports the terminology workflow of a company.",
        "Nouns that have the properties typical of terms and have not been found during the check in the database, either as correctly used terms or variants or deprecated terms, are listed in a separate display window together with the context they occurred in.",
        "The author then has the possibility to decide whether any of the term candidates should be included in the terminology of the respective company.",
        "CLAT checks documents with regard to the control functions mentioned above, reports every rule violation and gives technical authors the opportunity to revise their text and immediately recheck the corrections made.",
        "CLAT offers an additional function for working in editors that support tags (e.g., FrameMaker).",
        "This function, a context-sensitive search, enables the individual processing of individual tags.",
        "With the help of a DTD that must be created especially for CLAT, the CLAT server can process tags differently and ignore their contents entirely or only for individual style rules.",

        "All CLAT checks are based on a linguistic analysis of the text document.",
        "The linguistic analysis consists of several steps that are described in the following:",
        "• separating linguistic from non-linguistic data",
        "• recognizing word boundaries",
        "• analysing word forms: morphological analysis",
        "• determining part of speech: grammatical analysis",
        "The CLAT system consists of a CLAT server and CLAT Clients.",
        "CLAT Clients are user interfaces that are either standalone (Java CLAT Client) or they are CLAT-Ins that are plugged into an existing word processing program.",
        "The CLAT server handles the communication between the CLAT Clients and the Linguistic Engine.",
        "The Linguistic Engine is the core part of the CLAT system.",
        "It performs the linguistic analysis and the CLAT checks.",
        "The main component of the Linguistic Engine is the program MPRO for the morphological and syntactic analysis of the given text.",
        "For further details on MPRO see Maas et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Due to the Linguistic Engine the quality level of the CLAT checks is very high, e.g. the morphological analysis enables CLAT to elicit morphological word form variants such as electrical battery as a variant of electric battery.",
        "Moreover due to the linguistic intelligence CLAT is able to detect even word order variants such as source of propulsion power as a variant of propulsion power source.",
        "These variants are found using complex methods of linguistic abstraction and do not need to be explicitly named in the terminological database (cf. Carl et al., 2002a, Hong et al., 2001, Thurmair, 2003).",
        "Another system component of CLAT is UMMT (Utility for Mandate Management Tasks).",
