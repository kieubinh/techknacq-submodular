        "Proofing technologies for L2 writers have been of interest to the NLP community since the 1970s, and have been subject to critical evaluation since the early 80s (e.g., Frase et al., 1981, Dobrin, 1985).",
        "In spite of continued interest in this area (e.g. Vernon, 2000; Foster and Vogel, 2004; Yi et al., 2008; Bender, 2009), computational linguists themselves remain disappointed with the lack of ongoing development of commercially available systems (Wampler, 2002).",
        "A more serious problem, from the view of applied linguists, is that enthusiasm for the technology has often resulted in a purely operational approach.",
        "The focus on algorithmic solutions to the correction of ill-formed input has frequently overlooked the long-term pedagogical needs of L2 novice writers.",
        "The parsing techniques of grammar checkers may reliably flag a subset of L2 errors; however, there is some question as to whether automatically generated prescriptive advice, even when it is reliable, actually helps learner language evolve (Bolt, 1992; Chen, 1997).",
        "While machine-generated error identification and correction may be a desirable convenience for casual writers, explicit correction by a machine, or for that matter, a human tutor, appears to be counterproductive in the development of an L2 writer's proficiency (Truscott, 1996; Ferris and",
        "Hedgcock, 2005).",
        "The goal of the project described here is to develop a suite of tools that will help novice writers who are learning to write in academic or professional contexts improve the accuracy and fluency of their texts, while also becoming more confident in their long-term command of English.",
        "We have developed companion tools to help teachers of writing improve the efficiency and reliability of their feedback, and move L2 novice writers toward lifelong independence.",

        "Most grammar checking programs use some form of parsing to identify errors.",
        "Typically, if a sentence is ungrammatical according to a set of parsing rules, the programs attempt alternate analysis.",
        "However, the unconstrained text of L2 learners is difficult to parse.",
        "Even more demanding is the ability of software (or, very often, human tutors) to suggest a 'correct' version that reflects the writer's intention.",
        "This requires semantic disambiguation well beyond our current ontology or technology.",
        "The difficulties in parsing natural language are compounded in the case of interlanguage (Schneider and McCoy, 1998).",
        "Parsers generally are based on theoretical models of how grammatical sentences of the target language should be constructed.",
        "This approach is especially ineffective for cases where the speakers' first language is linguistically remote from the target language.",
        "For example, the current version of the parser-based grammar checker in Microsoft Word sacrifices a low rate of recall for a relatively high rate of precision in the analysis of Chinese speakers' English texts.",
        "That is, it displays few flagged errors compared to the total number of errors actually occurring in a text, a necessary trade-off resulting from the need to reduce distracting false positives.",
        "This is understandable since the rates of recall and precision for various grammatical constituents are inconsistent, and the numbers of false positives are not easily reduced across all types of grammatical constructions.",
        "The insufficient, but nevertheless often still inaccurate, and frequently non-existent, advice of these programs is easily demonstrated.",

        "These errors are typical examples of learners' attempts to map Chinese syntax on English constructions (treating 'worth', which functions here as a preposition, as a verb, forcing the passive verb 'born' into an active construction, and blending the verbs 'be' and 'have' into one form, as their equivalents are in Chinese).",
        "The first comment is unhelpful; all options in the second set of suggestions are, bizarrely, further from Standard English than the student's original text, and the third sentence passes without comment.",
        "In addition to its general unreliability for L2 writers, grammar/style-checking software has been censured for giving overly narrow and prescriptive advice (Pennington, 1992), for compounding the already constrained nature of L2 production (Chapelle, 2001) and for otherwise abusing the tenets of good pedagogy (McGee and Ericsson, 2002).",
        "Even if the reliability of parsing technology can be significantly enhanced, much of the composition research of the last fifty years has argued against imposing corrections on the texts of novice writers.",
        "Current theories of language pedagogy promote learner independence and discourage direct correction by tutors.",
        "In light of the limitations of writing software, reliance on a deus ex machina for correction is hardly a desirable alternative to dependence on a language tutor.",
        "A more principled, and ultimately more valid, role for language tools in supporting L2 novice writers is to enable them to test their evolving hypotheses of the L2.",

        "The role of the software, and of the human tutor, is to assist the writer express meaning in an acceptable manner, rather than explicitly to interpret the writer's text.",

        "The program 'Check My Words' (Figure 2) gives L2 novice writers access to interactive explanations of common structural and lexical errors from an Internet grammar as they write.",
        "These explanations are based on an analysis of a large L2 corpus consisting of millions of words of the writing of Chinese speakers, from which a typology of misused, and blatantly underused or overused lexical and structural patterns, was extracted (e.g., Milton, 2001).",
        "Hundreds of problematic words and patterns in a learner's text are explained.",
        "This is the kind of didactic, deductive advice that a good textbook might provide, except that there are few textbooks targeted directly at the EFL learning difficulties of speakers of particular L1s, and this internet grammar is embellished with interactive multimedia: it is fun to use.",
        "Secondly, the program enables learners to discover how the language they are struggling to use is formulated in relevant, professionally written texts.",
        "They have a choice of search engines that they can use to look up words in context.",
        "Together, these search engines address many of the problems learners encounter in choosing words, forms and constructions.",
        "This inductive, procedural access to writing models, combined with the feedback tutors can provide via companion tools, greatly increases the amount of positive and negative evidence about the L2 available to the novice writer – support that researchers of applied linguistics believe promotes language acquisition (e.g., Trahey and White, 1993, Doughty and Varela, 1998).",
        "In addition to helping learners become more confident, responsible, and independent in selecting language that is both accurate and appropriate to their purposes, this approach helps relieve language tutors of the need to act as proofreading slaves.",
        "When learners are given the tools to attend to form, taught how to use the tools, and held accountable for their own progress, teachers can share more of the burden of responsibility for learning with their students.",
