        "Writing is fundamentally complex.",
        "Writers must simultaneously consider a constellation of factors during composition, including writing task requirements, knowledge of audience, domain knowledge, language usage, and tone (Hayes and Flower, 1981).",
        "Furthermore, effective writing involves sophisticated higher-order cognitive skills, such as synthesis of ideas, critical thinking, and self-regulation.",
        "Text genres, such as narrative or expository texts, also introduce distinct requirements and conventions (Hayes and Flower, 1981).",
        "Because writing itself is complex, learning to write poses significant challenges for students.",
        "The central role of writing in communication, knowledge organization, and sensemaking points to the need to devise methods and tools with which writing skills can be effectively taught and learned (Graham, 2006).",
        "Intelligent tutoring systems (VanLehn, 2006) offer a promising means for delivering tailored writing support to students.",
        "However, developing intelligent tutors to scaffold student writing poses a number of technical and pedagogical hurdles.",
        "Texts written by novice writers are likely to exhibit significant variation in grammar, cohesion, coherence, and content quality; these characteristics are likely to be problematic for analysis by current natural language processing tools.",
        "Furthermore, students' individual differences in language arts skills, writing self-efficacy, domain knowledge, and motivation can have pedagogical implications.",
        "An effective intelligent writing tutor must do more than just parse and understand student texts; it must also provide tailored feedback that fosters effective writing processes and enhances student motivation for writing.",
        "This paper explores several key questions for the design of intelligent composition support tools for novice writers.",
        "First, it investigates the performance of current syntactic parsing tools on a corpus of narrative texts written by middle grade students during interactions in a narrative composition support environment.",
        "A narrative composition support environment aims to support the principal processes of writing, such as planning, revision, and text production.",
        "The second question the paper explores is how middle school students' language art skills affect the cohesion and coherence of texts produced during interactions with a narrative composition support environment.",
        "Third, the paper investigates how middle school students' language art skills affect their writing processes during interactions in a narrative composition support environment.",
        "Studying the interactions between the environment's support mechanisms and students' individual differences provides insights into the affordances and limitations of novices' writing abilities, as well as implications for the design of intelligent tutors for narrative writing.",
        "The study presented here investigates novice writers' composition processes during interactions with a narrative composition support environment.",
        "In the study, 127 middle grade students interacted with the Narrative Theatre fable composition support environment.",
        "The Narrative Theatre uses a multimedia interface to guide students as they select key elements of their fable (e.g., moral, setting, characters), prompts students through an explicit, timed story planning process, and allows students to review their earlier planning decisions at any point during writing of the main text.",
        "Students' literacy ratings and log data from interactions with the Narrative Theatre environment are analyzed to investigate the differences between high-and low-skill students and their practice of key composition processes in the Narrative Theatre environment, including planning, text production, and revision.",
        "Coh-Metrix (Graesser et al., 2004) was also used to analyze the cohesion and coherence characteristics of the students' fables.",

        "Since Hayes and Flower first proposed their seminal model of writing nearly thirty years ago (1981), a rich body of work has investigated the cognitive functions supporting written composition.",
        "Foundational results are now in place on the core processes of writing, including idea generation (Galbraith et al., 2009), text production (Berninger et al., 2002), and revision (McCutchen et al., 1997).",
        "Furthermore, a detailed account of the composition process has begun to emerge across a range of writing experience levels (Graham et al., 2002) and text genres (Langer, 1985).",
        "Particularly important for the design of composition support tools for novices is the emergence of a consensus account of the characteristics of novice writers' narrative composition processes.",
        "Empirical studies have suggested that notable differences exist between novice and expert writers, such as novices' use of knowledge-telling practices versus experts' use of knowledgetransformation practices during text production (Bereiter and Scardamalia, 1987).",
        "However, it has been argued that even novice writers can employ high-level knowledge-transformation processes when situated within an appropriate task environment with effective writing scaffolds (Cameron and Moshenko, 1996).",
        "Other work has found that students' domain and linguistic knowledge influences the coherence and quality of their expository writings (DeGroff, 1987).",
        "These findings underscore the importance of investigating methods for effective and engaging writing instruction targeted at novice writers, as well as automated tools to tailor feedback and scaffolding to individual students.",
        "In addition to grounding their work in the writing research literature, designers of composition support tools will likely need to avail themselves of the full gamut of natural language processing techniques to analyze students' texts with regard to syntax, semantics, and discourse.",
        "However, in texts produced by novice writers, grammatical errors and incoherent discourse abound, which may present serious challenges for natural language processing since the majority of current NLP tools have been developed for well-formed texts.",
        "While existing NLP tools have been successfully used in writing support systems designed for expert writers (Mahlow and Piotrowski, 2009), common structural issues in novice compositions are likely to prove problematic for current tools.",
        "However, recent work has begun to explore techniques for handling ill-formed texts that are similar to those produced by novice writers.",
        "For example, Gamon et al.",
        "conducted a word-level analysis of texts written by non-native English speakers (2008).",
        "Focusing on two types of errors (determiners and prepositions), they use decision-tree classifiers in combination with a language model trained on a large English corpus to detect and correct erroneous selection of words.",
        "Wagner et al.",
        "investigated the detection of grammatical mal-formedness of individual sentences (2007).",
        "They found it effective to combine a shallow approach that uses n-grams and a deep approach that uses syntactic parse results.",
        "Higgins et al.",
        "explored the overall coherence of texts written by students (2004).",
        "Using support vector machines, their system identified the portions of text that resulted in coherence breakdowns with regard to relatedness to the essay question and relatedness between discourse elements.",
        "To date, a relatively small number of intelligent tutoring systems have been developed to support student learning in the language arts, and even fewer have sought to specifically address writing.",
        "Sourcer's Apprentice is a web-based learning environment to help high school students gather, evaluate, and integrate information for writing essays about history topics (Britt et al., 2004), although Sourcer's Apprentice did not seek to apply NLP tools to understand or scaffold students' compositions directly.",
        "Other work on intelligent tutoring for language arts, such as Project LISTEN (Mo-stow and Aist, 2001) and REAP (Heilman et al., 2007), has addressed vocabulary learning and reading comprehension."

        "During the planning phase, students select a moral, a setting, a cast of characters, and a set of objects for the story they will create.",
        "The system provides nine different morals, four settings, ten characters, and twenty objects from which students may choose.",
        "Each setting is accompanied by a visual representation, which can be enlarged by clicking on the image to highlight salient features of the setting.",
        "Characters and objects are also visually represented by static graphics, which were designed to be neutral in gender and expression in order to allow students creative choice when filling narrative roles with the characters.",

        "The students ranged in age from 10 to 13.",
        "Approximately 38% of the students were Caucasian, 27% African-American, 17% Hispanic or Latino, 6% Asian, 2% American Indian, and the remaining 10% were of mixed or other descent.",
        "Students participated as part of their Language Arts class.",
        "The study spanned two days for each student involved.",
        "On the first day, the students were seated at a computer and asked to fill out a pre-experiment questionnaire, which required approximately twenty minutes.",
        "On the second day, the students were again assigned to a computer.",
        "They were presented with the NARRATIVE THEATRE interface, which asked them to enter a unique identification number.",
        "Once correctly entered, the students were presented with a short instructional video that described the features and operation of the interface.",
        "They were given fifteen minutes to complete the planning activity, which included choosing a setting, main characters, props, and deciding the beginning, middle, and end of their story.",
        "Once planning was completed, or time ran out, the students were given another thirty-five minutes to write their fable.",

        "For the purpose of this work, a pause is defined as a keystroke made five or more seconds after the preceding keystroke.",
        "Keystroke pauses were categorized as either an appendage or a revision, depending on whether they occurred before the tail end of the passage (revision) or after the tail end (appendage).",

        "The performance of the two parsers differed widely.",
        "The Stanford Parser was able to parse over 90% of fables, but the Link Grammar Parser was only successful for about 40% of the fables.",
        "While parser failure is not always indicative of poor grammaticality, every sentence that failed on the Stanford Parser contained either misspelled words or run-on sentences.",
        "Many of these were indicated by errors in the sentence segmentation as well.",
        "There were also indications that students' language arts skills may influence the grammaticality of their written sentences; significant effects of reading level were found on both the Stanford Parser's success rate and the Link parser's success rate.",
        "The fact that below-grade level students constituted a considerable proportion of the study's student population suggests that pedagogical writing support tools should be capable of handling the variations inherent in students' writings, and leverage natural language processing results to inform tutorial feedback.",
        "Paragraph-to-paragraph LSA scores tended to increase with reading level.",
        "This has implications for semantic cohesion (Graessar, 2004) and indicates that students with a higher reading assessment score produce stories that satisfy this particular dimension of cohesion.",
        "However, the converse was true for the Coh-Metrix measure of causal cohesion, where above-grade level students actually produced the lowest cohesion scores.",
        "One possible explanation could stem from differences in vocabulary skills between above-and below-grade level students; students who exercise a larger vocabulary may be penalized by Coh-Metrix's cohesion metric.",
        "Alternatively, the result may be related to the fact that below-grade level students tend to produce less text (Graessar, 2004).",
        "Clearly, students' individual differences in language arts ability affect the cohesiveness of the texts they write, but additional investigation is necessary to develop a clear understanding of the relationship between cohesion and language arts ability, as well as the implications for tailoring tutoring.",
        "With regard to the writing process, the average length per revision was significantly greater for students of higher reading skill-levels.",
        "There is a possibility that this may be associated with more elaborate revision processes, which requires further investigation.",
        "It should be noted that the revision finding was more salient for the planning stage of Narrative Theatre interactions.",
        "This result may also indicate that below-grade level readers were somewhat less thorough when planning their fables.",
        "Further, differences in mouseover behavior were found across reading levels, apparently indicating a decline in the rate of mouseovers as reading level increased.",
        "This finding may be the result of below-grade level students experiencing difficulties in idea generation, or a lack of motivation.",
        "Finally, the number of pauses prior to revision was found to decrease as reading level increased.",
        "This result may point to difficulties with text production for lower language arts skill students.",
        "Difficulty translating ideas into text may point to a need for intelligent writing tutors to help reduce lower reading level students' cognitive load during writing."

        "We have presented a study conducted with middle grade students to investigate the process and products of writing in a narrative composition support environment.",
        "The study found significant variations in syntactic parser performance associated with students' language arts abilities, as well as relationships between students' reading level and the grammaticality of their writing.",
        "For example, the stories of below-grade readers had a lower level of semantic cohesion than at-grade level readers, but surprisingly, above-grade level students' writings exhibited lower causal cohesion than both at-grade and below-grade level students.",
        "Reading level had a significant effect on time spent in the planning phase, and below-grade level readers spent more time composing fables than at-grade level readers.",
        "There were also gender differences, with females spending less time in both the planning and writing phases.",
        "There were also differences with respect to revision, with above-grade readers revising more than below-grade readers.",
        "The study highlights important issues about how to design composition support tools.",
        "Composition support tools that are sensitive to students' individual writing abilities seem likely to be most effective.",
        "Natural language processing is critical for analyzing students' texts and informing the content of adaptive tutorial feedback.",
        "Intelligent writing tutors should utilize natural language processing techniques that can robustly handle the variations in students' writings, and deliver tailored scaffolding informed by analyses of students' texts and writing processes.",
        "The findings suggest that several directions exist for future work.",
        "Additional analysis is necessary to investigate the correctness of syntactic parses.",
        "Further investigation of students' individual differences in writing at the discourse and narrative levels is also necessary.",
        "Results from these analyses should then be used to inform the design of techniques for adaptive tutorial feedback in narrative composition support environments."
