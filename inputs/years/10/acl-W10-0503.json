        "Social Network Service (SNS) and personal blogs have become the most popular platform for online communication and sharing information.",
        "However because most modern computer keyboards are Latin-based, Asian language speakers (such as Chinese) has to rely on a input system which accepts Romanisation of the characters and convert them into characters or words in that language.",
        "In Chinese this form of Romanisation (usually called Pinyin) is highly ambiguous, word misuses often occur because the user choose a wrong candidate or deliverately substitute the word with another character string that has the identical Romanisation to convey certain semantics, or to achieve a sarcasm effect.",
        "In this paper we aim to develop a system that can automatically identify such word misuse, and suggest the correct word to be used."

        "A certain kind of derogatory opinion is being conveyed in Chinese chat forums and SNS sites through the use of Chinese Hanzi (hieroglyphic) characters.",
        "There is potential for this to happen whenever two expressions are pronounced in a similar way in Chinese.",
        "For exmaple, irate readers have used (\"Ji Zhe\") for \"id #\" (\"Ji Zhe\").",
        "While \"id #\" means reporter or journalist, \"M #\" can be interpreted as prostitute.",
        "There are 5000 commonly used characters.",
        "While the number of distinct Pinyin (toneless) is only 412.",
        "Therefore Pinyin to character conversion is highly ambigurous and is a active research topic (Zhou et al., 2007), (Lin and Zhang, 2008), (Chen and Lee, 2000).",
        "On the other hand, automatic Pinyin generation is considered a solved task, (Liu and",
        "Guthrie, 2009) shows that using the most frequent Pinyin approach to assign Pinyin to each character can achieve 98% accuracy.",
        "In fact, we test on the Gi-gaword Chinese (Verson 2) corpus and find out that only about 15% of the characters have ambigurous Pinyin."

        "We divided the detection process into three steps as below:",
        "• Segmentation: Given a piece of Chinese text, we first feed it into an automatic word segmenter (Zhang et al., 2003) to break the text into semantic units.",
        "Because we consider only multiple-character anomaly cases, anomalies can only be contained within sequences of single characters.",
        "• Character sequence extraction: After segmentation, we are interested in sequences of single characters, because anomalies will occur only within those sequences.",
        "Once we obtain these sequences, we generate all possible substrings for each sequence because any anomalous words can be part of a character sequence.",
        "• Detection: We assume the anomaly shares many phonetic similarities with the \"true\" word.",
        "As a result we need a method for comparing pronunciations of two character sequences.",
        "Here we use the Pinyin to represent phonetics of a Chinese character, and we define two pronunciations to be similar when they both have identical Pinyin (not including the tone).",
        "We use character-to-pinyin conversion tool to create a Pinyin-to-Word hash table using the machine-segmented Chinese Gigaword",

        "2.",
        "Once we have the resources, we first produce all possible Pinyin sequences of each character sequence.Next we do a Pinyin-word look up in the hash table we created; if there exists any entries, we know that the Pinyin sequence maps to one or more 'real' words.",
        "Consequently, we consider any character sequences whose Pinyin maps to these words to be possible anomalies."

        "We evaluate our identification/correction performance using standard measures of standard precision and recall.",
        "We tested our performance using bigram thresholds of 0, 1 and 2.",
        "The initial experiments showed that our method can successfully identify and correct the three examples of non-word anomalies with reasonable precision and recall.",
        "The method obtains 100% recall however it generates a lot of false positives; this can be seen in a relatively low precision of 60%.",
        "In summary, our method is successful at identifying genuine anomalous non-word character sequences; however the method also retrieves some false positives, due to the highly ambiguous Pinyin to word mappings."
