        "Social media in general exhibit a rich variety of information sources.",
        "Question answering (QA) has been particularly amenable to social media, as it allows a potentially more effective alternative to web search by directly connecting users with the information needs to users willing to share the information directly (Bian, 2008).",
        "One of the useful by-products of this process is the resulting large archives of data - which in turn could be good sources of information for automatic question answering.",
        "Yahoo!",
        "Answers, as a collaborative QA system (CQA), has acquired an archive of more than 40 Million Questions and 500 Million answers, as of 2008 estimates.",
        "The main premise of this paper is that there are many questions that are syntactically different while semantically similar.",
        "The key problem is how to identify such question groups.",
        "Our method is based on the key observation that when the best non-trivial answers chosen by asker in the same domain are exactly the same, the corresponding questions are semantically similar.",
        "Based on this observation, we propose answering new method for learning question equivalence patterns from CQA archives.",
        "First, we retrieve \"equivalent\" question groups from a large dataset by grouping them by the text of the best answers (as chosen by the askers).",
        "The equivalence patterns are then generated by learning common syntactic and lexical patterns for each group.",
        "To avoid generating patterns from questions that were grouped together by chance, we estimate the group's topic diversity to filter the candidate patterns.",
        "These equivalence patterns are then compared against newly submitted questions.",
        "In case of a match, the new question can be answered by proposing the \"best\" answer from a previously answered equivalent question.",
        "We performed large-scale experiments over a more than 200,000 questions from Yahoo!",
        "Answers.",
        "Our method generated over 900 equivalence patterns in 339 groups and allows to correctly suggest an answer to a new question, roughly 70% of the time - outperforming conventional similarity-based baselines for answer suggestion.",
        "Moreover, for the newly submitted questions, our method can identify equivalent questions and generate equivalent patterns incrementally, which can greatly improve the feasibility of our method."

        "While most questions that share exactly the same \"best\" answer are indeed semantically equivalent, some may share the same answer by chance.",
        "To filter out such cases, we propose an estimate of Topical Diversity (TD), calculated based on the shared topics for all pairs of questions in the group.",
        "If the diversity is larger than a threshold, the questions in this group are considered not equivalent, and no patterns are generated.",
        "To calculate this measure, we consider as topics the \"notional words\" (NW) in the question, which are the head nouns and the heads of verb phrases recognized by the OpenNLP parser.",
        "Using these words as \"topics\", TD for a group of questions G is calculated as:",
        "where Qi and Qj are the notional words in each question in within group G with n questions total.",
        "Based on the question groups, we can generate equivalence patterns to extend the matching coverage - thus retrieving similar questions with different syntactic structure.",
        "OpenNLP is used to generate the basic syntactic structures by phrase chunking.",
        "After that, only the chunks which contain NWs are analyzed to acquire the phrase labels as the syntactic pattern.",
        "Table 1 shows an example of a generated pattern.",

        "These groups contain 979 questions, with, 2.89 questions per group on average.",
        "After that, we split our data into 413 questions for training (200 groups) and 566 questions, with randomly selected an additional 10,000 questions, for testing (the remainder) to compare three variants of our system Equivalence patterns only (EP), Notional words only (NW), and the weighted combination (EP+NW).",
