        "Some of these model message roles using dialogue acts such as question act or answer act.",
        "Most of these focus on modeling individual messages, often using surface forms.",
        "There has been limited study on thread-level modeling of the true roles of the messages, whether they provide information (source) or seek information (sink), or which message in the thread is most useful or influential as the source.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel model of message influence within a discussion thread.",
        "In modeling the thread-level influence of the messages, besides the sink/source role of the individual messages, we take into account the roles of the message posters within the thread.",
        "In Q&A discussion threads, since the roles of the posters as an information provider or an information seeker often do not change within the same thread, such information can help us identify the true roles or influence of the messages.",
