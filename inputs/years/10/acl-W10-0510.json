        "Language use is overlaid on a network of social connections, which exerts an influence on both the topics of discussion and the ways that these topics can be expressed (Halliday, 1978).",
        "In the past, efforts to understand this relationship were stymied by a lack of data, but social media offers exciting new opportunities.",
        "By combining large linguistic corpora with explicit representations of social network structures, social media provides a new window into the interaction between language and society.",
        "Our long term goal is to develop joint sociolinguistic models that explain the social basis of linguistic variation.",
        "In this paper we focus on microblogs: internet journals in which each entry is constrained to a few words in length.",
        "While this platform receives high-profile attention when used in connection with major news events such as natural disasters or political turmoil, less is known about the themes that characterize microblogging on a day-to-day basis.",
        "We perform an exploratory analysis of the content of a well-known microblogging platform (Twitter), using topic models to uncover latent semantic themes (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "We then show that these latent topics are predictive of the network structure; without any supervision, they predict which other microblogs a user is likely to follow, and to whom microbloggers will address messages.",
        "Indeed, our topical link predictor outperforms a competitive supervised alternative from traditional social network analysis.",
        "Finally, we explore the application of supervision to our topical link predictor, using regression to learn weights that emphasize topics of particular relevance to the social network structure.",
        "We acquired data from Twitter's streaming \"Gardenhose\" API, which returned roughly 15% of all messages sent over a period of two weeks in January 2010.",
        "This com-",
        "*We thank the reviews for their helpful suggestions and Brendan O'Connor for making the Twitter data available.",
        "prised 15GB of compressed data; we aimed to extract a representative subset by first sampling 500 people who posted at least sixteen messages over this period, and then \"crawled\" at most 500 randomly-selected followers of each of these original authors.",
        "The resulting data includes 21,306 users, 837,879 messages, and 10,578,934 word tokens.",
        "Text Twitter contains highly non-standard orthography that poses challenges for early-stage text processing.",
        "We took a conservative approach to tokenization, splitting only on whitespaces and apostrophes, and eliminating only token-initial and token-final punctuation characters.",
        "Two markers are used to indicate special tokens: #, indicating a topic (e.g. #curling); and @, indicating that the message is addressed to another user.",
        "Topic tokens were included after stripping the leading #, but address tokens were removed.",
        "All terms occurring less than 50 times were removed, yielding a vocabulary of 11,425 terms.",
        "Out-of-vocabulary items were classified as either words, URLs, or numbers.",
        "To ensure a fair evaluation, we removed \"retweets\" - when a user reposts verbatim the message of another user - if the original message author is also part of the dataset.",
        "Links We experiment with two social graphs extracted from the data: a follower graph and a communication graph.",
        "The follower graph places directed edges between users who have chosen to follow each other's updates; the message graph places a directed edge between users who have addressed messages to each other (using the @ symbol).",
        "Huberman et al.",
        "(2009) argue that the communication graph captures direct interactions and is thus a more accurate representation of the true underlying social structure, while the follower graph contains more connections than could possibly be maintained in a realistic social network.",

        "We constructed a topic model over twitter messages, identifying the latent themes that characterize the corpus.",
        "In standard topic modeling methodology, topics define distributions over vocabulary items, and each document contains a set of latent topic proportions (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "However, the average message on Twitter is only sixteen word tokens, which is too sparse for traditional topic modeling; instead, we gathered together all of the messages from a given user into a single document.",
        "Thus our model learns the latent topics that characterize authors, rather than messages.",
        "Authors with similar topic proportions are likely to share interests or dialect, suggesting potential social connections.",
        "Author similarity can be quantified without supervision by taking the dot product of the topic proportions.",
        "If labeled data is available (a partially observed network), then regression can be applied to learn weights for each topic.",
        "Chang and Blei (2009) describe such a regression-based predictor, which takes the form exp ( – nT(Zi – Zj ) o (Zi – Zj ) – v), denoting the predicted strength of connection between authors i and j.",
        "Here zZi (zZj) refers to the expected topic proportions for user i (j), n is a vector of learned regression weights, and v is an intercept term which is only necessary if a the link prediction function must return a probability.",
        "We used the updates from Chang and Blei to learn n in a post hoc fashion, after training the topic model."

        "We constructed topic models using an implementation of variational inference for Latent Dirich-let Allocation (LDA).",
        "The results of the run with the best variational bound on 50 topics can be found at http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/ socialmedia/naacl10ws/.",
        "While many of the topics focus on content (for example, electronics and sports), others capture distinct languages and even dialect variation.",
        "Such dialects are particularly evident in stopwords (you versus u).",
        "Structured topic models that explicitly handle these two orthogonal axes of linguistic variation are an intriguing possibility for future work.",
        "We evaluate our topic-based approach for link prediction on both the message and follower graphs, comparing against an approach that only considers the network structure.",
        "Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg (2003) perform a quantitative comparison of such approaches, finding that the relatively simple technique of counting the number of shared neighbors between two nodes is a surprisingly competitive predictor of whether they are linked; we call this approach common-neighbors.",
        "We evaluate this method and our own supervised LDA+regression approach by hiding half of the edges in the graph, and predicting them from the other half.",
        "For each author in the dataset, we apply each method to rank all possible links; the evaluation computes the average rank of the true links that were held out (for our data, a random baseline would score 10653 - half the number of authors in the network).",
        "As shown in Figure 1, topic-based link prediction outperforms the alternative that considers only the graph structure.",
        "Interestingly, post hoc regression on the topic proportions did not consistently improve performance, though joint learning may do better (e.g., Chang and Blei, 2009).",
        "The text-based approach is especially strong on the message graph, while the link-based approach is more competitive on the followers graph; a model that captures both features seems a useful direction for future work."
