        "During times of mass emergency, many turn to Twitter to gather and disperse relevant, timely information (Starbird et al.",
        "2010; Vieweg et al.",
        "2010).",
        "However, the sheer amount of information now communicated via Twitter during these time-and safety-critical situations can make it difficult for individuals to locate personally meaningful and actionable information.",
        "In this paper, we discuss natural language processing (NLP) techniques designed for Twitter data that will lead to the location and extraction of specific information during times of mass emergency."

        "Twitter communications are comprised of 140-character messages called \"tweets.\"",
        "During times of mass emergency, Twitter users send detailed information that may help those affected to better make critical decisions.",
        "Our goal is to develop techniques to automatically identify crucial pieces of information in these tweets.",
        "This process will lead to the automatic extraction of information that helps people understand the situation \"on the ground\" during mass emergencies.",

      "heading": "3. The Annotation Process",
      "text": [
        "A foundational level of linguistic annotation for many natural language processing tasks is Named Entity (or nominal entity) tagging (Bikel 1999).",
        "Typical labeled entities that were included in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) guidelines (LDC 2004) are: Person, Location, Organization, and Facility, the four maximal entity classes.",
        "Our preliminary annotation task consists of identifying the syntactic span and entity class for these four types of entities in a pilot set of Twitter data (200 tweets from a data set generated during the 2009 Oklahoma grassfires).",
        "In future annotation, the ontology will be expanded to include event and relation annotations, as well as additional subclasses of the entities now examined.",
        "Annotations are done using Knowtator (Ogren 2006), a tool built within the Protégé framework (http://protege.stanford.edu/).",
        "The ontology development is data-driven; as such it is likely that certain ACE annotations will never emerge and other annotations (such as disaster-relevant materials) will be necessary additions.",
        "Three annotators undertook pilot annotation as part of the construction of preliminary annotation guidelines; the top pairwise ITA score is reported below.",
        "Twitter data makes reference to numerous entity spans that are of specific interest to this annotation task, such as road intersections and multiword named entities.",
        "The example below, from the pilot annotation set, shows a relatively simple span delineation.",
        "[ person Velma area residents]: [pERSoN Officials] say to take [facilty Old Hwy 7] to [facilty Speedy G] to safely evacuate.",
        "[LOCATION Stephens Co Fairgrounds] in [LOCATION Duncan] for shelter",
        "Because of the varying length of entities, annotators cannot be given simple rules for deciding the spans for annotations.",
        "This difficulty is reflected in markedly lower rates for span identification inter-annotator agreement (IAA) rates than for simple class assignment."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "4. Preliminary Results",
      "text": [
        "IAA calculations were performed using the Know-tator IAA functionality.",
        "When annotations are required to be both the same span and class, the pilot annotation yielded an F-score of 56.27 (An additional 4% have exact span matches but different classes).",
        "However, when annotations are required to have the same class assignment but only overlapping spans, this F-score rises to 72.85.",
        "While Facility and Location are the most commonly confused classes, span-matching remains a difficult issue for all entity classes."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "5. Discussion",
      "text": [
        "While these ITA rates are significantly lower than published results from previous ACE annotation efforts (LDC 2004), we believe that the crisis communications domain, particularly with regard to Twitter analysis, provides challenges not encountered in newswire, broadcast transcripts, or newspaper data.",
        "First, determining the maximal span of interest for a given class assignment is non-trivial.",
        "The constraint of 140 characters necessarily results in very limited syntactic and semantic contexts, making spans and entity class assignments much harder to determine.",
        "A large source of disagreement was on the treatment of coordinated or listed noun phrases.",
        "In certain contexts, each entity (cities below) requires its own span (e.g. \"Firestorms in Oklahoma.",
        "[Midwest City], [Lake Draper].",
        "Some houses lost\"), whereas in other contexts we find multiple entities per span (e.g. \"Midwest City to evacuate between SE 15th and Rena and Anderson and Hiwassee also [Tur-tlewood, Wingsong, and Oakwood additions]\").",
        "Equally, class assignment cannot be a mechanistic process or accomplished by reference to lists, as it is important to distinguish between cases where terms have been elided due to limited space and cases where no elision has taken place.",
        "For instance, the entity \"Attorney General\" (as opposed to \"Attorney General's Office\") might be annotated 'Person' or 'Organization' depending on context, or simply ambiguous, i.e. lacking sufficient context.",
        "It is primarily these unclear cases of class assignment that will require careful discussion in the annotation guidelines and in future mappings to an ontology.",
        "In summary, this pilot study represents a new application of ACE annotation practices to a uniquely challenging domain.",
        "We outline issues that place special demands on annotators and future directions for ongoing research.",
        "We are confident that as we refine our guidelines and provide more cues and examples for the annotators that the determination of spans and entity classes will improve."
