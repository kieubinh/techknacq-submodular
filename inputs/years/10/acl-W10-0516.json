        "The set of entities E is composed of 104,713 celebrity names scraped from Wikipedia for the Actor, Athlete, Politician and Musician categories.",
        "The overall size of S amounts to 661,226 (we consider only snapshots with a minimum of 10 tweets).",
        "The number of buzzy snapshots in B is 30,451.",
        "For evaluation, we use a gold standard of 120 snapshots randomly sampled from B, and manually annotated as controversial or not-controversial by two expert annotators (detailed guidelines will be presented at the workshop).",
        "Kappa-agreement between the annotators, estimated on a subset of 20 snapshots, is 0.89 ('almost perfect' agreement).",
        "We experiment with different a and ß values, as reported in Table 1, in order to discern the value of final score components.",
        "We use Average Precision (AP), and the area under the ROC curve (AROC) as our evaluation measures.",
        "The results in Table 1 show that all Twitter-based models perform better than the Web-based baseline.",
        "The most effective basic model is MixSent, suggesting that the presence of mixed polarity sentiment terms in a snapshot is a good indicator of controversy.",
        "For example, 'Claudia Jordan' appears in a snapshot with a mix of positive and negative terms in a debate about a red carpet appearance-but the hcont and Controv scores are low as there is no record of historical controversy or explicit controversy terms in the target tweets.",
        "Best overall performance is achieved by a mixed model combining the hcont and the MixSent score (last row in Table label 1).",
        "There are indeed cases in which the evidence from MixSent is not enough - e.g., a snapshot discussing 'Jesse Jackson' 's appearance on a tv show lacks common positive or negative terms, but reflects users' confusion nevertheless; however, 'Jesse Jackson' has a high historical controversy score, which leads our combined model to correctly assign a high controversy score to the snapshot.",
        "Interestingly, most controversies in the gold standard refer to micro-events (e.g., tv show, award show or athletic event appearances), rather than more traditional controversial events found in news streams (e.g., speeches about climate change, controversial movie releases, etc.",
        "); this further strengthens the case that Twitter is a complementary information source wrt news corpora.",
        "We plan to follow up on this very preliminary investigation by improving our Twitter-based sentiment detection, incorporating blog and news data and generalizing our controversy model (e.g., discovering the 'what' and the 'why' of a controversy, and tracking common controversial behaviors of entities over time).",
