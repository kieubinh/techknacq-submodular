        "Multivariate analysis allows decoding of neural representations at the single trial level in single subjects.",
        "Its introduction into the field of cognitive neuroscience has led to novel insights about the neural representation of cognitive functions such as language (Mitchell et al., 2008), memory (Hassabis et al., 2009), and vision (Miyawaki et al., 2008).",
        "However, interpretation of the models obtained using a multivariate analysis can be hard due to the fact that different models are obtained for individual subjects.",
        "For example, when analyzing K separately acquired datasets, K sets of model parameters will be obtained which may or may not show a common pattern.",
        "In some sense, we are in need of a second-level analysis such that we can draw inferences on the group level, as in the conventional analysis of neuroimaging data using the general linear model.",
        "One way to achieve this in the context of multivariate analysis is by means of multi-task learning, a special case of transfer learning (Thrun, 1996) where model parameters for different tasks (datasets) are estimated simultaneously and no longer assumed to be independent (Caru-ana, 1997).",
        "In an fMRI context, multi-task learning has been explored using canonical correlation analysis (Rustandi et al., 2009).",
        "In a Bayesian setting, multi-task learning is typically realized by assuming a hierarchical Bayesian framework where shared prior distributions condition task-specific parameters (Gelman et al., 1995).",
        "In this paper, we explore a new Bayesian approach to multi-task learning in the context of concept classification; i.e., the prediction of the semantic category of concrete nouns from BOLD response.",
        "Effectively, we are using a shared prior to induce parameter shrinkage.",
        "We show that Bayesian multi-task learning leads to more interpretable models, thereby facilitating the interpretation of the models obtained using multivariate analysis."

        "The posterior marginals for the latent variables (ß, u, v) can be approximated using expectation propagation (Minka, 2001) and the posterior variance of the auxiliary variables Ui (or v% by symmetry) can be interpreted as a measure of importance of the corresponding covariate xi since it eventually determines how large the regression coefficients ßi can become.",
        "Interpretation becomes complicated whenever we have collected multiple datasets for the same task since each corresponding model may give different results regarding the importance of the covariates used when solving the classification problem.",
        "Multi-task learning presents a solution to this problem by dropping the assumption that datasets {D1,..., DK} are independent.",

        "In this way, we have coupled covariates over datasets with coupling strength s. Note that this coupling is realized on the level of the auxiliary variables and not on the regression coefficients.",

        "This considerably reduces computational overhead since we need to couple just 116 ROIs instead of approximately 20000 voxels between all nine subjects.",
        "Furthermore, it facilitates interpretation since results can be analyzed at the ROI level instead of at the single voxel level.",

        "Although obtained accuracies are lower than those which would have been obtained using single-voxel activations, it is interesting in its own right that the activation in just 116 predefined regions still allows concept decoding.",
        "However, it remains an open question to what extent clas-sifiability truly reflects semantic processing instead of sensory processing of words and/or pictures.",
        "The coupling induced by multi-task learning leads to interpretable models when using auxiliary variable variance as a measure of importance.",
        "The obtained models for the pairs which were easiest to classify corresponded well to the results reported in (Shinkareva et al., 2008) and mapped nicely onto the semantic features shelter, manipulation and eating identified in (Just et al., 2010).",

        "Our algorithm also does not preclude multi-task learning on thousands of voxels.",
        "Computation time depends on the number of non-zeros in the structure matrix R and matrices containing hundreds of thousands of non-zero elements are still manageable with computation time being in the order of hours.",
