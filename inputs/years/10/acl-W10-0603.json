        "Since its advent, fMRI has been used to conduct hundreds of studies that identify specific regions of the brain that are activated on average when a human performs a particular cognitive function (e.g., reading, mental imagery).",
        "A great body of these publications show that averaging together fMRI data collected over multiple time intervals, while the subject responds to some kind of repeated stimuli (reading words), can present descriptive statistics of brain activity (Mitchell et al., 2004).",

        "Many attempts have investigated to approximate human judgment of similarity between objects.",
        "Measures of similarity use information found in isa hierarchy of concepts (or synsets), and quantify how much concept A is like concept B (Pedersen, 2004).",
        "Such a measure might show that a horse is more like a cat than it is like a window, due to the fact that horse and cat share mammal as an ancestor in the WordNet noun hierarchy.",
        "Similarity is a fundamental and widely used concept and refers to relatedness between two concepts in WordNet.",
        "Many similarity measures have been proposed for WordNet-based measures of semantic similarity, such as information content (Resnik, 1995), JCN (Jiang and Conrath, 1997), LCH (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), and Lin (Lin, 1998).",
        "These measures have limited the part of speech (POS) of words, for example it is not defined to measure the similarity between verb see and noun eye.",
        "There is another set of similarity measures which work beyond this boundary of POS limitation.",
        "These measures are called semantic relatedness measures; such as Lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), and Vector (Patwardhan, 2003).",
        "The simple idea behind the LCH method is to compute the shortest path of two concepts in a WordNet unified hierarchy tree.",
        "The LCH measure is defined as follows (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998):",
        "Similarity is measured between concepts c1 and c2, and D is the maximum depth of taxonomy; therefore the longest path is at most 2D.",

        "This anomaly is originated from the fact that some verbs do not have related non-verb senses (POS).",
        "On the other hand, relatedness measures (like Lesk) do not limit the POS of words.",
        "In consequence, we have non-zero values for every element of the feature matrix.",
