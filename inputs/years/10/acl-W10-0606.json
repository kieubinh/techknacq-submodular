        "In the previous study, Huang et al.",
        "(2009) have found the ERP evidence to indicate single entry representation for Chinese polysemy in the left hemisphere; however, in the right hemisphere, they found sense inhibition which may be due to (1) the nature of hemispheric processing in dealing with semantic ambiguity or (2) the semantic activation from the separate-entry representation for senses.",
        "To clarify these possibilities, the study used the word class judgment task with the attempt to push subjects in a deeper level of lexical processing.",
        "The results revealed sense facilitation effect in the RH and suggested that in a deeper level, the RH had more possibility to observe the sense facilitation due to different efficiency of cerebral hemispheres."

        "Lexical ambiguity is very common in language.",
        "Linguistically, homonymy and polysemy are traditionally distinguished as two types of ambiguity.",
        "Early behavioral studies on semantic ambiguity obtained ambiguity advantage effects (e.g., Rubenstein et al., 1970; Jastrzembski, 1981, Millis & Button, 1989) in lexical decisions in which ambiguous words yielded faster reaction time than unambiguous words.",
        "However, the same results were not replicated in some other studies (e.g., Bo-rowsky & Masson, 1996; Azuma & Van Orden, 1997).",
        "More recent psycholinguistic studies found that the so-called ambiguity advantage effects were in fact resulted from the activation of words having related senses rather than that of words having unrelated meanings (e.g., Rodd et al., 2002; Beretta et al., 2005; Pylkkänen et al., 2006).",
        "These studies were generally in agreement with the linguistic assumption in that homonymy and polysemy might be represented differently in the mental lexicon.",
        "The issue of hemispheric processing in combination with lexical ambiguity have been widely studied (e.g., Burgess & Simpson, 1988; Beeman & Chiarello, 1998; Faust & Lavidor, 2003) and suggested that both cerebral hemispheres process word meanings in complementary ways.",
        "For example, Faust and Lavidor (2003) demonstrated that the LH benefited most from semantically congruent primes related to dominant meaning of ambiguous targets while the RH benefited most from semantically mixed primes.",
        "The overall pattern of priming was also suggestive of dissociation in the hemispheric meaning retrieval, with the LH engaging in fine semantic coding that focused on a single meaning interpretation, and the RH engaging in coarser semantic coding where multiple alternate meanings were activated.",
        "Alternatively, Federmeier and Kutas (1999) offered electrophysiological data in a sentence comprehension task to present another explanation in hemispheric language processing.",
        "They suggested that while both hemispheres involved in lexical resolution, they played different roles with the LH being 'predictive', the RH being 'integrative', to complement each other.",
        "Pylkkänen et al., (2006) were the first to focus on the investigation of how different but related senses were psychologically represented in the mental lexicon.",
        "Their MEG data suggested the single-entry representation for related senses in the LH whereas they showed the sense inhibition in the RH and interpreted it as a potential sense competition effect.",
        "In Chinese, Huang et al.",
        "(2009) demonstrated similar patterns in their ERP data in which there was sense facilitation in the LH and sense inhibition in the RH.",
        "Nevertheless, the question concerning the representation of related senses in the RH still left unresolved.",
        "Early studies on Chinese ambiguity such as Lin (1999) obtained ambiguity advantage but the calculation of 'senses' included related and unrelated meanings and the effect was not reliable enough.",
        "In Chinese words recognition process, the issue of lexical ambiguity involves the composition of constituent characters and how they contribute to the whole word reading.",
        "Chinese words differ from English in at least two aspects.",
        "First, about 80% of Chinese words are composed of two characters (Huang et al., 2006).",
        "Second, unlike the words in English, which every word is composed of letters corresponding to phonemes, Chinese words consist of characters corresponding to morphemes.",
        "In other words, each character in Chinese has its mor-pheme(s) when they are embedded in two-character compounds.",
        "Therefore, before we look into the lexical ambiguity of two-character words as lexical items, we should investigate the sense representation of its subcomponent, the representation of its single character within two-character compounds.",
        "In the circumstance which every character in the disyllabic compounds may contribute to word recognition, there still exists disparity between the roles of the first and second character.",
        "In light of the studies on the neighborhood size effect, word recognition process will be influenced by the composition of letters or characters.",
        "In English, facilitative neighborhood size effects and inhibitory neighborhood size effects were robust findings in low frequency words (e.g. Andrews, 1989, 1992; Grainger and Jacobs, 1996).",
        "In the Chinese neighborhood size study (Huang et al., 2006) and eye movement study (Tsai et al., 2006), it was suggested that the neighborhood size of the first character constituent played a more important role in lexical processing than did neighborhood size of the second character constituent.",
        "Based on the assumption that the first character will play a key role in whole word reading, the study primarily manipulated the number of senses of the first character and attempted to reveal the hypotheses of sense representation in the context provided by the second character.",
        "The question left in Huang et al.",
        "(2009) was that whether the sense inhibition in the RH was due to the nature of hemispheric processing in dealing with semantic ambiguity or the semantic activation from the separate-entry representation for senses.",
        "Considering the sense inhibition in the N400 of the ERP component, the pattern in their data was that words having many senses were more negative than those having few senses.",
        "That is, there existed competition when the first characters of the targets had many related senses.",
        "Nevertheless, based on the single entry assumption for related senses, we assumed sense facilitation for the representation of senses.",
        "In Huang et al.",
        "(2009), they required subjects to make word/ non-word lexical decision, but subjects might make their judgments based on perceptual familiarity rather than the involvement of lexical access.",
        "Previous studies on probabilistic phonotactics (Vitevitch and Luce, 1998) or on Chinese semantic combinability (Cheng, 2006) have demonstrated opposing effects in early and late levels of word processing.",
        "In order to clarify the results in Huang et al.",
        "(2009), we designed the word class judgment task to deepen the difficulty of the experimental procedure."

        "By changing the depth of the task, the goal of the experiment was to find out if, under the assumption of single entry representation for senses, there was a chance to discover the sense facilitation in the RH.",
        "Suppose the representation of Chinese senses had single entry, words having more senses should be less negative than few senses in the N400 because of the benefits of semantic activation.",
        "On the contrary, if there were multiple entries for senses in the RH, words of more senses should be more negative than few senses and displayed semantic competition and inhibition.",

        "Possible confounding factors such as word frequency, NS1, NS2 were controlled.",

        "For example, in children' s lexical development, the acquisition of nouns seems to be earlier and easier than that of verbs (Gentner, 1982).",
        "In aphasic findings, case studies indicated that patients with lesions located in left anterior and middle temporal lobe, outside so called language areas, had difficulty in the production of nouns whereas patients with lesions areas in left frontal premotor cortex had difficulty in the production of verbs (Damasio & Damasio, 1992; Damasio et al., 1993).",
