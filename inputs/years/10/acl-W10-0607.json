        "Lexical acquisition is restrained by perception and comprehension difficulties, which are associated with a number of linguistic and psycholinguistic factors.",
        "Among these we can cite age of acquisition (Ellis and Morrison, 1998; Ellis and Ralph, 2000), frequency (Morrison and Ellis, 1995), syntactic (Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2004; Goldberg, 1999; Thompson et.",
        "al, 2003) and semantic (Bree-din et.",
        "al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006) characteristics of words.",
        "In terms of semantic features, acquisition may be influenced by the polysemy and generality of a word, among others.",
        "In terms of semantic features, acquisition may be influenced by the generality and polysemy of a word, among others.",
        "For instance, considering acquisition of verbs in particular, Goldberg (1999) observes that verbs such as go, put and give are among those to be acquired first, for they are more general and frequent, and have lower \"semantic weight\" (a relative measure of complexity; Breedin et.",
        "al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006).",
        "These verbs, known as light verbs, not only are acquired first: they are also known to be more easily used by aphasics (Breedin et al., 1998; Thompson, 2003; Thompson et al.",
        "2003; Barde et al.",
        "2006; but see Kim and Thompson, 2004), which suggest their great importance for human cognition.",
        "The preference for light verbs may be explained by the more general meanings they tend to present and their more polysemic nature, that is their ability to convey multiple meanings, since the more polysemic the verb is, the more contexts in which it can be used (Kim and Thompson, 2004; Barde et al., 2006).",
        "The importance of the number of relationships a word has in the learning environment has been pointed out by Hills et al.",
        "(2009), regardless of generality.",
        "Several factors may influence acquisition, but in this paper we will focus on polysemy.",
        "Understanding how characteristics like polysemy influence acquisition is essential for the construction of more precise theories.",
        "Therefore, the hypothesis we investigate is that more polysemous words have a higher chance of earlier acquisition.",
        "For this purpose, we compare data from children and adults from the same linguistic community, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, in an action naming task, looking at lexical evolution by using statistical and topological analysis of the data mode led as graphs (following Steyvers and Tenen-baum, 2005, and Gorman and Curran, 2007).",

        "In recent years, there has been growing interest in the investigation of language acquisition using computational models.",
        "For instance, some work has investigated language properties such as age-of-acquisition effects (Ellis and Ralph, 2000; Li et al., 2004).",
        "Others have simulated aspects of the acquisition process (Siskind, 1996; Yu, 2005; Yu, and lexical growth (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007).",
        "Some authors employ graph theory metrics to directly analyze word senses (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Navigli and Lapata, 2007).",
        "In this paper, word senses are implicitly expressed by graph edges, thus being considered indirectly.",
        "Graph theory has also been successfully used in more theoretical fields, like the characterization and comparison of languages (Motter et al., 2002; Fer-rer-i-Cancho et al., 2004; Masucci and Rodgers, 2006).",
        "For example, the works by Sigman and Cecchi (2002), and Gorman and Curran (2007) use graph measures to extensively analyze WordNet properties.",
        "Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) use some properties of language networks to propose a model of semantic growth, which is compatible with the effects of learning history variables, such as age of acquisition and frequency, in semantic processing tasks.",
        "The approach proposed in this work follows Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005), and Gorman and Curran (2007) in the sense of iterative modifications of graphs, but differs in method (we use involutions instead of evolutions) and objective : modifications are motivated by the study of polysemy instead of production of a given topological arrangement.",
        "It also follows Deyne and Storms (2008), in the sense that it directly relates linguistic factors and graph theory metrics, and Coronges et al.",
        "(2007), in the sense that it compares networks of different populations with the given approach.",
        "As to Brazilian Portuguese, in particular, Anti-queira et al.",

        "Tonietto et al.",
        "(2008) analyze the influence of pragmatic aspects, such as conventionality of use, over the lexical organization of verbs, and observe that adults tend to prefer more conventional labels than children.",
        "In this context, this study follows Tonietto et al. (2008) in using data from a psycholinguistic action naming task.",

        "In order to study the evolution of the lexicon in children, children's data are longitudinal; participants of the first data collection (G1) aged between 2;0 and 3;11 (average 3;1), and in the second collection (G2), between 4;1 and 6;6 (average 5;5) as described by Tonietto et al.",

        "The adult group is unrelated to the children, and aged between 17;0 and 34;0 (average 21;8).",
        "The longitudinal data enabled the comparison across the lexical evolution of children at age of acquisition (G1), two years later (G2), and the reference group of adults (G3).",
        "Participants were shown 17 actions of destruction or division (To-nietto et al., 2008); answers were preprocessed in order to eliminate both invalid answers (like \"I don't know\") and answers with only 1 occurrence per group.",
        "The selection of this particular domain (destruction and division) is due to its cognitive importance: it was found to be one of the four conceptual zones, grouping a great amount of verbs (Tonietto, 2009).",
        "There were a total of 935 answers per group, out of which 785, 911 and 917 were valid answers to G1, G2 and G3, respectively.",
        "These made averages of 46.18, 53.59 and 53.94 valid answers per action, respectively.",
        "The average numbers of distinct valid answers per action, before merging (explained in section 3.2), were 6.76, 5.53 and 4, respectively.",
        "The answers given by each participant were collected and annotated two polysemy scores, each calculated from a different source:",
        "Wscore is the polysemy score of a verb according to its number of synsets (synonym sets) in WordNetBR (Dias-da-Silva et al., 2000, Maziero, 2008), the Brazilian Portuguese version of Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Hscore is the number of different entries for a verb in the Houaiss dictionary (Houaiss, 2007).",
        "Information about these two scores for each group is shown in Table 1.",
        "We notice that most scores, i.e., type and token Hscores, and token Wscore, decrease as age increases, which is compatible with the hypothesis investigated.",
        "However, due to the limited coverage of WordNetBR, some verbs had a null value, and this is reflected in type Wscore.",

        "In each column, the second graph is compared to the first.",
        "In the \"Gl-G2\" column, there are 16 verbs common to both graphs, which represents 64% of the verbs in G2 (with 36% of the verbs in G2 not appearing in G1).",
        "As expected, due to the proximity in age, results show a higher similarity between G1 and G2 than between G2 and",
        "G3.",
        "Linguistic production of each group was represented in terms of graphs, whose nodes represent the verbs mentioned in the task.",
        "Verbs uttered for the same action were assumed to share semantic information, thus being related to each other.",
        "The existence of conceptual relationships due to semantic association is in accordance with Nelson et al.",
        "(1998), where implicit semantic relations were shown to influence on recall and recognition.",
        "Therefore, for each age group, all the verbs uttered for a given action were linked together, forming a (clique) subgraph.",
        "The subgraphs for the different actions were then connected in a merging step, through the polysemic words uttered for more than one action.",
        "As the goal of this research is to investigate whether a factor such as polysemy has any influence on language acquisition, we examine the effects of using it to incrementally change the network over time.",
        "Strategies for network modif i-cation, such as network growth (Albert and Ba-rabâsi, 2002), have been used to help evaluate the effects of particular factors by iteratively changing the network (e.g., Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007).",
        "Network growth incrementally adds nodes to an initial state of the network, by means of some criteria, allowing analysis of its convergence to a final state.",
        "The longitudinal data used in this paper provides references to both an initial and a final state.",
        "However, due to differences in vocabulary size and content between the groups, network growth would require complete knowledge of the vocabulary of both the source and target groups to precisely decide on the nodes to include and where.",
        "Network involution, the strategy adopted, works in the opposite way than network growth.",
        "It takes an older group graph as the source and decides on the nodes to iteratively remove, regardless of the younger group graph, and uses the latter only as a reference for comparison of the structure and content of the resulting graph.",

        "This study investigated the influence of polysemy on verb acquisition and organization using both graph and set theory metrics.",
        "In general, results from the topological analysis showed a tendency towards the reference value, and the greatest similarities were mostly collected in the beginning, as expected, pointing for a preference of children to use more polysemous verbs.",
        "The static analysis of the initial graphs (Tables 1, 2 and 3) corroborate the hypothesis.",
        "As a result, we note that not only does the evolution of human vocabulary lead to a decrease in the average polysemy measure, but its structure also evolves according to this linguistic factor.",
        "So we conclude that both the model of involution and the given analysis are appropriate for linguistic studies concerning vocabulary evolution.",
        "The analyses highlighted also some interesting properties reflected in the graphs, such as vocabulary growth and specialization with the increase of participants' age.",
        "In addition, the analysis was useful in showing that the graphs of the two groups of children were more similar to each other than to that of adults, both in structure and content.",
        "For future work, we intend to apply the same approach to other parameters, such as frequency, concreteness, and syntactic complexity.",
        "As they may simultaneously influence acquisition, we also plan to investigate possible combinations of these factors.",
        "We also intend to apply this methodology to investigate lexical dissolution in the context of pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, and in",
        "parisons with random elimination can be seen as a tendency.",
        "Additionally, the experiments consist of two simulations, over three different data sets, by using two different sets of polysemy, two kinds of metrics, and five different metrics, which provide robustness to the results.",
