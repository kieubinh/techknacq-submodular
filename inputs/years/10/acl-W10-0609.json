        "(2008) presented a novel approach for predicting human brain activity associated with conceptual stimuli.",
        "This approach represents a useful development for interdisciplinary researchers interested in lexical semantics, for several reasons.",
        "Most broadly, it is useful in testing the hypothesis that distributional properties of words in corpora can reveal important information about the meanings of words.",
        "A strong version of this hypothesis (i.e. that children in part learn the meaning of concrete concept words from co-occurring words in discourse that they are exposed to) has formed the basis of one class of probabilistic cognitive models of conceptual representation (Andrews et al., 2005; Andrews et al., 2009; Steyvers, 2010).",
        "Furthermore this approach is useful for testing hypotheses about the kind of co-occurring information that is useful for representing conceptual semantics.",
        "In Mitchell et al.",
        "'s work (2008), for example, they adopt the position that the meaning of concrete concepts is encoded in the brain with information associated with basic sensory and motor activities (such as actions involving changes to spatial relationships and physical actions performed on objects).",
        "At a more technical level, Mitchell et al.",
        "'s fMRI activation data give researchers developing feature-based models of conceptual representation an important benchmark for evaluation.",
        "For these researchers, a key problem is the lack of a reasonable \"gold standard\" against which the quality of the representations generated by a computational model may be evaluated.",
        "Previous research has adopted two main approaches to evaluation.",
        "Firstly, some models - especially those aiming to extract representations composed of psychologically meaningful semantic feature units, such as Baroni et al.",
        "(2009) - have been evaluated against features gathered in large scale property norming studies (e.g. McRae et al.",
        "(2005)).",
        "By comparing the system output against features elicited by people, this kind of eval-",
        "!fMRI data measures changes in oxygen concentrations in the brain.",
        "These changes are tied to cognitive processes.",
        "uation aims to test the psychological validity ofcom-putational methods.",
        "Furthermore, it allows a finegrained analysis of performance, for example by revealing the classes of features (part-of, taxonomic, etc) which a given model is particularly good at extracting (Baroni et al., 2008).",
        "However, property norms come with important caveats.",
        "One problem is that they tend to over-represent informative or salient information about concepts whilst under-representing other kinds of features.",
        "For example, participants report that camels have humps, but not that camels have hearts, even though all participants are likely to have both pieces of information accessible in their representation of the concept CAMEL.",
        "If a model is successful in extracting these less salient features, there is no way of evaluating their correctness using property norms.",
        "A related issue is that participants can only report verbalizable features, which may not represent the total sum of their conceptual knowledge (Murphy, 2002; McRae et al., 2005).",
        "A second problem with using property norms as the basis of evaluation is that there is often no direct lexical match between feature terms appearing in the system output and the norms.",
        "Feature norms are typically normalized such that near-synonymous properties (e.g. is endangered, is an endangered species, is almost extinct, etc., for whale) given by different participants are mapped to the same feature label (e.g. is endangered).",
        "As a consequence, a model may correctly extract endangered for WH AL E, but other lexical forms of the same feature will not match any feature in the norms.",
        "One solution to this is to create an expansion set for each feature which includes its synonyms (Baroni et al., 2008).",
        "However, this is only a partial solution because lexical variation in features is not limited to synonyms.",
        "A second approach to evaluating semantic models uses classification or similarity data.",
        "For example, Andrews et al.",
        "(2009) evaluated their models by calculating cosine similarity scores between semantic representations and using these similarity scores to predict behavioral data which are contingent on the semantic similarity between pairs of concepts (e.g. lexical substitution errors, semantic priming latencies, word-association norms, etc).",
        "Although this approach is psychologically motivated, it evaluates a set of extracted features more indirectly than comparison with norm data.",
        "In computational linguistics, a similarly indirect evaluation method is to cluster the extracted representations.",
        "This approach avoids the difficulties in evaluating individual features; however it only allows consideration along one dimension of the data, namely the similarity between pairs of concepts.",
        "dataset offers an advancement over both of these evaluation techniques.",
        "Unlike, for example, property norming data, fMRI data offers direct insight into how the brain is functioning in response to given stimuli.",
        "Its multidimensional nature makes it easier to inspect what aspects of meaning a particular model is performing strongly or weakly on, and allows for better control of experimental variation.",
        "Finally, it avoids the two major issues associated with property norms, which we outlined above.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "In the next section, we briefly describe the models which we used to extract conceptual representations for the 60 concepts in the Mitchell et al.",
        "(2008) dataset.",
        "In Section 3, we outline our experimental objectives, and the framework we adopt for testing our semantic models.",
        "In Section 4, we present the results of our evaluation, which indicate above chance performance for each of the models.",
        "Finally, we examine the differences between models by investigating for which concepts prediction of the fMRI activity is poorest, and discuss these differences with respect to the differing assumptions made by the methods."

        "We consider four different semantic models in this paper, which are described briefly below.",
        "These models were selected as we were interested in the various kinds of knowledge (part-of-speech, syntactic, and semantic) in corpora available to the extraction process, and the extent to which the use of these types of knowledge can affect the quality of the extracted conceptual representations.",
        "The first semantic model we considered was that of Mitchell et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "This model assumes that sensory-motor information is an important aspect of conceptual representation, and that the information relevant to a target concept's representation can be estimated from the concept word's frequency of cooccurrence with 25 sensory-motor verbs (eat, manipulate, push, etc) in a very large corpus.",
        "Our reimplementation of this method used the co-occurrence statistics provided by Mitchell et al.",
        "which were extracted from the Google n-gram corpus consisting of 1 trillion words of web text.",
        "Secondly, we implemented a co-occurrence-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model based on the one described by Baroni and colleagues (Ba-roni and Lenci, 2008; Baroni et al., 2009).",
        "This model combines aspects of both the HAL (Landauer et al., 1998) and LSA (Lund and Burgess, 1996) models in constructing representations for words based on their co-occurrences in texts.",
        "A word-by-word co-occurrence matrix was constructed for our corpus, storing how often each target word co-occurred with each context word.",
        "The set of context words consisted of the 5,000 most frequent content words (i.e. words not occurring in a stop-list of function words) appearing in the corpus.",
        "The set of target words consisted of the 60 concept terms appearing in the fMRI dataset, supplemented with the 10,000 most frequent content words in the corpus (with the exception of the top 10 most frequent words).",
        "For calculating co-occurrence frequency between target and context words, the context window was defined by sentence boundaries: two words were considered to co-occur if they appeared in the same sentence.",
        "Following Baroni and Lenci (2008), the dimensionality of the target-word x context-word cooccurrence matrix was reduced to 150 columns by singular value decomposition.",
        "That is, the singular value decomposition of the co-occurrence matrix was computed and the 150 left singular vectors that accounted for most of the variance, multiplied by the corresponding singular values, were used as the 150-dimensional representation of each target term.",
        "Similarity between pairs of target words was calculated as the cosine between their vectors, and for each of the 60 concept words in the experimental stimuli we chose the 200 most similar target words to act as the feature terms extracted by the model.",
        "The corpus used with this model was the British National Corpus (BNC) (Leech et al., 1994).",
        "Finally we implemented a novel extraction method, which aims to extract property-norm-like, psychologically meaningful features from corpus data (Kelly et al., 2010).",
        "The method aims to extract semantically unconstrained feature triples of the form concept-relation-feature , where feature is a feature (either noun or adjective) of the target concept and relation is a verb representing the semantic relationship between them.",
        "Examples of extracted triples include: swan be white, swan have neck and screwdriver be tool.",
        "The model uses a corpus parsed for grammatical relations (GRs) using Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP) (Briscoe et al., 2006).",
        "For each sentence containing a target concept, the set of GRs for that sentence are examined to test whether they match manually-created rules.",
        "These rules include prototypical feature-relation GR structures connecting elements of the sentence and represent dependency patterns which encode potential semantic relationships between the concept and candidate feature terms occurring in the sentence.",
        "A large set of candidate triples are extracted by applying these rules to each sentence in the corpus containing a target concept, and the triples for each concept are ranked by their frequency of extraction.",
        "In the second stage of the method, the extracted triples are reweighted on the basis of probabilistic high-level semantic information obtained from human property norm data.",
        "This subsequent stage has the effect of increasing the weight associated with more high-quality features and downgrading lower-quality features.",
        "The extraction method is described more fully in Kelly et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "For this method we also used the BNC.",
        "The top 200 triples ranked by frequency (i.e. unweighted) and the top 200 features after reweighting with the semantic data were used in our experiments."

        "The quality of the predictions generated for the concepts using each semantic model can therefore be adopted as an index of model performance.",

        "To ensure that the linear regression model for each method would be fitted using the same number of free parameters during training (thereby maximizing the comparability of the different methods), we reduced the dimensionality of the generated feature spaces for the SVD method and the two triple-extraction methods using Principal Components Analysis (PCA).",

        "It is interesting to consider the kind of semantic information that is being captured by the resultant PCA components.",
        "In particular, the components appear to capture meaningful distinctions between stimuli.",

        "The fMRI dataset and training and evaluation methodology presented by Mitchell et al.",
        "(2008) gives researchers an interesting new framework with which to evaluate the quality of feature-based conceptual representations extracted from corpora.",
        "This framework avoids some of the problems inherent in evaluating extracted representations against a \"gold standard\" based on participant-generated property norms.",
        "It also provides a rich multidimensional dataset through which the strengths and weaknesses of extraction methods can be identified.",
        "We have applied this evaluation framework to four feature extraction methods which use different sources of information available in corpora to extract conceptual representations.",
        "Surprisingly, in spite of their major differences, we did not find any significant difference in performance between the models.",
        "This finding has interesting theoretical implications, given that previous research has suggested that aspects of meaning defined by sensory-motor verbs may have a somewhat distinctive role to play in predicting the fMRI activation associated with conceptual stimuli (Mitchell et al., 2008).",
        "Our results suggest that general feature-based representations of concepts, which place no a priori distinction on sensory-motor properties, may be equally capable of predicting activation to conceptual stimuli.",
        "This highlights the potential for the Mitchell et al.",
        "method to be used to inform both distributed and sensory-motor accounts of conceptual representation (e.g. McRae et al.",
        "(1997), Cree et al.",
        "(2006), Tyler et al.",
        "(2000), Tyler & Moss (2001), Moss et al.",
        "(2007), Martin & Chao (2001)), as well as providing a benchmark with which to assess semantic model development.",
        "In a similar vein, Murphy et al.",
        "(2009) used a dependency-parsed corpus yielding verb co-occurrence statistics to predict EEG activation patterns with significant accuracy.",
        "The training and evaluation framework presented by Mitchell et al.",
        "(2008) represents just one point in a large space of possibilities for using computational modelling to predict human brain activity associated with conceptual stimuli.",
        "In these initial experiments, we have chosen to follow the Mitchell et al.",
        "approach as closely as possible, in order to maximize comparability with their results.",
        "In future work, we aim to investigate other methods for training and evaluation, other corpora and other sources of imaging data.",
        "Furthermore, we aim to use the evaluation results from such work to inform the development of our extraction method."
