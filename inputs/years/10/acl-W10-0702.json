        "Recent decades have seen rapid development in natural language processing tools for parsing, semantic role-labeling, machine translation, etc., and much of this success can be attributed to the study of statistical techniques and the availability of large annotated corpora for training.",
        "However, the performance of these systems is heavily dependent on the domain and genre of their training data, i.e. systems trained on data from a particular domain tend to perform poorly when applied to other domains and adaptation techniques are not always able to compensate (Dredze et al., 2007).",
        "For this reason, achieving high performance on new domains and genres frequently necessitates the collection of annotated training data from those domains and genres, a time-consuming and frequently expensive process.",
        "This paper examines the problem of collecting high-quality annotations for new genres with a focus on time and cost efficiency.",
        "We explore the well-studied but non-trivial task of prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and describe a semi-automated system for identifying accurate attachments in blog data, which is frequently noisy and difficult to parse.",
        "PP attachment disambiguation involves finding a correct attachment for a prepositional phrase in a sentence.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"We went to John's house on Saturday\", the phrase \"on Saturday\" attaches to the verb \"went\".",
        "In another example, \"We went to John's house on 12th Street\", the PP \"on 12th street\" attaches to the noun \"John's house\".",
        "This sort of disambiguation requires semantic knowledge about sentences that is difficult to glean from their surface form, a problem which is compounded by the informal nature and irregular vocabulary of blog text.",
        "In this work, we investigate whether crowd-sourced human judgments are capable of distinguishing appropriate attachments.",
        "We present a system that simplifies the attachment problem and represents it in a format that can be intuitively tackled by humans.",
        "Our approach to this task makes use of a heuristic-based system built on a shallow parser that identifies the likely words or phrases to which a PP can attach.",
        "To subsequently select the correct attachment, we leverage human judgments from multiple untrained annotators (referred to here as workers) through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, an online marketplace for work.",
        "This two-step approach offers distinct advantages: the automated system cuts down the space of potential attachments effectively with little error, and the disambiguation task can be reduced to small multiple choice questions which can be tackled quickly and aggregated reliably.",
        "The remainder of this paper focuses on the PP attachment task over blog text and our analysis of the resulting aggregate annotations.",
        "We note, however, that this type of semi-automated approach is potentially applicable to any task which can be reliably decomposed into independent judgments that untrained annotators can tackle (e.g., quantifier scoping, conjunction scope).",
        "This work is intended as an initial step towards the development of efficient hybrid annotation tools that seamlessly incorporate aggregate human wisdom alongside effective algorithms."

        "Identifying PP attachments is an essential task for building syntactic parse trees.",
        "While this task has been studied using fully-automated systems, many of them rely on parse tree output for predicting potential attachments (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Yeh and Vilain, 1998; Stetina and Nagao, 1997; Zavrel et al., 1997).",
        "However, systems that rely on good parses are unlikely to perform well on new genres such as blogs and machine translated texts for which parse tree training data is not readily available.",
        "Furthermore, the predominant dataset for evaluating PP attachment is the RRR dataset (Ratna-parkhi et al., 1994) which consists of PP attachment cases from the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank.",
        "Instead of complete sentences, this dataset consists of sets of the form {V,Ni,P,N2} where {P,N2} is the PP and {V,N1} are the potential attachments.",
        "This simplification of the PP attachment task to a choice between two alternatives is unrealistic when considering the potential longdistance attachments encountered in real-world text.",
        "While blogs and other web text, such as discussion forums and emails, have been studied for a variety of tasks such as information extraction (Hong and Davison, 2009), social networking (Gruhl et al., 2004), and sentiment analysis (Leshed and Kaye, 2006), we are not aware of any previous efforts to gather syntactic data (such as PP attachments) in the genre.",
        "Syntactic methods such as POS tagging, parsing and structural disambiguation are commonly used when analyzing well-structured text.",
        "Including the use of syntactic information has yielded improvements in accuracy in speech recognition (Chelba and Jelenik, 1998; Collins et al., 2005) and machine translation (DeNeefe and",
        "Knight, 2009; Carreras and Collins, 2009).",
        "We anticipate that datasets such as ours could be useful for such tasks as well.",
        "Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has become very popular for manual annotation tasks and has been shown to perform equally well over labeling tasks such as affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering and word sense disambiguation, when compared to annotations from experts (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "While these tasks were small in scale and intended to demonstrate the viability of annotation via MTurk, it has also proved effective in large-scale tasks including the collection of accurate speech transcriptions (Gruenstein et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper we explore a method for corpus building on a large scale in order to extend annotation into new domains and genres.",
        "We previously evaluated crowdsourced PP attachment annotation by using MTurk workers to reproduce PP attachments from the Wall Street Journal corpus (Rosenthal et al., 2010).",
        "The results demonstrated that MTurk workers are capable of identifying PP attachments in newswire text, but the approach used to generate attachment options is dependent on the existing gold-standard parse trees and cannot be used on corpora where parse trees are not available.",
        "In this paper, we build on the semi-automated annotation principle while avoiding the dependency on parsers, allowing us to apply this technique to the noisy and informal text found in blogs."

        "In order to compensate for the common occurrence of informal punctuation and web-specific symbols in blog text, we replace all punctuation symbols between quotation marks and parentheses with placeholder tags (e.g. (QuestionMark)) during the sentence splitting process and do the same for website names, time markers and referring phrases (e.g. @John).",
        "Additionally, we attempt to re-split sentences at ellipsis boundaries if they are longer than 80 words and discard them if this fails.",
        "As parsers trained on news corpora tend to perform poorly on unstructured texts like blogs, we rely on a chunker to partition sentences into phrases.",
        "Choosing a good chunker is essential to this approach: around 35% of the cases in which the correct attachment is not predicted by the system are due to chunker error.",
        "We experimented with different chunkers over a random sample of 50 sentences before selecting a CRF-based chunker (Phan, 2006) for its robust performance.",
        "The chunker output is initially processed by fusing together chunks in order to ensure that a single chunk represents a complete attachment point.",
        "Two consecutive NP chunks are fused if the first contains an element with a possessive part of speech tag (e.g. John's book), while particle chunks (PRT) are fused with the VP chunks that precede them (e.g. pack up).",
        "These chunked sentences are then processed to identify PPs and potential attachment points for them, which can then be used to generate questions",

        "We handle compound PPs by breaking them down into multiple simple PPs; compound PPs can be recovered by identifying the attachments of their constituent simple PPs.",
        "Our simple PP extraction algorithm identifies PPs as a sequence of chunks that consist of one or more prepositions terminating in a noun phrase or gerund.",
        "A PP usually attaches to the noun or verb phrase preceding it or, in some cases, can modify a following clause by attaching to the head verb.",
        "We build a set of rules based on this intuition to pick out the potential attachments in the sentence; these rules are described in Table 1.",
