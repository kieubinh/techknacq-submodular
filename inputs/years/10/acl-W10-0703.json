        "For some applications it is useful to disambiguate the meanings of a polysemous word.",
        "For example, if we show a student a text containing a word like \"bank\" and then automatically generate questions about the meaning of that word as it appeared in the text (say as the bank of a river), we would like to have the meaning of the word in the questions match the text meaning.",
        "Teachers do this each time they assess a student on vocabulary knowledge.",
        "For intelligent tutoring systems, two options are available.",
        "The first one is to ask a teacher to go through all the material and label each appearance of a polysemous word with its sense.",
        "This option is used only if there is a relatively small quantity of material.",
        "Beyond that, automatic processing, known as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is essential.",
        "Most approaches are supervised and need large amounts of data to train the classifier for each and every word that is to be taught and assessed.",
        "Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has been used for the purpose of word sense disambiguation (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "The results show that nonexperts do very well (100% accuracy) when asked to identify the correct sense of a word out of a finite set of labels created by an expert.",
        "It is therefore possible to use MTurk to build a training corpus for WSD.",
        "In order to extend the Snow et al. crowdsourced disambiguation to a large number of words, we need an efficient way to create the set of senses of a word.",
        "Asking an expert to do this is costly in time and money.",
        "Thus it is necessary to have an efficient Word Sense Induction (WSI) system.",
        "A WSI system induces the different senses of a word and provides the corresponding sense labels.",
        "This is the first step to crowdsourcing WSD on a large scale.",
        "While many studies have shown that MTurk can be used for labeling tasks (Snow et al., 2008), to rate automatically constructed artifacts (Callison-Burch, 2009, Alonso et al., 2008) and to transcribe speech (Ledlie et al., 2009, Gruenstein et al., 2009), to our knowledge, there has not been much work on evaluating the use of MTurk for clustering tasks.",
        "The goal of this paper is to investigate different options available to crowdsource a clustering task and evaluate their efficiency in the concrete application of word sense induction."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "Our interest in the use of MTurk for disambiguation comes from work on a vocabulary tutor; REAP (Heilman et al., 2006).",
        "The tutor searches for documents from the Web that are appropriate for a student to use to learn vocabulary from context (appropriate reading level, for example).",
        "Since the system finds a large number of documents, making a rich repository of learning material, it is impossible to process all the documents manually.",
        "When a document for vocabulary learning is presented to a student, the system should show the definition of the words to be learned (focus words).",
        "In some cases a word has several meanings for the same part of speech and thus it has several definitions.",
        "Hence the need for WSD to be included in vocabulary tutors.",
        "The identification of a list of senses for a given word in a corpus of documents is called word sense induction (WSI).",
        "SemEval 2007 and 2010 (SigLex, 2008) both evaluate WSI systems.",
        "The I2R system achieved the best results in 2007 with an F-score of 81.6% (I2R by Niu (2007)).",
        "Snow et al. (2007) have a good description of the inherent problem of WSI where the appropriate granularity of the clusters varies for each application.",
        "They try to solve this problem by building hierarchical-like word sense structures.",
        "In our case, each dictionary definition for a word could be considered as a unique sense for that word.",
        "Then, when using MTurk as a platform for WSD, we could simply ask the workers to select which of the dictionary definitions best expresses the meaning of the words in a document.",
        "The problem here is that most dictionaries give quite several definitions for a word.",
        "Defining one sense label per dictionary definition would result in too many labels, which would, in turn, make the MTurk WSD less efficient and our dataset sparser, thus decreasing the quality of the classifier.",
        "Another option, investigated by Chklovski and Mihalcea (2003), is to use",
        "WordNet sense definitions as the possible labels.",
        "They obtained more than 100,000 labeled instances from a crowd of volunteers.",
        "They conclude that WordNet senses are not coarse enough to provide high interannotator agreement, and exploit workers disagreement on the WSD task to derive coarser senses.",
        "The granularity of the senses for each word is a parameter that is dependent on the application.",
        "In our case, we want to be able to assess a student on the sense of a word that the student has just been taught.",
        "Learners have the ability to generalize the context in which a word is learned.",
        "For example, if a student learns the meaning of the word \"bark\" as the sound of a dog, they can generalize that this can also apply to human shouting.",
        "Hence, there is no need for two separate senses here.",
        "However, a student could not generalize the meaning \"hard cover of a tree\" from that first meaning of \"bark\".",
        "This implies that students should be able to distinguish coarse word senses.",
        "(Kulkarni et al., 2007) have looked at automatic clustering of dictionary definitions.",
        "They compared K-Means clustering with Spectral Clustering.",
        "Various features were investigated: raw, normalized word overlap with and without stop words.",
        "The best combination results in 74% of the clusters having no misclassified definitions.",
        "If those misclassified definitions end up being used to represent possible sense labels in WSD, wrong labels might decrease the quality of the disambiguation stage.",
        "If a student is shown a definition that does not match the sense of a word in a particular context, they are likely to build the wrong conceptual link.",
        "Our application requires higher accuracy than that achieved by automatic approaches, since students' learning can be directly affected by the error rate.",
        "The possible interaction between users and clustering algorithms has been explored in the past.",
        "Huang and Mitchell (2006) present an example of how user feedback can be used to improve clustering results.",
        "In this study, the users were not asked to provide clustering solutions.",
        "Instead, they fine tuned the automatically generated solution.",
        "With the advent of MTurk, we can use human judgment to build clustering solutions.",
        "There are multiple approaches for combining workforce: parallel with aggregation (Snow et al., 2008), iterative (Little et al., 2009) and collaboration between workers (Horton, Turker Talk, 2009).",
        "These strategies have been investigated for many applications, most of which are for labeling, a few for clustering.",
        "The Deneme blog presents an experiment where website clustering is carried out using",
        "MTurk (Little, Website Clustering, 2009).",
        "The workers' judgments on the similarity between two websites are used to build a distance matrix for the distance between websites.",
        "Jagadeesan and others (2009) asked workers to identify similar objects in a pool of 3D CAD models.",
        "They then used frequently co-occurring objects to build a distance matrix, upon which they then applied hierarchical clustering.",
        "Those two approaches are different: the first gives the worker only two items of the set (a local view of the task), while the latter offers the worker a global view of the task.",
        "In the next sections we will measure the accuracy of these approaches and their advantages and disadvantages."

        "D. To tie a bandage firmly around an injured part of someone's body, strap",
        "E. To fasten a package, box etc with tape",
        "Since our two approaches are based on the result of the first HIT, which determines the number of clusters, the accuracy of that first task is extremely important.",
        "It turns out that the correlation between the crowd solution and the experts (0.67) is actually higher than the average correlation between experts (0.63).",
        "One way to explain this is that of the 4 experts, 3 had a similar opinion on what the grain size should be, while the other one had a different opinion.",
        "The crowd picked a grain size that was actually between those two opinions, thus resulting in a higher correlation.",
        "This hypothesis is also supported by Table 3.",
        "The average difference in the number of clusters is lower for the NE solution than for any expert solution.",
        "The crowd of 13 was able to come up with a grain size that could be seen as a good consensus of the four annotators' grain size.",
        "This allows us to believe that using the crowd to determine the number of clusters for our two approaches is a reliable technique.",
        "As expected, Table 3 indicates that our two setups behave better than randomly assigning definitions to clusters.",
        "This is a good indication that the workers did not complete our tasks randomly.",
        "The automatic approach (K-Means) clearly behaves better than the random baseline.",
        "However, the clusters obtained with this approach agree less with the experts than any of our crowdsourced approaches.",
        "This confirms the intuition that humans are better at distinguishing word senses than an automatic approach like K-Means.",
        "Our first hypothesis was that global-view would give us the best results: since the worker completing a global-view HIT has an overall view of the task, they should be able to provide a better solu-",
        "The crowd created two clusters: one by grouping A and C to create a \"record audio/video\" sense, and another one by grouping B,D and E to create a \"fasten\" sense.",
        "This solution was also chosen by two of the four experts.",
        "One of the other experts grouped definitions E with A and C, which is clearly an error since there is no shared meaning.",
        "The last expert created three clusters, by assigning D to a different cluster than B and E. This decision can be considered valid since there is a small semantic distinction between D and B/E from the fact that D is \"fasten\" for the specific case of injured body parts.",
        "However, a student could generalize D from B and E. So that expert's grain size does not correspond to our specifications.",
        "We investigated two different aggregation techniques for clustering solutions, CSPA and centroid identification.",
        "In this application, both techniques give very similar results with only 2 clusters out of 50 words differing between the two techniques.",
        "Centroid identification is easier to implement, and doesn't require reclustering the elements.",
        "Figure 1 shows the impact of adding more workers to the crowd.",
        "While it seems advantageous to use 3 workers' opinions rather than only 1, (gain of 0.04), adding a fourth and fifth worker does not improve the average ITA.",
        "Local-view is more tolerant to errors than global-view.",
        "If a chaotic worker randomly answers one pair of elements, the entire final clustering will not be affected.",
        "If a chaotic (or cheating) worker answers randomly in global-view, the entire clustering solution will be random.",
        "Thus, while a policy of using only one worker's answer for a local-view",

        "-■-local-view – • – global-view / centroid",
        "Figure 2 Distribution of the number of definitions",
        "HIT could be adopted, the same policy might result in poor clustering if used for the global-view HIT.",
        "However, global-view has the advantage over local-view of being cheaper.",
        "Figure 2 shows the distribution of the number of definitions extracted from both LDOCE and CALD per word (starting at word with more than 6 definitions).",
        "Since the local-view cost increases in a quadratic manner as the number of elements to cluster increases it would cost more than $275,000 to group the definitions of 30,000 words coming from the two dictionaries (using the parameters described in 3).",
        "It would be possible to modify it to only ask workers for the similarity of a subset of pairs of elements and then reconstruct the incomplete distance matrix (Hathaway and Bezdek, 2002).",
        "A better option for clustering a very large amount of elements is to use global-view.",
        "For the same 30,000 words above, the cost of grouping definitions using this technique would be around $4,500.",
        "This would imply that worker would have to create clusters from set of over 22 definitions.",
        "Keeping the cost constant while increasing the number of elements to cluster might decrease the workers' motivation.",
        "Thus scaling up a global-view HIT requires increasing the reward.",
        "It also requires vigilance on how much cognitive load the workers have to handle.",
        "Cognitive load can be seen as a function of the number of elements to cluster and of the number of clusters that a new element can be assigned to.",
        "If a worker only has to decide if an element should be in A or B, the cognitive load is low.",
        "But if the worker has to decide among many more classes, the cognitive load may increase to a point where the worker is hampered from providing a correct answer."

        "We evaluated two different approaches for crowd-sourcing dictionary definition clustering as a means of achieving WSI.",
        "Global-view provides an interface to the worker where all the elements to be clustered are displayed, while local-view displays only two elements at a time and prompts the worker for their similarity.",
        "Both approaches show as much agreement with experts as the experts do with one another.",
        "Applying either CSPA or centroid identification allows the solution to benefit from the wisdom of crowd effect, and shows similar results.",
        "While global-view is cheaper than local-view, it is also strongly affected by worker error, and sensitive to the effect of increased cognitive load.",
        "It appears that the task of clustering definitions to form word senses is a subjective one, due to different ideas of what the grain size of the senses should be.",
        "Thus, even though it seems that our two approaches provide results that are as good as those of an expert, it would be interesting to try crowdsourced clustering on a clustering problem where an objective ground truth exists.",
        "For example, we could take several audio recordings from each of several different persons.",
        "After mixing up the recordings from the different speakers, we could ask workers to clusters all the recordings from the same person.",
        "This would provide an even stronger evaluation of local-view against globalview since we could compare them to the true solution, the real identity of the speaker.",
        "There are several interesting modifications that could also be attempted.",
        "The local-view task could ask for similarity on a scale of 1 to 5, instead of a binary choice of same/different meaning.",
        "Also, since using global-view with one large problem causes high cognitive load, we could partition a bigger problem, e.g., with 30 definitions, into 3 problems including 10 definitions.",
        "Using the same interface as global-view, the workers could cluster the sub-problems.",
        "We could then use CSPA to merge local clusters into a final cluster with the 30 definitions.",
        "In this paper we have examined clustering word sense definitions.",
        "Two approaches were studied, and their advantages and disadvantages were described.",
        "We have shown that the use of human computation for WSI, with an appropriate crowd size and mean of aggregation, is as reliable as using expert judgments."
