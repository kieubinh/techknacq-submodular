        "For example (Kaisser et al., 2008) and (Kaisser and Lowe, 2008) used MTurk to build question answering datasets and choose summary lengths that suite the need of the users.",

        "In this task, we want to collect manual word alignment data from MTurk workers, Figure 2 shows an example of word alignment.",
        "There are two sentences which are translation of each other.",
        "There are links between words in two sentences, indicating the words are translation pairs.",
        "Notice that one word can be aligned to zero or more words, if a word is aligned to zero word, we can assume it is aligned to a virtual empty word.",
        "Therefore, given a sentence pair, we want workers to link words in source sentence to one or more target words or the empty word.",
        "In our experiment, we use a Chinese-English parallel corpus and ask workers to alignment the words in Chinese sentence to the words in English sentence.",
        "We do not provide any alignment links from automatic aligner.",
        "2.1 Guidelines of design",
        "MTurk represents a new pattern of market that has yet be thoroughly studied.",
        "Mason and Watts (2009) shows that higher payment does not guarantee results with higher quality.",
        "Also, one should be aware that the web-based interface is vulnerable to automatic scripts that generate highly consistent yet meaningless results.",
        "To ensure a better result, several measures must be combined: 1) Require workers to take qualifications before they can accept the tasks.",
        "2) Implement an interface less vulnerable to automatic scripts.",
        "3) Build quality control mechanism that filters inaccurate results, and finally 4) Redesign the interface so that the time spent by careful and careless workers does not differ too much, so there is less incentives for workers to submit random results.",
        "With these guidelines in mind, we put together several elements into the HIT.",
        "Qualifications",
        "We require the workers to take qualifications, which requires them to pick correct translation of five Chinese words.",
        "The Chinese word is rendered in bitmap.",
        "Interface implementation",
        "We implemented the word alignment interface on top of Google Web Toolkit, which enables developing Javascript based Web application in Java.",
        "Because all the content of the interface, including the content in the final result, is generated dynamically in the run time, it is much more difficult to hack than plain HTML forms.",
        "Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the interface.",
        "The labeling procedure requires only mouse click.",
        "The worker need to label all the words with a golden background.",
        "To complete the task, the worker needs to: 1) Click on the",
        "Chinese word he want to label.",
        "2) Click on the English words he want the Chinese word to be linked, or click on the empty word to the end of the sentence.",
        "3) If he want to delete a link, he need to click on the English word again, otherwise he can move on to next unlabeled word, or to modify links on another labeled word.",
        "4) Only when all required words are labeled, the user would be allowed to click on submit button.",
        "The interface has two more functionalities, first, it allows to specify a subset of words in the sentence for user to label, as shown in the snapshot, words with white background are not required to label.",
        "Secondly it supports providing initial alignment on the sentence.",
        "Quality control",
        "Quality control is a crucial component of the system.",
        "For problems that have clear gold standard answers to a portion of data, the quality control can be done by mingling the known into the unknown, and rejecting the submissions with low qualities on known samples.",
        "However in our situation it is not easy to do so because although we have fully manual aligned sentences, we do not have corpus in which the sentences are partially aligned, therefore if we want to use the method we have to let worker label an additional sentence, which may double the effort for the workers.",
        "Also we do not provide thorough standard for users, therefore before we know the divergence of the alignments, we actually do not know how to set the threshold, even with given gold standard labels.",
        "In addition, if the method will be applied on languages with low resource, we cannot assume availability of gold standard answers.",
        "Therefore, we only try to filter out answers base on the consensus.",
        "The quality control works as follows.",
        "Firstly we assign an alignment task to 2n +1 workers.",
        "For these submissions, we first try to build a majority answer from these assignments.",
        "For each alignment link, if it appears in more than n submissions.",
        "Then every individual assignments will be compared to the majority alignment, so we can get the precision and recall rates.",
        "If either precision or recall rate is lower than a threshold, we will reject the submission.",
        "alt-aligner.appspot.com, the source code of the aligner is distributed under Apache License 2.0 on http:// code.google.com/p/alt-aligner/",
        "We tried two pricing strategies.",
        "The first one fixes the number of words that a worker need to label for each HIT, and fix the rate for each HIT.",
        "The second one always asks workers to label every word in the sentence, in the mean time we vary the rate for each HIT according to the lengths of source sentences.",
        "For each strategy we tried different rates, starting from 10 words per cent.",
        "However we did not get enough workers even after the price raised to 2 words per cent.",
        "The result indicates a limited worker base of Chinese speakers."

        "The algorithm will update the center alignment as long as a better alignment can be found, and finally outputs a local optimal alignment.",
        "The neighbor alignments of the alignment are then used in collecting the counts for the M Step.",
