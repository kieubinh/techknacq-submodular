        "This paper discusses the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to rate computer-generated reading comprehension questions about Wikipedia articles.",
        "We have developed a question generation system (Heilman and Smith, 2009; Heilman and Smith, 2010) that uses the overgenerate-and-rank paradigm (Langkilde and Knight, 1998).",
        "In the the overgenerate-and-rank approach, many systemgenerated outputs are ranked in order to select higher quality outputs.",
        "While the approach has had considerable success in natural language generation (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Walker et al., 2001), it often requires human labels on system output for the purpose of learning to rank.",
        "We employ MTurk to reduce the time and cost of acquiring these labels.",
        "For many problems, large labeled datasets do not exist.",
        "One alternative is to build rule-based systems, but it is often difficult and time-consuming to accurately encode relevant linguistic knowledge in rules.",
        "Another alternative, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, usually requires clever formulations of bias that guide the learning process (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995); such intuitions are not always available.",
        "Thus, small, application-specific labeled datasets, which can be cheaply constructed using MTurk, may provide considerable benefits by enabling the use of supervised learning.",
        "In addition to using MTurk ratings to train a learned ranking component, we could also use MTurk ratings to evaluate the final top-ranked output of our system.",
        "More generally, MTurk can be a useful evaluation tool for systems that output natural language (e.g., systems for natural language generation, summarization, translation).",
        "For example, Callison-Burch (2009) used MTurk to evaluate machine translations.",
        "MTurk facilitates the efficient measurement and understanding of errors made by such technologies, and could be used to complement automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Pap-ineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004).",
        "It is true that, for our task, MTurk workers annotate computer-generated rather than human-generated natural language.",
        "Thus, the data will not be as generally useful as other types of annotations, such as parse trees, which could be used to build general purpose syntactic parsers.",
        "However, for the reasons described above, we believe the use of MTurk to rate computer-generated output can be useful for the training, development, and evaluation of language technologies.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: §2 and §3 briefly describe the question generation system and corpora used in our experiments.",
        "§4 provides the details of our rating scheme.",
        "§5 discusses the quantity, cost, speed, and quality of the ratings we gathered.",
        "§6 presents preliminary experiments showing that the MTurk ratings improve question ranking.",
        "Finally, in §7, we conclude."

        "This rule system is complemented by a statistical ranker, which ranks questions according to their quality.",
        "Currently, we focus on basic linguistic issues and the goal of producing acceptable questions – that is, questions that are grammatical, make sense, and are not vague.",

        "Our system is described by Heilman and Smith (2010).",
