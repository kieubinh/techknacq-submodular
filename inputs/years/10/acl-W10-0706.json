        "Suitable tasks are best limited to those easily accomplished in 'short bites' requiring little context switching.",
        "For instance, most annotation tasks in prior work (Snow et al., 2008) required selection from an enumerated list, allowing for easy automated quality control and data collection.",

        "In this paper, we extend open ended collection even further by eliciting narrations of English Wikipedia articles.",

        "We use Wikipedia narrations as an initial proof-of-concept for other more challenging elicitation tasks such as spontaneous or conversational speech.",
        "While previous work used other Turkers in second-pass filtering for quality control, we flip this process and instead require that narrators be judged favorably before working on full narration tasks.",
        "Relying on human opinion sidesteps the difficult task of automatically judging narrative quality.",

        "Articles averaged 40 paragraphs, so each HIT averaged $2 in payment - some as little as $0.25.",
        "We provided instructions for using recording software and asked Turkers to record one paragraph at a time.",

        "However, the definition of a \"good speaking voice\" is not easy to quantify.",
        "Luckily, this task is well suited to Mechanical Turk's concept of artificial artificial intelligence.",
        "Humans can easily decide a narrator's quality while automatic methods would be impractical.",
        "Additionally, we never define what a 'good' narration voice is, relying instead on public opinion.",
        "We implemented the qualification ratings using the API with three different steps.",
        "Turkers who wish to complete the full narration HITs are first directed to a 'qualification' HIT with one sample paragraph paying $0.05.",
        "We then use other Turkers to rate the quality of the narrator, asking them to judge based on speaking style, audio clarity and pronunciation.",
        "Post Qualification The narration qualification and full narration HITs are posted.",
        "Sample HIT A prospective narrator uploads a recording of a sample paragraph earning $0.05.",
        "The audio is downloaded and hosted on our web host.",
        "Rating HIT A HIT is created to be completed ten times.",
        "Turkers make a binary decision as to whether they would listen to a full article by the narrator and optionally suggest feedback.",
        "Grant Qualification The ten ratings are collected and if five or more are positive we grant the qualification.",
        "The narrator is then automatically contacted with the decision and provided with any feedback from the rating Turkers.",
        "Although not straightforward, the API made it possible to dynamically create HITs, approve assignments, sync audio files and ratings,notify workers and grant qualifications.",
        "It does not, however, manage state across HITs, requiring us to implement our own control logic for associating workers with narration and rating HITs.",
        "Once implemented, managing the process was as simple as invoking three perl scripts a few times a day.",
        "These could easily be rolled into one background process automatically controlling the entire workflow.",
        "Thirteen Turkers submitted sample audio files over the course of a week.",
        "Collecting the ten ratings took a few hours per Turker.",
        "The average rating for the narrators was 7.5, with three of the thirteen being rejected for having a score less than 5.",
        "The authors agreed with the sentiment of the raters and feel that the qualification process correctly filtered out the poor narrators.",
        "Below is a sample of the comments for an approved narrator and a rejected narrator.",
        "This Turker was approved with 9/10 votes.",
        "• The narration was very easy to understand.",
        "The speaker's tone was even, well-paced, and clear.",
        "Great narration.",

        "• Monotone voice, uninterested and barely literate.",
        "I would never listen to this voice for any length of time.",
        "• muddy audio quality; narrator has a tired and a very low tone quality.",
        "• Very solemn voice - didn't like listening to it.",
        "5 Data Analysis",
        "Of the thirteen qualified Turkers, only two went on to complete full narrations.",
        "This happened only after we shortened the articles to the initial five paragraphs and raised payment to $0.25 per paragraph.",
        "While the audio was clear, both authors exhibited mispronunciations of domain-specific terms.",
        "For instance, one author narrating Isaac Newton mispronounced Principia with a soft c (/prinsipia/) instead of a hard c (/prinkipia/) and indices as /indâisez/.",
        "Since the text is known ahead of time, one could include a pronunciation guide for rare words to assist the narrator.",
        "The more disapointing result, however, is the very slow return of the narration task.",
        "Contrasting with the successful elicitation of (McGraw et al., 2010), two reasons clearly stand out.",
        "First, these tasks were much too long in length.",
        "This was due to constraints we placed on collection to improve data quality.",
        "We assumed that multiple narrators for a single article would ruin the narrative flow.",
        "Since few workers were willing to complete five recordings, future work could chop each article into smaller chunks to be completed by multiple narrators.",
        "In contrast, eliciting spoken addresses has no need for continuity across samples, thus the individual HITs in (McGraw et al., 2010) could be much smaller.",
        "Second, and more importantly, our HITs required much more effort on the part of the Turker.",
        "We chose to fully use Mechanical Turk's API to manage data and did not implement audio recording or data transmission through the browser.",
        "Turkers were required to record audio in a separate program and then upload the files.",
        "We thought the added ability to rerecord and review audio would be a plus compared to in-browser recording.",
        "In contrast, (McGraw et al., 2010) used a javascript package to record narrations directly in the browser window.",
        "While it was simple to use the API, it raised too much of a barrier for Turkers to complete the task.",
        "Regardless of the task effectiveness, it is not clear that Mechanical Turk is cost effective for large scale narration.",
        "A reasonable first task would be to narrate the 2500 featured articles on Wikipedia's home page.",
        "They average 44 paragraphs in length with around 4311 words per article.",
        "Narrating this corpus would cost $5500 at the rate of $0.05 per paragraph if workers would be willing to complete at that rate."

        "Our experiments with Mechanical Turk attempted to find the limits of data collection and nebulous task definitions.",

        "This task exploited the strenghts of Mechanical Turk by quickly gathering judgements that are easy for humans to make but near impossible to reliably automate.",
        "The contrast between the failure of this narration task and the success of previous elicitation is due to the nature of the underlying task.",
