        "Orthographic transcription of large amounts of speech is necessary for improving speech recognition results.",
        "Transcription, however, is a time consuming and costly procedure.",
        "Typical transcription speeds for spontaneous, conversational speech are around 7 to 10 times real-time (Glenn and Strassel, 2008).",
        "The transcription of non-native speech is an even more difficult task-one study reports an average transcription time of 12 times real-time for spontaneous non-native speech (Zechner, 2009).",
        "In addition to being more costly and time consuming, transcription of non-native speech results in a higher level of disagreement among transcribers in comparison to native speech.",
        "This is especially true when the speaker's proficiency is low and the speech contains large numbers of grammatical errors, incorrect collocations, and disfluencies.",
        "For example, one study involving highly predictable speech shows a decline in transcriber agreement (measured using Word Error Rate, WER) from 3.6% for native speech to 6.4% for non-native speech (Marge et al., to appear).",
        "Another study involving spontaneous non-native speech showed a range of WER between 15% and 20% (Zechner, 2009).",
        "This study uses the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) resource to obtain multiple transcriptions for non-native speech.",
        "We then investigate several methods for combining these multiple sources of information from individual MTurk workers (turkers) in an attempt to obtain a final merged transcription that is more accurate than the individual transcriptions.",
        "This methodology results in transcriptions that approach the level of expert transcribers on this difficult task.",
        "Furthermore, a substantial savings in cost can be achieved."

        "Due to its ability to provide multiple sources of information for a given task in a cost-effective way, several recent studies have combined multiple MTurk outputs for NLP annotation tasks.",
        "For example, one study involving annotation of emotions in text used average scores from up to 10 turk-ers to show the minimum number of MTurk annotations required to achieve performance comparable to experts (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "Another study used preference voting to combine up to 5 MTurk rankings of machine translation quality and showed that the resulting judgments approached expert inter-annotator agreement (Callison-Burch, 2009).",
        "These tasks, however, are much simpler than transcription.",
        "MTurk has been used extensively as a transcription provider, as is apparent from the success of a middleman site that act as an interface to MTurk for transcription tasks.",
        "However, to our knowledge, only one previous study has systematically evaluated the quality of MTurk transcriptions (Marge et al., to appear).",
        "This recent study also combined multiple MTurk transcriptions using the ROVER method (Fiscus, 1997) to produce merged transcriptions that approached the accuracy of expert transcribers.",
        "Our study is similar to that study, except that the speech data used in our study is much more difficult to transcribe-the utterances used in that study were relatively predictable (providing route instructions for robots), and contained speech from native speakers and high-proficiency non-native speakers.",
        "Furthermore, we investigate two additional merging algorithms in an attempt to improve over the performance of ROVER."

        "The audio files used in this experiment consist of responses to an assessment of English proficiency for non-native speakers.",

        "In the spontaneous task, the speakers were asked to respond with their opinion about a topic described in the prompt.",
        "The speech in these responses is thus highly unpredictable.",
        "In the read-aloud task, on the other hand, the speakers were asked to read a paragraph out loud.",
        "For these responses, the speech is highly predictable; any deviations from the target script are due to reading errors or disfluencies.",
        "For this experiment, one set of 10 spontaneous (SP) responses (30 seconds in duration) and two sets of 10 read-aloud (RA) responses (60 seconds in duration) were used.",
        "Table 1 displays the characteristics of the responses in the three batches.",
        "The tasks were submitted to the MTurk interface in batches of 10, and a turker was required to complete the entire batch in order to receive payment.",
        "Turkers received $3 for a complete batch of transcriptions ($0.30 per transcription).",
        "Different interfaces were used for transcribing the two types of responses.",
        "For the spontaneous responses, the task was a standard transcription task: the turkers were instructed to enter the words that they heard in the audio file into a text box.",
        "For the read-aloud responses, on the other hand, they were provided with the target text of the prompt, one word per line.",
        "They were instructed to make annotations next to words in cases where the speaker deviated from the target text (indicating substitutions, deletions, and insertions).",
        "For both types of transcription task, the turkers were required to successfully complete a short training task before proceeding onto the batch of 10 responses."

        "Then, each transcription is compared to the LCS, and any portions of the transcription that are missing between words of the LCS are tallied.",
        "Finally, words are interpolated into the LCS by selecting the most frequent missing sequence from the set of transcriptions (including the empty sequence); as with the ROVER method, ties are broken by a random choice among the most frequent candidates.",

        "New nodes are only added to the graph when necessary.",
        "Then, to produce the merged transcription, the optimal path through the lattice is determined.",
        "Three different configurations for computing the optimal path through the lattice method were compared.",
        "In the first configuration, \"Lattice (TW),\" the weight of a path through the lattice is determined simply by adding up the total of the weights of each edge in the path.",
        "Note that this method tends to favor longer paths over shorter ones, assuming equal edge weights.",
        "In the next configuration, \"Lattice (AEW),\" a cost for each node based on the average edge weight is subtracted as each edge of the lattice is traversed, in order to ameliorate the preference for longer paths.",
        "Finally, in the third configuration, \"Lattice (TWPN),\" the weight of a path through the lattice is defined as the total path weight in the \"Lattice (TW)\" method, normalized by the number of nodes in the path (again, to offset the preference for longer paths).",
        "All three of the methods for merging transcriptions are sensitive to the order in which the individual transcriptions are considered.",
        "Thus, in order to accurately evaluate the methods, for each number of transcriptions used to create the merged transcription, N G {3,4, 5 j, all possible permutations of all possible combinations were considered.",

        "As is clear from the levels of disagreement between the expert transcriber and the gold standard transcription for all three tasks, these responses are much more difficult to transcribe accurately than native spontaneous speech.",
        "For native speech, expert transcribers can usually reach agreement levels over 95% (Deshmukh et al., 1996).",
        "For these responses, however, the WER for the expert transcriber was worse than this even for the read-aloud speech.",
        "These low levels of agreement can be attributed to the fact that the speech is drawn from a wide range of English proficiency levels among test-takers.",
        "Most of the responses contain disfluencies, grammatical errors, and mispronunciations, leading to increased transcriber uncertainty.",

        "For the spontaneous responses, the performance of the best methods still lagged behind the expert transcription, even when five MTurk transcriptions were used.",
        "Due to the consistent increase in performance, and the low cost of adding additional transcribers (in this study the cost was $0.30 per audio minute for read-aloud speech and $0.60 per audio minute for spontaneous speech), the approach of combining multiple transcriptions should always be considered when MTurk is used for transcription.",
