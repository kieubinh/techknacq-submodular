        "Large scale parallel data generation for new language pairs requires intensive human effort and availability of bilingual speakers.",
        "Only a few languages in the world enjoy sustained research interest and continuous financial support for development of automatic translation systems.",
        "For most remaining languages there is very little interest or funding available and limited or expensive access to experts for data elicitation.",
        "Crowd-sourcing compensates for the lack of experts with a large pool of expert/non-expert crowd.",
        "However, crowd-sourcing has thus far been explored in the context of eliciting annotations for a supervised classification task, typically monolingual in nature (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "In this shared task we test the feasibility of eliciting parallel data for Machine Translation (MT) using Mechanical Turk (MTurk).",
        "MT poses an interesting challenge as we require turkers to have understanding/writing skills in both the languages.",
        "Our work is similar to some recent work on crowd-sourcing and machine translation (Ambati et al., 2010; Callison-Burch, 2009), but focuses primarily on the setup and design of translation tasks on MTurk with varying granularity levels, both at sentence-and phrase-level translation."

        "We first conduct a pilot study by posting 25 sentences each from a variety of language pairs and probing to see the reception on MTurk.",
        "Language-pair selection was based on number of speakers in the language and Internet presence of the population.",
        "Languages like Spanish, Chinese, English, Arabic are spoken by many and have a large presence of users on the Internet.",
        "Those like Urdu, Tamil, Telugu although spoken by many are not well represented on the Web.",
        "Languages like Swahili, Zulu, Haiti are neither spoken by many nor have a great presence on the Web.",
        "For this pilot study we selected Spanish, Chinese, English, Urdu, Telugu, Hindi, Haitian Creole languages.",
        "We do not select German, French and other language pairs as they have already been explored by Callison-Burch (2009).",
        "Our pilot study helped us calibrate the costs for different language pairs as well as helped us select the languages to pursue further experiments.",
        "We found that at lower pay rates like 1 cent, it is difficult to find a sufficient number of translators to complete the task.",
        "For example, we could not find turkers to complete the translation from English to Haitian-Creole even after a period of 10 days.",
        "Haitian creole is spoken by a small population and it seems that only a very small portion of that was on MTurk.",
        "For a few other languages pairs, while we could find a few turkers attempting the task, the price had to be increased to attract any attention.",
        "Table 1 shows the findings of our pilot study.",
        "We show the minimum cost at which we could start getting turkers to provide translations and the number of days they took to complete the task.",
        "MTurk has so far been a suppliers' market, and translation of rare-languages shows how a limited supply of turkers leads to a buyer's market; only fair."

        "We use MTurk for all our crowd-sourcing experiments.",
        "In case of MT, a HIT on MTurk is one or more sentences in the source language that need to be translated to a target language.",
        "Making sure that the workers understand the task is the first step towards a successful elicitation using the crowd.",
        "We provide detailed instructions on the HIT for both completion of the task and its evaluation.",
        "Mechanical turk also has a provision to seek annotations from qualified workers, from a specific location with a specific success rate in their past HITs.",
        "For all our HITs we set the worker qualification threshold to 90%.",
        "We use the terms HIT vs. task and turker vs. translator interchangeably.",
        "Quality assurance is a concern with an online crowd where the expertise of the turkers is unknown.",
        "We also notice from the datasets we receive that consistently poor and noisy translators exist.",
        "Problems like blank annotations, misspelling, copy-pasting of input are prevalent, but easy to identify.",
        "Turkers who do not understand the task but attempt it anyway are the more difficult ones to identify, but this is to be expected with non-experts.",
        "Redundancy of translations for the input and computing majority consensus translation is agreed to be an effective solution to identify and prune low quality translation.",
        "We discuss in following section computation of majority vote using fuzzy matching.",
        "For a language pair like Urdu-English, we noticed a strange scenario, where the translations from two turkers were significantly worse in quality, but consistently matched each other, there by falsely boosting the majority vote.",
        "We suspect this to be a case of cheating, but this exposes a loop in majority voting which needs to be addressed, perhaps by also using gold standard data.",
        "Turking Machines: We also have the problem of machines posing as turkers - 'Turking machine' problem.",
        "With the availability of online translation systems like Google translate, Yahoo translate (Ba-belfish) and Babylon, translation tasks on MTurk become easy targets to this problem.",
        "Turkers either use automatic scripts to get/post data from automatic MT systems, or make slight modifications to disguise the fact.",
        "This defeats the purpose of the task, as the resulting corpus would then be biased towards some existing automatic MT system.",
        "It is extremely important to keep gamers in check; not only do they pollute the quality of the crowd data, but their completion of a HIT means it becomes unavailable to genuine turkers who are willing to provide valuable translations.",
        "We, therefore, collect translations from existing automatic MT services and use them to match and block submissions from gamers.",
        "We rely on some gold-standard to identify genuine matches with automatic translation services.",
        "Due to the natural variability in style of turkers, there could be multiple different, but perfectly valid translations for a given sentence.",
        "Therefore it is difficult to match translation outputs from two turk-ers or even with gold standard data.",
        "We therefore need a fuzzy matching algorithm to account for lexical choices, synonymy, word ordering and morphological variations.",
        "This problem is similar to the task of automatic translation output evaluation and so we use METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), an automatic MT evaluation metric for comparing two sentences.",
        "METEOR has an internal aligner that matches words in the sentences given and scores them separately based on whether the match was supported by synonymy, exact match or fuzzy match.",
        "The scores are then combined to provide a global matching score.",
        "If the score is above a threshold ö, we treat the sentences to be equivalent translations of the source sentence.",
        "We can set the ö parameter to different values, based on what is acceptable to the application.",
        "In our experiments, we set ö = 0.7.",
        "We did not choose BLEU scoring metric as it is strongly oriented towards exact matching and high precision, than towards robust matching for high recall.",

        "For example more than 50% of the Spanish-English tasks were completed in India, and in some cases a direct output of automatic translation services.",
