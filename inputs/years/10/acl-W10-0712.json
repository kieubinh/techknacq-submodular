        "It is well known that the performance of many machine learning systems is heavily determined by the size and quality of the data used as input to the training algorithms.",
        "Additionally, for certain applications in natural language processing (NLP), it has been noted that the particular algorithms or feature sets used tend to become irrelevant as the size of the corpus increases (Banko and Brill 2001).",
        "It is therefore not surprising that obtaining large annotated datasets is an issue of great practical importance for the working researcher.",
        "Traditionally, annotated training data have been provided by experts in the field or the researchers themselves, often at great costs in terms of time and money.",
        "Recently, however, attempts have been made to leverage non-expert annotations provided by Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service to create large training corpora at a fraction of the usual costs (Snow et al.",
        "2008).",
        "The initial results seem promising, and a new avenue for enhancing existing sources of annotated data appears to have been opened.",
        "Named entity recognition (NER) is one of the many fields of NLP that rely on machine learning methods, and therefore large training corpora.",
        "Indeed, it is a field where more is almost always better, as indicated by the traditional use of named entity gazetteers (often culled from external sources) to simulate data that would have been inferred from a larger training set (Minkov et al.",
        "2005; Mikheev et al.",
        "1999).",
        "Therefore, it appears to be a field that could profit from the enormous bargain-price workforce available through MTurk.",
        "It is not immediately obvious, though, that MTurk is well-suited for the task of NER annotation.",
        "Commonly, MTurk has been used for the classification task (Snow et al.",
        "2008) or for straightforward data entry.",
        "However, NER does not fit well into either of these formats.",
        "As pointed out by Kozareva (2006), NER can be thought of as a composition of two subtasks: 1) determining the start and end boundaries of a textual entity, and 2) determining the label of the identified span.",
        "The second task is the well-understood classification task, but the first task presents subtler problems.",
        "One is that MTurk's form-based user interface is inappropriate for the task of identifying textual spans.",
        "Another problem is that MTurk's fixed-fee payment system encourages low recall on the part of the annotators, since they receive the same pay no matter how many entities they identify.",
        "This paper addresses both of these problems by describing a custom user interface and competitive payment system that together create a fluid user experience while encouraging high-quality annotations.",
        "Further, we demonstrate that MTurk successfully scales to the task of annotating a very large set of documents (over 20,000), with each document annotated by multiple workers.",
        "We also present a system for resolving inter-annotator conflicts to create the final training corpus, and determine the ideal agreement threshold to maximize precision and recall of a statistical named entity recognition model.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate that a model trained on our corpus is on par with one trained from expert annotations, when applied to a labeled test set."

        "Mechanical Turk is a virtual market in which any requester can post tasks that are simple for humans but difficult for computers.",
        "MTurk has been adopted for a variety of uses both in industry and academia from user studies (Kittur et al.",
        "2008) to image labeling (Sorokin and Forsyth 2008).",
        "In March 2007, Amazon claimed the user base of MTurk consisted of over 100,000 users from 100 countries (Pontin 2007).",
        "In the scope of this paper, we examine the feasibility of MTurk in creating large-scale corpora for training statistical named entity recognition models.",

      "text": [
        "Named entity recognition (NER) is a well-known subtask of information extraction.",
        "Traditionally, the task has been based on identifying words and phrases that refer to various entities of interest, including persons, locations, and organizations, (Nadeau and Sekine 2007).",
        "The problem is usually posed as a sequence labeling task similar to the part-of-speech (POS) tagging or phrase-chunking tasks, where each token in the input text corresponds to a label in the output, and is solved with sequential classification algorithms (such as CRF, SVMCMM, or MEMM).",
        "Previous works have tackled NER within the biomedical domain (Settles 2004), newswire domain (Grishman and Sundheim 1996), and email domain (Minkov et al.",
        "2005).",
        "In this paper, we focus on extracting entities from email text.",
        "It should be noted that email text has many distinctive features that create a unique challenge when applying NER.",
        "For one, email text tends to be more informal than either newswire or biomedical text, which reduces the usefulness of learned features that depend on patterns of capitalization and spelling.",
        "Also, the choice of corpora in email text is particularly important.",
        "As email corpora tend to come from either a single company (e.g., the Enron Email Dataset) or a small group of people (e.g., the Sarah Palin email set), it is easy to build a classifier that overfits the data.",
        "For instance, a classifier trained to extract personal names from Enron emails might show an especially high preference to words such as \"White,\" \"Lay,\" and \"Germany,\" because they correspond to the names of Enron employees.",
        "Within the newswire and biomedical domains, such overfitting may be benign or actually beneficial, since documents in those domains tend to deal with a relatively small and predetermined set of named entities (e.g., politicians and large corporations for newswire text, gene and protein names for biomedical text).",
        "For NER in the email domain, however, such overfitting is unacceptable.",
        "The personal nature of emails ensures that they will almost always contain references to people, places, and organizations not covered by the training data.",
        "Therefore, for the classifier to be useful on any spontaneous piece of email text, a large, heterogeneous training set is desired.",
        "To achieve this effect, we chose four different sources of unlabeled email text to be annotated by the Mechanical Turk workers for input into the training algorithms:",

        "Additionally, we built a separate set of tools designed to determine the ideal number of workers to assign per email.",
        "In order to adapt the task of NER annotation to the Mechanical Turk format, we developed a web-based graphical user interface using JavaScript that allowed the user to select a span of text with the mouse cursor and choose different categories of entities from a dropdown menu.",
        "The interface also used simple tokenization heuristics to divide the text into highlightable spans and resolve partial overlaps or double-clicks into the next largest span.",
        "For instance, highlighting the word \"Mary\" from \"M\" to \"r\" would result in the entire word being selected.",
        "Each Human Intelligence Task (or HIT, a unit of payable work in the Mechanical Turk system) presented the entire subject and body of an email from one of the four corpora.",
        "To keep the HITs at a reasonable size, emails with bodies having less than 60 characters or more than 900 characters were omitted.",
        "The average email length, including both subject and body, was 405.39 characters.",
        "For the labeling task, we chose three distinct entity types to identify: Person, Location, and Organization.",
        "To reduce potential worker confusion and make the task size smaller, we also broke up each individual HIT by entity type, so the user only had to concentrate on one at a time.",
        "For the Person and Location entity types, we noticed during initial tests that there was a user tendency to conflate unnamed references (such as \"my mom\" and \"your house\") with true named references.",
        "Because NER is intended to be limited only to named entities (i.e., references that contain proper nouns), we asked the users to distinguish between \"named\" and \"unnamed\" persons and locations, and to tag both separately.",
        "The inclusion of unnamed entities was intended to keep their named counterparts pure and undiluted; the unnamed entities were discarded after the annotation process was complete.",
        "The same mechanism could have been used for the Organization entity type, but the risk of unnamed references seemed smaller.",
        "Initially, we ran a small trial with a base rate of $0.03 for each HIT.",
        "However, after compiling the results we noticed that there was a general tendency for the workers to under-tag the entities.",
        "Besides outright freeloaders (i.e., workers who simply clicked \"no entities\" each time), there were also many who would highlight the first one or two entities, and then ignore the rest of the email.",
        "This may have been due to a misunderstanding of the HIT instructions, but we conjectured that a deeper reason was that we were paying a base rate regardless of the number of entities identified.",
        "Ideally, a HIT with many entities to highlight should pay more than a HIT with fewer.",
        "However, the default fixed-rate system was paying the same for both, and the workers were responding to such an inflexible incentive system accordingly.",
        "To remedy this situation, we set about to create a payment system that would motivate higher recall on entity-rich emails, while still discouraging the opposite extreme of random over-tagging.",
        "Mechanical Turk provides two methods for paying workers: fixed rates on each HIT and bonuses to individual workers for especially good work.",
        "We chose to leverage these bonuses to form the core of our payment system.",
        "Each HIT would pay a base rate of $0.01, but each tagged entity could elicit a bonus of $0.01-$0.02.",
        "Person entities paid $0.01, while Location and Organization entities paid $0.02 (since they were rarer).",
        "To ensure quality and discourage over-tagging, bonuses for each highlighted entity were limited based on an agreement threshold with other workers.",
        "This threshold was usually set such that a majority agreement was required, which was an arbitrary decision we made in order to control costs.",
        "The terms of the bonuses were explained in detail in the instructions page for each HIT.",
        "Additionally, we decided to leverage this bonus system to encourage improvements in worker performance over time.",
        "Since the agreed-upon spans that elicited bonuses were assumed to be mostly correct, we realized we could give feedback to the workers on these entities to encourage similar performance in the future.",
        "In general, worker bonuses are a mysterious and poorly understood motivational mechanism.",
        "Our feedback system attempted to make these bonuses more predictable and transparent.",
        "The system we built uses Amazon's \"NotifyWorkers\" REST API to send messages directly to the workers' email accounts.",
        "Bonuses were batched on a daily basis, and the notification emails gave a summary description of the day's bonuses.",
        "Fig.",
        "2: Example bonus notification.",
        "Both the UI and the bonus/notification system were works in progress that were continually refined based on comments from the worker community.",
        "We were pleasantly surprised to find that, throughout the annotation process, the Mechanical Turk workers were generally enthusiastic about the HITs, and also interested in improving the quality of their annotations.",
        "Out of 169,156 total HITs, we received 702 comments from 140 different workers, as well as over 50 email responses and a dedicated thread at TurkerNation.com6.",
        "Most of the feedback was positive, and negative feedback was almost solely directed at the UI.",
        "Based on their comments, we continually tweaked and debugged the UI and HIT instructions, but kept the basic structure of the bonus system.",
        "With the bonus system in place, it was still necessary to determine the ideal number of workers to assign per email.",
        "Previously, Snow et al.",
        "(2008) used expert annotations to find how many Mechanical Turk workers could \"equal\" an expert in terms of annotation quality.",
        "Because we lacked expert annotations, we developed an alternative system to determine the ideal number of workers based purely on inter-annotator agreement.",
        "As described in the previous section, the most significant problem faced with our HITs was that of low recall.",
        "Low precision was generally not considered to be a problem, since, with enough annotators, inter-annotator agreement could always be set arbitrarily high in order to weed out false positives.",
        "Recall, on the other hand, could be consistently expected to improve as more annotators were added to the worker pool.",
        "Therefore, the only problem that remained was to calculate the marginal utility (in terms of recall) of each additional annotator assigned to an email.",
        "In order to estimate this marginal recall gain for each entity type, we first ran small initial tests with a relatively large number of workers.",
        "From these results, we took all the entities identified by at least two workers and set those aside as the gold standard annotations; any overlapping annotations were collapsed into the larger one.",
        "Next, for each n number of workers between 2 and the size of the entire worker pool, we randomly sampled n workers from the pool, recalculated the entities based on agreement from at least two workers within that group, and calculated the recall relative to the gold standard annotation.",
        "The threshold of 2 was chosen arbitrarily for the purpose of this experiment.",
        "From this data we generated a marginal recall curve for each entity type, which roughly approximates how many workers are required per email before recall starts to drop off significantly.",
        "As expected, each graph shows a plateaulike behavior as the number of workers increases, but some entity types reach their plateau earlier http://turkers.proboards.com/index.cgi7action =display&board=everyoneelse&thread=3177",

        "In order to quickly and economically build a large annotated dataset for NER, we leveraged Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",
        "MTurk allowed us to build a dataset of 20,609 unique emails with 169,156 total annotations in less than four months.",
        "The MTurk worker population responded well to NER tasks, and in particular responded well to the bonus and feedback scheme we put into place to improve annotation quality.",
        "The bonus feedback system was designed to improve the transparency of the compensation system and motivate higher quality work over time.",
        "Encouragingly, our results indicate that the workers who completed the most documents also had consistently high entity recall, i.e., agreement with other workers, indicating that the system achieved the desired effect.",
        "Given a large body of MTurk annotated documents, we were able to leverage inter-annotator agreement to control the precision and recall of a CRF-based recognizer trained on the data.",
        "Importantly, we also showed that inter-annotator agreement can be used to predict the appropriate number of workers to assign to a given email in order to maximize entity recall and reduce costs.",
        "Finally, a direct comparison of the entity recognizers generated from MTurk annotations to those generated from expert annotations was very promising, suggesting that Mechanical Turk is appropriate for NER annotation tasks, when care is taken to manage annotator error."
