        "The task asked workers to look at Twitter individual status messages (tweets) and use a toggle button to tag each word with person (PER), organization (ORG), location (LOC), or \"none of the above\" (NONE).",
        "Each word also had a check box (labeled ???)",
        "to indicate that uncertainty.",

        "MUC-7 (Chinchor and Robinson, 1997).",
        "We deliberately kept our annotation goals simple: We only asked workers to identify three basic types of named entities.",
        "Our guidelines read:",
        "An entity is a object in the world like a place or person and a named entity is a phrase that uniquely refers to an object by its proper name (Hillary Clinton), acronym (IBM), nickname (Opra) or abbreviation (Minn.).",
        "Person (PER) entities are limited to humans (living, deceased, fictional, deities, ...) identified by name, nickname or alias.",
        "Don't include titles or roles (Ms., President, coach).",
        "Include suffix that are part of a name (e.g., Jr., Sr. or III).",
        "Organization (ORG) entities are limited to corporations, institutions, government agencies and other groups of people defined by an established organizational structure.",
        "Some examples are businesses (Bridgestone Sports Co.), stock ticker symbols (NASDAQ), multinational organizations (European Union), political parties (GOP) non-generic government entities (the State Department), sports teams (the Yankees), and military groups (the Tamil Tigers).",
        "Do not tag 'generic' entities like \"the government\" since these are not unique proper names referring to a specific ORG.",
        "Location (LOC) entities include names of politically or geographically defined places (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.).",
        "Locations also include man-made structures like airports, highways, streets, factories and monuments.",
        "We instructed annotators to ignore other types of named entities, e.g., events (World War II), products (iPhone), animals (Cheetah), inanimate objects and monetary units (the Euro) and gave them four principles to follow when tagging:",
        "• Tag words according to their meaning in the context of the tweet.",
        "• Only tag names, i.e., words that directly and uniquely refer to entities.",
        "• Only tag names of the types PER,ORG, and LOC.",
        "• Use the ???",
        "checkbox to indicate uncertainty in your tag.",
        "We created a \"gold standard\" data set of about 400 tweets to train and screen workers on MTurk, to salt the MTurk data with worker evaluation data, for use on CrowdFlower, and to evaluate the performance of the final NER system after training on the crowd-sourced annotations.",
        "We preselected tweets to annotate using the NLTK named entity recognizer to select statuses that were thought to contain named entities of the desired types (PER, ORG, LOC).",
        "Initial experiments suggested that a worker can annotate about 400 tweets an hour.",
        "Based on this, we loaded each MTurk Human Intelligence Tasks (HIT) with five tweets, and paid workers five cents per HIT.",
        "Thus, if we require that each tweet be annotated by two workers, we would be able to produce about 4,400 raw annotated tweets with the $100 grant from Amazon, accounting for their 10% overhead price.",
        "We also experimented with CrowdFlower, a crowd-sourcing service that uses various worker channels like MTurk and SamaSource and provides an enhanced set of management and analytic tools.",

        "Figure 2: CrowdFlower is an enhanced service that feeds into MTurk and other crowdsourcing systems.",

        "Figure 3: In the MTurk interface a tweet is shown in its entirety at the top, then a set of radio buttons and a checkbox is shown for each word of the tweet.",
        "These allow the user to pick the annotation for each word, and indicate uncertainty in labeling.",

        "These are automatically mixed into the stream of regular tasks that workers process.",
        "If a worker makes errors in one of these gold standard tasks, she gets immediate feedback about her error and the correct answer is shown.",
        "CrowdFlower claims that error rates are reduced by a factor of two when gold standards are used(crowdflower.com, 2010).",
        "The interface shown in Figure 2 shows the number of gold tasks the user has seen, and how many they have gotten correct.",
        "CrowdFlower's management tools provides a detailed analysis of the workers for a job, including the trust level, accuracy and past accuracy history associated with each worker.",

        "The current iteration of our MTurk interface is shown in Figure 3.",
        "Each tweet is shown at the top of the HIT interface so that it can easily be read for context.",
        "Then a table is displayed with each word of the tweet down the side, and radio buttons to pick what kind of entity each word is.",
        "Every ten rows, the header is repeated, to allow the worker to scroll down the page and still see the column labels.",
        "The interface also provides a checkbox allows the worker to indicate uncertainty in labeling a word.",
        "We expect that our data will include some tricky cases where an annotator, even an experienced one, may be unsure whether a word is part of a named entity and/or what type it is.",
        "For example, is 'Baltimore Visionary Art Museum' a LOC followed by a three word ORG, or a four-word ORG?",
        "We considered and rejected using hierarchical named entities in order to keep the annotation task simple.",
        "Another example that might give an annotator pause is a phrase like 'White House' can be used as a LOC or ORG, depending on the context.",
        "This measure can act as a measure of a worker's quality: if they label many things as \"uncertain\", we might guess that they are not producing good results in general.",
        "Also, the uncertainty allows for a finer-grained measure of how closely the results from two workers for the same tweet match: if the workers disagree on the tagging of a particular word, but agree that it is not certain, we could decide that this word is a bad example and not use it as training data.",
        "Finally, a help screen is available.",
        "When the user mouses over the word \"Help\" in the upper right, the guidelines discussed in Section 3 are displayed.",

        "Wikipedia links were provided, when applicable, for anyone needing further information about the query subject.",
        "Workers were asked to use a slider to determine which cloud better represented the key concepts related to the query.",
        "The slider would snap into one of eleven positions, which were labeled with value judgments they represented.",
        "The center value indicates that the two clouds were equally good.",
        "Figure 10 shows the final query interface.",
        "Figure 10: MTurk workers were asked which word cloud they thought best represented returned the results of a query, in this case \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\".",
        "Since MTurk workers are paid per task they complete, there is an incentive to do low quality work and even to randomly guess to get tasks done as fast as possible.",
        "To ensure a high quality evaluation we included in every batch of five queries a quality control question.",
        "Quality control questions were designed to look exactly like the regular cloud comparisons, but only one of the two clouds displayed was actually from the query in the description.",
        "The other word cloud was generated from a different query with no relation to the real query, and hand checked to make sure that anyone who was doing a respectable job would agree that the off-topic word cloud was a poor result for the query.",
        "If a worker's response indicated that the off topic cloud was as good as or better than the real cloud then they failed that control question, otherwise they passed.",
        "We asked that twelve workers label each set of questions.",
        "We only used results from workers that answered at least seven control questions with an average accuracy rating of at least 75%.",
        "This left us with a pool of eight reliable workers with an average accuracy on control questions of about 91%.",
        "Every question was labeled by at least five different workers with a mode of seven.",
        "Workers were not told which technique produced which cloud.",
        "Techniques were randomly assigned to either cloud A or B to prevent people from entering into a \"cloud A is always better\" mentality.",
        "The po-sitionofthe quality control questions were randomly assigned in each set of five cloud comparisons.",
        "The links to the cloud images were anonymized to random numbers followed by the letter A or B for their position to prevent workers from guessing anything about either the query or the technique that generated the cloud.",
        "We applied a filter to remove the query words from all word clouds.",
        "First of all, it would be a dead giveaway on the control questions.",
        "Second, the query words are already known and thus provide no extra information about the query to the user while simultaneously taking up the space that could be used to represent other more interesting words.",
        "Third, their presence and relative size compared to the baseline could cause users to ignore other features especially when doing a quick scan.",
        "The slider scores were converted into numerical scores ranging from 5 to +5, with zero representing that the two clouds were equal.",
        "We averaged the score for each cloud comparison, and determined that for 44 out of 55 clouds workers found our technique to be better than the baseline approach.",
        "We faced some issues with the CrowdFlower system.",
        "These included incorrect calibration for jobs, errors downloading results from completed jobs, price displayed on MTurk being different that what was set through CrowdFlower and gold standard data not getting stored on CrowdFlower system.",
        "Another problem was with the system's 10-token limit on gold standards, which is not yet resolved at the time of this writing.",
        "On the whole, the CrowdFlower team has been very quick to respond to our problems and able to correct the problems we encountered.",
        "Figure 11: Statistics for worker #181799.",
        "The interface has an option to \"forgive\" the worker for missing gold and an option to \"flag\" the worker so that the answers are excluded while returning the final set of judgments.",
        "It also displays workers ID, past accuracy and source, e.g. MTurk.",
        "CrowdFlower'a analytics panel facilitates viewing the live responses.",
        "The trust associated with each worker can be seen under the workers panel.",
        "Workers who do a large amount of work with low trust are likely scammers or automated bots.",
        "Good gold data ensures that their work is rejected.",
        "The system automatically pauses a job when the ratio of untrusted to trusted judgments exceeds a certain mark.",
        "This was particularly helpful for us to rectify some ofourgold data.",
        "Currently, the job is being completed with 61% accuracy for gold data.",
        "This could be due to the current issue we are facing as described above.",
        "It's also possible to view statistics for individual workers, as shown in Figure 11."

        "Crowdsourcing is an effective way to collect annotations for natural language and information retrieval research.",
        "We found both MTurk and CrowdFlower to be flexible, relatively easy to use, capable of producing usable data, and very cost effective.",
        "Some of the extra features and interface options that CrowdFlower provided were very useful, but did their were problems with their \"gold standard\" agreement evaluation tools.",
        "Their support staff was very responsive and helpful, mitigating some of these problems.",
        "We were able to duplicate some of the \"gold standard\" functionality on MTurk directly by generating our own mix of regular and quality control queries.",
        "We did not attempt to provide immediate feedback to workers who enter a wrong answer for the \"gold standard\" queries, however.",
        "With these labeled tweets, we plan to train an entity recognizer using the Stanford named entity recognizer, and run it on our dataset.",
        "After using this trained entity recognizer to find the entities in our data, we will compare its accuracy to the existing recognized entities, which were recognized by an ER trained on newswire articles.",
        "We will also attempt to do named entity linking and entity resolution on the entire corpus.",
        "We look forward to making use of the data we collected in our research and expect that we will use these services in the future when we need human judgements."
