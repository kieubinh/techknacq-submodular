        "To that end, we ask human annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk to compare translation candidates, and then interpret their preferences of one candidate over another as an implicit preference for one derivation over another, and therefore as an implicit preference for one or more grammar rules.",

        "When translating between two languages, state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems (Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009) generate candidate translations by relying on a set of relevant grammar (or phrase table) entries.",
        "Each of those entries, or rules, associates a string in the source language with a string in the target language, with these associations typically learned by examining a large parallel bitext.",
        "By the very nature of the translation process, a target side sentence e can be a candidate translation for a source sentence f only if e can be constructed using a small subset of the grammar, namely the subset of rules with source side sequences relevant to the word sequence of f. However, even this limited set of candidates (call it E(f)) is quite large, with |E(f)| growing exponentially in the length of f. The system is able to rank the translations within E (f ) by assigning a score s(e) to each candidate translation.",
        "This score is the dot product:",
        "where f (e) is a feature vector characterizing e, and W is a system-specific weight vector characterizing the system's belief of how much the different features reflect translation quality.",
        "The features of a candidate e are computed by examining the way e is constructed (or derived), and so if we let d(e) be the derivation of e, the feature vector can be denoted: where (pi(d(e)) is the value of ith feature function of d(e) (with a corresponding weight wi in W).",
        "To compute the score for a candidate, we examine its derivation d(e), enumerating the grammar rules used to construct e: d(e) = (r1,..., rk).",
        "Typically, each of the rules will itself have a vector of m features, and we calculate the value of a derivation feature (pi(d(e)) as the sum of the ith feature over all rules in the derivation:",
        "These features are usually either relative frequencies estimated from the training corpus, relating the rule's source and target sides, or features that characterize the structure of the rule itself, independently from the corpus.",
        "Either way, the weight wi is chosen so as to reflect some belief regarding the correlation between the ith feature and translation quality.",
        "This is usually done by choosing weights that maximize performance on a tuning set separate from the training bitext.",
        "Unlike system weights, the grammar rule feature values are fixed once extracted, and are not modified during this tuning phase.",
        "In this paper, we propose a framework to augment the feature set to incorporate additional intuition about how likely a rule is to produce a translation preferred by a human annotator.",
        "This knowledge is acquired by directly asking human judges to compare candidate translations, therefore determining which subset of grammar rules annotators seem to prefer over others.",
        "We also seek to generalize this intuition to rules for which no candidates were judged, hence allowing us to impact a much larger set of rules than just those used in translating the tuning set.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first give a general description of our framework.",
        "We then discuss our data collection efforts on Amazon Mechanical Turk for an Urdu-English translation task, and make explicit the type of judgments we collect and how they can be used to augment grammar rules.",
        "Before concluding, we propose a framework for generalizing judgments to unseen grammar rules, and analyze the data collection process."

        "As initially mentioned, when tuning a SMT system on a development set, we typically only perform high-level optimization of the system weights.",
        "In this section we outline an approach that could allow for lower-level optimization, on the level of individual grammar rules.",
        "We kick off the process by soliciting judgments from human annotators regarding the quality of a subset of candidates (the following section outlines how candidates are chosen).",
        "The resulting judgments on sentences are interpreted to be judgments on individual grammar rules used in the derivations of these candidates.",
        "And so, if an annotator declares a candidate to be of high quality, this is considered a vote of confidence on the individual rules giving rise to this candidate, and if an annotator declares a candidate to be of lowl quality, this is considered a vote of no confidence on the individual rules.",
        "To make use of the collected judgments, we extend the set of features used in the decoder by a new feature A:",
        "This feature is the cornerstone of our framework, as it will hold the quantified and cumulated judgments for each rule, and will be used by the system at decoding time, in addition to the existing m features, incorporating the annotators' judgments into the translation process.",
        "The range of possible values for this feature, and how the feature is computed, depends on how one chooses to ask annotators to score candidates, and what form those judgments assume (i.e. are those judgments scores on a scale?",
        "Are they \"better\" vs. \"worse\" judgments, and if so, compared to how many other possibilities?).",
        "At this point, we will only emphasize that the value of A should reflect the annotators' preference for the rule, and that it should be computed from the collected judgments.",
        "We will propose one such method of computing A in Section 4, after describing the type of judgments we collected."

        "Asking a worker to make a quantitative judgment of the quality of a particular candidate translation (e.g. on a 1-7 scale) is a highly subjective and annotator-dependent process.",
        "Instead, we present workers with pairs of candidates, and ask them to judge which candidate is of better quality.",
        "How are candidate pairs chosen?",
        "We would like a judgment to have the maximum potential for being informative about specific grammar rules.",
        "In essense, we prefer a pair of candidates if they have highly similar derivations, yet differ noticeably in terms of how the decoder ranks them.",
        "In other words, if a relatively minimal change in derivation causes a relatively large difference in the score assigned by the decoder, we are likely to attribute the difference to very few rule comparisons (or perhaps only one), hence focusing the comparison on individual rules, all the while shielding the annotators from having to compare grammar rules directly.",
        "Specifically, each pair of candidates (e, e') is assigned a potential score n(e, e'), defined as:",
        "where s(e) is the score assigned by the decoder, and lev (d, d') is a distance measure between two derivations which we will now descibe in more detail.",
        "In Joshua, the derivation of a candidate is captured fully and exactly by a derivation tree, and so we define lev (d, d') as a tree distance metric as follows.",
        "We first represent the trees as strings, using the familiar nested string representation, then compute the word-based Levenshtein edit distance between the two strings.",
        "An edit has a cost of 1 in general, but we assign a cost of zero to edit operations on terminals, since we want to focus on the structure of the derivation trees, rather than on terminal-level lexical choices.",
        "Furthermore, we ignore differences in \"pure\" pre-terminal rules, that only have terminals as their right-hand side.",
        "These decisions effectively allow us to focus our efforts on grammar rules with at least one nonterminal in their right-hand side.",
        "We perform the above potential computation on all pairs formed by the cross product of the top 10 candidates and the top 300 candidates, and choose the top five pairs ranked by potential.",

        "This expansion yields a set of judged grammar rule pairs J = {(a,b)} with associated vote counts va>b and vb>a, capturing how often the annotators preferred a candidate that was set apart by a over a candidate containing b, and vice versa.",
        "So, following our prior definiton as an expression of the judges' preference, we can calculate the value of A for a rule r as the relative frequency of favorable judgements:",

        "This approach has a substantial problem: A, computed as given above, is undefined for a rule that was never judged (i.e. a rule that never set apart a pair of candidates presented to the annotators).",
        "Furthermore, as described, the coverage of the collected judgments will be limited to a small subset of the entire grammar, meaning that when the system is asked to translate a new source sentence, it is highly unlikely that the relevant grammar rules would have already been judged by an annotator.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to generalize the collected judgments/votes and propagate them to previously unexamined rules.",
        "In order to do this, we propose the following general approach: when observing a judgment for a pair of rules (a, b) G J, we view that judgement not as a vote on one of them specifically, but rather as a comparison of rules similar to a versus rules similar to b.",
        "When calculating A(r) for any rule r we use a distance measure over rules, A, to estimate how each judgment in J projects to r. This leads to the following modified computatio of A(r):",
