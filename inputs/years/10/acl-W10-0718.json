        "Crowdsourc-ing enables requesters to tap from a global pool of non-experts to obtain rapid and affordable answers to simple Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), which can be subsequently used to train data-driven applications.",
        "A number of recent papers on this subject point out that non-expert annotations, if produced in a sufficient quantity, can rival and even surpass the quality of expert annotations, often at a much lower cost (Snow et al., 2008), (Su et al., 2007).",
        "However, this possible increase in quality depends on the task at hand and on an adequate HIT design (Kittur et al., 2008).",

        "Currently, a large majority of MTurk tasks is designed for English speakers.",
        "One of our reasons for participating in this shared task was to find out how easy it is to obtain annotated data for Spanish.",

        "A total of 19 workers passed the competence test and submitted at least one HIT.",
        "Of those, four workers completed HITs belonging to two different designs and six submitted HITs in all three designs.",

        "As to a comparison of completion times, it took a worker on average 11 seconds to complete an instance of HIT1, and 9 seconds to complete an instance of HIT2 and HIT3.",
        "At first sight, this result might seem surprising, since conceptually there is an increase in complexity when moving from HIT1 to HIT2 and from HIT2 to HIT3.",

        "This suggests that in order to map the graded annotations of HIT2 to the categories of HIT1, an intuitive partitioning of the graded scale into three equal parts should be avoided.",

        "This is usually done by calculating inter-annotator agreement (ITA) scores.",
        "Note that, since a single HIT can contain more than one assignment and each assignment is typically performed by more than one annotator, we can only calculate ITA scores between batches of assignments, rather than between individual workers.",
        "Therefore, we describe the ITA scores in terms of batches.",
        "In Table 4.4, we present a comparison of standard kappa calculations (Eugenio and Glass, 2004) between batches of assignments in HIT1 and expert annotations.",
        "We found an inter-batch ITA score of 0.598, which indicates a moderate agreement due to fairly consistent annotations between workers.",
        "When comparing individual batches with expert annotations, we found similar ITA scores, in the range between 0.628 and 0.649.",
        "This increase with respect to the inter-batch score suggests a higher variability among MTurk workers than between workers and experts.",
        "In order to filter out noise in worker annotations, we applied a simple majority voting procedure in which we selected, for each sentence in HIT1, the most voted category.",
        "This results in an additional batch of annotations.",
        "This batch, refered in Table 4.4 as Majority, produced a considerably higher ITA score of 0.716, which confirms the validity of the majority voting scheme to obtain better annotations.",
        "In addition, we calculated ITA scores between three expert annotators on a separate, 500-sentence dataset, randomly selected from the same corpus as described at the start of Section 3.",
        "This collection was later used as test set in the experiments described in Section 5.",
        "The inter-expert ITA scores on this separate dataset contains values of 0.725 for k1 and 0.729 for k2, only marginally higher than the Majority ITA scores.",
        "Although we are comparing results on different data sets, these results seem to indicate that multiple MTurk annotations are able to produce a similar quality to expert annotations.",
        "This might suggest that a further increase in the number of HIT assignments would outperform expert ITA scores, as was previously reported in (Snow et al., 2008) .",
        "As explained in Section 3, a total amount of 9000 assignments were uploaded on MTurk.",
        "At a reward of .02$ per assignment, a total sum of 225$ (180$ + 45$ Amazon fees) was spent on the task.",
        "Workers perceived an average hourly rate of 6.5$/hour for HIT1 and 8$/hour for HIT2 and HIT3.",
        "These figures suggest that, at least for assignments of type HIT2 and HIT3, a lower reward/assignment might have been considered.",
        "This would also be consistent with the recommendations of (Mason and Watts, 2009) , who claim that lower rewards might have an effect on the speed at which the task will be completed - more workers will be competing for the task at any given moment - but not on the quality.",
        "Since we were not certain whether a large enough crowd existed with the necessary skills to perform our task, we explicitly decided not to try to offer the lowest possible price.",
        "An in-house expert annotator (working at approximately 70$/hour, including overhead) finished a batch of 1000 HIT assignments in approximately three hours, which leads to a total expert annotator cost of 210$.",
        "By comparing this figure to the cost of uploading 3 x 1000 HIT assignments (75$), we saved 210 – 75 = 135$, which constitutes almost 65% of the cost of an expert annotator.",
        "These figures do not take into account the costs of preparing the data and HIT templates, but it can be assumed that these costs will be marginal when large data sets are used.",

        "Table 4 presents the resulting mean values of accuracy for each considered subtask in classifiers trained with either the baseline or the annotated dataset.",
        "As observed in the table, all subtasks benefit from using the annotated dataset for training the classifiers; however, it is important to mention that while similar absolute gains are observed for the 'positive/not_positive' and 'neutral/not-neutral' subtasks, this is not the case for the subtask 'neg-ative/not_negative', which actually gains much less than the other two subtasks.",

        "This, along with the fact that the 'negative/not_negative' subtask is actually the best performing one (in terms of accuracy) when baseline training data is used, might suggest that low rating comments contains a better representation of sentences belonging to category 'negative' than medium and high rating comments do with respect to classes 'neutral' and 'positive'.",
        "In any case, this experimental work only verifies the feasibility of constructing training datasets for opinionated content analysis, as well as it provides an approximated idea of costs involved in the generation of this type of resources, by using MTurk.",

        "As the objective was not to obtain optimum performance but only to evaluate the differences between different sets of annotations, all classifiers were used with their default settings.",

        "Using the tree annotations per sentence available from MTurk, all classifiers reach similar or better performance compared to the single set of expert annotations, at a much lower cost (as explained in section 4.4).",
        "It is interesting to note that most classifiers benefit from using the full 3000 training examples (1000 sentences with 3 annotations each), which intuitively makes sense as the unanimously labeled examples will have more weight in defining the model of the corresponding class, whereas ambiguous or unclear cases will have their impact reduced as their characteristics are attributed to various classes.",

        "As a first intuition, this may be due to the fact that SVMs focus on detecting class boundaries (and optimizing the margin between classes) rather than developing a model of each class.",
        "As such, having the same data point appear several times with the same label will not aid in finding appropriate support vectors, whereas having the same data point with conflicting labels may have a negative impact on the margin maximization.",
