        "Crowdsourcing's greatest contribution to language studies might be the ability to generate new kinds of data, especially within experimental paradigms.",
        "The speed and cost benefits for annotation are certainly impressive (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009; Hsueh et al., 2009) but we hope to show that some of the greatest gains are in the very nature of the phenomena that we can now study.",
        "For psycholinguistic experiments in particular, we are not so much utilizing 'artificial artificial' intelligence as the plain intelligence and linguistic intuitions of each crowdsourced worker - the 'voices in the crowd', so to speak.",
        "In many experiments we are studying gradient phenomena where there are no right answers.",
        "Even when there is binary response we are often interested in the distribution of responses over many speakers rather than specific data points.",
        "This differentiates experimentation from more common means of determining the quality of crowdsourced results as there is no gold standard against which to evaluate the quality or 'correctness' of each individual response.",
        "The purpose of this paper is therefore two-fold.",
        "We summarize seven current projects that are utilizing crowdsourcing technologies, all of them somewhat novel to the NLP community but with potential for future research in computational linguistics.",
        "For each, we also discuss methods for evaluating quality, finding the crowdsourced results to often be indistinguishable from controlled laboratory experiments.",
        "In Section 2 we present the results from semantic transparency experiments showing near-perfect interworker reliability and a strong correlation between crowdsourced data and lab results.",
        "Extending to audio data, we show in Section 3 that crowdsourced subjects were statistically indistinguishable from a lab control group in segmentation tasks.",
        "Section 4 shows that laboratory results from simple Cloze tasks can be reproduced with crowdsourcing.",
        "In Section 5 we offer strong evidence that crowdsourcing can also replicate limited-population, controlled-condition lab results for grammaticality judgments.",
        "In Section 6 we use crowdsourcing to support corpus studies with a precision not possible with even very large corpora.",
        "Moving to the brain itself, Section 7 demonstrates that ERP brainwave analysis can be enhanced by crowdsourced analysis of experimental stimuli.",
        "Finally, in Section 8 we outline simple heuristics for ensuring that microtasking workers are applying the linguistic attentiveness required to undertake more complex tasks."

        "who saw context is especially high (0.9).",
        "All correlations with StudentLong are relatively low, but this is actually true for StudentLong vs. StudentContext, too (p = 0.44), even though both groups are Stanford undergraduates.",
        "Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) measure the agreement among participants, and these are high for all groups except StudentLong.",
        "Just among StudentLong participants, the ICC consistency is only 0.0934 and their ICC agreement is 0.0854.",
        "Once we drop StudentLong, we see that all of the remaining tests have high consistency (average of 0.78 for ICC consistency, 0.74 for ICC agreement).",
        "For example, if we combine TurkContext and Stu-dentContext, ICC consistency is 0.899 and ICC agreement of 0.900.",
        "Cohen's kappa measurement also measures how well raters agree, weeding out chance agreements.",
        "Again, StudentLong is an outlier.",

        "We also used Javascript to force workers to spend at least 2 seconds on each sentence and we rejected results from workers that had chance level (50%) agreement with the other workers.",
        "Though our tasks produced words annotated with literal and metaphorical tags, we were less interested in the individual annotations (though agreement was decent at 73%) and more interested in the overall pattern for each target word.",
        "Some words, like fruit, were almost always used literally (92%), while other words, like hurdle were almost always used metaphorically (91%) .",
        "Overall, the target words had a mean metaphorical frequency of 53%, indicating that their literal and metaphorical senses were used in nearly equal proportions.",
        "Figure 5 shows that the metaphorical frequencies follow roughly a bell-curved distribution, which is especially interesting given that the target words were hand-selected for the Lai experiment and not drawn randomly from a corpus.",

        "We also took advantage of the collected sense frequency distributions to re-analyze data from the Lai experiment.",
        "We split the target words into a high bin (average 72% metaphorical) and a low bin (average 33% metaphorical), matching the number of items and average word log-frequency per bin.",
        "Looking at the average ERPs (brain waves) over time for each bin revealed that when subjects were reading novel metaphors, there was a significant difference (p = .01) at about 200ms (P200) between the ERPs for the highly literal words and the ERPs for the highly metaphorical words.",
        "Thus, not only does metaphorical frequency influence figurative language processing, but it does so much earlier than semantic effects are usually observed (e.g. N400 effects at 400ms)."

        "For annotation tasks, crowdsourcing is most successful when the tasks are designed to be as simple as possible, but in experimental work we don't always want to target the shallowest knowledge of the workers, so here we seek to discover just how attentive the workers really are.",
        "When running psycholinguistics experiments in the lab, the experimenters generally have the chance to interact with participants.",
        "It is not uncommon for prospective subjects to be visibly exhausted, distracted, or inebriated, or not fluent in the given language to a requisite level of competence.",
        "When these participants turn up as outliers in the experimental data, it is easy enough to see why – they fell asleep, couldn't understand the instructions, etc.",
        "With crowdsourcing we lose the chance to have these brief but valuable encounters, and so anomalous response data are harder to interpret.",
        "We present two simple experiments for measuring linguistic attentiveness, which can be used as one component of a language study or to broadly evaluate the linguistic competency of the workers.",
        "Taking well-known constructions from the literature, we selected constructions that: (a) exist in most (perhaps all) dialects of English; (b) involve high frequency lexical items; and (c) tend to be acquired relatively late by irst-language learners.",

        "While crowdsourcing was irst used by linguists for annotation, we hope that the results here demonstrate the potential for far richer studies.",
        "In a range of linguistic disciplines from semantics to psycholinguistics it enables systematic, large-scale judgment studies that are more affordable and convenient than expensive, time-consuming lab-based studies.",
        "With crowdsourcing technologies, linguists have a reliable new tool for experimentally investigating language processing and linguistic theory.",
        "Here, we have reproduced many 'classic' large-scale lab studies with a relative ease.",
        "We can envision many more ways that crowdsourcing might come to shape new methodologies for language studies.",
        "The affordability and agility brings experimental linguistics closer to corpus linguistics, allowing the quick generation of targeted corpora.",
        "Multiple iterations that were previously possible only over many years and several grants (and therefore never attempted) are now possible in a matter ofdays.",
        "This could launch whole new multi-tiered experimental designs, or at the very least allow 'rapid prototyping' of experiments for later lab-based veriication.",
        "Crowdsourcing also brings psycholinguistics much closer to computational linguistics.",
        "The two ields have always shared empirical data-driven methodologies and computer-aided methods.",
        "We now share a workspace too.",
        "Historically, NLP has necessarily drawn corpora from the parts of linguistic theory that have stayed still long enough to support time-consuming annotation projects.",
        "The results here have implications for such tasks, including parsing, word-sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling, but the most static parts of a ield are rarely the most exciting.",
        "We therefore predict that crowdsourcing will also lead to an expanded, more dynamic NLP repertoire.",
        "Finally, for the past half-century theoretical linguistics has relied heavily on 'introspective' corpus generation, as the rare edge cases often tell us the most about the boundaries of a given language.",
        "Now that we can quickly and conidently generate empirical results to evaluate hypotheses drawn from intuitions about the most infrequent linguistic phenomena, the need for this particular fallback has diminished - the stimuli are abundant."
