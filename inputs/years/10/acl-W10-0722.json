        "What information is relevant?",
        "Is it possible to separate information content from linguistic quality?",
        "Besides subjectivity issues, evaluation is time-consuming.",
        "Ideally, a judge would read the original set of documents before deciding how well the important aspects are conveyed by a summary.",
        "A typical 10-document problem could reasonably involve 25 minutes of reading or skimming and 5 more minutes for assessing a 100-word summary.",
        "Since summary output can be quite variable, at least 30 topics should be evaluated to get a robust estimate of performance.",
        "Assuming a single judge evaluates all summaries for a topic (more redundancy would be better), we get a rough time estimate: 17.5 hours to evaluate two systems.",
        "Thus it is of great interest to find ways of speeding up evaluation while minimizing subjectivity.",
        "Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) system has been used for a variety of labeling and annotation tasks (Snow et al., 2008), but such crowd-sourcing has not been tested for summarization.",
        "We describe an experiment to test whether MTurk is able to reproduce system-level rankings that match expert opinion.",
        "Unlike the results of other crowd-sourcing annotations for natural language tasks, we find that non-expert judges are unable to provide expert-like scores and tend to disagree significantly with each other.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the particular summarization task and data we use in our experiments; Section 3 describes the design of our Human Intelligence Task (HIT).",
        "Section 4 shows experimental results and gives some analysis.",
        "Section 5 reviews our main findings and provides suggestions for researchers wishing to conduct their own crowd-sourcing evaluations."

        "Our initial HIT design asked workers to perform a head-to-head comparison of two candidate summaries, but we found this unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.",
        "First, many of the resulting scores did not obey the transitive property: given summaries x, y, and z, a single worker showed a preference for y > x and z > y, but also x > z.",
        "Second, while this kind of head-to-head evaluation may be useful for system development, we are specifically interested here in comparing non-expert MTurk evaluation with expert TAC evaluation.",
        "We went through a few rounds of revisions to the language in the HIT after observing worker feedback.",
        "Specifically, we found it was important to emphasize that a good summary not only responds to the topic and description, but also conveys the information in the references.",
        "Only workers with at least a 96% HIT approval rating were allowed access to this task.",
        "We monitored results manually and blocked workers (rejecting their work) if they completed a HIT in under 25 seconds.",
        "Such suspect work typically showed uniform scores (usually all 10s).",
        "Nearly 30% of HITs were rejected for this reason.",
        "To encourage careful work, we included this note in our HITs: \"High annotator consistency is important.",
        "If the scores you provide deviate from the average scores of other annotators on the same HIT, your work will be rejected.",
        "We will award bonuses for particularly good work.\"",

        "The cost for the full evaluation, including 44 topics, 8 systems, and 2x redundancy, at $.07 per HIT, plus 10% commission for Amazon, was $55.",
        "Table 3 shows average scores for the two evaluations.",
        "The data suggest that the MTurk judges are better at evaluating Linguistic Quality than Content or Overall Quality.",
        "In particular, the MTurk judges appear to have difficulty distinguishing Linguistic Quality from Content.",
        "We will defend these claims with more analysis, below.",
        "The first important question to address involves the consistency of the workers.",
        "We cannot compare agreement between TAC and MTurk evaluations, but the MTurk agreement statistics suggest considerable variability.",
        "In Overall Quality, the mean score difference between two workers for the same HIT is 2.4 (the standard deviation is 2.0).",
        "The mean is 2.2 for Linguistic Quality (the standard deviation is 1.5).",
        "In addition, the TAC judges show more similarity with each other â€“ as if they are roughly in agreement about what makes a good summary.",
        "We compute each judge's average score and look at the standard deviation of these averages for the two groups.",
        "The TAC standard deviation is 1.0 (ranging from 3.0 to 6.1), whereas the MTurk standard deviation is 2.3 (ranging from 1.0 to 9.5).",
        "Note that the average number of HITs performed by each MTurk worker was just over 5.",
        "Finally, we can use regression analysis to show what fraction of the total score variance is captured by judges, topics, and systems.",
        "We fit linear models in R using binary indicators for each judge, topic, and system.",
        "Redundant evaluations in the MTurk set are removed for unbiased comparison with the TAC set.",
        "Table 4 shows that the differences between the TAC and MTurk evaluations are quite striking: Taking the TAC data alone, the topics are the major source of variance, whereas the judges are the major source of variance in the MTurk data.",
        "The systems account for only a small fraction of the variance in the MTurk evaluation, which makes system ranking more difficult.",
        "Table 4: Linear regression is used to model Overall Quality scores as afunction ofjudges, topics, and systems, respectively, for each data set.",
        "The R values, which give the fraction of variance explained by each of the six models, are shown.",
        "The TAC evaluation, while lacking redundant judgments, was a balanced experiment.",
        "That is, each judge scored every system for a single topic.",
        "The same is not true for the MTurk evaluation, and as a result, the average per-system scores shown in Table 3 may be biased.",
        "As a result, and because we need to test multiple system-level differences simultaneously, a simple t-test is not quite sufficient.",
        "We use Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences (HSD), explained in detail by Yandell (1997), to assess statistical significance.",
        "Tukey's HSD test computes significance intervals based on the range of the sample means rather than individual differences, and includes an adjustment to correct for imbalanced experimental designs.",
