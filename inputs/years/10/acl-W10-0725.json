        "The task of RTE (Dagan et al., 2005) is to say whether a person would reasonably infer some short passage of text, the Hypothesis (H), given a longer passage, the Text (T).",
        "However, collections of such TH pairs are rare to find and these resources are the key to solving the problem.",
        "The datasets used in the RTE task were collected by extracting paragraphs of news text and manually constructing hypotheses.",
        "For the data collected from information extraction task, the H is usually a statement about a relation between two named-entities (NEs), which is written by expertise.",
        "Similarly, the H in question answering data is constructed using both the question and the (in)correct answers.",
        "Therefore, the research questions we could ask are,",
        "1.",
        "Are these hypotheses really those ones people interested in?",
        "2.",
        "Are hypotheses different if we construct them in other ways?",

        "What would be a good negative hypotheses compared with the positive ones?",
        "In this paper, we address these issues by using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), online nonexpert annotators (Snow et al., 2008).",
        "Instead of constructing the hypotheses targeted to IE or QA, we just ask the human annotators to come up with some facts they consider as relevant to the given text.",
        "For negative hypotheses, we change the instruction and ask them to write counter-factual but still relevant statements.",
        "In order to narrow down the content of the generated hypotheses, we give a focused named-entity (NE) for each text to guide the annotators."

        "(1996), where they manually construct a textbook-style corpus aiming at different semantic phenomena involved in inference.",
        "However, the dataset is not large enough to train a robust machine-learning-based RTE system.",
        "The recent research from the RTE community focused on acquiring large quantities of textual entailment pairs from news headlines (Burger and Ferro, 2005) and negative examples from sequential sentences with transitional discourse connectives (Hickl et al., 2006).",
        "Although the quality of the data collected were quite good, most of the positive examples are similar to summarization and the negative examples are more like a comparison/contrast between two sentences instead of a contradiction.",
        "Those data are the real sentences used in news articles, but the way of obtaining them is not necessarily the (only) best way to find entailment pairs.",
        "In this paper, we investigate an alternative inexpensive way of collecting entail-ment/contradiction text pairs by crowdsourcing.",

        "In particular, we first preprocess an existing RTE corpus using a named-entity recognizer to mark all the named-entities appearing in both T and H. When we show the texts to Turkers, we highlight one named-entity and give them one of these two sets of instructions:",

        "Avoid using words like not or never.",
        "Then there are three blank lines given for the annotators to fill in facts or counter-factual statements.",
        "For each HIT, we gather facts or counter-facts for five texts, and for each text, we ask three annotators to perform the task.",
