        "Evaluating accuracy of new search algorithms on ever-growing information repositories has become increasingly challenging in terms of the time and expense required by traditional evaluation techniques.",
        "In particular, while the Cranfield evaluation paradigm has proven remarkably effective for decades (Voorhees, 2002), enormous manual effort is involved in assessing topic relevance of many different documents to many different queries.",
        "Consequently, there has been significant recent interest in developing more scalable evaluation methodology.",
        "This has included developing robust accuracy metrics using few assessments (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004), inferring implicit relevance assessments from user behavior (Joachims, 2002), more carefully selecting documents for assessment (Aslam and Pavlu, 2008; Carterette et al., 2006), and leveraging crowd-sourcing (Alonso et al., 2008).",
        "We build on this line of work to investigating crowdsourcing-based relevance assessment via MTurk.",
        "While MTurk has quickly become popular as a means of obtaining data annotations quickly and inexpensively (Snow et al., 2008), relatively little attention has been given to addressing human-factors involved in crowdsourcing and their impact on resultant cost, time, and accuracy of the annotations obtained (Mason and Watts, 2009).",
        "The advent of crowdsourcing has led to many researchers, whose work might otherwise fall outside the realm of human-computer interaction (HCI), suddenly finding themselves creating HITs for MTurk and thereby directly confronting important issues of interface design and usability which could significantly impact the quality or quantity of annotations they obtain.",
        "A similar observation has been made recently regarding the importance of effective HCI for obtaining quality answers from users in a social search setting (Horowitz and Kamvar, 2010).",
        "Our overarching hypothesis is that better addressing human factors in HIT design can yield significantly reduce cost, reduce time, and/or increase accuracy of the annotations obtained via crowdsourc-ing.",
        "Such improvement could come through a variety of complimentary effects, such as attracting more or better workers, incentivizing them to do better work, better explaining the task to be performed and reducing confusion, etc.",
        "While the results of this study are largely inconclusive with regard to our experimental hypothesis, other contributions of the work are identified in the abstract above."

      "text": [
        "To evaluate search accuracy in the Cranfield paradigm (Voorhees, 2002), a predefined set of documents (e.g., web pages) are typically manually assessed for relevance with respect to some fixed set of topics.",
        "Each topic corresponds to some static information need of a hypothetical user.",
        "Because language allows meaning to be conveyed in various ways and degrees of brevity, each topic can be expressed via a myriad of different queries.",
        "Table 1 shows the four topics used in our study which were generated by NIST for TREC.",
        "We do use the paragraph-length \"narrative\" queries under an (untested) assumption that they are overly complex and technical for a layman assessor.",
        "Instead, we use (1) the short keyword \"title\" queries and (2) more verbose and informative \"description\" queries, which are typically expressed as a one-sentence question or statement.",
        "NIST has typically invested significant time training annotators, something far less feasible in a crowdsourced setting.",
        "NIST has also typically employed a single human assessor per topic to ensure consistent topic interpretation and relevance assessment.",
        "One downside of this practice is limited scalability of annotation, particularly in a crowd-sourced setting.",
        "When multiple annotators have been used, previous studies have also found relatively low inner-annotator agreement for relevance assessment due to the highly subjective nature of relevance (Voorhees, 2002).",
        "Thus in addition to reducing time and cost of assessment, crowdsourcing may also enable us to improve assessment accuracy by integrating assessment decisions by a committee of annotators.",
        "This is particularly important for generating reusable test collections for benchmarking.",
        "Practical costs involved in relevance assessment based on standard pooling methods is significant and becoming increasingly prohibitive as collection sizes grow (Carterette et al., 2009).",
        "MTurk allows \"requesters\" to crowdsource large numbers of HITs online which workers can search, browse, preview, accept, and complete or abandon.",

      "heading": "3. Methodology",
      "text": [
        "Our study investigated how varying certain aspects of HIT design affected annotation accuracy and time, as well as the relationship between expense and these outcomes.",
        "In particular, workers were asked to make binary assessments regarding the relevance of various documents to different queries.",
        "We varied four simple aspects of HIT design:",
        "• Terminology: HIT title of \"binary relevance judgment\" (technical) vs. \"yes/no decision\" (layman)",
        "The Query is clearly central to relevance assessment since it provides the annotator's primary basis for judging relevance.",
        "Since altering a query can have enormous impact on the assessment, and because we were testing the ability of Mechanical Turk workers to replicate assessments made previously by TREC assessors, we preserved wording of the queries as they appeared in the original TREC topics (see §2).",
        "We hypothesized that the greater detail found in the topic description vs. the title would improve accuracy with some corresponding increase in HIT completion time (longer query to read, at times with more stilted language, and more specific relevance criteria requiring more careful reading of documents).",
        "An alternative hypothesis would be that a very conscientious worker might take longer wrestling with a vague title query.",
        "Terminology: the HIT title is arguably one of a HIT's more prominent features since it is one of the first (and often the only) description of a HIT a potential worker sees.",
        "An attractive title could conceivably draw workers to a task while an unattractive one could repel them.",
        "Besides the simple variation studied here, future experiments could test other aspects of title formulation.",
        "For example, greater specificity as to the content of documents or topics within the HIT could attract workers that are knowledgeable or interested in a particular subject.",
        "Additionally, a title that indicates a task is for research purposes might attract workers motivated to contribute to society.",
        "Pay: the base pay rate has obvious implications for attracting workers and incentivizing them to do quality work.",
        "While anecdotal knowledge suggested the \"going rate\" for simple HITs was about $0.02, we started at the lowest possible rate and increased from there.",
        "Although higher pay rates are certainly more attractive to legitimate workers, they also tend to attract more spammers, so determining appropriate pay is something of a careful balancing act.",
        "Bonus: Two important questions are 1) How does knowing that one could receive a bonus affect performance on the current HIT?, and 2) How does actually receiving a bonus affect performance on future HITs?",
        "We focused on the first question.",
        "When bonuses were offered, we both advertised this fact in the HIT title (see Title 4 above) and appended the following statement to the instructions: \"[b]onuses will be given for good work with good explanations of the reasoning behind your relevance assessment.\"",
        "If a worker's explanation made clear why she made the relevance judgment she did, bonuses were awarded regardless of the assessment's correctness with regard to ground truth.",
        "Decisions to award bonus pay were made manually (see §5).",
        "Various factors kept constant in our study could also be interesting to investigate in future work:",
        "• Description: the worker may optionally view a brief description of the task before accepting the HIT.",
        "For all HITs, our description was simply: \"(1) Decide whether a document is relevant to a topic, 2) Click 'relevant' or 'not relevant', and 3) Submit\".",
        "• Keywords: HITs were advertised for search via keywords \"judgment, document, relevance, search\"",
        "• Duration: once accepted, all HITs had to be completed within one hour",
        "• Approval Rate: workers had to have a 95% approval rate to accept our HITs",
        "• HIT approval: all HITs were accepted, but approval was not immediate to suggest that HITs were being carefully reviewed before pay was awarded",
        "• Feedback to workers: none given",
        "More careful selection of high-interest Keywords (e.g., \"easy\" or \"fun\") may be a surprisingly effective way to attract more workers.",
        "It would be very interesting to analyze the query logs for keywords used by Workers in searching for HITs of interest.",
        "Omar Alonso suggests workers should always be paid (personal communication).",
        "Given the low cost involved, keeping Workers individually happy avoids the effort of having to justify rejections to angry Workers, maintains one's reputation for attracting Workers, and still allows problematic workers to be filtered out in future batches.",
        "With regard to outcomes, we were principally interested in measuring accuracy, time, and expense.",
        "Base statistics, such as the completion time of a particular HIT, allowed us to compute derived statistics like averages per topic, per Worker, per Batch, per experimental variable, etc.",
        "We could then also look for correlations between outcomes as well as between experimental variables and outcomes.",
        "Accuracy was measured by simply computing the annotator mean accuracy with regard to \"ground truth\" binary relevance labels from NIST.",
        "A variety of other possibilities exist, such as deciding binary annotations by majority vote and comparing these to ground truth.",

        "As for time, we measured HIT completion time (from acceptance to completion) and Batch completion time (from publishing the Batch to all its HITs being completed).",
        "We only anecdotally measured our own time required to generate HIT designs, shepherd the Batches, assess outcomes, etc.",
        "Cost was measured solely with respect to what was paid to Workers and does not include overhead costs charged by Amazon (§2).",
        "We also did not account for the cost of our own salaries, equipment, or other indirect expenses associated with the work.",
        "Assessment was performed on XML documents taken from the TREC TIPSTER collection of news articles.",
        "Documents were simply presented as text after simple pre-processing; a better alternative for the future would be to associate an attractive style sheet with the XML to enhance readability and attractiveness of HITs.",
        "Relatively little preprocessing was performed: (1) XML tags were replaced with",
        "HTML, (2) document ID, number, and TRECrelated info was commented out, and (3) paragraph tags were added to break up text.",
        "Our basic HIT layout was based on a pre-existing template for assessing binary relevance provided by Omar Alonso (personal communication).",
        "This template reflected several useful design decisions like having HITs be self-contained rather than referring to content at an external URL, a design previously found to be effective (Alonso et al., 2008)."

        "In the near-term, we will be using MTurk to evaluate search accuracy of systems participating in the TREC 2010 Relevance Feedback Track.",
        "This will involve addressing several significant challenges: (1) achieving scalable evaluation, (2) protecting workers from malicious attack pages while maintaining assessment accuracy, (3) addressing issues of Web spam, and (4) handling issues of unknown mature content workers may encounter during assessment.",
        "With regard to (1), we will be scaling up Cranfield-based relevance assessment to support search evaluation on the massive ClueWeb09 Web crawl.",
        "As for (2), many Web pages containing attack code designed to compromise the viewer's computer, and in a crowdsourced environment we cannot ensure all workers have installed the latest security patches for their Web browsers.",
        "Various tradeoffs may be involved between security and usability in pre-rendering Web pages to assess as static images, creating a \"safe-viewer\" applet, etc.",
        "Web spam (3) can be annoying to workers and thereby impact the quality of their work, wastes time and money since spam is never relevant to any query by definition, and spam detection is conceptually a distinct task and ought to be handled as such.",
        "In the short term, we may simply ask workers to not only decide relevance vs. non-relevance, but to simultaneously differentiate non-relevant content from nonrelevant spam, but a better solution would be preferable.",
        "Mature content (4) is similar to spam but can be far worse than annoying to workers, touches on legal issues, and inability to filter it could significantly reduce the number of workers willing to accept HITs which may contain it.",
        "Our short-term solution will likely be to perform some simple pre-filtering and simply warn workers they may encounter such content, but this solution is not ideal.",
        "Varying number of annotations in proportion to annotator agreement.",
        "While we collected a fixed number of relevance assessments for each query-document pair, it may be both more efficient and more effective to collect few assessments when inner-annotator agreement is high and proportionally more assessments when greater disagreement exists between annotators (Von Ahn et al., 2008).",

        "Evaluation of commercial search engines today often reports use of a five-point graded scale, and such graded feedback allows us to better distinguish relative effectiveness of different search algorithms at a finer scale.",
