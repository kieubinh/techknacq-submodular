        "In order to port a spoken language application to a new language, first an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system must be developed.",
        "For many languages pre-existing corpora do not exist and thus speech data must be collected before development can begin.",
        "The collection of speech corpora is an expensive undertaking and obtaining this data rapidly, for example in response to a disaster, cannot be done using the typical methodology in which corpora are collected in controlled environments.",
        "To build an ASR system for a new language, two sets of data are required; first, a text corpus consisting of written transcriptions of utterances users are likely to speak to the system, this is used to train the language model (LM) applied during ASR; and second, a corpora of recordings of speech, which are used to train an acoustic model (AM).",
        "Text corpora for a new language can be created by manually translating a pre-existing corpus (or a subset of that corpus) into the new language and crowd-sourcing methodologies can be used to rapidly perform this task.",
        "Rapidly creating corpora of speech data, however, is not trivial.",
        "Generally speech corpora are collected in controlled environments where speakers are supervised by experts to ensure the equipment is setup correctly and recordings are performed adequately.",
        "However, for most languages performing this task on-site, where developers are located, is impractical as there may not be a local community of speakers of the required language.",
        "An alternative is to perform the data collection remotely, allowing speakers to record speech on their own PCs or mobile devices in their home country or wherever they are located.",
        "While previous works have focused on the generation of translations (Razavian, 2009) and transcribing of audio (Marge, 2010) via Mechanical-Turk, in this paper we focus on the collection of speech corpora using a Mechanical-Turk type framework.",
        "Previous works (Voxforge), (Gruenstein, 2009), (Schultz, 2007) have developed solutions for collecting speech data remotely via web-based interfaces.",
        "A web-based system for the collection of open-source speech corpora has been developed by the group at www.voxforge.org.",
        "Speech recordings are collected for ten major European languages and speakers can either record audio directly on the website or they can call in on a dedicated phone line.",
        "In (Gruenstein, 2009) spontaneous speech (US English) was collected via a web-based memory game.",
        "In this system speech prompts were not provided, but rather a voice-based memory game was used to gather and partially annotate Figure 1: Screenshots from Speech Collection iPhone App spontaneous speech.",
        "In comparison to the above works which focus on the collection of data for major languages, the SPICE project (Schultz, 2007) provides a set of web-based tools to enable developers to create voice-based applications for less-common languages.",
        "In addition to tools for defining the phonetic units of a language and creating pronunciation dictionaries, this system also includes tools to create prompts and collect speech data from volunteers over the web.",
        "In this paper, we describe two tools we have developed to collect speech corpora remotely.",
        "The first, a Mobile smart-phone based system which allows speakers to record prompted speech directly on their phones and second, a web-based system which allows recordings to be collected remotely on PCs.",
        "We compare the quality of audio collected from paid part-time staff and unsupervised volunteers and determine that basic user training and automatic feedback mechanisms are required to obtain usable data."

        "Today's smart-phones are able to record quality audio onboard and generally have the ability to connect to the internet via a fast wifi-connection.",
        "This makes them an ideal platform for collecting speech data in the field.",
        "Speech data can be collected by a user at any time in any location, and the data can be uploaded at a later time when a wireless connection is available.",
        "At Mobile Technologies we have developed an iPhone application to perform this task.",
        "The collection procedure consists of three steps.",
        "First, on start-up a small amount of personal information, namely, gender and age, are requested from the user.",
        "They then select the language for which they intend to provide speech data.",
        "The mobile-device ID, personal information and language selected is used as an identifier for individual speakers.",
        "Next, collection of speech data is performed.",
        "Collection is performed offline, enabling data to be collected in the field where there may not be a persistent internet connection.",
        "A prompt is randomly selected from an onboard database of sentences and is presented to the user, who reads the sentence aloud holding down a push-to-talk button while speaking.",
        "During the speech collection stage, the system automatically proceeds to the following prompt when the current recording is complete.",
        "The user however has the ability to go back to previous recordings, listen to it and re-speak the sentence if any issues are found.",
        "Finally, the speech data is uploaded using a wireless collection.",
        "Data is uploaded one utterance at a time to an FTP server.",
        "Uploading each utterance individually allows the user to halt the upload and continue it at a later time if required.",

        "It has been reported that over 100,000 workers from 100 countries are using AMT (Pontin, 2007).",
        "AMT allows two general types of HITs.",
        "A Question Form HIT is based on a provided XML template and only allows certain elements in the HIT.",
        "However, it is possible to integrate an external JAVA applet within a Question Form HIT which allows for some flexibility.",
        "Questions can also be hosted on an external website which increases flexibility for the HIT developer while remaining tightly integrated in the AMT environment.",
        "Table 2: Annotations used to label poor quality recordings is performed in a controlled environment, the developer can ensure that the recording equipment is setup correctly, background noise is kept to a minimum and the speaker is adequately trained to use the recording equipment.",
        "However, the same is not guaranteed when collecting speech remotely via mechanical-turk frameworks.",
        "For collection of audio data Amazon does not offer any integrated tools.",
        "We thus designed and implemented a Java applet for web based speech collection.",
        "The Java applet can easily be incorporated in the AMT Question-Form mechanism and could also be used as part of an External-Question HIT.",
        "Currently the Java applet provides the same basic functionality as outlined for the iPhone application.",
        "The applet sequentially shows a number of prompts to record.",
        "The user can skip a sentence, playback a recording to check the quality and also redo the recording for the current sentence (see screenshot in Figure 2).",
        "After the user is finished, the recorded sentences are uploaded to a web-server using an HTTP Post request.",
        "An important difference is the necessity to be online during the speech recordings."
