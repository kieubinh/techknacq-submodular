        "Textual Entailment (TE) (Dagan and Glickman, 2004) has been proposed as a generic framework for modelling language variability.",
        "Given a text T and an hypothesis H, the task consists in deciding if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T. At the monolingual level, the great potential of integrating TE recognition (RTE) components into NLP architectures has been demonstrated in several areas, including question answering, information retrieval, information extraction, and document summarization.",
        "In contrast, mainly due to the absence of cross-lingual TE (CLTE) recognition components, similar improvements have not been achieved yet in any cross-lingual application.",
        "Along such direction, focusing on feasibility and architectural issues, (Mehdad et al., 2010) recently proposed baseline results demonstrating the potential of a simple approach that integrates Machine Translation and monolingual TE components.",
        "As a complementary research problem, this paper addresses the data collection issue, focusing on the definition of a fast, cheap, and reliable methodology to create CLTE corpora.",
        "The main motivation is that, as in many other NLP areas, the availability of large quantities of annotated data represents a critical bottleneck in the systems' development/evaluation cycle.",
        "Our first step in this direction takes advantage of an already available monolingual corpus, casting the problem as a translation one.",
        "The challenge consists in taking a publicly available RTE dataset of EnglishT-H pairs (i.e. the PASCAL-RTE3 dataset), and create its English-Spanish CLTE equivalent by translating the hypotheses into Spanish.",
        "To this aim non-expert workers have been hired through the CrowdFlower channel to Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing marketplace recently used with success for a variety of NLP tasks (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009; Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Marge et al., 2010; Ambati et al., 2010).",
        "The following sections overview our experiments, carried out under strict time (10 days) and cost ($100) limitations.",
        "In particular, Section 2 describes our data acquisition process; Section 3 summarizes the successive approximations that led to the definition of our methodology, and the lessons learned at each step; Section 4 concludes the paper and provides directions for future work."

      "text": [
        "Starting from the RTE3 Development set (800 English TH pairs), our corpus creation process has been organized in sentence translation-validation cycles, defined as separate \"jobs\" routed to Crowd-Fower's workforce.",
        "At the first stage of each cycle, the original English hypotheses are used to create a translation job for collecting their Spanish equivalents.",
        "At the second stage, the collected translations are used to create a validation job, where multiple judges are asked to check the correctness of each translation, given the English source.",
        "Translated hypotheses that are positively evaluated by the majority of trustful validators (i.e. those judged correct with a confidence above 0.8) are retained, and directly stored in our CLTE corpus together with the corresponding English texts.",
        "The remaining ones are used to create a new translation job.",
        "The procedure is iterated until substantial agreement for each translated hypothesis is reached.",
        "As regards the first phase of the cycle, we defined our translation HIT as follows:",
        "In this task you are asked to:",
        "• First, judge if the Spanish sentence is a correct translation of the English sentence.",
        "If the English sentence and its Spanish translation are blank (marked as -), you can skip this step.",
        "• Then, translate the English sentence above the text box into Spanish.",
        "Please make sure that your translation is:",
        "1.",
        "Faithful to the original phrase in both meaning and style.",

        "Grammatically correct.",

        "Don't use any automatic (machine) translation tool!",
        "You can have a look at any on-line dictionary or reference for the meaning of a word.",
        "This HIT asks workers to first check the quality of an English-Spanish translation (used as a gold unit), and then write the Spanish translation of a new English sentence.",
        "The quality check allows to collect accurate translations, by filtering out judgments made by workers missing more than 20% of the gold units.",
        "As regards the second phase of the cycle, our validation HIT has been defined as follows:",
        "Su tarea es verificar si la traduction dada de una frase del Ingles al espaol es correcta o no.",
        "La traduction es correcta si:",
        "1.",
        "El estilo y sentido de la frase sonfieles a los de la original.",

        "Es gramaticalmente correcta.",

        "Carece de errores ortograficos y tipograficos.",
        "Nota: el uso de herramientas de traduction automatica (maquina) no esta permitido!",
        "This HIT asks workers to take binary decisions (Yes/No) for a set of English-Spanish translations including gold units.",
        "The title and the description are written in Spanish in order to weed out untrusted workers (i.e. those speaking only English), and attract the attention of Spanish speakers.",
        "In our experiments, both the translation and validation jobs have been defined in several ways, trying to explore different strategies to quickly collect reliable data in a cost effective way.",
        "Such cost reduction effort led to the following differences between our work and similar related approaches documented in",
        "• Previous works built on redundancy of the collected translations (up to 5 for each source sentence), thus resulting in more costly jobs.",
        "For instance, adopting a redundancy-based approach to collect 5 translations per sentence at the cost of $0.01 each, and 5 validations per translation at the cost of $0.002 each, would result in $80 for 800 sentences.",
        "Assuming that the translation process is complex and expensive, our cycle-based technique builds on simple and cheap validation mechanisms that drastically reduce the amount of translations required.",
        "In our case, 1 translation per sentence at the cost of $0.01, and 5 validations per translation at the cost of $0.002 each, would result in $32 for 800 sentences, making a conservative assumption of up to 8 iterations with 50% wrong translations at each cycle (i.e. 800 sentences in the first cycle, 400 in the second, 200 in the third, etc.",
        ").",
        "• Previous works involving validation of the collected data are based on ranking/voting mechanisms, where workers are asked to order a number of translations, or select the best one given the source.",
        "Our approach to validation is based on asking workers to take binary decisions over source-target pairs.",
        "This results in an easier, faster, and eventually cheaper task.",
        "• Previous works did not use any specific method to qualify the workers' knowledge, apart from post-hoc agreement computation.",
        "Our approach systematically includes gold units to filter out untrusted workers during the process.",
        "As a result we pay only for qualified judgments."

      "heading": "3. Experiments and lessons learned",
      "text": [
        "The overall methodology, and the definition of the HITs described in Section 2, are the result of successive approximations that took into account two correlated aspects: the quality of the collected translations, and the current limitations of the Crowd-Flower service.",
        "On one side, simpler, cheaper, and faster jobs launched in the beginning of our experiments had to be refined to improve the quality of the retained translations.",
        "On the other side, ad-hoc solutions had to be found to cope with the limited quality control functionalities provided by CrowdFlower.",
        "In particular, the lack of regional qualifications of the workers, and of any qualification tests mechanism (useful features of MTurk) raised the need of defining more controlled, but also more expensive jobs.",
        "Table 1 and the rest of this section summarize the progress of our work in defining the methodology adopted, the main improvements experimented at each step, the overall costs, and the lessons learned.",
        "Step 1: a naïve approach.",
        "Initially, translation/validation jobs were defined without using qualification mechanisms, giving permission to any worker to complete our HITs.",
        "In this phase, our goal was to estimate the trade-off between the required development time, the overall costs, and the quality of translations collected in the most naive conditions.",
        "As expected, the job accomplishment time was negligible, and the overall cost very low.",
        "More specifically, it took about 1 hour for translating the 800 hypotheses at the cost of $12, and less than 6 hours to obtain 5 validations per each translation at the same cost of $12.",
        "Nevertheless, as revealed by further experiments with the introduction of gold units, the quality of the collected translations was poor.",
        "In particular, 61% of them should have been rejected, often due to gross mistakes.",
        "As an example, among the collected material several translations in languages other than English revealed a massive and defective use of on-line translation tools by untrusted workers, as also observed by (Callison-Burch, 2009).",
        "Step 2: reducing validation errors.",
        "A first improvement addressed the validation phase, where we introduced gold units as a mechanism to qualify the workers, and consequently prune the untrusted ones.",
        "To this aim, we launched the validation HIT described in Section 2, adding around 50 English-Spanish control pairs.",
        "The pairs (equally distributed into positive and negative samples) have been extracted from the collected data, and manually checked by a Spanish native speaker.",
        "The positive effect of using gold units has been verified in two ways.",
        "First, we checked the quality of the translations collected in the first naive translation job, by counting the number of rejections (61%) after running the improved validation job.",
        "Then, we manually checked the quality of the translations retained with the new job.",
        "A manual check on 20% of the retained translations was carried out by a Spanish native speaker, resulting in 97% Accuracy.",
        "The 3% errors encountered are equally divided into minor translation errors, and controversial (but substantially acceptable) cases due to regional Spanish variations.",
        "The considerable quality improvement observed has been obtained with a small increase of 25% in the cost (less than $3).",
        "However, as regards the accomplishment time, adding the gold units to qualify workers led to a considerable increase in duration (about 4 days for the first iteration).",
        "This is mainly due to the high number of automatically rejected judgments, obtained from untrusted workers missing the gold units.",
        "Because of the discrepancy between trusted and untrusted judgments, we faced another limitation of the CrowdFlower service, which further delayed our experiments.",
        "Often, in fact, the rapid growth of untrusted judgments activates automatic pausing mechanisms, based on the assumption that gold units are not accurate.",
        "This, however, is a strong assumption which does not take into account the huge amount of non-qualified workers accepting (or even just playing with) the HITs.",
        "For instance, in our case the vast majority of errors came from workers located in specific regions where the native language is not Spanish nor English.",
        "Step 3: reducing translation errors.",
        "The observed improvement obtained by introducing gold units in the validation phase, led us to the definition of a new translation task, also involving a similar qualification mechanism.",
        "To this aim, due to language variability, it was clearly impossible to use reference translations as gold units.",
        "Taking into account the limitations of the CrowdFlower interface, which does not allow to set qualification tests or split the jobs into sequential subtasks (other effective and widely used features of MTurk), we solved the problem by defining the translation HITs as described in Section 2.",
        "This solution combines a validity check and a translation task, and proved to be effective with a decrease in the translations eventually rejected (45%).",
        "Step4: reducing time.",
        "Considering the extra time required by using gold units, we decided to spend more money on each HIT to boost the speed of our jobs.",
        "In addition, to overcome the delays caused by the automatic pausing mechanism, we obtained from CrowdFlower the possibility to pose regional qualification, as commonly used in MTurk.",
        "As expected, both solutions proved to be effective, and contributed to the final definition of our methodology.",
        "On one side, doubling the payment for each task (from $0.01 to $0.02 for each translation and from from $0.002 to $0.005 for each validation), we halved the required time to finish each job.",
        "On the other side, by imposing the regional qualification, we eventually avoided unexpected automatic pauses."

        "We presented a set of experiments targeting the creation of bilingual Textual Entailment corpora by means of non experts' workforce (i.e. the Crowd-Flower channel to Amazon Mechanical Turk).",
        "As a first step in this direction, we took advantage of an already existing monolingual English RTE corpus, casting the problem as a translation task where Spanish translations of the hypotheses are collected and validated by the workers.",
        "Strict time and cost limitations on one side, and the current limitations of the CrowdFlower service on the other side, led us to the definition of an effective corpus creation methodology.",
        "As a result, less than $100 were spent in 10 days to define such methodology, leading to collect 426 pairs as a by-product.",
        "However, it's worth remarking that applying this technique to create the full corpus would cost about $30.",
        "The limited costs, together with the short time required to acquire reliable results, demonstrate the effectiveness of crowdsourcing services for simple sentence translation tasks.",
        "However, while MTurk is already a well tested, stable, and rich of functionalities platform, some limitations emerged during our experience with the more recent CrowdFlower service (currently the only one accessible to non-US citizens).",
        "Some of these limitations, such as the regional qualification mechanism, have been overcome right after the end of our experimentation with the introduction of new functionalities provided as \"Advanced Options\".",
        "Others (such as the lack of other qualification mechanisms, and the automatic pausing of the HITs in case of high workers' error rates on the gold units) at the moment still represent a possible complication, and have to be carefully considered when designing experiments and interpreting the results.",
        "In light of this positive experience, next steps in our research will further explore crowdsourcing-based data acquisition methods to address the complementary problem of collecting new entailment pairs from scratch.",
        "This will allow to drastically reduce data collection bottlenecks, and boost research both on cross-lingual and monolingual Textual Entailment."
