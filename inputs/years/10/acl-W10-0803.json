        "Identifying and extracting relevant information in a given text is an important task for human readers and natural language processing applications.",
        "To do this, proper identification and treatment of complex sentences containing relative clauses and other embedded structures such as appositive clauses (e.g., My mother, a patient at the center, met him last year,) and participial clauses (e.g., Once he ate Werthers, including the wrapper,) is necessary.",
        "Thus, the tasks of text simplification and text summarization in NLP have focused their efforts on finding effective ways of simplifying long and complex sentences into shorter and simpler ones.",
        "This has in turn proven useful in machine translation (Chandrasekar et.",
        "al., 1996), parsing and information extraction (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997), as well as document simplification designed to make texts accessible to wider audiences.",
        "Such audiences include readers at low literacy levels (Siddharthan, 2003), second language learners (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007) and aphasic readers (Devilin and Unthank, 2006).",
        "The goal of text simplification and summarization is to reduce syntactic or structural complexities while preserving the central meaning or relevant information in the given text.",
        "Unfortunately, syntactic simplification algorithms often assume a uniform treatment of syntactic structures.",
        "This is especially true in the domain of relative clauses.",
        "Relative clauses are often considered to contain parenthetical information.",
        "That is, their putative role in the sentence is to provide background information about the mentioned entity or entities.",

        "That is, (1) means something like: the entity you comes to possess a guy down the street.",
        "If we accordingly consider the relative clause as the background or incidental information and remove it from the semantic analysis, the assertion - the key piece of the information - would be lost.",
        "In this paper, we discuss the Presentational Relative Clause (PRC) construction, as seen in (1).",

        "(3) I [like] those movies that you watch_time and time again.",

        "The gap in the relative clause indicating the position of the co-referential noun phrase is shown.",

        "In (5), the relative clause does not identify the river walk area as one out of a set of areas, but simply provides additional information about it.",
        "In neither case does the relative clause assert information in the discourse; rather, it expresses a presupposed proposition (e.g., 'I can work on x,''x is the tourist area') that is assumed to be known by both the speaker and the addressee.",
        "Accordingly, relative clauses are assumed to provide background information concerning the entities they modify.",
        "This background material serves either to distinguish the referent from others of its kind, as in a restrictive relative clause, or provide additional material, as in a non-restrictive relative clause, rather than asserting something new about the referent.",
        "In line with the linguistic consensus, work in NLP has also viewed relative clauses as expressing background information about a referent.",
        "In syntactic simplification, the structural complexity is resolved by splitting a sentence into multiple ones (Siddharthan, 2003; Chandrasekar, 1996).",
        "In effect, the relative clause is pulled out of the main clause into an independent sentence.",

        "As the analysis of (1) above suggests, however, not all relative clauses contain parenthetical information.",
        "In fact, many linguistic studies have argued that subordinate clauses can make assertions (Goldberg, 2006; Menn, 1974; McCawley, 1981; Fox & Thompson, 1990), as a counterpoint to the studies that view them as expressing exclusively backgrounded information (Shibatani, 2009).",
        "Here, in line with Michaelis and Lambrecht (1996), Kay and Fillmore (1999) and other work in the Construction Grammar tradition, we analyze a particular construction, the Presentational Relative Clause construction (PRC), as a productive idiomatic pattern.",
        "The PRC is a construction in which the material presented in the relative clause is not backgrounded, either in the sense of being unnecessary parenthetical material, or in the sense of being already known to both speaker and addressee (Duffield & Michaelis, 2009).",
        "In the",
        "PRC, information is asserted in the relative clause that modifies the nominal element, which is introduced by a semantically bleached main clause.",
        "Examples of the PRC include (1) and the following:",
        "(7) They [had] some guy that_was defending himself.",
        "(8) And I [know] people who_have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation.",
        "(9) And they've [got] a fifteen year old that_'s their boss that ___ is carrying a gun",
        "Each of the examples above were examined in their original contexts to determining that an uninformative main clause introduces the head nominal, while an assertion is contained within the relative clause.",
        "In (7), the main clause that introduces the referent some guy is semantically uninformative.",
        "By this we mean that it does NOT assert that the entity they possessed some guy.",
        "Rather, the asserted proposition in the utterance is in the relative clause, and (7) can be paraphrased as A guy was defending himself.",
        "In (8) the important information is not that the speaker knows a certain set of people.",
        "Instead, the key assertion here is: \"Some people have been drug tested and have not been hired by a corporation.\"",
        "Likewise, (9), illustrating what might be described as a double-PRC, could be rephrased as, \"A fifteen-year-old is their boss and is carrying a gun.\"",
        "The PRC construction is typically characterized by three main properties: a semantically empty main clause, a head nominal in the object position of the main clause that is newly introduced into the discourse, and a subject-gap relative clause that modifies the head nominal.",
        "First property: The semantically bleached main clause serves to convey the restriction on the range of the existential quantifier rather than an assertion.",
        "In (7), for example, the main clause conveys the restriction 'x is a guy'.",
        "Consequently, a PRC, unlike a restrictive relative, is not optional.",
        "It is a required part of the clause in which it appears, exemplified by the fact that (7) cannot reasonably be construed as asserting 'They had some guy'.",
        "Being uninformative, the main verbs of PRC tend to have low semantic weight, as in (10-12).",
        "(10) I've [seen] some statistics that_say it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life.",
        "(11) You [get] a guy down the street who_comes up, uh, carrying a knife.",
        "(12) When our kids were small we [had] a couple of, uh, good women who_would often come to the house.",
        "The bracketed main verbs in (10-12), which otherwise denote relations of perception, obtaining, and possession, respectively, here appear simply to 'set the stage' for their object referents.",
        "In other words, (10) does not assert that the speaker sees something, (11) does not assert that the addressee",
        "himself.",
        "obtains something and (12) does not assert that some people possessed someone.",
        "Rather than predicating a property or action of the main clause subject, the main clause predications in (10-12) provide an explicit or inferred center of perspective from which to view the entity denoted by the head nominal (Koenig and Lambrecht, 1999).",
        "Second property: The discourse-new head nominal is in the object position of the main clause.",
        "Thus, the PRC enables the speaker to avoid violating a hearer-based information-packaging constraint that Lambrecht (1994) refers to as the Principle of Separation of Reference and Role (PSRR): \"Do not introduce a referent and talk about it in the same clause\" (ibid).",
        "In other words, to aid the hearer in anchoring the new referent in discourse, the speaker introduces it in the object position of the main clause, and then predicates upon it in the relative clause, as in example (13):",
        "(13) Speaker A: We have more options now then (sic) we did when my kids were born, with being able to take off full-time longer, you can phase your schedule in so that it 's not full-time for up to six months.",
        "Speaker B: Oh boy, that's great.",
        "Speaker A: It 's really neat.",
        "I've [had] a couple of assistants that_came back just three days a week or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint.",
        "Consider Speaker A's second turn, restructured as a declarative clause rather than as a PRC, and thus violating the PSRR.",
        "This time the assertion is conveyed in the main clause, but with the new entity in the in the subject position the result is pragmatically awkward:",
        "(14) Speaker A: It 's really neat.",
        "A couple of assistants came back just three days a week or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint.",
        "An additional example is provided in (15):",
        "(15) Speaker B: I've never liked D.C. a whole lot and a really hate the Redskins.",
        "And a lot of it's because, you know, I [got] a lot of people, you know, at work with and everything that_ are big Redskin fans.",
        "(?",
        "?A lot of people I work with and everything are big Redskin fans.)",
        "Thus, a crucial identifying characteristic of the PRC is that it always modifies head nominals that are main-clause objects.",
        "Third property: Third identifying property of the PRC is the presence of a subject-gap relative clause.",
        "That is, the relative clause modifying the head nominal contains a gap in the subject position of the relative clause that is co-referential with the head nominal, as in (7) repeated here as (16):",
        "(16) They [had] some guy that_was defending",
        "There are, however, cases in which the head nominal is modified by an object-gap relative clause, which conveys an assertion, as in (17):",
        "(17) Everybody [gets] five pounds of garbage that they can throw away____ you know uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound.",
        "In the example above, as with the more prototypical subject-gap PRC, the main clause does not make an assertion (in this case, the main clause does not assert that everybody receives five pounds of garbage).",
        "Rather, the assertion in the relative clause is demonstrated by the appropriate paraphrase, \"Everybody can throw away five pounds of garbage.\"",
        "While speakers do produce object-gap sentences to convey assertions, subject-gap PRC tokens account for the majority of assertoric relative clauses in spoken discourse (Duffield and Michaelis, 2009).",
        "This results in the subject-gap structure being a useful property for identifying prototypical instances of the PRC."

        "So far we have seen sentences or utterances that would inarguably be interpreted as sentences containing a PRC.",
        "However, there are PRCs, which, while equipped with every relevant PRC characteristic, initially appear to contain relative clauses expressing parenthetical information.",
        "Consider the following sentence:",
        "(18) I [had] a son, he's now gone from the home, that_was an animal lover.",
        "In isolation, (18) could be interpreted as asserting that the speaker has a son, who now happens to have left home.",
        "The relative clause that was an animal lover would be treated as background information about the son.",
        "Yet an examination of the context of the conversation reveals that the relative clause contains crucial information with regard to the discourse as a whole:",

        "Speaker B: Uh-huh.",
        "Speaker A: So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and a cat running loose in the house.",
        "In this case, we see even a more compelling reason to identify this sentence as a PRC.",
        "Disregarding the relative clause in (18) and treating the main clause as containing an asserted proposition, results in a radically different reading: the speaker's son is among the animals that the speaker claims to have owned (i.e. \"I've had a skunk, I've had a Burmese python, I've had rats, I've had mice, I've had gerbils, I had a son...\").",
        "By classifying this sentence as a PRC, we reach the intended assertion, \"My son was an animal lover,\" which in turn explains why the speaker has been the proud owner of a menagerie of animals.",
        "Much like the example in (18), the discourse context of the other PRCs presented in this paper substantiates the claim that they present information central to the discourse.",
        "The PRC in (7) \"They [had] some guy that was defending himself,\" used in a conversation describing a trial, signals that the situation departs from the prototypical courtroom schema in a crucial respect (the defendant is without a lawyer).",
        "Other instances of the PRC, such as (8) \"And I [know] people who _have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation,\" like (18), provide explanatory information: the reason for the speaker's negative view of drug-testing.",
        "Finally, in (15) \"I [got] a lot of people, you know, at work with and everything that _ are big Redskin fans,\" the PRC utterance explains why the speaker dislikes a particular football team.",

        "For the purposes of this section we make the assumption that we will only retain instances that can be parsed by an automatic parser (Collins 1999, Charniak, 1997).",
        "The features we suggest are based on the results of a corpus study carried out by Duffield and Michaelis (in prep) examining the role of the PRC in the distribution of relative clause types in spoken discourse.",
        "In the study by Duffield and Michaelis (2009, in prep), 1000 sentences (500 each of subject-gap and object-gap relative clauses) from the Switchboard Corpus (Godfrey, 1996) were manually examined for the first two of the identifying properties of PRC tokens as described in Section 3.1.",
        "In addition, each of the 1000 sentences was examined within a context of 50 lines of previous discourse to determine whether or not the relative clause conveyed an assertion.",
        "Their results showed that three properties, namely, a semantically bleached verb, discourse-new head nominals, and an assertion in the relative clause, were found to significantly predict relative clauses of the subject-gap type, suggesting that PRCs account for the prevalence of subject-gap relative clauses in discourse.",
        "In fact, 22.4% of subject-gap relative clauses were PRCs, while only 6.8% of object-gap relative clauses displayed features of the PRC.",
        "The manner in which Duffield and Michaelis manually annotated their data, although based on linguistic analysis as discussed above, easily lends itself to a list of properties that could be automatically used to identify PRCs in larger corpora.",
        "Corresponding to the first property (Section 3.1) of a semantically empty main clause, Duffield & Michaelis have observed that PRC tokens have the tendency to co-occur with verbs of existence, perception and discovery.",
        "Table 1 lists these verbs.",
        "This suggests that encoding the lemmatized verbs as features may help in automatic classification of",
        "PRCs.",

        "That is, the verbs such as look, tell, and wonder were regularly found when the head nominal was the complement in the PP, while other verbs in Table 1 more frequently occurred with the head nominal in the direct argument position of the main-clause verb.",
        "Furthermore, Duffield and Michaelis found that in cases where the head nominal was the complement of the PP, the head of the PP was found to be either of or about.",
        "This suggests that in conjunction with the features derived from the lemmatized verb, the position of the head nominal in relation to the main-clause verb could be encoded as a feature.",

        "Although Duffield & Michaelis recognize that the distinction between the 'given' and 'new' discourse statuses is not the same thing as definite versus indefinite form, discourse-active entities tend to be formally marked as definite, while discourse-new entities tend to be marked as indefinite (Prince 1992).",
        "Head nominals considered as indefinite include bare plural nouns (e.g., engineers), determinerless nominals modified by adjectives or cardinal numbers (e.g., about forty kindergarteners), bare mass nouns (e.g., material), nominals with weak quantifiers (e.g., some companies), indefinite pronouns (e.g., somebody, anybody) and nominals containing the indefinite article a (e.g., a fish).",
        "Definite head nominals include those containing the definite article the (e.g., the thing, the resources), demonstrative determiners (e.g., this recording, that attitude), possessive determiners (e.g., my bass), strong quantifiers (e.g., every story, all these people), demonstrative pronouns (e.g., that, those) and proper nouns (e.g., Rockport, Albany).",

        "In this paper, we have presented identifying properties of the PRC construction.",
        "We recognize that individual properties as presented here contribute to but do not determine the final meaning of the PRC construction as a whole, but in combination, they are likely predictors.",
        "Not all syntactic forms can be treated in the same way.",
        "By not privileging the syntactic level, but rather treating lexical, morphological, and syntactic features equally, we are able to identify key indicators that could be used to identify the function of a relative clause in discourse as conveying an assertion as opposed to backgrounded information.",
        "Certain types of PRCs, such as in this example, are produced without the relative pronoun.",
        "Such PRCs are referred to as amalgams (see Lambrecht, 1988 for discussion)",
        "For the purposes of NLP, we must work within the framework of phrasal structures, constrained by the resources currently available.",
        "Yet as we have suggested here, those resources, although not constructionally based, can be used to identify constructions for the purpose of extracting relevant information from naturally occurring data.",
        "We have further investigated the applicability of a construction-based approach to identifying relative clause types when the individual components, such as lexical items themselves are not themselves effective predictors.",
        "This clause-level information allows for richer representations of textual meaning.",
        "Our future plans include experiments with implementing automatic classifiers of relative clause type based on these features.",
        "Such empirical study will give us a better understanding of the degree of usefulness of these features in identifying PRCs in text data.",
        "We anticipate that additional features will be discovered during the implementation process."
