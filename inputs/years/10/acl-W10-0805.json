        "Nominal Compounds are syntactically condensed constructs which have extensively been attempted to expand in order to unfold the meaning of the constructions.",
        "Currently there exist two different approaches in Computational Linguistics: (a) Labeling the semantics of compound with a set of abstract relations (Moldovan and Girju, 2003) (b) Paraphrasing the compound in terms of syntactic constructs.",
        "Paraphrasing, again, is done in three ways: (1) with prepositions (\"war story\" – \"story about war\") (Lauer 1995) (2) with verb+preposition nexus (\"war story\" – \"story pertaining to war\", \"noise pollution\" – \"pollution caused by noise\") (Finin 1980) (3) with",
        "Copula (\"tuna fish\" – \"fish that is tuna\") (Van-derwende,1995).",
        "Nominal compound (henceforth NC) is a frequently occurring construct in English .",
        "A bigram or two word nominal compound, is a construct of two nouns, the rightmost noun being the head (H) and the preceding noun the modifier (M) as found in \"cow milk\", \"road condition\", \"machine translation\" and so on.",
        "Rackow et al.",
        "(1992) has rightly observed that the two main issues in translating the source language NC correctly into the target language involves (a) correctness in the choice of the appropriate target lexeme during lexical substitution and (b) correctness in the selection of the right target construct type.",
        "The issue stated in (a) involves correct selection of sense of the component words of NCs followed by substitution of source language word with that of target language that best fits for the selected sense (see Mathur and Paul 2009).",
        "From the perspective of machine translation, the issue of selecting the right construct of target language becomes very significant because English NCs are translated into varied construct types in Hindi.",
        "This paper motivates the advantage of expanding English nominal compounds into \"paraphrases with prepositions\" for translating them into Hindi.",
        "The English NCs are paraphrased using Lauer's (1995) 8 prepositions.",
        "In many cases prepositions are semantically overloaded.",
        "For example, the NC \"Hindu law\" can be paraphrased as \"law of Hindu\".",
        "This paraphrase can mean \"Law made by Hindu\" (not for Hindu people alone though) or \"Law meant for Hindu\" (law can be made by anyone, not by the Hindus necessarily).",
        "Such resolution of meaning is not possible from \"preposition paraphrase\".",
        "The paper argues that this is not an issue from the point of view of translation at least.",
        "It is because the Hindi correspondent of \"of\", which is \"kA\", is equally ambiguous.",
        "The translation of \"Hindu law\" is \"hinduoM kA kAnUn\" and the construction can have both aforementioned interpretations.",
        "Human users can select the right interpretation in the given context.",
        "On the other hand, 'paraphrase with preposition' approach has the following advantages: (a) Annotation is simpler; (b) Learning is easier and (c) Data sparseness is less; (d) Most importantly, English prepositions have one to one Hindi postposition correspondents most of the times.",
        "Therefore we have chosen the strategy of \"paraphrasing with prepositions\" over other kind of paraphrasal approach for the task of translation.",
        "The paper explores the possibility of maintaining one to one correspondence of English-Hindi preposition-postpositions and examines the accuracy of translation.",
        "At this point it is worth mentioning that translation of English NC as NC as well as different syntactic constructs in Hindi is almost equal.",
        "Therefore the task of translating English NCs into Hindi is divided into two levels: (1) Paraphrases for an NC are searched in the web corpus, (2) An algorithm is devised to determine when the paraphrase is to be ignored and the source language NC to be translated as NC or transliterated in NC, and (3) English preposition is replaced by Hindi corresponding postposition.",

        "We took a parallel corpora of around 50,000 sentences in which we got 9246 sentences (i.e. 21% cases of the whole corpus) that have nominal compounds.",

        "Scholars (Levi 1978; Finin 1980) agree there is a limited number of relations that occur with high frequency in noun compounds.",
        "However, the number and the level of abstraction of these frequently used semantic categories are not agreed upon.",
        "They can vary from a few prepositional paraphrases (Lauer, 1995) to hundreds and even thousands more specific semantic relations (Finin, 1980).",
        "Lauer (1995), for example, considers eight prepositional paraphrases as semantic classification categories: of, for, with, in, on, at, about, and from.",
        "According to this classification, the noun compound \"bird sanctuary\", for instance, can be classified both as \"sanctuary of bird\" and \"sanctuary for bird\".",
        "The automatic interpretation of noun compounds is a difficult task for both unsupervised and supervised approaches.",
        "Currently, the best-performing NC interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus only on two-word noun compounds and rely either on rather ad-hoc, domain-specific, hand-coded semantic taxonomies, or on statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data.",
        "The majority of corpus based statistical approaches to noun compound interpretation collects statistics on the occurrence frequency of the noun constituents and uses them in a probabilistic model (Resnik, 1993; Lauer, 1995; Lapata and Keller, 2004).",
        "Lauer (1995) was the first to devise and test an unsupervised probabilistic model for noun compound interpretation on Grolier encyclopedia, an 8 million word corpus, based on a set of 8 prepositional paraphrases.",
        "His probabilistic model computes the probability of a preposition p given a noun-noun pair n1-n2 and finds the most likely prepositional paraphrase",

        "Lapata and Keller (2004) showed that simple unsupervised models applied to the noun compound interpretation task perform significantly better when the n-gram frequencies are obtained from the web (accuracy of 55.71% on Altavista), rather than from a large standard corpus.",

        "Based on the observation from English-Hindi parallel corpus data that we examined as part of this project, we have designed an algorithm to determine whether an English NC is to be translated as an analytic construct or retained as an NC in Hindi.",
        "We used Yahoo search engine to perform a simple frequency search for \"M Preposition H\" in web corpus for a given input NC.",
        "For example, the paraphrases obtained for the NC \"finance minister\" is given in table 2 and frequency of various paraphrases is shown in the second column:",
        "In the table we notice that the distribution is widely varied.",
        "For some paraphrase the count is very low (minister about finance) while the highest count is 5420000 for \"minister of finance\".",
        "The wide distribution is apparent even when the range is not that high as shown in following table:",
        "During our experiment we have come across three typical cases: (a) No paraphrase is available when searched; (b) Frequency counts of some paraphrases for a given NC is very low and (c) Frequency of a number of paraphrases cross a threshold limit.",
        "The threshold is set to be mean of all the frequencies of paraphrases.",
        "Each of such cases signifies something about the data and we build our translation heuristics based on these observations.",
        "When no paraphrase is found in web corpus for a given NC, we consider such NCs very close-knit constructions and translate them as nominal compound in Hindi.",
        "This generally happens when the NC is a proper noun or a technical term.",
        "Similarly when there exists a number of paraphrases each of those crossing the threshold limit, it indicates that the noun components of such NCs can occur in various contexts and we select the first 3 paraphrase as probable paraphrase of NCs.",
        "For example, the threshold value for the NC finance minister is: Threshold = 6825288/8 = 853161.",
        "The two paraphrases considered as probable paraphrase of this NC is are therefore \"minister of finance\" and \"minister for finance\".",
        "The remaining are ignored.",
        "When count of a paraphrase is less than the threshold, they are removed from the data.",
        "We presume that such low frequency does not convey any significance of paraphrase.",
        "On the contrary, they add to the noise for probability distribution.",
        "For example, all paraphrases of \"antelope species\" except \"species of antelope\" is very low as shown in Table 4.",
