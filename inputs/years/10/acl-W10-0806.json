        "In the main, constructionist approaches to grammar focus on discovering generalizations in language by analyzing clusters of usage-based instances of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Similarly, computational linguistic approaches to grammar learning aim to discover these very same patterns, using automated techniques such as machine learning (ML).",
        "In this research, we use techniques from ML to analyze and predict irregular phenomena with limited data available, and then represent these phenomena visually in a way that is compatible with the Cognitive Grammar descriptive framework (as a constructionist approach to grammar; henceforth CG).",
        "Our grand goal is to develop language technology tools that could be used in descriptive linguistics.",
        "Specifically, we aim to (1) develop a predictor that could suggest derivational forms for novel base-forms; and (2) automatically extract categorization networks (i.e. constructional schemas and the relationships between them) from a dataset, which could serve as a heuristic input to descriptive linguistics."

        "This research originates from a practical problem related to language standardization.",
        "Similar to standardization bodies for languages like Dutch, and German, the \"Afrikaanse Taalkommisie\" (TK) is the official body responsible for the description and regulation of Afrikaans spelling.",
        "The TK regularly publishes the official orthography of Afrikaans in the form of the Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls ('Afrikaans Wordlist and Spelling Rules'; AWS (Taalkommissie, 2009)).",
        "One of the challenges faced by the TK is to standardize the spelling of foreign place names (including names of countries, cities, regions, provinces, etc.",
        "), and their derived forms (i.e. adjectives, such as Amerikaans 'American'; and personal names, such as Amerikaner 'person from America').",
        "In the absence of sufficient usage-based evidence, many variant forms are often being accepted, either related to spelling or derivation; compare for instance the variant spelling forms Maskat or Masqat or Muskat 'Muscat', or the variant derivational forms Turkmenistan-i or Turkme-nistan-ner 'person from Turkmenistan'.",
        "The TK is therefore challenged with the task to give guidelines regarding spelling and derivation, while faced with highly irregular and sparse data containing many variants.",
        "We contribute to address this challenge by discovering the constructions in seemingly unsystematic and irregular data.",
        "Based on our tools and outputs, the TK could then revise existing irregularities and variants, or use these tools to guide future decisions."

        "Morphological constructions can be defined as composite symbolic assemblies (i.e. complex form-meaning pairings) smaller than phrases, consisting of component structures between which valence relations hold (Van Huyssteen, 2010; see also Tuggy, 2005).",
        "One of the main component structures in morphological constructions is the morpheme, which is simply defined as a simplex symbolic unit in the language system (i.e. it does not contain smaller symbolic units as subparts).",
        "More schematic symbolic assemblies (i.e. less specified in their characterization) are referred to as constructional schemas.",
        "Constructional schemas can be represented as a network with relationships of categorization holding between different constructional schemas; these categorization networks provide the structural description of a construction (Langacker, 2008: 222).",
        "In the representations used in CG, categorization relationships of elaboration (i.e. full instantiations of a schema), extension (i.e. partial instantiations), and correspondence are specified.",
        "Entrenchment and ease of activation is indicated by the thickness of boxes: the thicker the line of a box, the more prototypical that unit is (Langacker, 2008: 226; see also Figure 5).",
        "The aim of descriptive linguistics is to postulate categorization networks that describe a construction in a language, based on usage data.",
        "Our research contributes to this aim by automatically creating visual representations of such language models.",
        "For our current research, we are specifically interested in the personal name construction in Afrikaans.",
        "Formation of personal names by means of a personal name creating derivational suffix (NRPERS) is a productive process in many languages.",
        "The specific category that we are investigating in this research is personal names derived from place names, such as Trinidad-ees 'person from Trinidad'.",
        "In one of the standard works on derivation in Afrikaans, Kempen (1969) identifies a number of NRPERS suffixes that are used in derivations from place names.",
        "He finds that there is no obvious systematicity in their distribution (based on a dataset of 132 instances), but concludes that, in derivations of foreign place names, the -ees and s morphemes are most frequently used, with some distribution also over -i, n (especially -aan) and -r. In addition to some of the morphemes mentioned by Kempen (1969), Combrink (1990) also mentions a few, while excluding others.",
        "In as far as we know, no other description of this construction in Afrikaans has been done, and based on the difference between Combrink (1990) and Kempen (1969), we can also deduct that there is no comprehensive understanding of this construction.",
        "Personal names from place names can be formed in four basic ways in Afrikaans: (1) suffixation (Aruba-an 'Arabian'); (2) zero derivation (Aberdeen 'person from Aberdeen'); (3) clipping and back-formation (Turk<Turkye 'person from Turkey'; Armeen<Armenië 'person from Armenia'); and (4) lexicalization (Cornwallis>Korniër 'person from Cornwallis').",
        "In a rather large number of cases (119 in our dataset of 1,034; see 5.1) none of the above strategies can be applied, and then paraphrasing is being used (e.g. 'n persoon van Akkra 'a person from Accra').",
        "Variants of morphemes (i.e. allomorphs) exist for phonological reasons, of which a linking element is the most prominent (Combrink, 1990).",
        "Compare for example -aar in Brussel-aar 'person from Brussels' (where the base-form is polysyllabic) vs. -enaar in Delft-enaar 'person from Delft' (where the base-form is monosyllabic; Delftenaar could therefore also be analyzed as Delft-en-aar).",
        "For our purposes, we consider -enaar as an allo-morph (i.e. elaboration) of -aar, and is identified as such in our categorization network (see Figure 5).",
        "Similarly, we classify morphemes as allo-morphs in cases where an allomorph exists due to identical vowel deletion (e.g. an as a variant of -aan when it combines with a base-form ending on an -a, as in Afrika-an 'person from Africa'), as well as consonant doubling after a short, stressed syllable in the auslaut (e.g. -mer as a variant of -er, as in Amsterdam-mer 'person from Amsterdam').",
        "Computational modeling of morphology is a vast subfield in computational linguistics, gaining popularity since the 1980s.",
        "Pioneering work in the field has been done within the two-level morphology framework, and elaborations on this framework can be considered the basis of state-of-the-art morphological analyzers today.",
        "However, since constructing such analyzers manually is hugely expensive in terms of time and human effort, the approach does not scale well for new languages.",
        "To overcome this obstacle, many computational linguists have developed techniques towards the automatic learning of morphology (e.g. Goldsmith, 2001).",
        "A key goal is to be able to produce a morphological analysis of the words of a corpus when only provided with the unannotated corpus.",
        "We are interested in the related goal of function learning: given a base-form of a word, learn other forms of the word.",
        "Most typically, function learning takes pairs of words (base-forms plus inflected/derived forms) as input to discover patterns in the data.",
        "This is also the paradigm used in the current paper.",
        "Several ML techniques have been used to solve specific function learning tasks (such as learning the past tense form of the English verb).",

        "Our research has two complementary goals, dealt with separately: (1) to develop a predictor that can suggest potential derivational forms for novel base-forms (and alternative forms for existing base-forms with irregular forms); and (2) to automatically extract categorization networks that are easily interpretable by linguists.",
        "In order to analyze existing and predict new derivational forms, we use the Default&Refine (D&R) algorithm (Davel & Barnard, 2004).",
        "This algorithm extracts context-sensitive rules from discrete data, and is particularly effective when learning from small training sets.",
        "It has the additional advantage that rules generated are interpretable by humans.",
        "When applied to the grapheme-to-phoneme prediction task, it has been shown to outperform comparative algorithms (Davel & Barnard, 2008).",
        "The D&R algorithm defines a set of templates and then uses a greedy search to find the most general rule (matching the templates) that describes the training data in question.",
        "Examples that are successfully explained by this rule are removed from the data set and the process repeated.",
        "Whenever a new rule contradicts examples previously dealt with successfully, these are again added to the training data to be \"re-explained\" by a later rule.",
        "The rule set therefore captures hierarchical default behavior: the last rule defines the default behavior for a specific pattern, and acts as a backoff rule to the second-last (more refined) rule, which would capture deviations from default behavior.",
        "The second-last rule would then act as backoff to the third-last rule, and so forth.",
        "Rules are therefore explicitly ordered according to the reverse rule extraction order.",
        "(The rule extracted first is matched last.)",
        "Once a set of rules have been generated, these describe the training data completely.",
        "In addition, by tracing each of the possible rules that may apply to a new pattern (in order), various alternative derivational forms are identified, along with the evidence supporting each option (as in Table 2).",

        "The full dataset is highly irregular, containing many transformation classes that occur only once.",
        "We are interested in these irregularities (in order to identify words that may need further review), as well as in more systematic phenomena that occur in the data.",

        "We also generate a rule set from the training and test data combined: this larger set is used to extract categorization networks.",
        "When the rule set is structured as a graph (called a rule network), the data can be interpreted as follows: the root node indicates the default transformation, which applies unless any child node is matched by the base-form, which again only applies unless a child of the child node matches the base-form (and so forth), which indicates that a more refined rule should be applied.",
        "A small part of a rule network is displayed in Figure 3, with each node listing the end-of-word string of the base-form that will trigger the rule, the transformation rule that will be applied, and the number of instances of the rule in the training data.",
