        "In contrast, the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Prasad et al., 2008) contains 7,448 training instances of causal relations and 2,763 training instances of temporal relations.",
        "This represents a significant increase in the amount of training data over the RST corpus.",

        "Inferences made about the first clause (e.g., that John went to the store because his dog was hungry), are likely to be uninformative or in conflict with explicitly stated information.",

        "Here, context refers to the discourse that surrounds the clause or sentence for which the system is attempting to generate a textual inference.",
        "The context places a number of constraints on allowable inferences.",
        "For example, in addition to content-based constraints demonstrated in Example 5, the context limits pronoun usage, entity references, and tense.",
        "Violations of these constraints will reduce local coherence.",
        "Finally, the story corpus, with its vast size, is likely to contain a significant amount of redundancy for common events and states.",
        "Our centroid-based re-ranking heuristics are inspired by this redundancy, and we expect that aggregation techniques such as clustering might be of some use when applied to the corpus as a whole.",
        "Having identified coherent clusters of causes, it might be easier to find a consequence for a previously unseen cause.",
        "In summary, we have presented preliminary research into the task of using a large, collaboratively constructed corpus as a commonsense knowledge repository.",
        "Rather than relying on hand-coded ontologies and event schemas, our approach relies on the implicit knowledge contained in written natural language.",
        "We have demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining the discourse structure of such a corpus via linear-time parsing models.",
        "Furthermore, we have introduced inference procedures that are capable of generating open-domain textual inferences from the extracted knowledge.",
        "Our evaluation results suggest many opportunities for future work in this area."
