        "Open Information Extraction: The recently popular Open IE (Banko et al., 2007) is an extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input.",
        "These tuples attempt to capture the salient relationships expressed in each sentence.",
        "For instance, for the sentence, \"McCain fought hard against Obama, but finally lost the election\" an Open IE system would extract two tuples <McCain, fought (hard) against, Obama>, and <McCain, lost, the election>.",
        "These tuples can be binary or nary, where the relationship is expressed between more than 2 entities such as <Gates Foundation, invested (arg) in, 1 billion dollars, high schools>.",
        "TextRunner is a state-of-the-art Open IE system that performs extraction in three key steps.",
        "(1)",
        "A self-supervised learner that outputs a CRF based classifier (that uses unlexicalized features) for extracting relationships.",
        "The self-supervised nature alleviates the need for hand-labeled training data and unlexicalized features help scale to the multitudes of relations found on the Web.",
        "(2) A single pass extractor that uses shallow syntactic techniques like part of speech tagging, noun phrase chunking and then applies the CRF extractor to extract relationships expressed in natural language sentences.",
        "The use of shallow features makes TextRunner highly efficient.",
        "(3) A redundancy based assessor that re-ranks these extractions based on a probabilistic model of redundancy in text (Downey et al., 2005).",
        "This exploits the redundancy of information in Web text and assigns higher confidence to extractions occurring multiple times.",
        "All these components enable TEx-tRunner to be a high performance, general, and high quality extractor for heterogeneous Web text.",
        "Semantic Role Labeling: SRL is a common NLP task that consists of detecting semantic arguments associated with a verb in a sentence and their classification into different roles (such as Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.).",
        "Given the sentence \"The pearls I left to my son are fake\" an SRL system would conclude that for the verb 'leave', 'I' is the agent, 'pearls' is the patient and 'son' is the benefactor.",
        "Because not all roles feature in each verb the roles are commonly divided into meta-roles (A0-A7) and additional common classes such as location, time, etc.",
        "Each Ai can represent a different role based on the verb, though A0 and A1 most often refer to agents and patients respectively.",
        "Availability of lexical resources such as Propbank (Martha and Palmer, 2002), which annotates text with meta-roles for each argument, has enabled significant progress in SRL systems over the last few years.",
        "Recently, there have been many advances in SRL (Toutanova et al., 2008; Johansson and Nugues, 2008; Coppola et al., 2009; Moschitti et al., 2008).",
        "We use UIUC-SRL as our base SRL system (Pun-yakanok et al., 2008).",
        "Our choice of the system is guided by the fact that its code is freely available and it is competitive with state of the art (it achieved the highest F1 score on the CoNLL-2005 shared task).",
        "UIUC-SRL operates in four key steps: pruning, argument identification, argument classification and inference.",
        "Pruning involves using a full parse tree and heuristic rules to eliminate constituents that are unlikely to be arguments.",
        "Argument identification uses a classifier to identify constituents that are potential arguments.",
        "In argument classification, another classifier is used, this time to assign role labels to the candidates identified in the previous stage.",
        "Argument information is not incorporated across arguments until the inference stage, which uses an integer linear program to make global role predictions."

        "Our key insight is that semantically labeled arguments in a sentence almost always correspond to the arguments in Open IE extractions.",
        "Thus, we can convert the output of UIUC-SRL into an Open IE extraction.",
        "We illustrate this conversion process via an example.",
        "Given the sentence, \"Eli Whitney created the cotton gin in 1793,\" TextRunner extracts two tuples, one binary and one nary, as follows: arg0 Eli Whitney binary tuple: rel created arg1 the cotton gin nary tuple:",
        "arg0 Eli Whitney",

        "UIUC-SRL will extract: A0 Eli Whitney",
        "To convert UIUC-SRL output to Open IE format, SRL-IE treats the verb (along with its modifiers and negation, if present) as the relation.",
        "Moreover, it assumes SRL's role-labeled arguments as the Open IE arguments related to the relation.",
        "The arguments here consist of all entities labeled Ai, as well as any entities that are marked Direction, Location, or Temporal.",
        "We order the arguments in the same order as they are in the sentence and with regard to the relation (except for direction, location and temporal, which cannot be arg0 of an Open IE extraction and are placed at the end of argument list).",
        "As we are interested in relations, we consider only extractions that have at least two arguments.",
        "In doing this conversion, we naturally ignore part of the semantic information (such as distinctions between various Ai's) that UIUC-SRL provides.",
        "In this conversion process an SRL extraction that was correct in the original format will never be changed to an incorrect Open IE extraction.",
        "However, an incorrectly labeled SRL extraction could still convert to a correct Open IE extraction, if the arguments were correctly identified but incorrectly labeled.",
        "Because of the methodology that TExTRUNNER uses to extract relations, for nary extractions of the form <arg0, rel, argl, argN>, TEXTRUNNER often extracts sub-parts <arg0, rel, arg1>, <arg0, rel, arg1, arg2>, ... , <arg0, rel, arg1, ... , argN-1>.",
        "UIUC-SRL, however, extracts at most only one relation for each verb in the sentence.",

        "Generally, the longer arguments in SRL-IE are more informative than TEXTRUNNER's succinct ones.",
        "On the other hand, TEXTRUNNER's arguments normalize better leading to an effective use of redundancy in ranking.",
        "Lists: In sentences with a comma-separated lists of nouns, SRL-IE creates one extraction and treats the entire list as the argument, whereas TextRunner separates them into several relations, one for each item in the list.",
        "Out of vocabulary verbs: While we expected rel created (arg) in",
        "TEXTRUNNER to handle unknown verbs with little difficulty due to its unlexicalized nature, SRL-IE could have had severe trouble leading to a limited applicability in the context of Web text.",

        "We explore the first question in Section 5.2 and the second in Section 5.3.",

        "We searched for at most 100 sentences that contain both the verb-form and arg0.",
        "This resulted in a test set of an average of 6,000 sentences per relation, for a total of 29,842 sentences.",
        "We use this test set for all experiments in this paper.",
        "In order to compute precision and recall on this dataset, we tagged extractions by TextRunner and by SRL-IE as correct or errors.",
        "A tuple is correct if the arguments have correct boundaries and the relation accurately expresses the relationship between all of the arguments.",
