        "Dialogue act theories (also called speech acts (Allen & Perrault, 1980)) are concerned with the roles utterances play in discourse and the effects they have on the world or on understanding.",
        "An utterance identified as a Requesting Information, for example, might take the syntactic form of a question that makes the information requested explicit, e.g. \"What time is it?\"",
        "The surface manifestation might instead be a statement, or an indirect question, e.g. \"Do you have the time?\"",
        "In other words, its classification is based on its function in the dialogue and the set of operations it suggests for the recipient to undertake.",
        "We claim that there exists a set of analogical dialogue acts that are used in communicating analogies.",
        "Like other dialogue acts, they have criteria by which they can be recognized, and a set of implied commitments and obligations for the dialogue participants.",
        "This paper focuses on instructional analogies in texts, both because they are an important phenomenon and because it allows us to factor out follow-up questions, making it a useful starting point.",
        "There are a wide variety of dialogue act models, but all of them include some variation of acts like Inform (Traum, 2000), which indicate the intent to describe the state of the world.",
        "The analogical dialogue acts we discuss here can be viewed as specializations of Inform.",
        "The organization of analogical dialogue acts follows directly from the concepts of structure-mapping theory.",
        "In structure-mapping, analogical matching takes as input two structured, relational representations, the base and target, and produces as output one or more mappings.",
        "Each mapping consists of a set of correspondences, identifying how entities and statements in the base align with entities and statements in the target.",
        "Mappings include a structural evaluation score providing an estimate of their overall quality.",
        "This estimate is based on systematicity, i.e., the amount of nested relational structure in the mapping, especially higher-order relations that serve as inferential connections between other statements.",
        "Causal, logical, and mathematical statements are all examples of higher-order relations.",
        "Systematicity thus serves as a local heuristic measure of the explanatory promise of a mapping.",
        "Mappings can also contain candidate inferences, statements in the base that are projected onto the target, using the correspondences of the mapping.",
        "The candidate inferences represent conjectures about the target, and constitute a source of analogy's generative power.",
        "Whether or not the candidate inferences are in fact correct is evaluated outside of the matching process.",
        "In discourse, candidate inferences are often used to convey new information about the target to the learner.",
        "Candidate inferences can be forward, from base to target, or reverse, from target to base.",
        "Candidate inferences also represent differences between two representations, when they cannot be consistently projected from one description to the other.",
        "The Structure-Mapping Engine (SME, Falken-hainer et al. 1989) provides a simulation of analogical matching.",
        "SME typically produces only one mapping, but can produce a second or third mapping if they are sufficiently close to the best mapping.",
        "SME can accept input about the base and target incrementally, updating its mappings as new information becomes available (Forbus et al. 1994), which can be important for modeling the incremental nature of discourse.",
        "One cost of SME's greedy match algorithm and incremental operation is that matches can go awry.",
        "Consequently, SME also supports a small set of constraints, optionally specified as part of the matcher's input, which guide it based on task constraints.",
        "Here the relevant constraints are those concerning correspondences.",
        "That is, given a base item bi and target item tj, either entities or statements, the following constraints are defined: required(bi tj) means that bimust correspond to tj in every mapping, and ex-cluded(bi tj) means that bi cannot correspond to tj in any mapping.",
        "The following open constraints are also defined: requiredBase(bi), means that something in every mapping must correspond to bi, with requiredTarget(tj) defined similarly.",
        "excluded-Base(b) means that bi cannot participate in any correspondence, with excludedTarget(tj) defined similarly.",
        "An important problem in understanding analogy in discourse concerns how the representations provided to SME are constructed.",
        "As described below, the representations that constitute an understanding of the text are produced in our model via a semi-automatic natural language understanding system, which reduces tailorability.",
        "In understanding instructional analogies, a learner is expected to draw upon their existing world knowledge.",
        "In some situations, whole cases representing a prior experience are retrieved from memory.",
        "In other situations, cases seem to be constructed dynamically from one's general knowledge of the world.",
        "We use dynamic case construction methods (Mostek et al. 2000) to model this process.",
        "In dynamic case construction, a seed entity or concept is provided as a starting point, and facts which mention it are gathered, perhaps filtering by some criterion.",
        "For example, \"The economy of India\" might have India as its seed, and facts filtered based on their judged relevance to economic matters.",
        "When a reader is processing an instructional analogy, we believe that something like this process is used to create representations to be used in their understanding of the analogy."

        "To carry out an analogy, a reader must be able to infer that an analogy is required.",
        "They must understand what goes into the base and what goes into the target, which can be complex because what is stated in the text typically needs to be combined with the reader's own knowledge.",
        "Since readers often know quite a lot to begin with, figuring out which subset of what they know is relevant to the analogy can be complicated.",
        "Finally, they have to understand how the author intends the mapping to go, since there can be multiple mappings between the same domains.",
        "Analogical dialogue acts, we argue, provide readers with information that they need to perform these tasks.",
        "Let us examine this process in more detail.",
        "To carry out an analogy, the contents of the base and target representations must be identified.",
        "A fundamental problem is that the reader must figure out an appropriate construal of the base and target, i.e., what subset of their knowledge should be brought to bear in the current comparison?",
        "A reader's starting knowledge may or may not be sufficient to guide the mapping process correctly, in order to reconstruct the mapping that the author intended.",
        "This is especially true in instructional analogies, of course.",
        "We believe that this is why one commonly finds explicit information about intended correspondences provided as part of instructional analogies.",
        "Such information provides a source of constraints that can be used to guide case construction and mapping.",
        "Similarly, and we believe for similar reasons, the desired inferences to be drawn from the analogy are often highlighted.",
        "Since there can be multiple construals (i.e., specific sets of facts retrieved) for the given base and target, mentioning candidate inferences explicitly provides clues to the reader about how to construe the base and target (i.e., the given candidate inference should be derivable) as well as information about its validity.",

        "For each act, we give an example, some criteria for identifying them, and describe what operations a reader might do when they detect such an act has occurred.",

        "Modeling the roles that analogy plays in understanding language is an important problem in learning by reading.",
        "This paper is an initial exploration of how analogy can be integrated into dialogue act theories, focusing on instructional analogies in text.",
        "We presented a catalog of analogical dialogue acts, based on an analysis of how the functional constraints of analogical mapping and case construction interact with the properties of discourse.",
        "We showed that a simulation using these ideas, combined with a natural language understanding system to semi-automatically produce input representations, can indeed learn information from simplified English analogies, which is encouraging evidence for these ideas.",
        "The next step is to expand the corpus substantially, including more examples of all the ADAs, to better test our model.",
        "We also need to implement the rest of the ADAs, and experiment with a wider range of processing strategies.",
        "To better model how ADAs can be identified in natural texts, we plan to use a large-scale web-based corpus analysis.",
        "We have focused on text here, but we believe that these ideas apply to spoken dialogue as well.",
        "We predict more opportunities for blocking in spoken dialogue, due to opportunities for feedback.",
        "Our goal is to incorporate these ideas into a 2nd generation learning by reading system (e.g., Forbus et al. 2007; Forbus et al. 2009a), along with other dialogue processing, to better interpret larger-scale texts (e.g., Lockwood & Forbus, 2009).",
        "This will be built using the Companions cognitive architecture (Forbus et al. 2009b), to more easily model a wider range of processing strategies, and so that the system can learn to improve its interpretation processes."
