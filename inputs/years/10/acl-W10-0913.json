        "There are a number of challenges involved when using facts extracted from text to enrich a knowledge base (KB) with semantic relations between entities: co-reference resolution as there are many co-referent objects; entity resolution in order to link the entities mentioned in text to the right entities in the KB; handling co-referent relations, as a particular semantic relation between entities can be expressed in a variety of ways in the text and therefore have multiple facts associated between the entities.",
        "In addition, the facts extracted from linguistic analysis are usually noisy and sparse.",
        "Our work focuses on a recent line of exploratory work in the direction of Unrestricted Relation Discovery which is defined as: the automatic identification of different relations in text without specifying a relation or set of relations in advance (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006).",

        "For most entities like persons, places and things, Powerset shows a summary of facts from across Wikipedia (figure 1).",
        "In our approach we use the readily available \"Factz\" from Powerset as input to our system.",

        "Approach",
        "In this section we describe in detail the different steps in our approach involving querying Factz from Powerset, collapsing facts expressing same type of relation, Label Selection and introducing Semantic Typing information.",
        "Figure 2 gives an overview of our approach and Figure 3 shows the different components in our system.",
        "We discuss each component in detail below.",
        "In the first step we query Powerset API by giving as input a list of entities or list of entity pairs and retrieve all the Factz and sentences that are associated with the entities or entity pairs from the Powerset API output.",
        "A particular semantic relationship can be expressed in different ways in sentences.",
        "For example words like \"purchase\", \"buy\" and \"acquire\" may represent the same semantic relation between the subject and the object.",
        "Sometimes the words might be direct synonyms in which case resources like WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) can help in identifying the same relation whereas in other cases the words might not be synonyms at all but may still imply the same semantic relation between the subject and the object.",
        "For example, we queried Powerset to get a sample of relations between companies and products.",
        "We got relations like introduce, produce, sell, manufacture and make.",
        "It is often the case that companies introduce and sell the products that they manufacture, make or produce.",
        "However, all of these words are not synonyms of each other and it may not be feasible to express the relation between a company and a product in all these different ways in a KB.",
        "We have developed an approach for collapsing relations expressed using different words in the facts and represent it using the dominating relation between the pair of entities.",
        "We explain the different steps in our approach below.",
        "We consider relations to be similar if they appear between the same subjects and the objects.",
        "We take the set of Factz that we got by querying Powerset in the previous step and based on those Factz we construct a similarity matrix to represent similarity between all pairs of relations in the data set.",
        "Each entry in the similarity matrix represents the number of times the pair of relations had the same subject and object in the Factz data set.",
        "For example, in the sample dataset in table 1, the similarity matrix entry for the pair acquired and purchased would be 3.",
        "We use that similarity matrix as input and apply average link agglomerative clustering algorithm over it.",
        "After the clustering step we have a step for filtering ambiguous relations from the clusters.",
        "We explain the filtering procedure using an example from one of the experiments in which two clusters were produced.",
        "First cluster had acquire, purchase, buy and own relations and the second cluster had introduce, produce, make and say about relations.",
        "After clustering the relations we have the following steps:",
        "1.",
        "We take each pair of entities and get the set of relations between the pair of entities.",
        "For example, the set of relation between \"Bank of America\" and \"Merrill Lynch\" are acquire, purchase and say about (figure 4).",
        "2.",
        "By considering the set of relations between each pair of entities we assign it to a cluster based on the maximum number of overlapping relations between the set and the cluster members.",
        "In our example clusters, we assign it to cluster one with which there is an overlap of two relations i.e. acquire and buy instead of assigning it to cluster two with which it has an overlap of one relation i.e. say about (figure 4).",
        "3.",
        "Once an entity pair is assigned to a cluster, we consider other relations in the set of relations present between that entity pair and if any of those relations exists as a member of another cluster we filter out that relation from that cluster.",
        "For example, one of the relations present between \"Bank of America\" and \"Merill Lynch\" is",
        "Relation Cluster 1 Relation Cluster 2",
        "say about, and this relation is actually a member of cluster two whereas, this pair is assigned to cluster one and therefore, we filter out say about from cluster two.",
        "After cluster filtering, the label for the cluster is selected as the label that is the most frequent relation found in the set of entity pairs being assigned to the cluster.",
        "A pair of entities might have more than one fact associated with them.",
        "We select a representative label based on a hybrid approach by combining the output from entropy based label ranking (Chen et al., 2005) and clusters of similar relations found by relational clustering.",
        "We select the relation label as the cluster label of the cluster which has the maximum member overlap with the predicates in the set of facts between a pair of entities.",
        "In case there is an overlap of just one relation, we select the label that is ranked highest through entropy based label ranking approach (Chen et al., 2005).",
        "According to their algorithm, the importance of terms can be assessed using the entropy criterion, which is based on the assumption that a term is irrelevant if its presence obscures the separability of the dataset.",
        "There may be cases where there are multiple relations existing between a given pair of entities, however, in our approach we select the relation label that is evident in the majority of the facts associated with the pair.",
        "For certain applications there might be the need of discovering relations between specific types of entities rather than instances of entities.",
        "For example, for ontology engineering, the ontology engineer might want to explore the kind of relations that exist between different entity types based on the data set and then develop an ontology representing those relations.",
        "Therefore, we have a component in our system that incorporates semantic type information into the Factz before collapsing the relations present in the facts.",
        "The semantic type module queries a knowledge base for the entity type and replaces the entity instance names with entity types in the Factz data set.",
        "We have used the Freebase (Me-taweb Technologies, 2009) Knowledge base to associate the entity types for the entities that we experimented with.",
        "When this modified version of the Factz dataset is given as input to the next component of the system i.e. Collapse Relations, the similarity between relations is computed based on having the same subject and object entity types rather than entity instances.",
        "Following the Semantic Typing path in the system would output the relations discovered between types of entities.",
        "Introducing Semantic Typing information can also help in creating redundancy in the dataset and overcome the data sparseness problem.",
        "For example in case of relations such as acquire and purchase if we cannot get evidence of overlap in the subject and object in the Factz dataset then we cannot assign them any similarity score in the similarity matrix however, if we replace the instance names with instance types and consider the overlap between the instance types we can get more evidence about their similarity.",

        "The number of pairs for which Powerset returned Factz is low because Powerset currently extracts Factz from well formed sentences and not semi-structured or structured information such as tables or info-boxes in Wikipedia and the acquisition relation is mostly expressed in the form of tables or lists in Wikipedia articles.",
        "We applied relational clustering and stopped clustering when the similarity between the clusters was less than 4.",
        "We identified one cluster (acquire, purchase, buy) having more than one member and got 146 relations labeled accurately i.e. 85% accuracy through our approach.",

        "We were mainly focusing on relations that were expressed by verbs.",
        "We took all sentences between a pair of entities from which Powerset had extracted Factz.",
        "We extracted verbs from those sentences and ranked those verbs based on the entropy based label ranking approach and considered any of the labels matching with the cluster members (acquire, purchase, buy) as correct prediction.",
        "We compared the results with the ground truth and got the accuracy of 72% (table 2).",
        "Our preliminary experiment on the sample dataset demonstrated that the relation labels assigned by Powerset have reasonably high accuracy when compared with ground truth i.e. 85% and also give higher accuracy as compared to the entropy based label ranking approach for the sample data set.",

        "The Wikipedia article links served the purpose of finding out which organizations are related to which other organizations and which persons are related to which organizations.",
        "The first dataset represented relations between Organizations whereas the second dataset represented relations between Persons and Organizations.",
        "We applied relational clustering for collapsing similar relations and evaluated the output clusters at different thresholds to see if they represented relations between different types of entities.",
        "At stopping with a threshold of 2 we found the following two clusters having more than one member: one of the clusters represented the relations present between a pair of Organizations (acquire, purchase, buy, own, say about, take over) and the other cluster represented the relations between Persons and Organizations (formed, found, lead) (table 3).",

        "From the two clusters, one cluster had manufacture, produce and make relations and the second had acquire, purchase, own, operate and buy relations (table 4).",
        "Our intuition was that the first cluster represented relations between organizations and products.",
        "Therefore, we took the \"company-products\" table from Freebase and compared it with our dataset.",
        "However, we could only find an overlap of 3 subject object pairs.",
        "The second cluster had relations that we earlier found to exist between organizations having the acquisition relation between them, therefore, we took the \"acquisitions\" table from Freebase and compared it against our dataset.",
        "Comparing the pairs with our list of organizations, we found 104 pairs that had an organization as a subject and an object.",
        "Out of those 104 pairs 97 pairs were assigned to cluster 2 and 7 pairs were assigned to cluster 1.",
        "When we compared those 97 pairs with Freebase \"acquisition\" table (which had 73 pairs of organizations that overlapped with our dataset) we found that 66 existed in the set and were therefore predicted correctly.",
        "We then inspected the rest of the pairs manually and found that there were 16 additional pairs that were predicted to have the acquire relation and which were not present in the Freebase table.",

        "In this experiment we introduced Semantic Type information in the Factz data set to discover relations at different levels of abstraction i.e. between Entity Types at different levels (For example School or Organization, where School is a type of Organization).",
        "We took a list of 13000 organizations for which we had their Organization Types available from an internal KB and queried Powerset for Factz between all pairs of organizations and were able to retrieve more than 88,000 Factz.",

        "The Factz dataset with Semantic Type information was given as input for collapsing relations, where the similarity matrix was constructed based on the same subject and object types (rather than same subject and object instances), after which the clustering was performed.",
        "We evaluated the clusters at different stopping thresholds but the system did not generate any meaningful clusters.",
        "We then looked into the dataset and realized that a lot of noise was introduced into the system due to various organization names which were very ambiguous and replacing the ambiguous organization names with organization types had magnified the noise.",

        "We have developed a hybrid approach for unsupervised and unrestricted relation discovery between entities using linguistic analysis via Powerset, entropy based label ranking and semantic typing information from a Knowledge base.",
        "We initially compared the accuracy of Powerset Factz with ground truth and with entropy based label ranking approach on a sample dataset and observed that the relations discovered through Powerset Factz gave higher accuracy than the entropy based approach for the sample dataset.",
        "We also developed an approach to collapse a set of relations represented in facts as a single dominating relation and introduced a hybrid approach for label selection based on relation clustering and entropy based label ranking.",
        "Our experiments showed that the relational clustering approach was able to cluster different kinds of entity pairs into different clusters.",
        "For the case where the kinds of entity pairs were at different levels of abstraction, introducing Semantic Typing information helped in introducing redundancy and also in clustering relations between different kinds of entity pairs whereas, the direct approach was not able to identify meaningful clusters.",
