        "Our proposal is a step forward in this direction in two ways: a) it allows for feedback generation focusing both on formal and content (communicative-oriented) aspects of language learning activities, and b) it provides teachers with a tool and a methodology both evolving-for them to gain autonomy in the creation of parser-based CALL activities which by the way has a long tradition in CALL (Levy 1997, chap.",

        "Over the past four decades there have been several hundreds of CALL (Computer-Aided Language Learning) projects, often linked to CALL practice (Levy 1997), and within the last twenty years a considerable number of them focused on the use of",
        "NLP in the context of CALL (Amaral and Meurand 38).",
        "Moreover, parallel research shows that the softwareintegration of CALL in the learning context is critical to ensure the success of whatever materials are offered to learners (Levy 1997, 200-203; Polis-ca 2006).",
        "AutoTutor goes beyond tools such as Hot Potatoes, eXelearning or JClic in that it offers the possibility of authoring NLP-based CALL activities.",
        "It is also more ambitious than other authoring tools developed for the creation of activities in intelligent tutoring systems.",
        "Chen and Tokuda (2003) and Rösener (2009) present authoring tools for translation exercises, where expected learner input is much more controlled (by the sentence in the source language).",
        "Heift and Toole (2002) present Tutor Assistant, which enables to create activities such as build-a-sentence, drag-and-drop and fill-in-the-blank.",
        "An important difference between AutoTutor and Tutor Assistant is that the latter is a bit more restrictive in terms of the linguistic objects that can be used.",
        "It also presents a lighter complexity in the modelling of the underlying correction modules.",
        "However, the system underlying Tutor Assistant provides with more complex student adaptation functionalities (Heift 2003) and would be complementary in terms of overall system functionalities.",
        "AutoTutor is a web-based software solution to assist non-NLP experts in the creation of language learning activities using NLP-intensive processing techniques.",
        "The process includes a simplified specification of the means to automatically create the resources used to analyse learner input for each exercise.",
        "The goal is to use computational devices to analyse learner production and to be able to go beyond \"yes-or-no\" answers providing additional feedback focused both on form and content.",
        "This research work is framed within the AutoLearn project, a follow up of the ALLES project (Schmidt et al., 2004, Quixal et al., 2006).",
        "AutoLearn's aim was to exploit in a larger scale a subset of the technologies developed in ALLES in real instruction settings.",
        "Estrada et al.",
        "(2009) describe how, in AutoLearn's first evaluation phase, the topics of the activities were not attractive enough for learners and how learner activity decreased within the same learning unit across exercises.",
        "Both observations together with what it has been shown with respect to the integration of independent language learning, see above - impelled us to develop AutoTutor, which allows teachers to create their own learning units.",
        "As reflected in Figure 1, AutoTutor consists primarily of two pieces of software: AutoTutor Activity Creation Kit (ATACK) and AutoTutor Activity Player (ATAP).",
        "ATACK, an authoring tool, provides teachers with the ability to create parser-based CALL exercises and define the corresponding exercise specifications for the generation of automated feedback.",

        "Access to those methods is made through XML-RPC calls.",
        "ATACK is divided in two components: a GUI that allows content creators to enter the text, questions and instructions to be presented to learners in order to elicit answers from them; and an NLP resource creation module that automatically generates the resources that will be used for the automated feedback.",
        "Through the GUI, teachers are also able to define a set of expected correct answers for each question, and, optionally, specific customized feedback and sample answers.",
        "To encode linguistic and conceptual variation in the expected answers, teachers are required to turn them into linguistic patterns using blocks.",
        "Blocks represent abstract concepts, and contain the concrete chunks linked to those concepts.",
        "Within a block one can define alternative linguistic structures representing the same concept.",
        "By combining and ordering blocks, teachers can define the sequences of text that correspond to the expected correct answers -i.e., they can provide the seeds for answer modelling.",
        "Modelling answers",
        "Given an exercise where learners are required to answer the question \"From an architecture point of view, what makes Hagia Sophia in Istanbul so famous according to its Wikipedia entry?",

        "Thus, the possible correct block sequences would be (indices corresponding to Figure 2):",
        "Block B1 is an example of interchangeable alternatives (the Hagia Sophia or the old mosque), which do not require any further condition to apply.",
        "In contrast, block B2 is an instance of a syntactic variation of the concept.",
        "Famousness can be expressed through an adjective or through a verb (in our example), but each of the choices requires a different sentence structure.",
        "Alternative texts in a block with no variants (as in B1) exploit the paradigmatic properties of language, while alternative texts in a block with two variants as in B2 account for its syntagmatic properties, reflected in the block sequences.",
        "Interestingly, this sort of splitting of a sentence into blocks is information-driven and simplifies the linguistic expertise needed for the exercise specifications.",

        "AutoTutor has been used by a group of seven content creators university and school teachers-for a period of three months.",
        "They developed over 20 activities for learning units on topics such as business and finance, sustainable production and consumption, and new technologies.",
        "Those activities contain listening and reading comprehension activities, short-text writing activities, enabling tasks on composition writing aspects, etc.",
        "whose answers must be expressed in relatively free answers consisting of one sentence.",
        "In November 2009, these activities were used in real instruction settings with approximately 600 learners of English and German.",
        "Furthermore, an evaluation of both teacher and learner satisfaction and system performance was carried out.",
        "We briefly describe the process of creating the materials by one of the (secondary school) teachers participating in the content creation process and evaluate the results of system performance in one activity created by this same teacher.",
        "To start the process teachers received a 4-hour training course (in two sessions) where they were taught how to plan, pedagogically speaking, a learning sequence including activities to be corrected using automatically generated feedback.",
        "We required them to develop autonomous learning units if possible.",
        "And we invited them to get hold of any available technology or platform functionality to implement their ideas (and partially offered support to them too), convinced that technology had to be a means rather than a goal in itself.",
        "The course also included an overview of NLP techniques and a specific course on the mechanics of ATACK (the authoring tool) and ATAP (the activity management and deployment tool).",
        "During this training we learned that most teachers do not plan how activities will be assessed: that is, they often do not think of the concrete answers to the possible questions they will pose to learners.",
        "They do not need to, since they have all the knowledge required to correct learner production any place, any time in their heads (the learner, the activity and the expert model) no matter if the learner production is written or oral.",
        "This is crucial since it requires a change in normal working routine.",
        "After the initial training they created learning materials.",
        "During creation we interacted with them to make sure that they were not designing activities whose answers were simply impossible to model.",
        "For instance, the secondary school teacher who prepared the activity on sustainable production and consumption provided us with a listening comprehension activity including questions such as:",
        "1) Which is your attitude concerning responsible consumption?",
        "How do you deal with recycling?",
        "Do you think yours is an ecological home?",
        "Are you doing your best to reduce your ecological footprint?",
        "Make a list with 10 things you could do at home to reduce, reuse o recycle waste at home.",
        "All these things were asked in one sole instruction, to be answered in one sole text area.",
        "We then talked to the teacher and argued with her the kinds of things that could be modelled using simple one-sentence answers.",
        "We ended up reducing the input provided to learners to perform the activity to one",
        "video (initially a text and a video) and prompting learners with the following three questions:",
        "1) Explain in your words what the ecological footprint is.",
        "2) What should be the role of retailers according to Timo Mäkelä?",
        "3) Why should producers and service providers use the Ecolabel?",
        "Similar interventions were done in other activities created by other content creators.",
        "But some of them were able to create activities which could be used almost straightforwardly.",
        "The materials created by teachers were then used in their courses.",
        "In the setting that we analyse learners of English as a second language were Catalan and Spanish native speakers between 15 and 17 years old that attended a regular first year of Batxillerat (first course for those preparing to enter university studies).",
        "They had all been learning English for more than five years, and according to their teacher their CEF level was between A2 and B1.",
        "They were all digital literates and they all used the computer on a weekly basis for their studies or leisure (80% daily).",
        "We analyse briefly the results obtained for two of the questions in one of the activities created by the school teacher who authored the learning unit on sustainable production and consumption, namely questions 1) and 2) above.",
        "This learning unit was offered to a group of 25 learners.",
        "Overall system performance",
        "Table 1 reflects the number of attempts performed by learners trying to answer the two questions evaluated here: correct, partially correct and incorrect answers are almost equally distributed (around 30% each) and non-evaluated answers are roughly 10%.",
        "In non-evaluated answers we include basically answers where learners made a bad use of the system (e.g., answers in a language other than the one learned) or answers which were exactly the same as the previous one for two attempts in a row, which can interpreted in several ways (misunderstanding of the feedback, usability problems with the interface, problems with pop-up windows, etc.)",
        "that fall out of the scope of the current analysis.",
        "correct and incorrect answers for each of the two questions analyzed.",
        "The tables distinguish between Form Messages and Content Messages, and Real Form Errors and Real Content Errors a crucial distinction given our claim that using AutoTutor more open questions could be tackled.",
        "Table 2 and Table 3 show that the contrast between issued feedback messages (most commonly error messages, but sometimes rather pieces of advice or suggestions) and real problems found in the answers is generally balanced in formal problems (31:15, 8:7 and 41:39 for Table 2; and 6:8, 29:18, and 20:21 for Table 3) independently of the correctness of the answer.",
        "On the contrary, the contrast between issued messages and content problems is much more unbalanced in correct and partially correct answers (139:71 and 84:42 for Table 2; and 45:20 and 110:57 for Table 3) and more balanced for incorrect answers (30:18 for Table 2; and 93:77 for",

        "For instance in a sentence like (as an answer to question 2) The retailers need to make sure that whatever they label or they put in shelf is understandable",
        "to consumers.the system would generate six different feedback messages informing that some words were not expected (even if correct) and some were found but not in the expected location or form.",
        "In this same sentence above we find examples of too poor specifications, where, for instance, it was not foreseen that retailers was used in the answer.",
        "These two kinds of errors reflect the flaws of the current system: artificial separation reflects a lack of generalization capacity of the underlying parser, and poor specifications reflect the incompleteness of the information provided by novice users, teachers acting as material designers."

        "This paper describes software that provides non-NLP experts with a means to utilize and customize NLP-intensive resources using an authoring tool for language instruction activities.",
        "Its usability and usefulness have been tested in real instruction settings and are currently being evaluated and analyzed.",
        "Initial analyses show that the technology and methodology proposed allow teachers to create contents including automatic generation feedback without the need of being neither a programmer nor an NLP expert.",
        "Moreover, system performance shows a reasonable confidence in error detection given the immaturity of the tool and of its users following Shneiderman and Plaisant's terminology (2006).",
        "There is room for improvement in the way to reduce false positives related with poor specifications.",
        "It is quite some work for exercise designers to foresee a reasonable range of linguistic alternatives for each answer.",
        "One could further support them in the design of materials with added functionalities using strategies such as shallow semantic parsing, as in (Bailey and Meurers, 2008), or adding functionalities on the user interface that allow teachers to easily feed exercise models or specific feedback messages using learner answers.",
        "The architecture presented allows for portability into other languages (English and German already available), with a relative simplicity provided that the lexicon for the language exists and contains basic morpho-syntactic information.",
        "Moreover, having developed it as a Moodle extension makes it available to a wide community of teachers and learners.",
        "The modularity of ATACK and ATAP makes them easy to integrate in other Learning Management Systems.",
        "In the longer term we plan to improve AutoTu-tor's configurability so that its behaviour can be defined following pedagogical criteria.",
        "One of the aspects to be improved is that a computational linguist is needed to add new global error types to be handled or new linguistic phenomena to be considered in terms of block order.",
        "If such a system is used by wider audiences, then statistically driven techniques might be employed gradually, probably in combination with symbolic techniques the usage of the tool will provide with invaluable learner corpora.",
        "In the meantime AutoTutor provides with a means to have automatic correction and feedback generation for those areas and text genres where corpus or native speaker text is scarce, and experiments show it could be realistically used in real instruction settings.",
