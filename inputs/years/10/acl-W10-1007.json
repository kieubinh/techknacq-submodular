        "Another metric of the quality of a cloze task is context restriction; the number of solutions perceived as acceptable keys for a given stem.",

        "The theory involves the information content of a blank.",
        "According to Shannon's (1948) seminal work on information theory, the information contained in a given term is inverse to its predictability.",
        "In other words, if a term appears despite following a history after which is it considered very unlikely to occur, that word has high information content.",
        "For example, consider the partial sentence \"She drives a nice...\".",
        "A reader forms hypotheses about the next word before seeing it, and thus expects an overall meaning of the sentence.",
        "A word that conforms to this hypothesis, such as the word 'car', does little to change a reader's knowledge and thus has little information.",
        "If instead the next word is 'taxi', 'tank', or 'ambulance', unforeseen knowledge is gained and relative information is higher.",
        "According to Finn (1978) the applicability of this theory to Cloze Easiness can be explained though lexical transfer features.",
        "These features can be both syntactic and semantic, and they serve to interrelate words within a sentence.",
        "If a large number of lexical transfer features are within a given proximity of a blank, then the set of words matching those features will be highly restricted.",
        "Given that each choice of answer will be from a smaller pool of options, the probability of that answer will be much higher.",
        "Thus, a highly probable key has correspondingly low information content.",

        "Cloze Easiness improves if a student chooses from a smaller set of possibilities.",
        "The instructional value of a highly context-restricted cloze task is also higher by providing a richer set of lexical transfer features with which to associate vocabulary.",
        "Finn's application of information theory to Cloze Easiness and context restriction provides one possible new avenue to improve the quality of generated cloze tasks.",
        "We hypothesize that words of higher reading levels contain higher numbers of transfer features and thus their presence in a sentence can be correlated with its degree of context restriction.",

        "We can use a unigram reading level model to investigate this hypothesis.",
        "Returning to the example words for the partial sentence \"She drives a nice...\", we can see that our current model classifies the highly expected word, 'car', at reading level 1, while 'taxi','tank', and 'ambulance', are at reading levels 5, 6, and 11 respectively.",
        "The estimation of reading level is a complex topic unto itself.",

        "Experimental results from AMT are then used to evaluate the hypothesis that reading level can be used as a new, alternative predictor of cloze quality.",

        "As an alternative to expert evaluation of cloze quality, we investigated the use of non-expert workers on AMT.",
        "A statistically significant correlation was found between the co-occurrence score of a sentence and its experimental measure of Cloze Easiness.",
        "This is evidence that crowdsourcing techniques agree with expert evaluation of co-occurrence scores in past studies.",
        "To gain further evidence of the validity of these experimental results, sentences selected by a composite filter of co-occurrence score and Cloze Easiness were compared to sentences selected by context restriction and reading level.",
        "An expert evaluation showed a preference for sentences selected by the composite filter.",
        "We believe that this method of cloze task selection is promising.",
        "It will now be tested in a real learning situation.",
        "This work contributes insight into methods for improving technologies such as intelligent tutoring systems and language games."
