        "We investigated using structural events, e.g., clause and disfluency structure, from transcriptions of spontaneous non-native speech, to compute features for measuring speaking proficiency.",
        "Using a set of transcribed audio files collected from the TOEFL Practice Test Online (TPO), we conducted a sophisticated annotation of structural events, including clause boundaries and types, as well as disfluencies.",
        "Based on words and the annotated structural events, we extracted features related to syntactic complexity, e.g., the mean length of clause (MLC) and dependent clause frequency (DEPC), and a feature related to disfluencies, the interruption point frequency per clause (IPC).",
        "Among these features, the IPC shows the highest correlation with holistic scores (r = – 0.344).",
        "Furthermore, we increased the correlation with human scores by normalizing IPC by (1) MLC (r = – 0.386), (2) DEPC (r = – 0.429), and (3) both (r = – 0.462).",
        "In this research, the features derived from structural events of speech transcriptions are found to predict holistic scores measuring speaking proficiency.",
        "This suggests that structural events estimated on speech word strings provide a potential way for assessing non-native speech.",
        "tendorf et al., 2008).",
        "The detected structural events have been successfully used in many natural language processing (NLP) applications (Ostendorf et al., 2008).",
        "However, the structural events in speech data haven't been largely utilized by the research on using automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology to assess speech proficiency (Neumeyer et al., 2000; Zechner et al., 2007), which mainly used cues derived at the word level, such as timing information of spoken words.",
        "The information beyond the word level, e.g., clause/sentence structure of utterances and disfluency structure, has not been or is poorly represented.",
        "For example, in Zechner et al.",
        "(2007), only special words for filled pauses such as um and uh were obtained from ASR results to represent disfluencies.",
        "Given the successful usage of structural events on a wide range of NLP applications and the fact that the usage of these events is missing in the automatic speech assessment research, a research question emerges: Can we use structural events of spontaneous speech to assess non-native speech proficiency?"

        "In the last decade, a large amount of research (Ostendorf et al., 2008) has been conducted on detection of structural events, e.g., sentence structure and dis-fluency structure, in spontaneous speech.",
        "In these research works, the structural events were detected with a quite high accuracy.",
        "Furthermore, the detected sentence and disfluency structures have been found to help many of the following NLP tasks, e.g., speech parsing, information retrieval, machine translation, and extractive speech summary (Ostendorfetal., 2008).",
        "In the second language acquisition (SLA) and child language development research fields, the language development is measured according to fluency, accuracy, and complexity (Iwashita, 2006).",
        "The syntactic complexity of learners' writing data has been extensively studied in the SLA community (Ortega, 2003).",
        "Recently, this study has been extended to the learner's speaking data (Iwashita, 2006).",
        "Typical metrics for examining syntactic complexity include: length of production unit (e.g., T-unit, which is defined as essentially a main clause plus any other clauses which are dependent upon it (Hunt, 1970), clauses, verb phrases, and sentences), amount of embedding, subordination and coordination, range of structural types, and structure sophistication.",
        "Iwashita (2006) investigated several measures for syntactic complexity on the data from learners of Japanese.",
        "The author reported that some measurements, e.g., T-unit length, the number of clauses per T-unit, and the number of independent clauses per T-Unit, were good at predicting learners' proficiency levels.",
        "In addition, some previous studies used measurements related to disfluencies to assess speaking proficiency.",
        "For example, Lennon (1990) used a dozen features related to speed, pauses, and several dis-fluency markers, such as filler pauses per T-unit, to measure four German-speaking women's English improvement during a half year study in England.",
        "He found a significant change in filled pauses per T-unit during the studying process.",
        "The features related to syntactic complexity and the features related to \"smoothness\" (disfluency) of speech were jointly used in some previous studies.",
        "For example, Mizera (2006) used fluency factors related to speed, voiced smoothness (frequencies of repetitions or self-corrections), pauses, syntactic complexity (mean length of T-units), and accuracy, to measure speaking proficiency on 20 non-native English speakers.",
        "In this experiment, disfluency-related factors, such as total voiced disfluencies, had a high correlation with fluency (r = – 0.45).",
        "However, the syntactic complexity factor only showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.310).",
        "Yoon (2009) implemented an automated disfluency detection method and found that the disfluency-related features lead to the moderate improvement in the automated speech proficiency scoring.",
        "There were limitations on using the features reported in these SLA studies on standard language tests.",
        "For example, only a very limited number of subjects (from 20 to 30 speakers) were used in these studies.",
        "Second, the speaking content was narrations of picture books or cartoon videos rather than standard test questions.",
        "Therefore, we conducted a study using a much larger data set obtained from real speech tests to address these limitations."

        "To annotate structural events of speech content, we have developed a convention based on previous studies and our observations on the TOEFL Practice Online (TPO) test data.",
        "Defining clauses is a relatively simple task; however, defining clause boundaries and specifying which elements fall within a particular clause is a much more challenging task for spoken discourse, due to the presence of grammatical errors, fragments, repetitions, self corrections, and conversation fillers.",
        "Foster et al.",
        "(Foster et al., 2000) review various units for analyzing spoken language, including syntactic, semantic and intonational units, and propose a new analysis of speech unit (AS-Unit) that they claim is appropriate for many different purposes.",
        "In this study, we focused on clauses given the characteristics of spontaneous speech.",
        "Also, we defined clause types based on grammar books such as (Azar, 2003).",
        "The following clause types were defined:",
        "• Simple sentence (SS) contains a subject and a verb, and expresses a complete thought.",
        "• Independent clause (I) is the main clause that can stand along syntactically as a complete sentence.",
        "It consists minimally a subject and a finite verb (a verb that shows tense, person, or singular/plural, e.g., he goes, I went, and I was).",
        "• Subordinate clause is a clause in a complex sentence that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and that functions within the sentence as a noun, a verb complement, an adjective or an adverb.",
        "There are three types of subordinate clauses: noun clause (NC), relative clause that functions as an adjective (ADJ), adverbial clause that functions as an adverb (ADV).",
        "• Coordinate clause (CC) is a clause in a compound sentence that is grammatically equivalent to the main clause and that performs the same grammatical function.",
        "• Adverbial phrase (ADVP) is a separate clause from the main clause that contains a non-finite verb (a verb that does not show tense, person, or singular/plural).",
        "The clause boundaries and clause types were annotated on the word transcriptions.",
        "Round brackets were used to indicate the beginning and end of a clause.",
        "Then, the abbreviations described above for clause types were added.",
        "Also, if a specific boundary serves as the boundaries for both the local and global clause, the abbreviation of the local clause was followed by that of the global.",
        "Some examples of clause boundaries and types are reported in Table 1.",
        "In our annotation manual, a speech disfluency contains three parts:",
        "• Reparandum: the speech portion that will be repeated, corrected, or even abandoned.",
        "The end of the reparandum is called the interruption point (IP), which indicates the stop of a normal fluent speech stream.",
        "• Editing phrase: optional inserted words, e.g., um.",
        "• Correction: the speech portion that repeats, corrects, or even starts new content.",
        "In our annotation manual, the reparandum was enclosed by \"*\", the editing phrase was enclosed by \"%\", and the correction was enclosed by \"$\".",
        "For example, in the following utterance, \"He is a * very mad * % er % $ very bad $ cop\", \"very mad\" was corrected by \"very bad\" and an editing phrase, er, was inserted."

        "In the TPO test, some tasks required test-takers to provide information or opinions on familiar topics based on their personal experience or background knowledge.",

        "After reading through it, the annotators, as well as the second and third author completed four iterative loops of rating 4 or 5 responses per meeting.",
        "All four discussed differences in annotations and the convention was refined as needed.",
        "After the final iteration of comparisons, the raters seemed to have very few disagreement and thus began annotating sets of responses.",
        "Each set consisted of roughly 50-75 responses and then a kappa set of 30-50 responses which both annotators completed.",
        "Accordingly, between the two annotators, a set comprised roughly 130 to 200 responses.",
        "Each response takes roughly 3-8 minutes to annotate.",
        "The annotators were instructed to listen to the corresponding audio file if they needed the prosodic information to annotate a particular speech disfluency event.",
        "To evaluate the quality of structural event annotation, we measured the inter-rater agreement on clause boundary (CB) annotation and interruption point (IP) of disfluencies.",
        "We used Cohen's k to calculate the annotator agreement on each kappa set.",
        "k is calculated on the absence or presence of a boundary marker (either a clause boundary (CB) or an interruption point (IP) between consecutive words).",
        "For each consecutive pair of words, we check for the existence of one or more boundaries, and collapse the set into one term \"boundary\" and then compute the agreement on this reduced annotation.",
        "In Table 2, we list the annotator agreement for both boundary events over 4 kappa sets.",
        "The second column refers to the number of speech responses in the kappa set, the next two columns refer to the annotator agreement using the Cohen's k value on CB and IP annotation results.",
        "In general, a k of 0.8-1.0 represents excellent agreement, 0.6-0.8 represents good agreement, and so forth.",
        "Over each kappa set, k for CB annotations ranges between 0.8 and 0.9, which is an excellent agreement; k for IP annotation ranges between 0.",

        "8, which is a good agreement.",
