        "The system described in this paper scores English sentences composed by Korean students learning English.",
        "A detailed explanation of the system is given in (Kim et al., 2007).",
        "The scores are calculated from three different phases including word, syntax and mapping, each of which is designed to assign 0~2 points.",
        "Three scores are added up to generate the final score.",
        "A spelling error, a plural form error, and a confusable word error are considered as typical word errors.",
        "A subject verb agreement error, a word order error and relative clause error are typical examples of syntactic errors.",
        "Even when a student sentence is perfectly correct in lexical and syntactic level, it may fail to convey what is meant by the question.",
        "Such sentences are evaluated as grammatical, but cannot be a correct answer for the question.",
        "In this case, the errors can only be recognized by comparing a student sentence with its correct answers.",
        "The differences between a student answer and one of the answers can be considered as mapping errors.",
        "These three phases are independent from one another since they use different processing method, and refer different information.",
        "Independency of three phases causes some problems.",

        "(Exl) is an example of error reports provided to a student.",
        "The following two lines in (Exl) show the error information detected from the student answer by the system.",
        "Errl in (Exl) reports a comparative form error of an adjective 'small', which covers the 4 ~ 7th words of the student sentence.",
        "Err2 indicates that the 4th word 'small' of the student sentence is different from that of the answer sentence.",
        "The difference was identified by comparing the student sentence and the answer sentence.",
        "Errl was detected at the syntactic phase whereas Err2 was at the mapping phase.",
        "These two errors points to the same word, but have been reported as different errors.",

        "_Student answer: She is too weak to carry the her bag._ Errl: EXTRA_DET_ERR|7-91 I syntactic Err2: UNNECESSARY_NODE_ERR|8|(her) | mapping ~",
        "Similarly, Errl in (Ex2) reports an incorrect use of an article at the 7~9th words.",
        "The syntactic analysis recognizes that 'the' and 'her' cannot occur consecutively, but it is not capable of determine which one to eliminate.",
        "Err2, on the other hand, pinpoints 'her' as an incorrectly used word by comparing the student sentence and the answer sentence.",
        "(Exl) and (Ex2) have presented the errors which are detected at different processing phases, but represent the same error.",
        "Since these redundant errors are a hindering factor to calculate accurate scores, one of the errors has to be removed.",
        "The proposed system deals with 70 error types; 16 for word, 46 for syntax, and 14 for mapping.",
        "In this paper, we have adopted a human-computer collaboration approach by which linguistic experts assist the system to decide which one of the redundant errors should be removed."
