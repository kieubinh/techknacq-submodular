        "Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thomson, 1988) based discourse processing has attracted much attention with successful applications in sentence compression and summarization.",
        "Most of the current work on discourse processing focuses on sentence-level text organization (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) or the intermediate step (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005).",
        "Analyzing and utilizing discourse information at a higher level, e.g., at the paragraph level, still remains a challenge to the natural language community.",
        "In our work, we utilize the discourse information at a message level.",
        "There has been prior work on dialogue act analysis and associated surface cue words (Samuel 2000; Hirschberg and Litman 1993).",
        "There have also been Dialogue Acts modeling approaches for automatic tagging and recognition of conversational speech (Stolcke et al., 2000) and related work in corpus linguistics where machine learning techniques have been used to find conversational patterns in spoken transcripts of dialogue corpus (Shawar and Atwell, 2005).",
        "Although spoken dialogue is different from message-based conversation in online discussion boards, they are closely related to our thread analysis work, and we plan to investigate potential use of conversation patterns in spoken dialogue in threaded discussions.",
        "Carvalho and Cohen (2005) present a dependency-network based collective classification method to classify email speech acts.",
        "However, estimated speech act labeling between messages is not sufficient for assessing contributor roles or identifying help needed by the participants.",
        "We included other features like participant profiles.",
        "Also our corpus consists of less informal student discussions rather than messages among project participants, which tend to be more technically coherent.",
        "Requests and commitments of email exchange are analyzed in (Lampert et al., 2008).",
        "As in their analysis, we have a higher kappa value for questions than answers, and some sources of ambiguity in human annotations such as different forms of answers also appear in our data.",
        "However, student discussions tend to focus on problem solving rather than task request and commitment as in project management applications, and their data show different types of ambiguity due to different nature of participant interests.",
        "There also has been work on non-traditional, qualitative assessment of instructional discourse (Graesser et al., 2005; McLaren et al., 2007; Boyer et al., 2008).",
        "The assessment results can be used in finding features for student thinking skills or level of understanding.",
        "Although the existing work has not been fully used for discussion thread analysis, we are investigating opportunities for using such features to cover additional discourse analysis capabilities.",
        "Similar approaches for classifying speech acts were investigated (Kim and Ravi 2007).",
        "Our work captures more features that are relevant to analyzing noisy student discussion threads and support a full automatic analysis of student discussions instead of manual generation of thread analysis rules."

        "We have presented an approach for automatically classifying student discussions to identify discussions that have unanswered questions and need instructor attention.",
        "We applied a multiphase learning approach, where the first phase classifies individual messages with SAs and the second phase classifies discussion threads with SA-based features.",
        "We also created thread classifiers directly from features in discussion messages.",
        "The preliminary results indicate that SA-based features may help difficult classification tasks.",
        "We plan to perform more analysis on different types of thread classification tasks.",
        "We found that automatic classification of undergraduate student discussions is very challenging due to incoherence and noise in the data.",
        "Especially messages that contain long sentences, informal statements with uncommon words, answers in form of question, are difficult to classify.",
        "In order to use other SA categories such as Neg-Ack and analyze various types of student interactions, we plan to use more annotated discussion data.",

        "For example, classification of discussion topics can be used in identifying topics that participants have more confusion about.",
        "Furthermore, such information can also be used in profiling participants such as identifying mentors or help seekers on a particular topic as in (Kim and Shaw 2009).",
        "We are investigating several extensions in order to generate more useful instructional tools."
