        "With a new collection such as MedEval, the Swedish department could take control over the architecture and make decisions such as using a four graded scale of relevance, making it possible to employ a variety of evaluation tools.",
        "However, the most important decision was to assess documents, not only for relevance to topics, but also for intended groups of readers, 'Doctors: medical professionals' or 'Patients: lay persons', and to allow the user to choose user scenario: None, Doctors or Patients."
