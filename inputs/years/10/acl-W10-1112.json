        "Currently, most EHR systems implemented are proprietary and highly customized when used by larger care institutions.",
        "It is usually the case that only clinicians and other healthcare professionals with direct responsibility for providing care have access to patient data.",

        "According to their definition, secondary use includes activities such as analysis, research, quality and safety measurement, public health, payment, provider certification and accreditation, marketing, and general business applications, while at the same time taking into account the ethical, political, technical and social implications of such re-use.",
        "De Lusignan and van Weel highlight the challenges of making use of clinical data for research, stating, \"The available research methods for working with large data sets are limited; it is difficult to infer meaning from data; there is a rapid pace of change in both medicine and technology; and integrating data without reliable unique identifiers is difficult.\"",
        "(de Lusignan and van Weel, 2006).",
        "Prokosch and Ganslandt have recently summarized the latest advances in enabling clinical data reuse for research purposes (Prokosch and Ganslandt, 2009).",
        "They identify as key challenges the establishment of comprehensive clinical data repositories, the establishment of professional IT infrastructure to support clinical data capture, and the integration of medical record systems and clinical trial databases.",
        "As discussed in these articles, aggregated, abstracted and manipulable information is underutilized and hard to come by.",
        "The emerging field of Visual Analytics (Keim, 2008) is relevant to this review.",
        "This field is focusing on combining related research areas such as visualization, data mining and statistics to handle large and heterogeneous volumes of data, such as EHR.",
        "The systems we encountered are integrating human judgment with automated analysis, suggesting that future work will be related to handling massive amounts of data that contains missing elements - including the results of textual analysis of records content.",
        "Our motivation for creating this overview is to compare and discuss some of the available information visualization/visual analytics tools and how are these used for secondary, i.e. for purposes other than direct patient care.",
        "This is a first step towards infrastructure and coordinating efforts to produce systems that are based on standard input formats, and meet the needs of specifically defined users.",

        "LifeLines uses a timeline visualization technique to represent personal histories, medical records and other types on biographical data (Plaisant et al., 1996).",

        "LifeLines2 (Wang et al., 2008) is an extension of LifeLines, allowing the user to analyze records from multiple patients at a time.",
        "The system facilitates comparative visualization of records by means of aligning, filtering and sorting operations.",
        "By aligning patient records on some common reference event (e.g., the first heart attack), users can easily spot co-occurring and neighboring events.",
        "Ranking and filtering operations complement alignment by interactively reordering or narrowing the set of records to suit a user's changing focus.",
