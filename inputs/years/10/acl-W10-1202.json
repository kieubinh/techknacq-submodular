        "In this paper, we propose a multiword-enhanced author topic model that clusters authors with similar interests and expertise, and apply it to an information retrieval system that returns a ranked list of authors related to a keyword.",
        "For example, we can retrieve Eugene Charniak via search for statistical parsing.",
        "The existing works on author topic modeling assume a \"bag-of-words\" representation.",
        "However, many semantic atomic concepts are represented by multiwords in text documents.",
        "This paper presents a pre-computation step as a way to discover these multiwords in the corpus automatically and tags them in the term-document matrix.",
        "The key advantage of this method is that it retains the simplicity and the computational efficiency of the unigram model.",
        "In addition to a qualitative evaluation, we evaluate the results by using the topic models as a component in a search engine.",

        "This paper addresses the problem of searching people with similar interests and expertise without inputting personal names as queries.",
        "Many existing people search engines need people's names to do a \"keyword\" style search, using a person's name as a query.",
        "However, in many situations, such information is impossible to know beforehand.",
        "Imagine a scenario where the statistics department of a university invited a worldwide known expert in Bayesian statistics and machine learning to give a keynote speech; how can the department head notify all the people on campus who are interested without spamming those who are not?",
        "Our paper proposes a solution to the aforementioned scenario by providing a search engine which goes beyond \"keyword\" search and can retrieve such information semantically.",
        "The department head would only need to input the domain keyword of the keynote speaker, i.e. Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and all professors and students who are interested in this topic will be retrieved.",
        "Specifically, we propose a Multiword-enhanced Author-Topic Model (MATM), a probabilistic generative model which assumes two steps of generation process when producing a document.",
        "Statistical topical modeling (Blei and Lafferty, 2009a) has attracted much attention recently due to its broad applications in machine learning, text mining and information retrieval.",
        "In these models, semantic topics are represented by multinomial distribution over words.",
        "Typically, the content of each topic is visualized by simply listing the words in order of decreasing probability and the \"meaning\" of each topic is reflected by the top 10 to 20 words in that list.",
        "The Author-Topic Model (ATM) (Steyvers et al., 2004; Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004) extends the basic topical models to include author information in which topics and authors are modeled jointly.",
        "Each author is a multinomial distribution over topics and each topic is a multinomial distribution over words.",
        "Our contribution to this paper is two-fold.",
        "First of all, our model, MATM, extends the original ATM by adding semantically coherent multiwords into the term-document matrix to relax the model's \"bag-ofwords\" assumption.",
        "Each multiword is discovered via statistical measurement and filtered by its part of speech pattern via an off-line way.",
        "One key advantage of tagging these semantic atomic units off-line, is the retention of the flexibility and computational efficiency in using the simpler word exchangeable model, while providing better interpretation of the topics author distribution.",
        "Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal to apply the enhanced author topic modeling in a semantic retrieval scenario, where searching people is associated with a set of hidden semantically meaningful topics instead of their names.",
        "While current search engines cannot support interactive and exploratory search effectively, search based on our model serves very well to answer a range of exploratory queries about the document collections by semantically linking the interests of the authors to the topics of the collection, and ultimately to the distribution of the words in the documents.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We present some related work on topic modeling, the original author-topic model and automatic phrase discovery methods in Sec. 2.",
        "Then our model is described in Sec. 3.",
        "Sec.",
        "4 presents our experiments and the evaluation of our method on expert search.",

        "Author topic modeling, originally proposed in (Steyvers et al., 2004; Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), is an extension of another popular topic model, Latent probabilistic generative model that can be used to estimate the properties of multinomial observations via unsupervised learning.",
        "LDA represents each document as a mixture of probabilistic topics and each topic as a multinomial distribution over words.",
        "The Author topic model adds an author layer over LDA and assumes that the topic proportion of a given document is generated by the chosen author.",
        "Both LDA and the author topic model assume bag-of-words representation.",
        "As shown by many previous works (Blei et al., 2003; Steyvers et al., 2004), even such unrealistic assumption can actually lead to a reasonable topic distribution with relatively simple and computationally efficient inference algorithm.",
        "However, this unigram representation also poses major handicap when interpreting and applying the hidden topic distributions.",
        "The proposed MATM is an effort to try to leverage this problem in author topic modeling.",
        "There have been some works on Ngram topic modeling over the original LDA model (Wallach, 2006; Wang and McCal-lum, 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Griffiths et al., 2007).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to embed multiword expressions into the author topic model.",
        "Many of these Ngram topic models (Wang and McCallum, 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Griffiths et al., 2007) improves the base model by adding a new indicator variable x to signify if a bigram should be generated.",
        "If x = 1, the word w is generated from a distribution that depends only on the previous word to form an Ngram.",
        "Otherwise, it is generated from a distribution only on the topic proportion (Griffiths et al., 2007) or both the previous words and the latent topic (Wang and McCallum, 2005; Wang et al., 2007).",
        "However, these complex models not only increase the parameter size to V times larger than the size of the original LDA model parameters (V is the size of the vocabulary of the document collection) , it also faces the problem of choosing which word to be the topic of the potential Ngram.",
        "In many text retrieval tasks, the humongous size of data may prevent us using such complicated computation on-line.",
        "However, our model retains the computational efficiency by adding a simple tagging process via pre-computation.",
        "Another effort in the current literature to interpret the meaning of the topics is to label the topics via a post-processing way (Mei et al., 2007; Blei and Lafferty, 2009b; Magatti et al., 2009).",
        "For example, Probabilistic topic labeling (Mei et al., 2007) first extracts a set of candidate label phrases from a reference collection and represents each candidate labeling phrase with a multinomial distribution of words.",
        "Then KL divergence is used to rank the most probable labels for a given topic.",
        "This method needs not only extra reference text collection, but also facing the problem of finding discriminative and high coverage candidate labels.",
        "Blei and Lafferty (Blei and Lafferty, 2009b) proposed a method to annotate each word of the corpus by its posterior word topic distribution and then cast a statistical co-occurrence analysis to extract the most significant Ngrams for each topic and visualize the topic with these Ngrams.",
        "However, they only applied their method to basic LDA model.",
        "In this paper, we applied our multiword extension to the author topic modeling and no extra reference corpora are needed.",
        "The MATM, with an extra pre-computing step to add meaningful multiwords into the term-document matrix, enables us to retain the flexibility and computational efficiency to use the simpler word exchangeable model, while providing better interpretation of the topics and author distribution."

        "This very simple heuristic has been shown to improve the counting based methods significantly (Justenson and",

        "The x test is chosen since it does not assume any normally distributed probabilities and the essence of this test is to compare the observed frequencies with the frequencies expected for independence.",

        "In our experiments, we considered only ACL papers from the last 7 years.",
        "If we extend our data to cover papers from additional conferences, we will be able to strengthen author-topic associations for authors who submit papers on the same topics to different conferences.",

        "Another further development of this paper is the addition of citation information to the model as a layer of supervision for the retrieval system.",
        "For instance, an author who is cited frequently could have a higher weight in our system than one who isn't, and could occur more prominently in query results.",
        "Finally, we can provide a better evaluation of our system through a measure of recall and a simple baseline system founded on keyword search of paper titles.",
