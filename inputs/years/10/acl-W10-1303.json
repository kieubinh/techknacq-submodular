        "There are more than 3.5 million Americans with disabilities who cannot effectively use speech to communicate (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2005).",
        "There are many conditions that can result in such severe speech impairments including cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain-stem stroke, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI).",
        "Any one of these conditions can have a negative effect on the quality of life of these people.",
        "The field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) has, especially over the last ten years, dramatically enhanced access to communication for these individuals through the use of high-tech systems.",
        "These electronic systems allow the entering of text that is then converted to natural-sounding synthetic speech.",
        "While the population using AAC systems is quite diverse with regard to their linguistic and cognitive skills, here we focus on AAC systems for cognitively high-functioning literate adults with motor impairments.",
        "Even with a focus on this population, the communication rates of people who use AAC systems differ greatly based on their motor abilities and available interface choices (Trnka et al., 2009).",
        "Nevertheless, overall communication rates are slow to the extent that they are acknowledged as one of the most problematic areas of AAC interactions.",
        "Rates of 10-15 words per minute have been identified as upper limits for letter-by-letter selection on a keyboard (e.g., Wobbrock & Myers, 2006) – a significant contrast to 130-200 words per minute for spoken communication.",
        "These slow rates and long pauses continue to be a major barrier to the social, educational, and vocational success, particularly when communicating with unfamiliar partners who have little or no experience in conversing with someone who uses AAC.",
        "One method that holds a great deal of promise for enhancing communication rate is the use of systems that offer a selection of prestored messages.",
        "With these systems, a phrase or full sentence/utterance can be selected at once.",
        "In such systems, sometimes called utterance-based AAC systems, people compose whole utterances in advance and store them for later use.",
        "These systems appear to be best suited for situations where relatively predictable conversational routines take place.",
        "Examples include short, transactional exchanges in stores, restaurants, or other public places where services are provided.",
        "Although it might appear that utterance-based technology could solve the problem of slow communication, at least in these predictable exchanges, the individual who uses these prestored messages must deal with additional challenges to use the prestored messages that have been stored in their system.",
        "Users must be able to: 1) remember that they have messages prestored that are appropriate for a given situation; 2) remember where these messages are stored; and 3) access the desired prestored messages with few keystrokes.",
        "In addition, it must be recognized that the prestored messages are not always going to exactly fit the communicative situation in which the user finds him/herself (e.g., a prestored message may not have enough information for the needs of the part-ner).This results in a fourth challenge to the user – to decide if it is better to use the message as stored, or either edit or construct a new one.",
        "Each challenge, or trade-off choice, directly affects communication rate.",
        "An adequate solution to these challenges has proven elusive over the years, despite a long tradition of research in utterance-based technologies (e.g., Todman, 2000; Todman & Alm, 1997; Tod-man et al., 2008; Vanderheyden et al., 1996).",
        "What has been lacking is a design process that employs a theoretical framework (or perspective) dealing with conversation conventions, empirical evidence to identify priorities, and systematic testing to determine whether the design enables the communicator to achieve the goals of an interaction.",
        "A hierarchy of conversational rule violations based on a series of experimental studies has a great deal of potential to positively influence the design of future utterance-based technologies.",
        "In this paper we first describe a set of such studies and the resulting hierarchy.",
        "We then discuss the implications of this hierarchy on the design of an utterance-based AAC system, while integrating considerations from cognition and Natural Language Processing.",
        "Finally, we present our partially implemented prototype system and describe plans for evaluating this technology."

        "To shed light on the design of future utterance-based technologies, studied conversational tradeoff choices that a person faces when using an utterance-based system in goal-directed public situations with service providers who are unfamiliar with AAC, and how the particular choices made affect the attitudes and conversational behaviors of these providers (Bedrosian et al., 2003; Hoag et al., 2007; Hoag et al., 2004, 2008; McCoy, et al., 2007).",
        "We were interested in determining which message choices resulted in the most favorable attitudes and conversational responses leading to the success of the AAC customer's goal in these transactional exchanges.",
        "Notice that no matter how well a user anticipates text need, it is inevitable that some prestored messages are not going to exactly fit the pragmatic context in which the user finds him or herself.",
        "Four public situations (i.e., bookstore, movie theater, small convenience store, hair salon) where such mismatches could occur were studied in a series of investigations.",
        "Possible pragmatic mismatches were characterized in terms of rule violations according to Grice (1975) who articulated a set of classic conversational maxims that implicitly guide people in exchanging information.",
        "Using videotaped interactions across experiments, these violations were scripted in messages that involved trade-off choices between prestored message use and real time message construction.",
        "Specifically, the trade-offs examined in these investigations were between speed of message delivery and a message with either: 1) repetitive information with repetitive words or phrases; 2) excessive information, with more information than was needed by the listener but where the information was still topically relevant; 3) inadequate information, lacking some of the information needed by the listener, or 4) partly relevant information, where some of the content was not topically relevant.",
        "An example of such a trade-off involved the message choice of a quickly delivered (i.e., 4 seconds) prestored message with excessive information or one that was delivered slowly (i.e., 90 seconds) to allow editing of the excessive information.",
        "In essence, these experiments simulated situations where the user was faced with a choice: whether to quickly deliver a prestored message that was not exactly what was desired because of the pragmatic mismatch, or whether to take the time to edit the message so that it was exactly what was needed.",
        "The experiments looked at goal oriented situations with unfamiliar partners.",
        "This is an extremely important set of circumstances where the attitudes and actions of the communication partner can greatly affect whether or not the user can independently meet his or her goals.",
        "The experimental hypothesis was that there existed a hierarchy of conversational maxims involving the maxims of speed, relevance, repetition, and Informativeness, such that adherence to some of these maxims would result in more positive evaluations by public service providers than others.",
        "With regard to the results of the experiments, similar hierarchies of conversational rule violations were found across experiments, such that some violations, regardless of degree or particular public setting, were indeed consistently responded to more or less favorably than others.",
        "Consistently at the bottom of the hierarchy (i.e., responded to least favorably in all experimental situations, and with less success in meeting the target customer's goal) were quickly delivered messages with only partly relevant information.",
        "The finding places a high priority on selecting entirely relevant messages.",
        "As such, it suggests the development of a system architecture that makes it easy and fast to retrieve entirely relevant messages and difficult to retrieve messages that are only partly relevant to the current exchange.",
        "On the other hand, consistently at the top of the hierarchy were quickly delivered messages with repetitive information.",
        "These messages were responded to the most favorably and with much success in meeting the target customer's goal.",
        "The limited negative impact of the messages with repetition indicated that modification of system design to remedy this message flaw would yield less benefit for the user.",
        "The other trade-off choices, the fast inadequate message, the slow adequate message, and the fast excessive message, occupied the middle of the hierarchy across the experiments, although their positions with regard to each other were not exactly the same.",
        "Thus, the implications of these findings for system design are a little less clear, but suggest that users given options to edit or easily construct messages with respect to Informativeness.",
        "In sum, these findings have several important implications for future utterance-based technologies.",
        "A system design must provide a mechanisms to maximize the availability of situationally relevant prestored messages.",
        "Additionally, utterance-based technologies must be integrated seamlessly into an AAC system design that allows these prestored messages to be easily edited for their excessive or inadequate information.",
        "Finally, this design must also support the on-line construction of new messages, while still easily accessing prestored messages when appropriate."

      "heading": "3. Prototype Development",
      "text": [
        "The research findings cited above, particularly those regarding the critical role of relevance in conversation, led to the underlying structure of the prototype we are in the process of developing.",
        "Specifically, we are interested in a prototype that will support relevant conversation in familiar routine exchanges with relatively predictable content, such as those that occur in public settings, as it is these types of exchanges that provide the best situations in which to use prestored text.",
        "Schank and Abelson (1977) suggested that people develop mental scripts in such familiar situations (e.g., going to a restaurant), and that these scripts (representing typical sequences of events) are accessed by people in order to act appropriately in these situations, and understand/interpret what is being said.",
        "Each script consists of a series of scenes (subevents) that previous experience has led one to expect to occur.",
        "According to the cognitive theory, when faced with a new situation (e.g., going to a new restaurant), a person can pull up his/her mental script and step through the scenes in order to participate appropriately.",
        "We propose an underlying organizational structure for prestored utterances that leverages this mental script notion from cognitive science, as it nicely supports the Bedrosian, Hoag, McCoy, and Bedrosian findings about relevance.",
        "A slightly different notion of scripts has been used in previous research in utterance-based technologies (e.g., Dye et al., 1998; Alm et al., 2000).",
        "The notion referred to here is inspired by the early work of Vander-heyden (1995).",
        "In particular, in our prototype system the prestored utterances are organized (grouped and ordered) according to scenes within a script.",
        "For example, a \"going-to-a-restaurant\" script may have scenes associated with entering, ordering drinks, ordering entree, paying, etc.",
        "Associated with each of these scenes are the prestored utterances appropriate for use during that scene (e.g., utterances pertaining to entering might include, \"Hello.\"",
        "\"Fine, thank you.",
        "\", \"Nonsmoking.",
        "\").",
        "Not only would this organization ensure the relevance of utterances to the current situation, but it would also significantly aid the user in remembering where these messages are stored so that they can be accessed.",
        "Essentially the user could direct the system to step through messages appropriate for each scene of a given script as he/she is actually experiencing the scene.",
        "The utterance-based system would have a \"now point\" which corresponds to the scene in which the user is currently located in the script.",
        "Utterances useful for the conversation during that scene are easily available using very few keystrokes.",
        "Moreover, because the script mirrors the way a user thinks about a typical situation and how it flows from one scene to the next, the interface could lead the user to utterances appropriate for the next scenes to be encountered.",
        "Thus, users do not need to remember exactly which utterances are stored; they need only to activate the appropriate scene in the script to be shown relevant messages that can be selected, as well as other scenes that may follow.",
        "At the same time, this underlying structure can also provide time-saving benefits to the user with respect to entering text.",
        "This is in part because of its hierarchical organization [see Figure 1, influenced by Vanderheyden (1995)].",
        "At the top of any given hierarchy, are the most general scripts which can be used in a multitude of new situations (e.g., a new type of restaurant that the user has never gone to).",
        "As shown in the figure, the most general script here involves a \"going-to-a-restaurant\" script with scenes containing \"general purpose text\".",
        "For instance, in the ordering scene, slot fillers appropriate for many different kinds of restaurants are shown.",
        "Below this script, are scripts that pertain to more specific types of restaurants (only two are explicitly shown in the figure).",
        "In these scripts, notice some scenes and text are inherited verbatim from above, but text may also be added to or modified as appropriate for the situation and according to the preferences of the user.",
        "By inherited we mean that one or more scenes, with the corresponding messages, from the most general script would automatically be made available in the more specific instances.",
        "Unavailable in other prestored text systems, this feature is a significant benefit to users, because they only have to enter the information one time at the highest level of the hierarchy, and yet they will have access to it again in other scripts further down in the hierarchy.",
        "Another advantage of the inheritance is that it results in a consistent organization of messages across scripts.",
        "When accessing any script within the restaurant hierarchy, for example, not only can users expect to find the entering scene that was inherited from the \"parent\" script, they can also expect to find the prestored utterances \"Hello\" and \"Fine, thank you\" near the beginning of that scene.",
        "This illustrates a memory enhancement feature of this system that is not available in other prestored text systems - consistency in placement of messages from one particular script to another.",
        "Overall, this underlying organizational structure, which we will refer to as a deep structure, represents a significant change in the way that utterance-based systems in AAC have been designed.",
        "With respect to appearance, or surface structure, some current systems may have, for example, a restaurant \"page\" consisting of a grid of small rectangular boxes forming rows and columns across the computer screen.",
        "Although each box would contain a prestored message appropriate for use in a restaurant, there is no deep structure specifying how the messages on that page should be organized (grouped and ordered) nor how the messages might be related (the notion of consistency) to those stored on other pages.",
        "The only organizing principle is that these messages are \"things I can say in a restaurant.\"",
        "If the messages are not ordered (either by row or column) in a way that steps the user through a scripted sequence of events for a given situation, the user must search through a set of messages, some of which are unlikely to occur at that stage in the interaction.",
        "This search process, which is likely to include irrelevant messages, may slow down the selection process and negatively impact the rate of communication.",
        "Even if health providers or manufacturers programmed messages in these boxes to follow such a sequence, this would still remain a surface structure \"fix.\"",
        "The strength of our prototype is the deep structure – the machinery – such that the consistent location of the messages can be easily remembered and accessed in a few keystrokes to enhance communication rate.",
        "Additionally, the hierarchical advantage of the deep structure provides the user with a choice of scripts (depending on the specificity of the situation), and saves the user time and energy in entering text, making the user more independent in meeting individual communication needs.",

        "The user may then navigate to the script that best fits the actions in which he or she is about to engage.",

        "Asking for some assistance, talking with the waiter, small talk with the table mate, and quickfires are just some examples of the kinds of pages that might be accessible.",
        "Finally, at the bottom of the page are some navigation buttons for navigating in the device.",
        "Here we see buttons that allow the user to go to the device home page, move the script backward and forward, and go to a page containing a keyboard so a novel utterance can be composed.",
        "The system is set up in a way that allows users to select text that they might need while performing an action as they step through a scene.",
        "Thus, it is assumed that the user would select text in left-to-right order with the leftmost scene being the active scene (i.e., the scene the user is currently performing).",
