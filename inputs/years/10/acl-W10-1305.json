        "Many speech-related studies result in voluminous acoustic data.",
        "Many clinicians who design and use assistive technology would like to incorporate acoustic analysis, but have been discouraged because of these technical challenges.",

        "We are building a tool set to provide summary statistics for measures designed by clinicians to screen, diagnose or provide training to patients.",
        "This will be achieved by extending an existing shareware software platform with \"plug-ins\" that perform specific measures and report results to the user.",
        "At present, our goal is to use the existing shareware software tool Wavesurfer (Wavesurfer, 2005).",
        "The new modules will be set up to report data from a single audio file, or groups of audio files in a standard table format, for easy input to statistical or other analysis software.",
        "For example, the data may be imported into a program that correlates speech data with scalp electrode and medication data.",
        "Our tool will include alternative and independently tested algorithms for clinically relevant measures, as well as guidance as to what the speech data may mean.",
        "The common underlying basis for this tool set is a focused set of landmarks derived from Stevens' Lexical Access from Features (LAFF) paradigm (Stevens, 1992, 2002; Liu, 1995; Slifka et al., 2004).",
        "In this approach, landmarks are points in an utterance around which information about articulatory events can be extracted.",
        "In what follows, we will describe (1) the theoretical rationale of landmarks, (2) the general utility of landmark processing and several examples of clinically related measures, and (3) our current work on developing tools to make landmark analysis more widely available."

        "Landmark analysis is based on the fact that different sounds produce different patterns of abrupt changes in the acoustic signal simultaneously across wide frequency ranges.",
        "For instance, the abrupt increase in amplitude for a broad range of frequencies above 3 kHz can be used to indicate the onset of bursts.",
        "Likewise, an abrupt decrease in the same frequency bands can be used to indicate the end of frication.",
        "The use of onset and offset data in other frequency bands can be used to indicate sonorancy; i.e., intervals when the oral cavity is relatively unconstricted.",

        "b(urst): marks the onset (+b) of the burst of air following stop or affricate consonant release, or the onset of frication noise for fricative consonants.",
        "Offsets (-b) mark points where aspiration or frication noise ends abruptly due to a stop closure.",
        "V(owel): marks points of peak amplitude in a so-norant region – that is, a region where voicing is evident [Howitt, 2000].",

        "Measuring articulatory precision is important to evaluating efficacy of a treatment or in monitoring disease progression, e.g. in Parkinson's disease.",
        "Given that landmarks reflect articulation, tools based on landmarks may be useful for measuring and monitoring articulatory precision [Boyce et al.",
        "2005, 2007].",
        "The technique relies on setting empirically derived thresholds for the detection of abrupt acoustic changes in specified frequency bands.",
        "Recall that changes in the acoustic signal occur simultaneously across wide frequency ranges.",
        "When the onset of energy does not exceed threshold in a particular frequency band, i.e., not quite abrupt enough to trigger the detection of a landmark, then no landmark may be assigned.",
        "However, since different sounds produce different patterns, changes detected in other bands at that point in time are either a) assigned to a different landmark, or b) considered to be extraneous.",
        "Thus, small acoustic differences in the way speech is produced can be tracked as different patterns of landmarks.",
        "In addition to requirements that a tool for general clinical use must be fast and robust, it must be able to handle a wide variety of speaking styles, dialects, and voices.",
        "By focusing on landmarks that specify syllable structure and broad phoneme classes, distinctive differences between phonemes can be ignored.",
        "Therefore, the tool is less likely to break down due to problems recognizing specific vocabulary while remaining sensitive to changes in the acoustic signal that reflect articulatory precision of speech.",
        "Development of speech in early infancy includes the ability to produce increasingly complex phonological structure.",
        "Patterns of syllable structure in speech output can be tracked using landmarks, again without reference to specific phonemes or words.",
        "In Fell et al.",
        "[2002], landmarks were grouped into standard syllable patterns and syllables were grouped into utterances.",
        "Statistics based on these patterns were then reported to the clinician for various uses in training, screening or diagnosis.",
        "Patterns of syllable complexity were used to compute a \"vocalization age.\"",

        "Listeners with hearing impairment derive significant benefit from being addressed with clearly articulated speech.",

        "This is a project where automatic landmark analysis might have greatly reduced the effort.",
        "Similarly, in a study on tongue-twisters, Matthew Goldrick (Northwestern University) collected 100 hours of data comprising 20,000 tokens in less than three weeks, but found that it required another 600 hours merely to segment and label the data for further analysis.",

        "Description",
        "In our own work, we have developed an automatic tool for detecting, counting and analyzing acoustic events in the speech signal that are commonly used by scientists to measure differences in speech articulation.",
        "We are now integrating our system with Wave-surfer for certain researchers (linguists, speech-language pathologists, certain engineering and cognitive-science researchers) with a primary interest in inspecting and interpreting the articulation-related features in the waveforms of a corpus: e.g., the placement of landmarks of each type, patterns of clustering, or identification of non-speech sounds to be excised.",
        "(See Figure 1).)",
        "For this version, we are implementing user controls (\"widgets\") to produce automated measures or types of analyses for speech research such as:",
        "• Voice-onset time, VOT.",
        "• Detection of non-harmonic (and harmonic) voicing.",
        "• Identification and suppression or removal of stray sounds, i.e., non-speech.",
        "• Grouping of landmarks into syllable-like clusters.",
        "(Note that Wavesurfer already provides a general pitch-tracking capability for harmonic voicing.)",
        "The Wavesurfer plug-in will also allow the user to output information about an audio file or a directory of audio files, e.g. all the recordings of a child.",
        "This information will be in a tab-delimited text file or a spreadsheet.",
        "This will allow the speech scientist Figure 1: Wavesurfer with landmarks/waveform pane filtered to show only +/-g landmarks, and transcription pane (top) with +/-g and +/-s landmarks",
        "This information will be in a tab-delimited text file or a spreadsheet.",
        "This will allow the speech scientist to analyze the output and, for example, to summarize and compare the typically developing children to those diagnosed with autism.",
        "We are currently recruiting potential users to test the system including graduate students and senior researchers in neurosciences and speech-related sciences.",
        "So that these users can test the system on a realistic problem, we will provide them with a corpus of annotated, de-identified recordings of children with and without a diagnosis of autism.",
        "This will provide context for specific training tasks that we ask of the users and enable them to formulate their own appropriate, if small, research questions that the system can help to answer.",
        "We will probe their experiences by logging the questions they have about the system, watching their actions as they attempt to answer the research questions, and asking their opinions of the experience afterward."

        "The information in this pane is also automatically saved to a text file that can be analyzed with other software.",
        "This request also led us to include a popup window to show the vowel-space in a recording.",
        "Vowel-space measures are conventionally labor-intensive, thus limited to a few instances of specific vowels, and require that the researcher first identify specific instances of these vowels.",
        "On the other hand, vocalic landmarks identify the instants where formant frequencies may be reliably estimated, so our tools can quickly and automatically evaluate the full vowel space of a passage.",
        "(See Figure 2.)",
        "Figure 2: Automatic Vowel-Space Evaluation.",
        "Computing the resonant frequencies (formants) at vowel landmarks allows plotting the vowel space, i.e., the scatter of the first two formants against each other.",

        "90 sec of reading).",
        "The system automatically identified all the consonantal and vocalic landmarks, evaluated the formants at ~ 140 stressed vowels, and computed the convex hull (\"rubber-band\") area, 0.88 kHz .",

        "Though toolkits that run in MATLAB might be available free, or for a modest price, the MATLAB platform itself is costly, especially for non-academic users.",

        "of a knowledgeable user community; and variable standards for testing, correctness, and performance.",
        "A critical hidden cost for any system is the learning curve.",
        "For those systems with little documentation and training, this can dwarf the overt costs.",
        "Our goal is to make learning easier by creating landmark-processing plug-ins that people can use within software that they already employ.",
        "Such a plan requires a careful balance between the flexibility of a general, extensible system and the simplicity of a small, fixed set of easily documented plug-in capabilities.",
        "Our project therefore includes both a small set of simple functions, such as VOT, and software design centered on the needs identified by users from the appropriate research communities.",
