        "Both Spoken Dialog Systems (SDS) and Assistive Technology (AT) tend to have a narrow focus, supporting only a subset of the population.",
        "SDS typically aim to support the \"average man\", ignoring wide variations in potential users' ability to hear and understand the system.",
        "AT aims to support people with a recognized disability, but doesn't support those whose impairment is not severe enough to warrant the available devices or services, or those who are unaware or have not acknowledged that they need assistance.",
        "However, SDS should be able to meet the needs of users whose abilities fall within, and between, the extremes of severly impaired and perfectly abled.",
        "When aiming to support users with widely differing abilities, the cause of a user's difficulty is less important than adapting the communication channel in a manner that aids understanding.",
        "For example, speech that is presented more loudly and slowly can help a hearing-impaired elderly person understand the system, and can also help a person with no hearing loss who is driving in a noisy car.",
        "Although one user's difficulty is due to impairment and the other due to an adverse environment, a similar adaptation may be appropriate to both.",
        "During human-human communication, speakers manage the communication channel; implicitly altering their manner of speech to increase the likelihood of being understood while concurrently economizing effort (Lindblom, 1990).",
        "In addition to these implicit actions, speakers also make statements referring to breakdowns in the communication channel, explicitly pointing out potential problems or corrections, (e.g. \"Could you please speak up?\")",
        "(Jurafsky et al., 1997).",
        "As for human-computer dialogue, SDS are prone to misrecognition of users' spoken utterances.",
        "Much research has focused on developing techniques for overcoming or avoiding system misunderstandings.",
        "Yet, as the quality of automatic speech recognition improves and SDS are deployed to diverse populations and in varied environments, systems will need to better attend to possible human misunderstandings.",
        "Future SDS will need to manage the communication channel, in addition to managing the task, to aid in avoiding these misunderstandings.",
        "Researchers have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to create dialogue policies that balance and optimize measures of task success (e.g., see (Scheffler and Young, 2002; Levin et al., 2000; Henderson et al., 2008; Walker, 2000)).",
        "Along these lines, RL is potentially well suited to creating policies for the subtask of managing the communication channel, as it can learn to adapt to the user while continuing the dialogue.",
        "In doing so, RL may choose actions that appear costly at the time, but lead to better overall dialogues.",
        "Our long term goal is to learn how to manage the communication channel along with the task, moving away from just \"what\" to say and also focusing on \"how\" to say it.",
        "For this proof-of-concept, our goals are twofold: 1) to formalize a communication channel model that encompasses diverse users, initially focusing just on explicit user actions and implicit system actions, and 2) to determine whether RL is an appropriate tool for learning an effective communication channel management strategy for diverse users.",
        "To explore the above issues, we use a simple communication channel model in which the system needs to determine and maintain an amplitude level that is pleasant and effective for users with differing amplitude preferences and needs.",
        "As our goal includes decreasing the amount of potentially annoying utterances (i.e., those in which the system's amplitude setting is in discord with the user's optimal amplitude), we introduce a user-centric cost metric, which we have termed annoyance cost.",
        "We then compare hand-crafted policies against policies trained using both annoyance and more traditional dialogue-length cost components."

        "When conversing, speakers implicitly adjust features of their speech (e.g., speaking rate, loudness) to maintain the communication channel.",
        "For example, speakers produce Lombard speech when in noisy conditions, produce clear speech to better accommodate a hard of hearing listener, and alter their speech to more closely resemble the interlocutor's (Junqua, 1993; Lindblom, 1990).",
        "These changes increase the intelligibility of the speech, thus helping to maintain the communication channel (Payton et al., 1994).",
        "Research has also shown that speakers adjust their speaking style when addressing a computer; exhibiting the same speech adaptations seen during human-human communication (Bell et al., 2003; Lunsford et al., 2006).",
        "In addition to altering their speech implicitly, speakers also explicitly point out communication channel problems (Jurafsky et al., 1997).",
        "Examples include; requesting a change in speaking rate or amplitude (\"Could you please speak up?",
        "\"), explaining sources of communication channel interference (\"Oh, that noise is the coffee grinder.",
        "\"), or asking their interlocutor to repeat an utterance (\"What was that?\").",
        "These explicit utterances identify some issue with the communication channel that must be remedied before continuing the dialogue.",
        "In response, interlocutors will rewind to a previous point in the dialogue and alter their speech to ensure they are understood.",
        "This approach, of adapting ones speech in response to a communication problem, occurs even when conversing with a computer (Stent et al., 2008).",
        "Both implicit speech alterations and explicit utterances regarding the communication channel often address issues of amplitude.",
        "This is to be expected, as speaking at an appropriate amplitude is critical to maintaining an effective communication channel, with suboptimal amplitude affecting listeners' understanding and performance (Baldwin and Struckman-Johnson, 2002).",
        "In addition, Baldwin (2001) found that audible, but lowered, amplitude can negatively affect both younger and older subjects' reaction time and ability to respond correctly while multitasking, and that elderly listeners are likely to need higher amplitudes than younger listeners to maintain similar performance.",
        "Just as low amplitude can be difficult to understand, high amplitude can be annoying, and, in the extreme, cause pain.",
        "Towards improving listener understanding in a potentially noisy environment, Martinson and Brock (2007) take advantage of the mobility and sensory capabilities of a robot.",
        "To determine the best course of action, the robot maintains a noise map of the environment, measuring the environmental noise prior to each TTS utterance.",
        "The robot then rotates toward the listener, changes location, alters its amplitude, or pauses until the noise abates.",
        "A similar technique, useful for remote listeners who may be in a noisy environment or using a noisy communication medium, could analyze the signal-to-noise ratio to ascertain the noise level in the listener's environment.",
        "Although these techniques may be useful for adjusting amplitude to compensate for noise in the listener's environment, they do not address speech alterations needed to accommodate users with different hearing abilities or preferences.",
        "Given the need to adapt to individual users, it seems reasonable that users themselves would simply adjust volume on their local device.",
        "However, there are issues with this approach.",
        "First, manual adjustment of the volume would prove problematic when the user's hands and eyes are busy, such as when driving a car.",
        "Second, during an ongoing dialogue speakers tend to minimize pauses, responding quickly when given the turn (Sacks et al., 1974).",
        "Stopping to alter the amplitude could result in longer than natural pauses, which systems often respond to with increasingly lengthy 'timeout' responses (Kotelly, 2003), or repeating the same prompt endlessly (Villing et al., 2008).",
        "Third, although we focus on amplitude adaptations in this paper, amplitude is only one aspect of the communication channel.",
        "A fully functional communication channel management solution would also incorporate adaptations of features such as speaking rate, pausing, pitch range, emphasis, etc.",
        "This extended set of features, because of their number and interaction between them, do not readily lend themselves to listener manipulation."

        "RL has been used to create dialogue strategies that specify what action to perform in each possible system state so that a minimum dialogue cost is achieved (Walker, 2000; Levin et al., 2000).",
        "To accomplish this, RL starts with a policy, namely what action to perform in each state.",
        "It then uses this policy, with some exploration, to estimate the cost of getting from each state with each possible action to the final state.",
        "As more simulations are run, RL refines its estimates and its current policy.",
        "RL will converge to an optimal solution as long as assumptions about costs and state transitions are met.",
        "RL is particularly well suited for learning dialogue strategies as it will balance opposing goals (e.g., minimizing excessive confirmations vs. ensuring accurate information).",
        "RL has been applied to a number of dialogue scenarios.",
        "For form-filling dialogues, in which the user provides parameters for a database query, researchers have used RL to decide what order to use when prompting for the parameters and to decrease resource costs such as database access (Levin et al., 2000; Scheffler and Young, 2002).",
        "System misunderstanding caused by speech recognition errors has also been modeled to determine whether, and how, the system should confirm information (Scheffler and Young, 2002).",
        "However, there is no known work on using RL to manage the communication channel so as to avoid user misunderstanding.",
        "User Simulation: To train a dialogue strategy using RL, some method must be chosen to emulate realistic user responses to system actions.",
        "Training with actual users is generally considered untenable since RL can require millions of runs.",
        "As such, researchers create simulated users that mimic the responses of real users.",
        "The approach employed to create these users varies between researchers; ranging from simulations that employ only real user data (Henderson et al., 2008), to those that model users with probabilistic simulations based on known realistic user behaviors (Levin et al., 2000).",
        "Ai et al.",
        "suggest that less realistic user simulations that allow RL to explore more of the dialogue state space may perform as well or better than simulations that statistically recreate realistic user behavior (Ai et al., 2007).",
        "For this proof-of-concept work, we employ a hand-crafted user simulation that allows full exploration of the state space.",
        "Costs: Although it is agreed that RL is a viable approach to creating optimal dialogue policies, there remains much debate as to what cost functions result in the most useful policies.",
        "Typically, these costs include a measure of efficiency (e.g., number of turns) and a measure of solution quality (e.g., the user successfully completed the transaction) (Scheffler and Young, 2002; Levin et al., 2000).",
        "For managing the communication channel, it is unclear how the cost function should be structured.",
        "In this work we compare two cost components, a more traditional dialogue-length cost versus a novel annoyance cost, to determine which best supports the creation ofuse-ful policies."

        "For now, we only include explicit user actions, in which users directly address issues with the communication channel, as noted by Jurafsky et al.",
        "(1997).",
        "In addition, the users modeled are both consistent and amenable; they provide feedback every time the system's utterances are too loud or too soft, and abandon the interaction only when the system persists in presenting utterances outside the user's tolerance (either ten utterances that are too loud or ten that are too soft).",
        "For this work, we wish to create policies that treat all users equitably.",
        "That is, we do not want to train polices that give preferential treatment to a subset of users simply because they are more common.",
        "To accomplish this, we use a flat rather than normal distribution of users within the simulation, with both the optimal amplitude and the tolerance range randomly generated for each user.",
        "To represent users with differing amplitude needs, simulated users are modeled to have an optimal amplitude between 2 and 8, and a tolerance range of 1, 3 or 5.",
        "For example, a user may have a optimal amplitude of 4, but be able to tolerate an amplitude between 2 and 6.",
        "When interacting with the computer, the user responds with: (a) the answer to the system's query if the amplitude is within their tolerance range; (b) too soft (TS) if below their range; or (c) too loud (TL) if the amplitude is above their tolerance range.",
        "As a simplifying assumption, TS and TL represent any user responses that address communication channel issues related to amplitude.",

        "For this reason, the system's amplitude can vary between 0 and 10, and is initially set to 5 prior to each dialogue.",
        "In addition to performing domain actions, the system specifies the amount the amplitude should change: -2, -1, +0, +1, +2.",
        "Each system communication to the user consists of both a domain action and the system's amplitude change.",
        "Thus, the system manages the communication channel using only implicit actions.",

        "Specifically, the policy increases the amplitude by 2 after a TS response, and drops it by 2 after a TL.",

        "The second policy, termed find-optimal, searches for the user's optimal amplitude, then maintains that amplitude for the remainder of the dialogue.",
        "For this policy, the system first increases the amplitude by 1 until the user responds with TL (potentially in response to the system's first utterance), then decreases the amplitude by 1 until the user either responds with TS or the optimal amplitude is clearly identified based on the previous feedback.",

        "During training, to allow the system to better model the cost of choosing the same action repeatedly, we use a longer cutoff of 1000 utterances rather than 10.",

        "The first, a dialogue-length cost (DC), assigns a cost of 1 for each user utterance.",

        "This difference is multiplied by 3 when the system's amplitude setting is below the user's optimal.",
        "This multiplier was chosen based on research that demonstrated increased response times and errors during cognitively challenging tasks when speech was presented below, rather than above, typical conversational levels (Baldwin and Struckman-Johnson, 2002).",

        "After certain epochs, we tested the policy on 5000 user tasks.",

        "Because of this, only the dialogue-length cost(DC) and annoyance cost(AC) components are reflected in the following analyses.",

        "Additionally, if the policy receives user feedback that is contrary to the last feedback (i.e., TS after TL, or TL after TS), the policy backtracks one amplitude setting.",
        "In addition, if the current amplitude is near the boundary (3 or 7), the policy will change the volume by 1 or +1 as changing it by 2 or +2 would cause it to move outside users' amplitude range of 2-8.",
        "In essence, the DC policies are quite straightforward; aggressively changing the amplitude if the user complains, and assuming the amplitude is correct if the user does not complain.",
        "By 55,000 epochs, AC policies converged to one of two optimal solutions, with an average annoyance cost of 7.49.",
        "As illustrated in Table 1, the behavior of the AC policies is substantially more complex than the DC policies.",

        "However, the AC policies average 10.32 utterances long, only 0.52 utterances longer.",

        "For example, in Table 1, following the AC policy results in an annoyance cost of 12.",
        "For the same user, following the DC policy results in an annoyance cost of 36; 9 for Queryi as it is three below the user's optimal amplitude, and 3 for each of the following nine utterances as they are all one below optimal.",
        "As shown in the rightmost columns of Figure 2, DC policies average annoyance cost was 13.35, a substantial 78% increase over the average cost of 7.49 for AC policies.",
        "Figure 2 also illustrates that the AC and DC policies perform quite differently for users with differing optimal amplitudes.",
        "For example, users of the DC policies whose optimal is at (5), or slightly below (4), the system's default setting (5) average lower annoyance costs than those using the AC policies.",
        "However, these lowered costs for users in the midrange is gained at the expense of users whose optimal amplitude is farther afield, especially those users requiring higher amplitude settings.",
        "This substantial difference between users with different optimal amplitudes is because, for DC policies, the interaction is often conducted at the very edge of the users' tolerance.",
        "In contrast, the AC policies risk more intolerable utterances, but use this information to decrease overall costs by better meeting users' amplitude needs.",
        "As such, users of the AC policies can expect the majority of the task to be conducted at, or only one setting above, their optimal amplitude.",
        "Figure 2: Comparison of the annoyance cost between AC and DC policies for users with differing optimal amplitudes.",
        "Each of the two hand-crafted policies were run with each user simulation (i.e., optimal amplitude from 2-8 and tolerance ranges of 1, 3, or 5).",
        "In addition, we varied the domain task size, requiring between 4 and 10 pieces of information.",
        "DC and AC policies were also trained for these domain task sizes.",
        "As shown in Figure 3, The no-complain policy's annoyance costs ranged from 7.81 for dialogues requiring four pieces of information to 14.67 for those requiring ten pieces.",
        "The cost increases linearly with the amount of information required, because the no-complain policy maintains the first amplitude setting found that does not result in a user response of TS or TL.",
        "This ensures the amplitude setting is tolerable to the user, but may not be the user's optimal amplitude.",
        "In contrast, the find-optimal policy's annoyance costs initially increase from 9.67 for four pieces of information to 12.24 for seven through ten pieces.",
        "The cost does not continue to increase when the amount of information required is greater than seven because, for dialogues long enough to allow the system to concretely identify the user's optimal amplitude, the cost is zero for all subsequent utterances.",
        "Figure 3 also includes the mean annoyance cost for the DC and AC policies.",
        "Although one might expect the DC trained policies to resemble the no-complain policy, the learned policy performs slightly better.",
        "This difference is because the DC policies learn the range of users' optimal amplitude settings (2-8), and do not move the amplitude below 2 or above 8.",
        "In contrast, the no-complain policies",
        "Pieces of Information Required",
        "Figure 3: Average user annoyance costs for hand-crafted, DC and AC policies across dialogues requiring differing amounts of information.",
        "behave consistently regardless of the current setting, and thus will incur costs for exploring settings outside the range of users' optimal amplitudes.",
        "Similarly, AC policies could be anticipated to closely resemble the find-optimal policy.",
        "However, the AC policies average cost is lower than the costs for either hand-crafted policy, regardless of the amount of information required.",
        "This difference is, in part, due to differences in behavior at the ends of the users' optimal amplitude range, like the DC policies.",
        "However, additional factors include the AC policies' more varied use of amplitude changes and their balancing of the remaining duration of the dialogue against the cost to perform additional exploration, as discussed in subsection 7.2."

        "The first objective of this work was to create a model of the communication channel that takes into account the abilities and preferences of diverse users.",
        "In this model, each user has an optimal amplitude, but will answer a system query delivered within a range around that amplitude, although they find non-preferred, especially too soft, amplitudes annoying.",
        "When outside the user's tolerance, the user provides explicit feedback regarding the communication channel breakdown.",
        "For the system, the model specifies a composite system action, pairing a domain action with a possible communication channel management action to change the amplitude.",
        "By modeling explicit user actions, and implicit system actions, this model captures some essential elements of how people manage the communication channel.",
        "The second objective was to determine whether RL is appropriate for learning communication channel management.",
        "As expected, the learned policies found and maintained a tolerable amplitude setting and eliminated user abandonment.",
        "We also compared the learned policies with handcrafted solutions, and found that the learned policies performed better.",
        "This is primarily due to RL's ability to automatically balance the opposing goals of finding the user's optimal amplitude and minimizing dialogue-length.",
        "An added benefit of RL is that it optimizes the system's behavior for the users on which it is trained.",
        "In this work, we purposely used a flat distribution of users, which caused RL to find a policy (especially when using annoyance costs) that does not penalize the outliers, which are usually those with special needs.",
        "In fact, we could modify the user distribution, or the simulated users' behavior, and RL would optimize the system's behavior automatically.",
        "In this work, we contrasted dialogue length (DC) against annoyance cost (AC) components.",
        "We found that the AC and DC policies share the objective of finding an amplitude setting within the user's tolerance range because both incur stepwise costs for intolerable utterances.",
        "But, AC policies further refine this objective by incurring costs for tolerable, but non-optimal, amplitudes as well.",
        "AC policies are using information that is not explicitly communicated to the system, but which nonetheless RL can use while learning a policy.",
        "As this was exploratory work, the user model does not yet fully reflect expected user behavior.",
        "For example, as the system's amplitude decreases, users may misunderstand the system's query or fail to respond at all.",
        "In future work we will use an enhanced user model that includes more natural user behavior.",
        "In addition, because we wanted the system to focus on learning a communication channel management strategy, the domain task was fixed.",
        "In future work, we will use RL to learn policies that both accomplish a more complex domain task, and model connections between domain tasks and communication channel management.",
        "Ultimately, we need to conduct user-testing to measure the efficacy of the communication channel management policies.",
        "We feel confident that learned policies trained using a communication channel model which reflects the range of users' abilities and preferences will prove effective for supporting all users."
