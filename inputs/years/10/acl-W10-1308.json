        "In natural languages, a word form may refer to different meanings.",
        "For instance, the word \"fly\" means \"travel through the air\" in context like \"fly to New York,\" while it refers to an insect in the phrase \"a fly on the trashcan.\"",
        "Speakers determine the appropriate sense of a polysemous word based on the context.",
        "However, people with language disorders and access/retrieval problems, may have great difficulty in understanding words individually or in a context.",
        "To overcome such language barriers, visual and auditory representations are introduced to help illustrate concepts (Ma et al., 2009a)(Ma et al., 2010).",
        "For example, a person with a language disability can tell the word \"fly\" refers to \"travel through the air\" when he sees a plane in the image (rather than an insect); likewise he can distinguish the meaning of \"fly\" given the plane engine sound vs. the insect buzzing sound.",
        "This approach has been employed in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), in the form of multimodal vocabularies in assistive devices (Steele et al.",
        "1989)(Lingraphica, 2010).",
        "However, current AAC vocabularies assign visual stimuli to words instead of specific meanings, and thus bring in ambiguity when a user with language disability tries to comprehend and communicate a concept.",
        "For example, for the word \"fly,\" Lingraphica only has an icon showing a plane and a flock of birds flying.",
        "Confusion arises when a sentence like \"I want to kill the fly (the insect)\" is explained using the airplane/bird icon.",
        "Similarly, it will lead to miscommunication if the sound of keys jingling is used to express \"a key is missing\" when the person intends to refer to a key on the keyboard.",
        "People with language impairment are relying on the AAC vocabularies for language access, and any ambiguity may result in communication failure.",
        "To address this problem, we propose building a semantic multimodal AAC vocabulary with visual and auditory representations expressing concepts rather than words (Figure 1), as the backbone of the language assistant system for people with aphasia (Ma et al.",
        "2009b).",
        "Our work is exploratory with the following innovations: 1) we target the insufficiency of current assistive vocabularies by resolving ambiguity; 2) we enrich concept inventory and connect concepts through language, environmental sounds, and images (little research has looked into conveying concepts through natural nonspeech sounds); and 3) our vocabulary has a dynamic scalable semantic network structure rather",

        "One intuitive way to build a disambiguated multimodal vocabulary is to manually assign meanings to each word in the existing vocabulary.",
        "However, the task is time consuming with poor scalability no new multimedia representations are generated for concepts that are missing in the vocabulary.",
        "ImageNet (Jia et al., 2009) was constructed by people verifying the assignment of web images to given synonym sets (synsets).",
        "ImageNet has over nine million images linked to about 15 thousands noun synsets in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "Despite the huge human effort, ImageNet, with the goal of creating a computer vision database, does not yet include all the most commonly used words across different parts of speech.",
        "It is not yet suitable for a language support application.",
        "We explore a new approach for generating a vocabulary with concept to sound/image associations, that is, conducting word sense disambiguation (WSD) techniques used in Natural Language Processing on sound/image label datasets.",
        "For example, the labels \"car, drive, fast\" for the sound \"car - passing.wav\" are assigned to synsets \"car: a motor vehicle,\" \"drive: operate or control a vehicle,\" and \"fast: quickly or rapidly\" via WSD.",
        "It means the sound \"car - passing.wav\" can be used to depict those concepts.",
        "This approach is viable because the words in the sound/image labels were shown to evoke one another based on the auditory/visual content, and their meanings can be identified by considering all the tags generated for a given sound or image as a context.",
        "With the availability of large sound/image label datasets, the vocabulary created from WSD can be easily expanded.",
        "A variety of WSD methods (e.g. knowledge-based methods (Lesk, 1986), unsupervised methods (Lin, 1997), semi-supervised methods (Hearst, 1991) (Yarowsky, 1995), and supervised methods (Novischi et al., 2007)) were developed and evaluated with corpus data and other text documents like webpages.",
        "Compared to the text data that WSD methods work with, labels for sounds and images have unique characteristics.",
        "The labels are a bag of words related to the visual/auditory content; there is no syntactic or part of speech information, nor are the words necessarily contextual neighbors.",
        "For example, contexts suggest landscape senses for the word pair \"bank\" and \"water\", whereas in an image, a person may drink water inside a bank building.",
        "Furthermore, few annotated image or sound label datasets are available, making it hard to apply supervised or semi-supervised",
        "WSD methods.",
        "To efficiently and effectively create a disambiguated multimodal vocabulary, we need to achieve two goals.",
        "First, optimize the accuracy of the WSD algorithm to minimize the work required for manual checking and correction afterwards.",
        "Second, construct a semantic network across different parts of speech, and thus explore linking semantic relatedness measures that can capture aspects different from existing ones.",
        "In this paper, we target the first goal by proposing an unsupervised sense disambiguation algorithm combining a variety of semantic relatedness measures.",
        "We chose an unsupervised method because of the lack of a large manually annotated gold standard.",
        "The measure-combined voting algorithm presented here draws advantages from different semantic relatedness measures and has them vote for the best-fitting sense to assign to a label.",
        "Evaluation shows that the voting algorithm significantly exceeds WSD with each individual measure.",
        "To approach the second goal, we proposed and tested a semantic relatedness measure called evocation (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006) in disambiguation of sound/image labels.",
        "Evocation measures human judgements of relatedness between a directed concepts pair.",
        "It provides cross parts of speech evocativeness information which supplements most of the knowledge-based semantic relatedness measures.",
        "Evaluation results showed that the performance of WSD with evocation is no worse than most of the relatedness measures that we applied, despite the relatively small size of the current evocation dataset.",

        "Our ultimate goal is to create an AAC vocabulary of associations between environmental sounds and images and groups of synonymous words that are relevant to the content.",
        "We are working with two datasets of human labels for multimedia data, SoundNet and the Peekaboom dataset.",
        "The SoundNet Dataset (Ma, Fellbaum, and Cook, 2009) consists of 327 environmental \"soundnails\" (5-second audio clips) each with semantic labels collected from participants via a large scale Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) study.",
        "The sound-nails cover a wide range of auditory scenes, from vehicle (e.g. car starting), mechanical tools (e.g. handsaw) and electrical devices (e.g. TV), to natural phenomena (e.g. rain), animals (e.g. a dog barking), and human sounds (e.g. a baby crying).",
        "In the AMT study, participants were asked to generate tags for each soundnail labeling its source, possible location, and actions involved in making the sound.",
        "Each soundnail was labeled by over 100 people.",
        "The tags were clustered into meaning units that",
        "SoundNet refers to as \"sense sets.\"",
        "A sense set includes a set of words with similar meanings.",
        "For instance, for the soundnail pre-labeled \"bag, zipO-pen\" which is the sound of opening the zipper of a bag, the following sense sets were generated:",
        "(b) \"bag\" {bag, duffle bag, nylon bag, suitcase, luggage, backpack, purse, pack, briefcase}; (c) \"house\" {house, home, building}, and (d) \"clothes\" {clothes, jacket, coat, pants, jeans, dress, garment}.",
        "The word in bold is was judged by SoundNet to be the best representative of the sense set, and other words, possibly belonging to different parts of speech are included in the curly brackets enclosing the sense sets.",
        "SoundNet uses sense sets rather than single words because 1) people may use different words to describe the same underlying concept, (e.g. \"baby\" and \"infant;\" \"rain\" as a noun and as a verb); 2) people cannot draw fine distinctions between objects and events that generate similar sounds, and thus may come up with different but related categories (e.g. \"plate,\" \"cup,\" and \"bowl\" for the dish clinking sound); and 3) people may perceive objects and events that are not explicitly presented in the sound very differently (e.g. \"bag\" vs. \"clothes\" for the sound made by a zipper).",
        "In this experiment, only sense sets (labels) that were generated by at least 25% of the labelers were used.",
        "In our disambiguation experiment, two kinds of contexts were explored.",
        "In the Context 1 scheme, each label is treated separately: all its members plus the representatives of the other sense sets are considered.",

        "Second, texts in the images are often included in the labels.",
        "For example, the word \"green\" is one of the labels for an image with a street sign \"Green St.\" Third, the Peekaboom labels are not stemmed, which adds another layer of ambiguity.",

        "The measure-combined voting algorithm targets the accuracy of WSD and achieves significantly better performance than each relatedness measure individually.",
        "Our second approach applies a new relatedness measure, evocation.",
        "Evocation achieves similar performance to most of the existing relatedness measures with sound labels.",
        "Results suggest that evocation provides different semantic information from current measures.",
        "Future work includes: 1) expanding the evocation dataset and investigating the potential improvement in its WSD accuracy; 2) incorporating the extended evocation dataset into the voting algorithm; 3) exploring additional information such as image and sound similarity to help with WSD."
