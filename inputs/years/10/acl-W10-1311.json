        "Dysarthria is a set of congenital and traumatic neuro-motor disorders that impair the physical production of speech and affects approximately 0.8% of individuals in North America (Hosom et al., 2003).",
        "Causes of dysarthria include cerebral palsy (CP), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",
        "These impairments reduce or remove normal control of the primary vocal articulators but do not affect the abstract production of meaningful, syntactically correct language.",
        "The neurological origins of dysarthria involve damage to the cranial nerves that control the speech articulators (Moore and Dalley, 2005).",
        "Spastic dysarthria, for instance, is partially caused by lesions in the facial and hypoglossal nerves, which control the jaw and tongue respectively (Duffy, 2005), resulting in slurred speech and a less differentiable vowel space (Kent and Rosen, 2004).",
        "Similarly, damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve can reduce control over vocal fold vibration (i.e., phonation), resulting in guttural or grating raspiness.",
        "Inadequate control of the soft palate caused by disruption of the vagus nerve may lead to a disproportionate amount of air released through the nose during speech (i.e., hypernasality).",
        "Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) is incompatible with dysarthric speech, often rendering such software inaccessible to those whose neuro-motor disabilities might make other forms of interaction (e.g., keyboards, touch screens) laborious.",
        "Traditional representations in ASR such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) trained for speaker independence that achieve 84.",
        "8% word-level accuracy for non-dysarthric speakers might achieve less than 4.5% accuracy given severely dysarthric speech on short sentences (Rudzicz, 2007).",
        "Our research group is currently developing new ASR models that incorporate empirical knowledge of dysarthric articulation for use in assistive applications (Rudzicz, 2009).",
        "Although these models have increased accuracy, the disparity is still high.",
        "Our aim is to understand why ASR fails for dysarthric speakers by understanding the acoustic and articulatory nature of their speech.",
        "In this paper, we cast the speech-motor interface within the mathematical framework of the noisy-channel model.",
        "This is motivated by the characterization of dysarthria as a distortion of parallel biological pathways that corrupt motor signals before execution (Kent and Rosen, 2004; Freund et al., 2005), as in the examples cited above.",
        "Within this information-theoretic framework, we aim to infer the nature of the motor signal distortions given appropriate measurements of the vocal tract.",
        "That is, we ask the following question: Is dysarthric speech a distortion of typical speech, or are they both distortions of some common underlying representation?"

        "In each case, we transform test utterances (recorded, or synthesized with TADA) according to functions learned in training (i.e., we use the remaining 10% of the data for each speaker type).",

        "When our control data (both acoustic and articulatory) are transformed to match the dysarthric data, the result is predictably more similar to the latter than if the conversion had not taken place.",
        "This corresponds to the noisy channel model of figure 3(a), whereby dysarthric speech is modelled as a distortion of non-dysarthric speech.",
        "However, when we model dysarthric and control speech as distortions of a common, abstract representation (i.e., task dynamics) as in figure 3(b), the resulting synthesized articulatory spaces are more similar to their respective observed data than the articulation predicted by the first noisy channel model.",
        "Dysarthric articulation predicted by transformations from task-dynamics space differ significantly from those predicted by transformations from control EMA data at the 95% confidence interval."

        "This paper demonstrates a few acoustic and articulatory features in speakers with cerebral palsy.",
        "First, these speakers are likely to mistakenly voice unvoiced plosives, and to delete fricatives regardless of their word position.",
        "We suggest that it might be prudent to modify the vocabularies of ASR systems to account for these expected mispronunciations.",

        "This may present an increase in insertion errors in ASR systems (Rosen and Yampolsky, 2000).",
        "Although not quantified in this paper, we detect that a lack of articulatory control can often lead to observable acoustic consequences.",
        "For example, our dysarthric data contain considerable involuntary types of velopharyngeal or glottal noise (often associated with respiration), audible swallowing, and stuttering.",
        "We intend to work towards methods of explicitly identifying regions of non-speech noise in our ASR systems for dysarthric speakers.",
        "We have considered the amount of statistical disorder (i.e., entropy) in both acoustic and articulatory data in dysarthric and non-dysarthric speakers.",
        "The use of articulatory knowledge reduces the degree of this disorder significantly for dysarthric speakers (18.3%, relatively), though far less than for non-dysarthric speakers (86.2%, relatively).",
        "In real-world applications we are not likely to have access to measurements of the vocal tract; however, many approaches exist that estimate the configuration of the vocal tract given only acoustic data (Richmond et al., 2003; Toda et al., 2008), often to an average error of less than 1 mm.",
        "The generalizability of such work to new speakers (particularly those with dysarthria) without training is an open research question.",
        "We have argued for noisy channel models of the neuro-motor interface assuming that the pathway of motor command to motor activity is a linear sequence of dynamics.",
        "The biological reality is much more complicated.",
        "In particular, the pathway of verbal motor commands includes several sources of sensory feedback (Seikel et al., 2005) that modulate control parameters during speech (Gracco, 1995).",
        "These senses include exteroceptive stimuli (auditory and tactile), and interoceptive stimuli (particularly proprioception and its kinesthetic sense) (Seikel et al., 2005), the disruption of which can lead to a number of production changes.",
        "For instance, Abbs et al.",
        "(1976) showed that when conduction in the mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve is blocked, the resulting speech has considerably more pronunciation errors, although is generally intelligible.",
        "Barlow (1989) argues that the redundancy of sensory messages provides the necessary input to the motor planning stage, which relates abstract goals to motor activity in the cerebellum.",
        "As we continue to develop our articulatory ASR models for dysarthric speakers, one potential avenue for future research involves the incorporation of feedback from the current state of the vocal tract to the motor planning phase.",
        "This would be similar, in premise, to the",
        "DIVA model (Guenther and Perkell, 2004).",
        "In the past, we have shown that ASR systems that adapt non-dysarthric acoustic models to dysarthric data offer improved word-accuracy rates, but with a clear upper bound approximately 75% below the general population (Rudzicz, 2007).",
        "Incorporating articulatory knowledge into such adaptation improved accuracy further, but with accuracy still approximately 60% below the general population (Rudzicz, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we have demonstrated that dysarthric articulation can be more accurately represented as a distortion of an underlying model of abstract speech goals than as a distortion of non-dysarthric articulation.",
        "These results will guide our continued development of speech systems augmented with articulatory knowledge, particularly the incorporation of task dynamics."
