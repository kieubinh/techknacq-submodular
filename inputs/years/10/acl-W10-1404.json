        "This work has been developed in the context of dependency parsing exemplified by the CoNLL Shared Task on Dependency Parsing in years 2006 and 2007 (Nivre et al., 2007b), where several systems competed analyzing data from a typologically varied range of 19 languages.",
        "The treebanks for all languages were standardized using a previously agreed CoNLL-X format (see Figure 1).",
        "An early version of the BDT (BDT I) was one of the evaluated treebanks, which will allow a comparison with our results.",
        "One of the conclusions of the CoNLL 2007 workshop (Nivre et al., 2007a) was that there is a class of languages, those that combine a relatively free word order with a high degree of inflection, that obtained the worst scores.",
        "This asks for the development of new methods and algorithms that will help to reach the parsing performance of the more studied languages, as English.",
        "In this work, we will take the opportunity of having a new fresh version of the BDT, (BDT II henceforth), which is the result of an extension (three times bigger than the original one), and its redesign (see section 3.2).",
        "Using MaltParser, a freely available and state of the art dependency parser for all the experiments (Nivre et al., 2007a), this paper will concentrate on the application of different techniques to the task of parsing this new treebank, with the objective of giving a snapshot that can show the expected gains of each technique, together with some of their combinations.",
        "Some of the techniques have already been evaluated with other languages/treebanks or BDT I, while others have been adapted or extended to deal with specific aspects of the Basque language or the Basque Treebank.",
        "We will test the following:",
        "• Impact of rich morphology.",
        "Although many systems performed feature engineering on the BDT at CoNLL 2007, providing a strong baseline, we will take a step further to improve parsing accuracy taking into account the effect of specific morphosyntactic features.",

        "Nilsson et al.",
        "(2007) showed that they can increase parsing accuracy across lan-guages/treebanks.",
        "We have performed similar experiments adapted to the specific properties of Basque and the BDT.",
        "• Several works have tested the effect of using a two-stage parser (Nivre and McDonald, 2008; Martins et al., 2008), where the second parser takes advantage of features obtained by the first one.",

        "Until recently, many works on treebank parsing have been mostly dedicated to languages with poor morphology, as exemplified by the Penn English Treebank.",

        "They also show that using morphemes as the unit of analysis (instead of words) gets better results, as a result of the agglutinative nature of Turkish, where each wordform contains several morphemes that can be individually relevant for parsing.",

        "This is in accord with our experiment of dividing words into morphemes and transforming the tree accordingly (see section 4.2).",
        "Since the early times of treebank-based parsing systems, a lot of effort has been devoted to aspects of preprocessing trees in order to improve the results (Collins, 1999).",
        "When applied to dependency parsing, several works (Nilsson et al., 2007; Ben-goetxea and Gojenola, 2009a) have concentrated on modifying the structure of the dependency tree, changing its original shape.",
        "For example, Nilsson et al.",
        "(2007) present the application of pseudopro-jective, verbal group and coordination transformations to several languages/treebanks using MaltParser, showing that they improve the results.",
        "Another interesting research direction has examined the application of a two-stage parser, where the second parser tries to improve upon the result of a first parser.",

        "The general process consists of the following steps:",

        "• Train the system on the modified treebank",
        "• Apply the parser to the test set",
        "• Apply the inverse transformations",
        "• Evaluate the result on the original treebank We will test three different tree transformations,",
        "which had already been applied to the Treebank",

        "This is a language independent transformation already tested in several languages (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).",
        "This transformation is totally language independent, and can be considered a standard transformation.",
        "Its performance on the first version of BDT had been already tested (Hall et al., 2007), giving significant improvements This is in accordance with BDT I having a 2.9% of non-projective arcs.",
        "• Coordination (TC).",
        "The transformation on coordinated sentences can be considered general (Nilsson et al., 2007) but it is also language dependent, as it depends on the specific configurations present in each language, mainly the set of coordination conjunctions and the types of elements that can be coordinated, together with their morphosyntactic properties (such as head initial or final).",
        "Coordination in BDT (both versions) is annotated in the so called Prague Style (PS, see Figure 2), where the conjunction is taken as the head, and the",
        "Maltparser allows a rich set of functions to be specified for each column.",
        "In our experiments we mainly used the Stack and Input functions, which allow the inspection of the contents of the top elements of the Stack (Stack[0], Stack[1], ...) or the currently unanalyzed input sequence (Input[0], Input [1], ...).",

        "Basque is a head final language, where many important syntactic features, like case or subordinating morphemes are located at the end of constituents.",
        "For that reason, Bengoetxea and Gojenola (2009a) proposed MS-sym, a symmetric variation of MS in which the coordinated elements will be dependents of the last conjunct (which will be the head, see Figure 2).",
        "• Transformation of subordinated sentences (TS).",
        "They are formed in Basque by attaching the corresponding morphemes to the auxiliary verbs.",
        "However, in BDT (I and II) the verbal elements are organized around the main verb (semantic head) while the syntactic head corresponds to the subordination morpheme, which appears usually attached to the auxiliary.",
        "Its main consequence is that the elements bearing the relevant information for parsing are situated far in the tree with respect to their head.",
        "In Figure 3, we see that the morpheme -la, indicating a subordinated completive sentence, appears down in the tree, and this could affect the correct attachment to the main verb (esan).",
        "Figure 4 shows the effect of transforming the original tree in Figure 3.",
        "The subordination morpheme (-la) is separated from the auxiliary verb (da), and is \"promoted\" as the syntactic head of the subordinated sentence.",
        "New arcs are created from the main verb (etorri) to the morpheme (which is now the head), and also a new dependency relation (SUB).",
        "Overall, the projectivization transformation (TP) is totally language-independent.",
        "TC (coordination) can be considered in the middle, as it depends on the general characteristics of the language.",
        "Finally, the transformation of subordinated sentences (TS) is specific to the treebank and intrinsecally linked to the agglutinative nature of Basque.",
        "Bengoetxea and Gojenola (2009a) also found that the order of transformations can be relevant.",

        "As could be expected from the reduction of non-projective arcs (from 2.9% to 1.3%), the gains of TP are proportionally lower than in BDT I.",
        "Also, we can observe that TS alone worsens the baseline, but it gives the best results when combined with the rest (rows 6 and 7).",
        "This can be explained because TS creates new non-projective arcs, so it is effective only if TP is applied later.",
        "The transformation on coordination (TC) alone does not get better results, but when combined with TP and TS gives the best results.",
        "Applying feature propagation and stacking (see rows 9-17), we can see that most of the individual techniques (rows 9-14) give improvements over the baseline.",
        "When combining what we defined as linguistic features (those morphosyntactic features propagated by the application of three linguistic principles), we can see that their combination seems accumulative (row 15).",
        "The parser features also give a significant improvement individually (rows 12-14), but, when combined either among themselves (row 16) or with the linguistic features (row 17), their effect does not seem to be additive.",
        "After getting significant improvements on the individual techniques and some of their combinations, we took a further step to integrate different techniques.",
        "An important aspect that must be taken into account is that the combination is not trivial all the times.",
        "For example, we have seen (section 5.1) that combinations of the three kinds of tree transformations must be defined having in mind the possible side-effects of any previous transformation.",
        "When combining different techniques, care must be taken to avoid any incompatibility.",
        "For that reason we only tested some possibilities.",
        "Rows 18-21 show some of the combined experiments.",
        "Combination of feature optimization with the pseudoprojective transformation yields an accumulative improvement (row 18).",
        "However, the combination of all the tree transformations with FO (row 19) does not accumulate.",
        "This can be due to the fact that feature optimization already cancelled the effect of the transformation on coordination and subordinated sentences, or otherwise it could also need a better exploration of their interleaved effect.",
        "Finally, row 21 shows that feature optimization, the pseudopro-jective transformation and feature propagation are also accumulative, giving the best results.",
        "The relations among the rest of the transformations deserve future examination, as the results do not allow us to extract a precise conclusion."

        "Although several of the combined approaches are accumulative with respect to the individual systems, some others do not give a improvement over the basic systems.",
