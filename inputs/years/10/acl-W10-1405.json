        "Agreement is defined by linguists as the systematic covariance of the grammatical properties of one linguistic element to reflect the semantic or formal properties of another (Corbett, 2001).",
        "Morphologically marked agreement features such as gender, number and person are used to realize grammatical relations between syntactic constituents, and such patterns are abundantly found in (less- or) non-configurational languages (Hale, 1983) where the order of words is known to be (relatively) free.",
        "Agreement features encompass information concerning the functional relations between constituents in the syntactic structure, but whether incorporating agreement features in a statistical parsing model leads to improved performance has so far remained an open question and saw contradictory results.",
        "*The first author is currently a researcher at the department of Linguistics and Philology at Uppsala University.",
        "Taking Semitic languages as an example, it was shown that an SVM-based shallow parser (Goldberg et al., 2006) does not benefit from including agreement features for NP chunking in Hebrew.",
        "Phrase-structure based parsers for Arabic systematically discard morphological features from their label-set and never parametrize agreement explicitly (Maamouri et al., 2008).",
        "Models based on deep grammars such as CCG (Hockenmaier and Steed-man, 2003) and HPSG (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008) could in principle use inflectional morphology, but they currently rely on functional information mainly.",
        "For formalisms that do incorporate morphology, generative models are may leak probability due to unification failures (Abney, 1997).",
        "Even results from dependency parsing remain inconclusive.",
        "It was shown for dependency parsing that case, definiteness and animacy features are useful to enhance parsing (e.g., (0vrelid and Nivre, 2007)), agreement patterns are often excluded.",
        "When agreement features were included as features in dependency parser for Hebrew in (Goldberg and Elhadad, 2009) for Hebrew they obtained tiny-to-no improvement.",
        "A question thus emerges whether there are any benefits in explicitly incorporating morphosyntactic agreement patterns into our models.",
        "This question is a manifestation of a greater issue, namely, whether it is beneficial to represent complex patterns of morphology in the statistical parsing model, or whether configurational information subsume the relevant patterns, as it is commonly assumed in constituency-based parsing.",
        "Here we claim that agreement features are useful for statistical parsing provided that they are represented and parametrized in a way that reflects their linguistic substance; to express functional information orthogonal to configuration.",
        "We do so by extending the Relational-Realizational (RR) model we presented in (Tsarfaty and Sima'an, 2008) to explicitly encode agreement features in its native representation (RR-AGR).",
        "In the RR model, a joint distribution over grammatical relations is firstly articulated in the projection phase.",
        "The grammatical relations may be spelled out by positioning them with respect to one another in the configuration phase, through the use of morphology in the realization phase, or both.",
        "This paper shows that, for Hebrew, this RR-AGR strategy significantly outperforms a constituency-based model that treats agreement features as internally structured non-terminal state-splits (SP-AGR).",
        "As we accumulate morphological features, the performance gap between the RR and SP models becomes larger.",
        "The best result we report for the RR-AGR model, Fi 84.13, is the best result reported for Hebrew to date for parsing gold PoS-tagged segments, with 5% error reduction from previous results.",
        "This result is also significantly higher than all parsing results reported so far for Arabic, a Semitic language with similar morphosyntactic phenomena.The RR approach is shown to be an adequate way to model complex morphosyntactic patterns for improving constituency-based parsing of a morphologically rich, free word order language.",
        "Because the RR model is also proper and generative, it may also embed as a language model to enhance more complex NLP tasks, e.g., statistical Machine Translation."

        "We show that morphologically marked agreement features can significantly improve parsing performance if they are represented and parametrized in a way that reflects their linguistic substance: relating form-and-function in a non-linear fashion.",
        "We have so far dealt with the adequacy of representation and we plan to test whether more sophisticated estimation (e.g., split-merge-smooth estimation as in (Petrov et al., 2006)) can obtain further improvements from the explicit representation ofagreement.",
        "At the same time, the state-of-the-art results we present render the RR model promising for further exploration with morphologically rich languages.",

        "Throughout, the RR-AGR model outperforms the SP-AGR models that use the same category set and the same morphological features as state splits.",
        "For RR-AGR and RR-AGR (gp) models, adding agreement features to case features improves performance.",
        "The accumulative contribution is significant.",
        "For SP-AGR and SP-AGR (gp) models, adding more features either remains at the same level of performance or becomes detrimental.",
        "Since the SP/RR-AGR and SP/RR-AGR (gp) models are of comparable size for each feature-set, it is unlikely that the differences in performance are due to the lack of training data.",
        "A more reasonable explanation if that the RR parameters represent functional generalizations orthogonal to configuration for which statistical evidence is more easily found in the data.",
        "The robust realization distributions which cut across ordering alternatives can steer the disambiguation in the right direction.",
        "The RR-AGR (gp) +gen+def+acc model yields the best result for parsing Hebrew to date (F1 84.13), improving upon our best model in (Tsarfaty et al., 2009) (F1 83.33, underlined) in a pos-tagged setting.",
        "For this setting, Arabic parsing results are F1 78.1.",
        "Given the similar morphosyntactic phenomena (agreement, MaSDaR, iDaFa) it would be interesting to see if the model enhances parsing for Arabic.",
        "For (gp,hd) models (a configuration which was shown to give the best results in (Tsarfaty et al., 2009)) there is a significant decrease in accuracy"
