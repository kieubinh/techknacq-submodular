        "There are several challenges in parsing Korean compared to languages like English.",
        "At the root of many of these challenges is the fact that it is highly inflected and morphologically productive.",

        "Fortunately, there are good techniques for doing so.",
        "The sentences in KTB have been segmented into basic morphological units.",
        "Second, Korean is a pro-drop language: subjects and objects are dropped wherever they are pragmatically inferable, which is often possible given its rich morphology.",
        "Zero pronouns are a remarkably frequent phenomenon in general (Han, 2006), occuring an average of 1.8 times per sentence in the KTB.",
        "The standard approach in parsing English is to ignore NULL elements entirely by removing them (and recursively removing unary parents of empty nodes in a bottom-up fashion).",
        "This is less of a problem in English because these empty nodes are mostly trace elements that denote constituent movement.",
        "In the KTB, these elements are removed altogether and a crucial cue to grammatical inference is often lost.",
        "Later we will show the profound effect this has on parsing accuracy.",

        "TSGs present some difficulties in learning and representation, but a simple extraction heuristic called a spinal grammar has been shown to be very useful (Chiang, 2000; Sangati and Zuidema, 2009; Post and Gildea, 2009).",
        "Spinal subtrees are extracted from a parse tree by using a set of head rules to maximally project each lexical item (a word or morpheme).",
        "Each node in the parse tree having a different head from its parent becomes the root of a new subtree, which induces a spinal TSG derivation in the parse tree (see Figure 1).",
        "A probabilistic grammar is derived by taking counts from these trees, smoothing them with counts of all depth-one rules from the same training set, and setting rule probabilities to relative frequency.",
        "This heuristic requires a set of head rules, which we present in Table 6.",
        "As an evaluation of our rules, we list in Table 7 the accuracy results for parsing with spinal grammars extracted using the head rules we developed as well as with two head rule heuristics (head-left and head-right).",
        "As a point of comparison, we provide the same results for English, using the standard Magerman/Collins head rules for English (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997).",
        "Function tags were retained for Korean but not for English.",
        "We observe a number of things from Table 7.",
        "First, the relative performance of the head-left and",
        "Table 6: Head rules for the Korean Treebank.",
        "NT is the nonterminal whose head is being determined, RC identifies the label of its rightmost child.",
        "The default is to take the rightmost child as the head.",
        "head-right spinal grammars between English and Korean capture the linguistic fact that English is predominantly head-first and Korean is predominantly head-final.",
        "In fact, head-finalness in Korean was so strong that our head rules consist of only a handful of exceptions to it.",
        "The default rule makes heads of postpositions (case and information clitics) such as dative case marker and topic marker.",
        "It is these words that often have dependencies with words in the rest of the sentence.",
        "The exceptions concern predicates that occur in the sentence-final position.",
        "As an example, predicates in Korean are composed of several morphemes, the final one of which indicates the mood of the sentence.",
        "However, this morpheme often does not require any inflection to reflect long-distance agreement with the rest of the sentence.",
        "Therefore, we choose the morpheme that would be considered the root of the phrase, which in Korean is the verbalization/adjectivization suffix, verb, adjective, auxiliary predicate, and copula (XSV, XSJ, VV, VJ, VX, CO).",
        "These items often include the information about valency ofthe predicate.",
        "Second, in both languages, finer-grained specification of head rules results in performance above that of the heuristics (and in particular, the head-left heuristic for English and head-right heuristic for Korean).",
        "The relative improvements in the two languages are in line with each other: significant, but not nearly as large as the difference between the head-left and head-right heuristics.",

        "Recent work in applying nonparametric machine learning techniques to TSG induction has shown that the resulting grammars improve upon standard English treebank grammars (O'Donnell et al., 2009; techniques use a Dirichlet Process prior over the subtree rewrites of each nonterminal (Ferguson, 1973); this defines a model of subtree generation that produces new subtrees in proportion to the number of times they have previously been generated.",
        "Inference under this model takes a treebank and uses Gibbs sampling to determine how to deconstruct a parse tree into a single TSG derivation.",
        "In this section, we apply these techniques to Korean.",
        "This TSG induction requires one to specify a base measure, which assigns probabilities to subtrees being generated for the first time in the model.",
        "One base measure employed in previous work scored a subtree by multiplying together the probabilities of the height-one rules inside the subtree with a geometric distribution on the number of such rules.",
        "Since Korean is considered to be a free word-order language, we modified this base measure to treat the children of a height-one rule as a multiset (instead of a sequence).",
        "This has the effect of producing equivalence classes among the sets of children of each nonterminal, concentrating the mass on these classes instead of spreading it across their different instantiations.",
        "To build the sampled grammars, we initialized the samplers from the best spinal grammar derivations and ran them for 100 iterations (once again, function tags were retained).",
        "We then took the state of the training data at every tenth iteration, smoothed together with the height-one rules from the standard Treebank.",
        "The best score on the development data for a sampled grammar was 68.93 (all sentences) and 73.29 (sentences with forty or fewer words): well above the standard Treebank scores from earlier sections and above the spinal heuristics, but well below the scores produced by the latent annotation learning procedures (a result that is consistent with English).",
        "This performance increase reflects the results for English demonstrated in the above works.",
        "We see a large performance increase above the baseline Treebank grammar, and a few points above the best spinal grammar.",
        "One nice feature of these induced TSGs is that the rules learned lend themselves to analysis, which we turn to next.",
        "In addition to the base measure mentioned above, we also experimented with the standard base measure proposed by Cohn et al.",
        "and Post & Gildea, that treats the children of a nonterminal as a sequence.",
        "The grammars produced sampling under a model with this base measure were not substantively different from those of the unordered base measure.",
        "A partial explanation for this is that although Korean does permit a significant amount of reordering relative to English, the sentences in the KTB come from written newswire text, where word order is more standardized.",
        "Korean sentences are characterized as having a subject-object-verb (SOV) word order.",
        "There is some flexibility; OSV, in particular, is common in spoken Korean.",
        "In formal writing, though, SOV word order is overwhelmingly preferred.",
        "We see this reflected in the KTB, where SOV sentences are 63.5 times more numerous that OSV among sentences that have explicitly marked both the subject and the object.",
        "However, word order is not completely fixed even in the formal writing.",
        "NP-ADV is most likely to occur right before the VP it modifies, but can be moved earlier.",
        "For example,",
        "S โ NP-SBJ NP-ADV VP is 2.4 times more frequent than the alternative with the order of the NPs reversed.",
        "Furthermore, the notion of free(er) word order does not apply to all constituents.",
        "An example is nonterminals directly above preterminals.",
        "A Korean verb may have up to seven affixes; however, they always agglutinate in a fixed order.",
        "The TSG inference procedure can be thought of as discovering structural collocations in parse trees.",
        "The model prefers subtrees that are common in the data set and that comprise highly probable height-one rules.",
        "The parsing accuracy of these grammars is well below state of the art, but the grammars are smaller, and the subtrees learned can help us analyze the parse structure of the Treebank.",
        "One particular class of subtree is one that includes multiple lexical items with intervening nonterminals, which represent long distance dependencies that commonly co-occur.",
        "In Korean, a certain class of nouns must accompany a particular class of measure word (a morpheme) when counting the noun.",
        "In the example shown in Figure 2, (NNC S \"%D (members of assembly) is followed by NNU, which expands to indicate ordinal, cardinal, and numeral nouns; NNU is in turn followed by (NNX ^ ), the politeness neutral measure word for counting people."
