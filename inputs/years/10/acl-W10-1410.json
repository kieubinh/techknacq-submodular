        "Large parse-annotated corpora have led to an explosion of interest in statistical parsing methods, including the development of highly successful models for parsing English using the Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank (Ptb, (Marcus et al., 1994)).",
        "Over the last 10 years, parsing performance on the Ptb has hit a performance plateau of 90-92% f-score using the Par sE va l evaluation metric.",
        "When adapted to other language/treebank pairs (such as German, Hebrew, Arabic, Italian or French), to date these models have performed much worse.",
        "A number of arguments have been advanced to explain this performance gap, including limited amounts of training data, differences in treebank annotation schemes, inadequacies of evaluation metrics, linguistic factors such as the degree of word order variation, the amount of morphological information available to the parser as well as the effects of syncretism prevalent in many morphologically rich languages.",
        "Even though none of these arguments in isolation can account for the systematic performance gap, a pattern is beginning to emerge: morphologically rich languages tend to be susceptible to parsing performance degradation.",
        "Except for a residual clitic case system, French does not have explicit case marking, yet its morphology is considerably richer than that of English, and French is therefore a candidate to serve as an instance of a morphologically rich language (MRL) that requires specific treatment to achieve reasonable parsing performance.",
        "Interestingly, French also exhibits a limited amount of word order variation occurring at different syntactic levels including (i) the word level (e.g. pre or post nominal adjective, pre or post verbal adverbs); (ii) phrase level (e.g. possible alternations between post verbal NPs and PPs).",
        "In order to avoid discontinuous constituents as well as traces and coindexations, treebanks for this language, such as the French Treebank (Ftb, (Abeillé et al., 2003)) or the Modified French Treebank (Mft, (Schluter and van Genabith, 2007)), propose a flat annotation scheme with a non-configurational distinction between adjunct and arguments.",
        "Finally, the extraction of treebank grammars from the French treebanks, which contain less than a third of the annotated data as compared to Ptb, is subject to many data sparseness issues that contribute to a performance ceiling, preventing the statistical parsing of French to reach the same level of performance as for Ptb-trained parsers (Candito et al., 2009).",
        "This data sparseness bottleneck can be summarized as a problem of optimizing a parsing model along two axes: the grammar and the lexicon.",
        "In both cases, the goal is either to get a more compact grammar at the rule level or to obtain a considerably less sparse lexicon.",
        "So far, both approaches have been tested for French using different means and with different degrees of success.",
        "To obtain better grammars, Schluter and van Genabith (2007) extracted a subset of an early release of the Ftb and carried out extensive restructuring, extensions and corrections (referred to as the Modified French Treebank MFT) to support grammar acquisition for PCFG-based LFG Parsing (Cahill et al., 2004) while Crabbé and Candito (2008) slightly modified the original Ftb POS tagset to optimize the grammar with latent annotations extracted by the Berkeley parser (Bky, (Petrov et al., 2006)).",
        "Moreover, research oriented towards adapting more complex parsing models to French showed that lexicalized models such as Collins' model 2 (Collins, 1999) can be tuned to cope effectively with the flatness of the annotation scheme in the Ftb, with the Charniak model (Charniak, 2000) performing particularly well, but outperformed by the Bky parser on French data (Seddah et al., 2009).",
        "Focusing on the lexicon, experiments have been carried out to study the impact of different forms of word clustering on the Bky parser trained on the Ftb.",
        "Candito et al.",
        "(2009) showed that using gold lemmatization provides a significant increase in performance.",
        "Obviously, less sparse lexical data which retains critical pieces of information can only help a model to perform better.",
        "This was shown in (Candito and Crabbé, 2009) where distributional word clusters were acquired from a 125 million words corpus and combined with inflectional suffixes extracted from the training data.",
        "Training the Bky parser with 1000 clusters boosts its performance to the current state-of-the-art with a ParsEval Fi score of 88.28% (baseline was 86.29 %).",
        "We performed the same experiment using the Charniak parser and recorded only a small improvement (from 84.96% to 85.51%).",
        "Given the fact that lexical information is crucial for lexicalized parsers in the form of bilexical dependencies, this result raises the question whether this kind of clustering is in fact too drastic for lexicalized parsers as it may give rise to head-to-head dependencies which are too coarse.",
        "To answer this question, in this paper we explore the impact of lemmatization, as a (rather limited) constrained form of clustering, on a state-of-the-art lexicalized parser (Charniak).",
        "In order to evaluate the influence of lemmatization on this parser (which is known to be highly tuned for English) we carry out experiments on both the Ftb and on a lemmatized version of the Ptb.",
        "We used gold lemmatization when available and an automatic statistical morphological analyzer (Chrupala, 2010) to provide more realistic parsing results.",
        "The idea is to verify whether lemmatization will help to reduce data sparseness issues due to the French rich morphology and to see if this process, when applied to English will harm the performance of a parser optimized for the limited morphology of English.",
        "Our results show that the key issue is the way unseen tokens (lemmas or words) are handled by the Charniak parser.",
        "Indeed, using pure lemma is equally suboptimal for both languages.",
        "On the other hand, feeding the parser with both lemma and part-of-speech slightly enhances parsing performance for French.",
        "We first describe our data sets in Section 2, introduce our data driven morphology process in Section 3, then present experiments in Section 4.",
        "We discuss our results in Section 5 and compare them with related research in Section 6 before concluding and outlining further research."

        "Size: The Ftb consists of 350,931 tokens and 12,351 sentences, that is less than a third ofthe size of Ptb.",
        "The average length of a sentence is 28.41 tokens.",
        "By contrast, the average sentence length in the Wall Street Journal section of the Ptb is 25.4 tokens.",
        "A Flat Annotation Scheme: Both the Ftb and the P tb are annotated with constituent trees.",
        "However, the annotation scheme is flatter in the Ftb.",
        "For instance, there are no VPs for finite verbs and only one sentential level for clauses or sentences whether or not they are introduced by a complementizer.",
        "Only the verbal nucleus (VN) is annotated and comprises the verb, its clitics, auxiliaries, adverbs and negation.",
        "Inflection: French morphology is richer than English and leads to increased data sparseness for statistical parsing.",
        "There are 24,098 lexical types in the Ftb, with an average of 16 tokens occurring for each type.",
        "Compounds: Compounds are explicitly annotated and very frequent in the treebank: 14.52% of tokens are part of a compound.",
        "Following Candito and Crabbé (2009), we use a variation of the treebank where compounds with regular syntactic patterns have been expanded.",
        "We refer to this instance as Ftb-uc.",
        "Lemmatization: Lemmas are included in the treebank's morphological annotations and denote an abstraction over a group of inflected forms.",
        "As there is no distinction between semantically ambiguous lexemes at the word form level, polysemic homographs with common inflections are associated with the same lemma (Abeillé et al., 2003).",
        "Thus, except for some very rare cases, a pair consisting of a word form and its part-of-speech unambiguously maps to the same lemma.",
        "Unlike the Ftb, the Ptb does not have gold lemmas provided within the treebank.",
        "We use the finite state morphological analyzer which comes within the English ParGram Grammar (Butt et al., 1999) for lemmatization.",
        "For open class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) the word form is sent to the morphological analyzer.",
        "The English ParGram morphological analyzer outputs all possible analyses of the word form.",
        "The associated gold POS from the Ptb is used to disambiguate the result.",
        "The same process is applied to closed class words where the word form is different from the lemma (e.g. 'll for will).",
        "For the remaining parts of speech the word form is assigned to the lemma.",
        "Since gold lemmas are not available for the Ptb, a large-scale automatic evaluation of the lemmatizer is not possible.",
        "Instead, we conducted two manual evaluations.",
        "First, we randomly extracted 5 samples of 200 <POS,word> pairs from Section 23 of the Ptb.",
        "Each data set is fed into the lemmatization script, and the output is manually checked.",
        "For the 5x200 <POS,word> sets the number of incorrect lemmas is 1, 3, 2, 0, and 2.",
        "The variance is small indicating that the results are fairly stable.",
        "For the second evaluation, we extracted each unseen word from Section 23 and manually checked the accuracy of the lemmatization.",
        "Of the total of 1802 unseen words, 394 words are associated with an incorrect lemma (331 unique) and only 8 with an incorrect <POS,lemma> pair (5 unique).",
        "For an overall unseen word percentage of 3.22%, the lemma accuracy is 77.70%.",
        "If we assume that all seen words are correctly lemmatized, overall accuracy would be 99.28%.",
        "In order to evaluate the influence of lemmatization on comparable corpora, we extracted a random subset of the Ptb with properties comparable to the Ftb-uc (mainly with respect to CFG size and number of tokens).",
        "We call this Ptb subset S.Ptb.",
        "Table 1 presents a summary of some relevant features of those treebanks.",
        "Table 1 : French and Penn Treebanks properties",
        "Table 1 shows that the average number of word forms associated with a lemma (i.e. the lemma ratio) is higher in the Ftb-uc (1.54 words/lemma) than in the Ptb (1.31).",

        "Comparing Morfette's tagging performance for English is a bit more challenging as we only trained on one third of the full Ptb and evaluated on approximately one section, whereas results reported in the literature are usually based on training on sections 02-18 and evaluating on either sections 19-21 or 22-24.",

        "The very small differences between those two configurations (most noticeable with the Leaf Ancestor score of 95.41 vs. 95.38) indicates that the reduced lemma lexicon is actually of some limited use but its impact is negligible compared to perfect tagging.",
        "While the lemma+POS setting clearly boosts performance for parsing the Ftb, the situation is less clear for English.",
        "Indeed, the lemma+POS and the word+POS gold variations give almost the same results.",
        "The fact that the POS tagging accuracy is close to 100% in this mode shows that the key parameter for optimum parsing performance in this experiment is the ability to guess POS for unknown words well.",
        "In fact, the Charniak parser uses a two letter suffix context for its tagging model, and when gold POS are suffixed to any type of token (being lemma or word form), the Ptb POS tagset is used as a substitute for lack of morphology.",
        "It should also be noted that the Ftb-uc tag set does include some discriminative features (such as PART, INF and so on) but those are expressed by more than two letters, and therefore a two letter suffix tag cannot really be useful to discriminate a richer morphology.",
        "For example, in the Ptb, the suffix BZ, as in VBZ, always refers to a verb, whereas the Ftb pos tag suffix PP, as in NPP (Proper Noun) is also found in POS labels such as VPP (past participle verb).",
        "Having shown that parsing French benefits from a reduced lexicon is not enough as results imply that a key factor is POS tag guessing.",
        "We therefore test our hypothesis in a more realistic set up.",
        "We use Morfette to lemmatize and tag raw words (instead of the \"gold\" lemma-based approach described above), and the resulting corpus is then parsed using the corresponding training set.",

        "When we started this work, we wanted to explore the benefit of lemmatization as a means to reduce data sparseness issues underlying statistical lexical-ized parsing of small treebanks for morphologically rich languages, such as the Ftb.",
        "We showed that the expected benefit of lemmatization, a less sparse lexicon, was in fact hidden by the absence of inflectional information, as required by e.g. the Charniak parser to provide good POS guesses for unseen words.",
        "Even the inclusion of POS tags generated by a state-of-the-art tagger (Morfette) did not lead to much improvement compared to a parser run in a regular bare word set up.",
        "An unexpected effect is that the POS accuracy of the parser trained on the French data does not reach the same level of performance as our tagger (96.47% for <word, auto POS> vs. 97.34% for",
        "Morfette).",
        "Of course, extending the Charniak tagging model to cope with lemmatized input should be enough, because its POS guessing model builds on features such as capitalization, hyphenation and a two-letter suffix (Charniak, 2000).",
        "Those features are not present in our current lemmatized input and thus cannot be properly estimated.",
        "Charniak also uses the probability that a given POS is realized by a previously unobserved word.",
        "If any part of a <lemma,POS> pair is incorrect, the number of unseen words in the test set would be higher than the one estimated from the training set, which only contained correct lemmas and POS tags in our setting.",
        "This would lead to unsatisfying POS accuracy.",
        "This inadequate behavior of the unknown word tagging model may be responsible for the POS accuracy result for <auto lemma> (cf. Table 7, lines <auto lemma only> for both treebanks).",
        "We believe that this performance degradation (or in this case the somewhat less than expected improvement in parsing results) calls for the inclusion of all available lexical information in the parsing model.",

        "A fair amount of recent research in parsing morphologically rich languages has focused on coping with unknowns words and more generally with the small and limited lexicons acquired from treebanks.",

        "This method leads to a significant increase of parsing performance over previously reported results for Modern Hebrew.",

        "For parsing German, Versley and Rehbein (2009) cluster words according to linear context features.",
        "The clusters are then integrated as features to boost a discriminative parsing model to cope with unknown words.",
        "Interestingly, they also include all possible information: valence information, extracted from a lexicon, is added to verbs and preterminal nodes are annotated with case/number.",
        "This leads their discriminative model to state-of-the-art results for parsing German.",
        "Concerning French, Candito and Crabbé (2009) present the results of different clustering methods applied to the parsing of Ftb with the Bky parser.",
        "They applied an unsupervised clustering algorithm on the 125 millions words \"Est Republicain\" corpus to get a reduced lexicon of 1000 clusters which they then augmented with various features such as capitalization and suffixes.",
        "Their method is the best current approach for the probabilistic parsing of French with a F1 score (<=40) of 88.29% on the standard test set.",
        "We run the Charniak parser on their clus-terized corpus.",
        "Table 8 summarizes the current state-of-the-art for lexicalized parsing on the Ftb-uc.Clearly, the approach consisting in extending clusters with features and suffixes seems to improve Charniak's performance more than our method.",
        "In that case, the lexicon is drastically reduced, as well as the amount of out of vocabulary words (OOVs).",
        "Nevertheless, the relatively low POS accuracy, with only 36 OOVs, for this configuration confirms that POS guessing is the current bottleneck if a process of reducing the lexicon increases POS assignment ambiguities.",

        "We showed that while lemmatization can be of some benefit to reduce lexicon size and remedy data sparseness for a MRL such as French, the key factor that drives parsing performance for the Charniak parser is the amount of unseen words resulting from the generation of <lemma,POS> pairs for the Ftb-uc.",
        "For a sample of the English PTB, morphological analysis did not produce any significant improvement.",
        "Finally, even if this architecture has the potential to help out-of-domain parsing, adding morphological analysis on top of an existing highly tuned statistical parsing system can result in suboptimal performance.",
