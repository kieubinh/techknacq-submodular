        "The dependency parsing community has since a few years shown considerable interest in parsing morphologically rich languages with flexible word order.",
        "This is partly due to the increasing availability of dependency treebanks for such languages, but it is also motivated by the observation that the performance obtained for these languages has not been very high (Nivre et al., 2007a).",
        "Attempts at handling various non-configurational aspects in these languages have pointed towards shortcomings in traditional parsing methodologies (Tsarfaty and Sima'an, 2008; Eryigit et al., 2008; Seddah et al., 2009; Husain et al., 2009; Gadde et al., 2010).",
        "Among other things, it has been pointed out that the use of language specific features may play a crucial role in improving the overall parsing performance.",
        "Different languages tend to encode syntactically relevant information in different ways, and it has been hypothesized that the integration of morphological and syntactic information could be a key to better accuracy.",
        "However, it has also been noted that incorporating these language specific features in parsing is not always straightforward and many intuitive features do not always work in expected ways.",
        "In this paper, we are concerned with Hindi, an Indian language with moderately rich morphology and relatively free word order.",
        "There have been several previous attempts at parsing Hindi as well as other Indian languages (Bharati et al., 1995, Bharati et al., 2009b).",
        "Many techniques were tried out recently at the ICON09 dependency parsing tools contest (Husain, 2009).",
        "Both the best performing system (Ambati et al., 2009a) and the system in second place (Nivre, 2009b) used a transition-based approach to dependency parsing, as implemented in MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007b).",

        "(2008),",

        "In this paper, we continue to explore the transition-based approach to Hindi dependency parsing, building on the state-of-the-art results of Ambati et common pool of features used by those systems.",
        "Through a series of experiments we select features incrementally to arrive at the best parser features.",
        "The primary purpose of this investigation is to study the role of different morphosyntactic features in Hindi dependency parsing, but we also want to improve the overall parsing accuracy.",
        "Our final results are 76.5% labeled and 91.1% unlabeled attachment score, improving previous results by 2 and 1 percent absolute, respectively.",
        "In addition to this, we also provide an error analysis, isolating specific linguistic phenomena and/or other factors that impede the overall parsing performance, and suggest possible remedies for these problems."

        "The Hindi dependency treebank (Begum et al., 2008) used for the experiment was released as part of the ICON09 dependency parsing tools contest (Husain, 2009).",
        "The dependency framework (Bharati et al., 1995) used in the treebank is inspired by Panini's grammar of Sanskrit.",
        "The core labels, called karakas, are syntactico-semantic relations that identify the participant in the action denoted by the verb.",
        "For example, in (1), 'Malay' is the agent, 'book' is the theme, and 'Sameer' is the beneficiary in the activity of 'give'.",
        "In the treebank, these three labels are marked as k1, k2, and k4 respectively.",
        "Note, however, that the notion of kara-ka does not capture the 'global' semantics of thematic roles; rather it captures the elements of the ' local semantics' of a verb, while also taking cues from the surface level morpho-syntactic information (Vaidya et al., 2009).",
        "The syntactic relational cues (such as case markers) help identify many of the karakas.",
        "In general, the highest available karaka, if not case-marked, agrees with the verb in an active sentence.",
        "In addition, the tense, aspect and modality (TAM) marker can many a times control the case markers that appear on k1.",
        "For example, in (1) 'Malay' takes an ergative case because of the past perfective TAM marker (that appears as a suffix in this case) of the main verb 'gave'.",
        "Many dependency relations other than ka-rakas are purely syntactic.",
        "These include relations such as noun modifier (nmod), verb modifier (vmod), conjunct relation (ccof), etc.",

        "For example, such information can represent the postposition/case-marking in the case of noun chunks, or it may represent the TAM information in the case of verb chunks.",
        "In the experiments conducted for this paper this local information is automatically computed and incorporated as a feature of the head of a chunk.",
        "As we will see later, such information proves to be extremely crucial during dependency parsing.",
        "For all the experiments discussed in section 4, the training and development data size was 1500 and 150 sentences respectively.",

        "A transition-based dependency parser is built of two essential components (Nivre, 2008):",
        "• A transition system for mapping sentences to dependency trees",
        "• A classifier for predicting the next transition for every possible system configuration",
        "Given these two components, dependency parsing can be realized as deterministic search through the transition system, guided by the classifier.",
        "With this technique, parsing can be performed in linear time for projective dependency trees.",
        "Like Ambati et al.",
        "(2009a) and Nivre (2009b), we use MaltPars-er, an open-source implementation of transition-based dependency parsing with a variety of transition systems and customizable classifiers.",
        "Previous work has shown that the arc-eager projective transition system first described in Nivre",
        "Nivre, 2009b).",
        "A parser configuration in this system contains a stack holding partially processed tokens, an input buffer containing the remaining tokens, and a set of arcs representing the partially built dependency tree.",
        "There are four possible transitions (where top is the token on top of the stack and next is the next token in the input buffer):",
        "• Left-Arc(r): Add an arc labeled r from next to top; pop the stack.",
        "• Right-Arc(r): Add an arc labeled r from top to next; push next onto the stack.",
        "• Reduce: Pop the stack.",
        "• Shift: Push next onto the stack.",
        "Although this system can only derive projective dependency trees, the fact that the trees are labeled allows non-projective dependencies to be captured using the pseudo-projective parsing technique proposed in Nivre and Nilsson (2005).",
        "Classifiers can be induced from treebank data using a wide variety of different machine learning methods, but all experiments reported below use support vector machines with a polynomial kernel, as implemented in the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2001) included in MaltParser.",

        "Experiment 4: In experiment 4, we used the PTAG information of nodes in the partially built tree, more specifically the syntactic head of top and the leftmost dependent of next.",

        "Some arguments such as place/time nominals can be shared.",
        "Shared arguments are assigned to only one verb in the dependency tree.",
        "So the task of identifying the shared arguments, if any, and attaching them to the correct parent is a complex task.",
        "Note that the dependency labels can be identified based on the morphosyntactic features.",
        "The task becomes more complex if there is more than one participle in a sentence.",
        "12 out of 130 instances (9.23%) of shared arguments has an incorrect attachment.",
        "Many participles are ambiguous and making the correct attachment choice is difficult.",
        "Similar participles, depending on the context, can behave as adverbials and attach to a verb, or can behave as adjectives and attach to a noun.",
        "Take (4) as a case in point.",
        "In (4) based on how one interprets 'daurte hue', one gets either the reading that 'I saw a running dog' or that 'I saw a dog while running'.",
        "In case of the adjectival participle construction (VJJ), 2 out of 3 errors are due to wrong attachment.",
        "Coordination poses problems as it often gives rise to long-distance dependencies.",
        "Moreover, the treebank annotation treats the coordinating conjunction as the head of the coordinated structure.",
        "Therefore, a coordinating conjunction can potentially become the root of the entire dependency tree.",
        "This is similar to Prague style dependency annotation (Hajico-va, 1998).",
        "Coordinating conjunctions pose additional problems in such a scenario as they can appear as the child of different heads.",
        "A coordinating conjunction takes children of similar POS category, but the parent of the conjunction depends on the type of the children.",
        "(5) a. raama aur shyaama ne khaana khaayaa 'Ram ate food and drank water.'",
        "In (5a), raama and shyaama are children of the coordinating conjunction aur, which gets attached to the main verb khaayaa with the label k1.",
        "In effect, syntactically awr becomes the argument of the main verb.",
        "In (5b), however, the verbs khaayaa and piyaa are the children of aur.",
        "In this case, awr becomes the root of the sentence.",
        "Identifying the nature of the conjunction and its children becomes a challenging task for the parser.",
        "Note that the number of children that a coordinating conjunction can take is not fixed either.",
        "The parser could identify the correct head of the conjunctions with an accuracy of 75.7% and the correct children with an accuracy of 85.7%.",
        "The nature of the conjunction will also affect the dependency relation it has with its head.",
        "For example, if the children are nouns, then the conjunction behaves as a noun and can potentially be an argument of a verb.",
        "By contrast, if the children are finite verbs, then it behaves as a finite verb and can become the root of the dependency tree.",
        "Unlike nouns and verbs, however, conjunctions do not have morphological features.",
        "So a child-to-head feature percolation should help make a coordinating node more transparent.",
        "For example, in (5a) the Ergative case ne is a strong cue for the dependency label k1.",
        "If we copy this information from one of its children (here shyaama) to the conjunct, then the parser can possibly make use of this information.",
        "Complex predicates are formed by combining a noun or an adjective with a verbalizer kar or ho.",
        "For instance, in taariif karanaa 'to praise', taariif 'praise' is a noun and karanaa 'to do' is a verb.",
        "Together they form the main verb.",
        "Complex predicates are highly productive in Hindi.",
        "Combination of the light verb and the noun/adjective is dependent on not only syntax but also semantics and therefore its automatic identification is not always straightforward (Butt, 1995).",
        "A noun-verb complex predicate in the treebank is linked via the dependency label pof.",
        "The parser makes mistakes in identifying pof or misclassifies other labels as pof.",
        "In particular, the confusion is with k2 and kls which are object/theme and noun complements of kl, respectively.",
        "These labels share similar contextual features like the nominal element in the verb complex.",
        "Table 3 includes the confusion matrix for pof errors.",
        "As noted earlier, MaltParser's arc-eager parsing algorithm can be combined with the pseudo-projective parsing techniques proposed in Nivre and Nilsson (2005), which potentially helps in identifying non-projective arcs.",
        "The Hindi treebank has ~14% non-projective arcs (Mannem et al., 2009a).",
        "In the test set, there were a total of 11 non-projective arcs, but the parser did not find any of them.",
        "This is consistent with earlier results showing that pseudo-projective parsing has high precision but low recall, especially when the percentage of non-projective relations is small (Nilsson et al., 2007).",
        "Non-projectivity has proven to be one of the major problems in dependency parsing, especially for free word-order languages.",
        "In Hindi, the majority of non-projective arcs are inter-clausal (Mannem et al., 2009a), involving conjunctions and relative clauses.",
        "There have been some attempts at handling inter-clausal non-projectivity in Hindi.",
        "Hu-sain et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a two-stage approach that can handle some of the inter-clausal non-projective structures.",
        "Previous results on parsing other languages have shown that MaltParser has lower accuracy on longdistance dependencies.",
        "Our results confirm this.",
        "Errors in the case of relative clauses and coordination can mainly be explained in this way.",
        "For example, there are 8 instances of relative clauses in the test data.",
        "The system could identify only 2 of them correctly.",
        "These two are at a distance of 1 from its parent.",
        "For the remaining 6 instances the distance to the parent of the relative clause ranges from 4 to 12.",
        "Figure 3 shows how parser performance decreases with increasing distance between the head and the dependent.",
        "Recently, Husain et al.",
        "(2009) have proposed a two-stage setup to parse inter-clausal and intra-clausal dependencies separately.",
        "They have shown that most long distance relations are inter-clausal, and therefore, using such a clause motivated parsing setup helps in maximizing both short distance and long distance dependency accuracy.",
        "In a similar spirit, Gadde et al.",
        "(2010) showed that using clausal features helps in identifying long distance dependencies.",
        "They have shown that providing clause information in the form of clause boundaries and clausal heads can help a parser make better predictions about long distance dependencies.",
