        "This is a preliminary report of the results of a new procedure for building a webcorpus of academic writing using BootCaT seeded searches (Baroni and Bernardini, 2004).",
        "The procedure inverts the usual one of finding text-internal traits that correlate with externally defined corpora and subcorpo-ra (Lee, 2001).",
        "Instead, we seek words and lexical bundles so distinctive of a text-type (\"register\") that they will induce BootCaT to download texts of that type and no other.",
        "In the initial phase, a list of search seed terms is developed to download academic texts; in the second phase, this procedure is refined to increase its resolution, developing search seeds that can bring in texts belonging to subtypes such as Science and Technology, Arts and Humanities, History and Political Science, and so on.",
        "One might object that this is a solution to a non-problem: that all that is necessary is to limit searches to the .edu and .ac.uk domains to search for academic web texts, at least for US and UK academics.",
        "It will become clear, however, that quite a number of qualifying texts can be found elsewhere in other web domains such as .org, .gov, and even .com."
