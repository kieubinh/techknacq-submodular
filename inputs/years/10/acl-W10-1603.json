        "In the Computational Linguistics area, the task of part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) consists in assigning to words in a text the grammatical class they belong.",
        "Since the same word may belong to more than one class, models for POS tagging have to look at the context where each word occurs to try to solve the ambiguity.",
        "Previous and current work have developed a wide range of models and methods for tagging.",
        "The vast majority uses supervised learning methods, which",
        "TDuring the course of this work Fabio received support from Brazilian funding agencies CAPES and CNPq.",
        "need an already tagged corpus as input in order to train the model, calculating relations, weights, probabilities etc.",
        "Among the various models for tagging, there are Maximum Entropy models (dos Santos et al., 2008; de Almeida Filho, 2002; Ratnaparkhi, 1996), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Brants, 2000), Transformation Based Learning (Brill, 1993), and other succesful approaches (Toutanova et al., 2003; Tsu-ruoka and Tsujii, 2005; Shen et al., 2007).",
        "Current state-of-the-art precision in tagging is achieved by supervised methods.",
        "Although precision is pretty high - less than 3% error rate for English - the disavantage is exactly the need of a tagged corpus, usually built manually.",
        "This is a very restrictive issue for languages with lack of resources such as linguistic especialists, corpora projects etc.",
        "The Portuguese language falls in between resourceful languages, such as English, and languages with restricted resources.",
        "There have been initiatives both in Brazil and in Portugal, which include modern Brazilian Portuguese corpora (ICMC-USP, 2010), European Portuguese corpora (Flo, 2008), and historical Portuguese corpora (IEL-UNICAMP and IME-USP, 2010).",
        "Also, some supervised POS taggers have already been developed for Portuguese (dos Santos et al., 2008; Kepler and Finger, 2006; Aires, 2000) with a good degree of success.",
        "And finally, there has also been increasing effort and interest in Portuguese annotation tools, such as E-",
        "Dictor (de Sousa et al., 2009).",
        "Despite these advances, there is still lack of material and resources for Portuguese, as well as research",
        "!See http://purl.org/edictor.",
        "in unsupervised methods to bootstrap text annotation.",
        "Our work focuses on further improvement of the current state-of-the-art in Portuguese tagging.",
        "For this, we focus on the Tycho Brahe (IEL-UNICAMP and IME-USP, 2010) corpus for testing and benchmarking, because of its great collaboration potential: it is easily accessible; is under continuous development; and has recently started using E-Dictor, which also offers a great collaboration potential.",
        "One popular approach to tagging is to use HMMs of order 2.",
        "Order 2, or trigram, means the tagger considers the previous two words/tags when tagging a word.",
        "This adds context to help disambiguation.",
        "The drawback is that this context may not be sufficient.",
        "Increasing the order does not help, since this incurs in too many model parameters and suffers from the data sparsity problem.",
        "In (Kepler and Finger, 2006), we developed a tagger for Portuguese that uses Markov chains of variable length, that is, orders greater than 2 can be used conditioned on certain tags and sequences of tags.",
        "This approach is better at avoiding the sparsity and complexity problems, while being able to model longer contexts.",
        "However, one interesting conclusion from that work is that, even using longer contexts, some words stay extremely hard to disambiguate.",
        "Apparently, those words rely on flexible contexts not captured by pure VLMCs.",
        "Motivated by this problem, we improve over the previous work, and developed a set of tagger models based on Variable-Length Markov Chains (VLMCs) extended with various other approaches in order to try to tackle the problem.",
        "In the next section we describe the VLMC theory, the results it achieves, and the problems with two common words.",
        "Then, in Section 3, we explain in summary the set of models and approaches we tried to mix with VLMCs, and the different types of results they give.",
        "Conclusions are drawn in Section 4.",
        "Finally, Section 5 describes how this work can be incorporated in other projects, and Section 6 presents ideas for future work."

        "(BÃ¼hlmann and Wyner, 1999) give a formal description of VLMCs, while here we will explain them in terms of the POS-tagging task.",
        "Consider a Markov chain with a finite, large order k. Let ti be a tag, and ti_k,i_1 be the k tags preceding ti.",
        "Variable length memory can be seen as a cut of irrelevant states from the ti_k)i_1 history.",
        "We call the set of these states the context of ti.",
        "Given a tag ti, its context ti_h;i_1, h < k, is given by the context function c(ti_k,i_i).",
        "A context tree is a tree in which each internal node has at most |T| children, where T is the tagset.",
        "Each value of a context function c( ) is represented as a branch of such tree.",
        "For example, the context given by c(ti_k i_1) is represented as a branch whose sub-branch at the top is determined by ti_1, the next sub-branch by ti_2, and so on, until the leaf, determined by ti_h.",
        "The parameters of a VLMC are the underlying functions c( ) and their probabilities.",
        "To obtain these parameters we use a version of the context algorithm of (Rissanen, 1983).",
        "First, it builds a big context tree, using a training corpus.",
        "For a tag ti, its maximal history ti_k i_1 is placed as a branch in the tree.",
        "Then, the algorithm uses a pruning function considering a local decision criterion.",
        "This pruning cuts off the irrelevant states from the tags' histories.",
        "For each leaf u in the context tree, and branch v that goes from the root to the parent node of u, u is pruned from the tree if where C (vu) is the number of occurrences of the sequence vu in the training corpus, and K is a threshold value, called the cut value of the context tree,",
        "If the probability of a tag does not change much between considering the entire branch together with the leaf (all past history) and considering only the branch (the history without the furthest tag), then the leaf does not need to be considered, and can be removed from the tree.",
        "We want to find the best sequence of tags t1.. .tnfor a given sequence of words w1... wn of size n, that is, arg max TT P(ti|c(ti_fc)i_1))P(wi|ti) .",
        "Probabilities are computed from a tagged training corpus using maximum likelihood estimation from the relative frequencies of words and sequences of tags.",
        "The context tree is built with sequences of tags of maximum length k and then pruned, thus defining the context functions.",
        "For decoding, the Viterbi Algorithm is used (Viterbi, 1967).",
        "We used the tagged texts available by the Ty-cho Brahe Corpus of Historical Portuguese (IEL-UNICAMP and IME-USP, 2010).",
        "The Tycho Brahe project uses 377 POS and inflectional tags, and contains annotated texts written by authors born between 1380 and 1845.",
        "We have selected 19 texts for composing our corpus, which contains 1035593 tagged words and has 262 different tags.",
        "This corpus was then randomly divided into 75% of the sentences for generating a training corpus and 25% for a testing corpus.",
        "The training corpus has 775602 tagged words, while the testing corpus has 259991 tagged words.",
        "The Tycho Brahe project is undergoing rapid development, so as for today there are more texts available which are not present in the corpus we used.",
        "Because of some of the approaches explained below, we also created a new training corpus and a new testing corpus by segmenting contracted words from the original corpus.",
        "Contracted words are words like da, which has the tag P+D-F and is a contraction of the preposition de (P) with the feminine determiner a (D-F).",
        "Using the original corpus, our VLMC implementation, which we will call vlmm tagger (from Variable Length Markov Model), and which better implements under-and overflow control, achieves 96.29% of precision, while the vlmc tagger from (Kepler and Finger, 2006) achieves 95.51%.",
        "Table 1 shows the numbers for both taggers, where P and E means Precision and Error, respectively.",
        "The difference in precision is mainly due to a 21.64% error reduction in known words tagging.",
        "That, combined with 6.82% error reduction in unknown words, results in 17.50% total error reduction.",
