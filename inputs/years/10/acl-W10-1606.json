        "Costa Rica is a Central American country, well known for the abolition of its army in 1949 and for its policies in favor of the conservation of ecologically important areas.",
        "Investments in Education brought a good development of several higher educational institutions, most of them public and open to new students through an academic selection system.",
        "As a consequence, one of the main products of exportation is software (outsourcing, for example).",
        "The growing importance of Computational Linguistics (CL) in the last years has made developers to start using CL technologies at work, but unfortunately, often, they are on their own for the lack of academic structures supporting development.",
        "In the Table 1 and in the Figure 1 we provide comparative data on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico and the United States both taken from the World Economic Report for 2010 (Dutta and Mia, 2010), in order to help the reader to get a better picture of the context on which CL is growing up in Costa Rica.",
        "This paper aims to bring a general account of CL in Costa Rica.",
        "This article is divided into three parts.",
        "The section 2 starts with some early CL articles in Costa Rica before covering academic and research infrastructure in the country.",
        "The section 4 briefly acknowledges the presence of CL industries in the country.",
        "Finally, the section 5 presents some of the current tendencies in research and teaching.",
        "The claims in this paper are not exhaustive and they only represent the Author's opinion, who aims to be as objective as possible, but who does not have a complete knowledge on the structures, institutions and companies involved in computational issues in Costa Rica.",
        "Therefore, all the topics are raised from personal interviews and experiences ."

        "Since the 90's, CL raised interest in main academic institutions in Costa Rica, particularly in the field of Artificial Intelligence, but this interest was not continued and well structured in time.",
        "Some researchers moved to other academic areas in computation or even to industrial research.",
        "So, in the Instituto Tec-nolôgico de Costa Rica (TEC) we found the first citations related to CL, mainly on number recognition (Helo and Sell, 1995), knowledge representation (Araya, 1992), connectionism (Vargas, 1991) and unification grammars (Vargas, 1992), these last from a philosophical perspective.",
        "In Costa Rica, we found more than 40 universities and research institutes.",
        "But, computational research in the country is principally done in the TEC and in the University of Costa Rica.",

        "In the 90's the project Estudios de Lexicografia Hispano-Costarricense (ELEXHICOS) at the School ofPhilology, Linguistics and Literature of the University of Costa Rica was born as an initiative to do lexicographical research on contemporary Costarican Spanish and to publish dictionaries based on modern scientific methods and oriented towards different publics and usages.",

        "However, statistical dictionaries (Morales, 2009) can only be done by electronic means because of the huge calculations involved.",
        "For a long time, ELEXHICOS counted on the limited, but important, support ofthe Centro de Informatica (Center ofInformatics) ofthe University of Costa Rica, but the need of developing its own resources and technologies imposed itself.",
