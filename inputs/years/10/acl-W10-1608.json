        "For some tasks in language processing such as Information Extraction or Q&A Systems, it is important to know the opinions expressed by different sources and their polarity, positive or negative, with respect to different topics.",
        "There are even commercial applications that provide this kind of service (http://www.jodange.com).",
        "We here present a system for identifying opinions in Spanish texts.",
        "We define opinion as the report of someone's statement about any subject ( El investigador de la Politécnica afirma que el principal problema de este sistema es conseguir que sea fâcil de usar / The researcher at the Politécnica asserts that the main problem with this system is making it easy to use), or as any mention of discourse participants' beliefs (El PRI acepta parti-cipar en el debate / The PRI agrees to participate in the debate).",
        "As a first step, we study the impact of elements that typically introduce such expressions in written text.",
        "These elements are mainly verbs of communication (decir, declarar / say, state) but other verb classes (belief, agreement, appreciation) are also considered.",
        "In other cases, the opinions will be expressed through nouns (opinion/opinion, declara-ciôn/statement) or segments introduced by segun (according to) or similar expressions.",
        "To complete the opinion, we identify its characteristic arguments: the source, the topic and the message.",
        "In addition to recognizing an opinion, we try to determine its semantic orientation.",
        "To this end, we consider certain subjective elements and operators (reverse, intensifier, enhancing, neutralizing, etc.)",
        "which affect them.",
        "In this article, we present only results on the semantic orientation of opinion verbs, opinion nouns and topic introducers (sobre/about, con respecto a/with respect to, etc.",
        ").",
        "There are many studies that address these issues: Pang and Lee (2008), for instance, discuss in detail various concepts in the area of \"Opinion Mining\" or \"Sentiment Analysis\" and present the main proposals, resources and applications.",
        "For our work, which focuses on the identification of source, topic and message, we have mainly drawn on the following: the scheme for annotating opinions and emotions proposed by Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie (2005); the work on opinion-holder (source) propositional opinion identification presented in (Bethard et al., 2004); a system for source identification using statistical methods (Choi et al., 2005); a method for opinion-holder and topic extraction from Kim and Hovy (2006); the study on the identification of source and target presented in (Ruppenhofer et al., 2008); and a work on topic annotation (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008).",
        "For our semantic orientation study, we have taken some concepts from Turney and Littman (2003) and analyzed some work on subjectivity operators (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2004; Moilanen and Pulman, 2007; Choi and Cardie, 2008).",
        "In what follows, we briefly present the model that has been defined to represent opinions and two methods for their automatic recognition.",
        "First, we describe a rule-based system that incorporates lexical resources.",
        "This system, whose evaluation is detailed below, achieves a recall of 74% and a precision of 97%.",
        "During the evaluation process we produced an annotated corpus of 13,000 words, by manually correcting the system output.",
        "The second system, currently under development, involves the application of machine-learning techniques to the annotated corpus."

      "text": [
        "An opinion is composed of a predicative element and its characteristic arguments.",
        "The set of opinion predicates includes verbs, nouns and prepositions (or prepositional locutions).",
        "Verbs belong to various semantic classes: communication (decir / say, declarar / state), assessment (criticar / criticize, felicitar / compliment), belief (creer / believe, opinar / think) and acceptance (aceptar / accept, rechazar / reject).",
        "These classes are similar to those proposed in (Asher et al., 2008), the main difference being that they include the class Sentiment but we do not.",
        "Nouns are generally derived from the aforementioned verbs (opiniôn / opinion, declaraciôn / statement, apoyo / support).",
        "Some prepositions and prepositional locutions are segun, de acuerdo a, para / according to.",
        "The relevant arguments that we identified for the opinion predicates are, as already mentioned, source, topic and message.",
        "To establish this scheme we analysed syntactico-semantic schemes proposed in ADESSE for selected verb classes (Garcia-Miguel et al., 2005) and some of the Spanish FrameNet frames (Subirats-Rüggeberg and Petruck., 2003), mainly the opinion frame whose frame elements include cognizer (source), topic and opinion (message) and the communication frame for which some elements are communicator (source), topic and message.",
        "Our definition deviates from much of the literature on this subject because we limit our work to opinions introduced by an opinion predicate, as explained above, while many of the cited works identify all kinds of subjective expressions, mainly adjectives with positive or negative polarity, as with the expressive subjective elements described in (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "As in our work we focus on finding the source, the message and the topic for each opinion, we ignore all the text fragments in which there is no evidence that the author is quoting or referring to other participants' opinions.",
        "These text fragments constitute the message, as defined above, stated by the text author.",
        "So, once our system has identified other participants' opinions, the remaining text should be attributed to the text author.",
        "Identifying subjective elements is necessary in order to determine the semantic orientation of the opinion.",
        "We think the treatment of these elements within the author's message is similar to the treatment that must be applied within the message attributed to any other source.",
        "Such a treatment is not addressed in this work, since the semantic orientation study presented here is restricted to opinion predicates and topic introducers.",
        "In some respects our work is related to that of (Bethard et al., 2004).",
        "For opinions introduced by opinion verbs, they identify the source (opinion holder) and the message (propositional opinion), restricting the study to messages that constitute subordinate clauses.",
        "However, we seek also to identify the explicit references to the topic and we consider not only verbs but also some nouns and prepositions such as segun / according to.",
        "A further difference is that they distinguish propositions containing an opinion from those transmitting facts or predictions, whereas we do not make this distinction.",
        "In our recognition of the topic we consider only explicit references to the opinion subject.",
        "We look for topic-introducing elements, such as sobre / about, con respecto a / regarding, en contra de / against, without trying to deduce the topic from the study of the message itself.",
        "For this general scheme, there are different instances in which the arguments can take different forms.",
        "Thus, for some opinion verbs such as re-chazar / reject, the message is usually empty.",
        "For other verbs the topic will be a noun phrase, such as aceptar la propuesta / to accept the proposal, while for others it will be a prepositional phrase, for example, hablar de literatura / to speak about literature.",
        "In a standard reported speech utterance (1), the opinion predicate is a communication verb.",

        "When the source introducer is segun, we can find an opinion verb between segun and the source (segun el senador / segun dijo el senador / according to the senator), For the preposition para / for, preceding punctuation is required because of its high ambiguity.",
        "Some of the rules, especially those for opinion predicate identification, rely heavily on lexical resources: lists of opinion verbs and nouns, person indicators (senor, doctor, senador /Mr., Dr., senator), institution indicators (instituciôn, hospital, diario / institution, hospital, journal), support verbs (plantear, emitir / make, deliver), topic introducers (sobre, con respecto a / about, with respect to), positive subjective elements (bueno, excelente, diversiôn / good, excellent, fun), negative subjective elements (malo, negativo, pesimista / bad, negative, pessimist), and operators (muy, extremadamente, a penas / very, extremely, just).",
