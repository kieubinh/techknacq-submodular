        "The objective of the Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge is determining whether the meaning of the Hypothesis (H) can be inferred from a text (T) (Ido Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "This challenge has been organized by NIST in recent years.",
        "Another related antecedent was Answer Validation Exercise (AVE), part of Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF), whose objective is to develop systems which are able to decide whether the answer to a question is correct or not (Penas et al., 2006).",
        "It was a three year-old track, from 2006 to 2008.",
        "AVE challenge was an evaluation framework for Question Answering (QA) systems to promote the development and evaluation of subsystems aimed at validating the correctness of the answers given by a QA system.",
        "The Answer Validation task must select the best answer for the final output.",
        "There is a subtask for each language involved in QA, the Spanish is one of these.",
        "Thus, AVE task is very similar to RTE (Recognition of Textual Entailments).",
        "In this paper, we address the RTE task problem of determining the entailment value between Text and Hypothesis pairs in Spanish, applying machine learning techniques.",
        "In the past, RTEs Challenges machine learning algorithms were widely used for the task of recognizing textual entailment (Marneffe et al., 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2007; Castillo, 2009) and they have reported goods results for English language.",
        "Also, our system applies machine learning algorithms to the Spanish.",
        "We built a set of datasets based on public available datasets for English, together to SPARTE (Penas et al., 2006), an available Corpus in Spanish.",
        "This corpus contains 2962 hypothesis with a document label and a True/False value indicating whether the document entails the hypothesis or not.",
        "Up to our knowledge, SPARTE corpus in the only corpus aimed at evaluating RTE systems in Spanish.",
        "Finally, we generated a feature vector with the following components for both Text and Hypothesis: Levenshtein distance, a lexical distance based on Levenshtein, a semantic similarity measure Wordnet based, and the LCS (longest common substring) metric; in order to characterize the relationships between the Text and the Hypothesis.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 shows the system description, whereas Section 3 describes the results of experimental evaluation and discussion of them.",
        "Section 4 discusses opportunities of collaboration.",
        "Finally, Section 5 summarizes the conclusions and lines for future work."

        "The SPARTE Corpus, was built from the Spanish corpora used at Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) for evaluating QA systems during the years 2003, 2004 and 2005.",
        "This corpus contains 2962 hypothesis with a True/False value indicating whether the document entails the hypothesis or not.",
        "Due to, all available dataset of PASCAL Text Analysis Conference were in English, we translated every dataset to Spanish by using an online translator engine.",
        "So, we had a Spanish dataset but with some translation errors provided by the translator.",
        "It is important to note, that the \"quality\" of the translation is given by the Translator engine, and we suppose that the sense of the sentence should not be modified by the Translator.",
        "Indeed, it is the situation for the majority of the cases that we analyzed.",
        "The new datasets were named RTE3-Sp (Spanish), RTE4-Sp, and RTE5-Sp.",
        "The following example is the pair number 799 from RTE3-Sp with False as entailment value.",
        "Otros dos marines, Tyler Jackson y Juan Jodka III, ya han se declarô culpables de asalto agra-vantes y conspiraciôn para obstruir la justicia y fueron condenados a 21 meses y 18 meses, respec-tivamente.",
        "Hypothesis:",
        "Tyler Jackson ha sido condenado a 18 meses.",
        "This example shows a little noisy (and a minimal syntactic error) in the translation of the Text to Spanish (instead of \"ya han se declarô\" should be \"ya se han declarado\"); but the whole meaning was not changed.",
        "Also, we show a pair example (pair id=3) taken from Sparte Corpus with False as entailment value:",
        "Text: iCuäl es la capital de Croacia?",
        "Hypothesis :",
        "La capital de Croacia es ONU.",
        "In a similar way, all pairs from SPARTE belong to QA task and these are syntactically simpler than RTE's Corpus pairs.",
        "Additionally, we generate the following development sets: RTE3-Sp+RTE4-Sp, and SPARTE-Bal+RTE3-Sp+RTE4-Sp in order to train with different corpus and different sizes.",
        "In all cases, RTE5-Sp TAC 2009 gold standard dataset was used as test-set.",
        "Also, we did additional experiments with SPARTE, using cross-validation technique and percentage split method, in order to test the accuracy of our system taking only this corpus as development and training set.",
        "We experimented with the following four machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), Decision Trees(DT) and AdaBoost(AB).",
        "The Decision Trees are interesting because we can see what features were selected from the top levels of the trees.",
        "SVM and AdaBoost were selected because they are known for achieving high performances, and MLP was used because it has achieved high performance in others NLP tasks.",
        "We experimented with various settings for the machine learning algorithms, including only the results for the best parameters.",
        "We generated a feature vector with the following components for every possible <T,H>: Le-venshtein distance, a lexical distance based on Levenshtein, a semantic similarity measure Wordnet based, and the LCS (longest common substring) metric.",
        "We chose only four features in order to learn the development sets, having into account that larger feature sets do not necessarily lead to improving classification performance because it could increase the risk of overfitting the training data.",
        "Below the motivation for the input features: Levenshtein distance is motivated by the good results obtained as a measure of similarity between two strings.",
        "Using stems, this measure improves the Levenshtein over words.",
        "The lexical distance feature based on Levenshtein distance is interesting because works to a sentence level.",
        "Semantic similarity using WordNet is interesting because of the capture of the semantic similarity between T and H to sentence level.",
        "Longest common substring is selected because it is easy to implement and provides a good measure for word overlap.",
        "The standard Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the amount of difference between two strings.",
        "This distance quantifies the number of changes (character based) to generate one text string (T) from the other (H).",
        "The algorithm works independently from the language that we are analyzing.",
        "We used a Spanish Stemmer that stems words in Spanish based on a modified version of the Snowball algorithm.",
        "Additionally, by using Levenshtein distance we defined a lexical distance and the procedure is the following:",
        "• Each string T and H are divided in a list of tokens.",
        "• The similarity between each pair of tokens in T and H is performed using the Le-venshtein distance over stems.",
        "• The string similarity between two lists of tokens is reduced to the problem of \"bipartite graph matching\", performed using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) over this bipartite graph.",
        "Then, we found the assignment that maximizes the sum of ratings of each token.",
        "Note that each graph node is a token of the list.",
        "The final score is calculated by:",
        ".",
        "TotalSim finalscore – -",
        "TotalSim is the sum of the similarities with the optimal assignment in the graph.",
        "Length (T) is the number of tokens in T. Length (H) is the number of tokens in H.",
        "Since, all datasets are in Spanish, we need to convert <T, H> pair to English.",
        "In the case of RTEs-Sp datasets, this action will backward to the English language (source).",
        "Our ideal case would be to use EuroWordNetto obtain the semantic information that we need, but we won't be able to access to this resource.",
        "Thus, WordNet is used to calculate the semantic similarity between T and H. The following procedure is applied:",

        "Word sense disambiguation using the Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986), based on Wordnet definitions.",
        "2.",
        "A semantic similarity matrix between words in T and H is defined.",
        "Words are used only in synonym and hyperonym relationship.",
        "The Breadth First Search algorithm is used over these tokens; similarity is calculated by using two factors: length of the path and orientation of the path.",
        "3.",
        "To obtain the final score, we use matching average.",
        "The semantic similarity between two words is computed as:",
        "Where: s,t are source and target words that we are comparing (s is in H and t is in T).",
        "Depth(s) is the shortest distance from the root node to the current node.",

        "The SPARTE-Balanced dataset yields the worst results, maybe because this dataset contains only pairs with QA task, and an additional reason, could be that SPARTE is syntactically simpler than PASCAL RTE.",
