        "In knowledge-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, the lexical knowledge database is responsible for providing, to the processing modules, the lexical units of the language and their morphological, syntactic, semantic-conceptual and even illocutionary properties (Hanks, 2004).",
        "In this scenario, there is an increasing need of accurate general lexical-conceptual resources for developing NLP applications.",
        "A revolutionary development of the 1990s was the Princeton WordNet (WN.Pr) (Fellbaum, 1998), an online reference lexical database built for North-American English that combines the design of a dictionary and a thesaurus with a rich ontological potential.",
        "Specifically, WN.Pr is a semantic network, in which the meanings of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into \"sets of cognitive synonyms\" (or synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.",
        "Synsets are interlinked through conceptual-semantic (i.e., hypernymy/hyponymy, holo-nymy/meronymy, entailment, and cause) and lexical (i.e., antonymy) relations.",
        "Moreover, WN.Pr encodes a co-text sentence for each wordform in a synset and a concept gloss for each syn-set (i.e., an informal lexicographic definition of the concept evoked by the synset).",
        "The success of WN.Pr is largely due to its accessibility, linguistic adequacy and potential in terms of NLP.",
        "Given that, WN.Pr serves as a model for similarly conceived wordnets in several languages.",
        "In other words, the success of WN.Pr has determined the emergence of several projects that aim the construction of wordnets for other languages than English or to develop multilingual wordnets (the most important project in this line is EuroWordNet) (Vossen, 2002).",
        "Many recent projects with the objective of (i) integrating generic and specialized wordnets (e.g., Magnin and Speranza, 2001; Roventini and Mari-nelli, 2004; Bentivogli et al., 2004), (ii) enriching generic wordnets with terminological units (e.g., Buitelaar and Sacaleanu, 2002) or (iii) constructing terminological wordnets (e.g.: Sagri et al., 2004; Smith and Fellbaum, 2004) have shown that concrete NLP application must be able to comprehend both expert and non-expert vocabulary.",
        "Despite the existence of a reasonable number of terminological wordnets, there is no a general methodology for building this type of lexical database.",
        "Thus, motivated by this gap and by the fact that Brazilian Potuguese (PB) is a resource-poor language, the two-years TermiNet project has been developed since September 2009.",
        "This paper gives an overview of the TermiNet project.",
        "Accordingly, in Section 2 we brief describe the original WN.Pr design that motivated the project.",

        "WN.Pr contains information about nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in North-American English and is organized around the notion of a synset.",
        "As mentioned, a synset is a set of words with the same part-of-speech that can be interchanged in a certain context.",
        "For example, {car; auto; automobile; machine; motorcar} form a synset because they can be used to refer to the same concept.",
        "A synset is often further described by a concept gloss, e.g.: \"4-wheeled; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine\".",
        "Finally, synsets can be related to each other by the conceptual-semantic relations of hyperonymy/ hyponymy, holonymy/meronymy, entailment and cause, and the lexical relation of antonymy.",
        "In the example, taken from WN.Pr (2.1), the synset {car; auto; automobile; machine; motorcar} is related to:",
        "(i) more general concepts or the hyperonym syn-set: {motor vehicle; automotive vehicle};",
        "(ii) more specific concepts or hyponym synsets: e.g. {cruiser; squad car; patrol car; police car; prowl car} and {cab; taxi; hack; taxicab}; and",
        "(iii) parts it is composed of: e.g. {bumper}; {car door}, {car mirror} and {car window}.",

        "The TermiNet (\"Terminological WordNet\") project started in September 2009 and shall be finished finish in August 2011.",
        "It has been developed in the laboratory of the Research Group of Terminology (GETerm) in Federal University of Sào Carlos (UFSCar) with the collaboration of the Interinstitutional Center for Research and Development in Computational Linguistics(NILC/University of Sào Paulo) researchers.",
        "The TermiNet project has two main objectives.",
        "The first is to instantiate the generic NLP methodology, proposed by Dias-da-Silva (2006), for developing terminological databases according to the WN.Pr model.",
        "Such methodology distinguishes itself by conciliating the linguistic and computational facets of the NLP researches.",
        "The second is to apply the instantiated methodology to build a terminological wordnet or terminet in BP, since BP is a resource-poor language in NLP for which domain-specific databases in wordnet format have not been built yet.",
        "It is important to emphasize that the main terminological resources in BP, which are available through the OntoLP website, are in fact (formal) ontologies or taxonomies.",
        "There is no nological WordNet-like database in BP.",
        "In order to achieve its objectives, TermiNet has, apart from the project leader (Prof. Ariani Di Fe-lippo), an interdisciplinary team that includes six undergraduate students: five from Linguistics and one from Computer Science courses.",
        "The Linguistics students are responsible for specific linguistic tasks in the project, such as: (i) corpus compilation, (ii) candidate terms extraction, (iii) synonymy identification, and (iv) semantic-conceptual relations extraction (hypernymy/hyponymy).",
        "The res-ponsability of the Computer Science student is to support the automatic processing related to the linguistic (e.g., tagging, parsing, term extraction, etc.)",
        "and linguistic-computational domains during the initial stages of the project.",
        "Moreover, the project counts with the collaboration of four PhD researchers from NILC.",
        "Specifically, TermiNet has the support of Prof. Gladis Maria de Barcellos Almeida, a specialist in terminological research and the coordinator of GETerm; Prof. Maria da Graças Volpe Nunes, the coordinator of NILC and one of the most important Brazilian NLP researchers; Prof. Sandra Aluisio, a specialist in corpus construction, and Prof. Thiago Pardo, who has interests in the development of lexical resources for the automatic processing of BP.",
        "Based on Expert Systems development, Dias-da-Silva (2006) established a three-domain approach methodology to develop any research in NLP domain, assuming a compromise between Human Language Technology and Linguistics (Dias-da-Silva, 1998).",
        "The linguistic-related information to be computationally modeled is likened to a rare metal.",
        "So, it must be \"mined\", \"molded\", and \"assembled\" into a computer-tractable system (Durkin, 1994).",
        "Accordingly, the processes of designing and implementing a terminet lexical database have to be developed in the following complementary domains: the linguistic domain, the linguistic-computational domain, and implementational or computational domain.",
        "(a) The Linguistic-related Domain In this domain, the lexical resources and the lexical-conceptual knowledge are mined.",
        "More specifically, the research activities in the linguistic domain are divided in two processes: the selection of the lexical resources for building the terminet database, and the specification of the lexical-conceptual knowledge that characterize a terminet.",
        "The linguist starts off these procedures by delimitating the specialized domain that will be encoded in wordnet format.",
        "According to Almeida and Correia (2008), dealing with an entire specialized domain is a very problematic task because the domains (e.g.: Materials Engineering) in general are composed of subdomains (e.g.: Ceramic Materials, Polymers and Metals) with different characteristics, generating a large universe of sources from which the lexical-conceptual knowledge will have to be mined.",
        "Consequently, the authors present some criteria that may lead to delimitate a specialized domain: (i) the interest of the domain experts by terminological products (in this case, by a terminet); (ii) the relevance of the domain in the educational, social, political, economic, scientific and/or technological scenarios, and (iii) the availability of specialized resources in digital format from which the lexical-conceptual knowledge will be extracted.",
        "After delimitating the domain, it is necessary to select the lexical resources describe in (iii).",
        "According to Rigau (1998), the two main sources of information for building wide-coverage lexicons for NLP systems are: structured resources (e.g.: conventional monolingual and bilingual dictionaries, thesauri, taxonomies, vocabularies, etc.)",
        "and unstructured resources (i.e., corpora).",
        "Due to the unavailability of reusing structured resources, the corpora have become the main source of lexical knowledge (Nascimento, 2003; Agbago and Barrière, 2005; Cabré et al., 2005; Almeida, 2006).",
        "The increasing use of corpora in terminological researches is also due to the fact that \"el carâcter de término nose da per se, sino en funcion del uso de una unidad léxica en un contex-to expresivo y situacional determinado\" (Cabré, 1999: 124).",
        "Thus, in the TermiNet project, the cor- pus is considered the main lexical resource that can be used to construct a terminet.",
        "Although there are available several specialized corpora, the development of a terminet of certain domains may require the compilation of a corpus.",
        "Based on the assumptions of Corpus Linguistics (Aluisio and Alemida, 2007), the construction of a corpus must follow three steps: (i) the corpus projection, i.e., the specification of the corpus typology according to the research purposes; (ii) the compilation of the texts that will compose the corpus, and (iii) the preprocessing of the corpus (i.e., conversion, clean-up, manipulation, and annotation of the texts).",
        "From the corpus, the specialized knowledge will be extracted, i.e., the terminological units (or terms), the lexical relations, and the conceptual-semantic relations.",
        "As mentioned in previous sections, the lexical units are organized into four syntactic categories in WN.Pr: verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Given the relevance of nouns in the organization of any terminology (i.e., the set of all terms related to a given subject field or discipline), we decided to restrict the construction of a terminet to the category of nouns.",
        "In other words, a terminet database, in principle, will only contain information about concepts lexicalized by nouns.",
        "Additionally, it will only encode the hyperonymy/hyponymy relations, which are the most important conceptual-semantic relations between nouns.",
        "The co-text sentence for each word-form in a synset and the concept gloss for each synset will not be focused in building a terminet.",
        "As the TermiNet a corpus-based project, we will apply approaches and strategies to automatically recognize and extract candidate terms and relations from corpus.",
        "In order to better understand the automatic candidate terms and extraction, it can be useful to identify two mainstream approaches to the problem.",
        "In the first approach, statistical measures have been proposed to define the degree of termhood of candidate terms, i.e., to find appropriate measures that can help in selecting good terms from a list of candidates.",
        "In the second approach, computational terminologists have tried to define, identify and recognize terms looking at pure linguistic properties, using linguistic filtering techniques aiming to identify specific syntactic term patterns (Bernhard, 2006; Pazienza et al., 2005; Cabré et al., 2001).",
        "Once extrated, the candidate terms have be validated.",
        "Two validation estrategies will be considered in the TermiNet project.",
        "The first strategy consists on manually validating by domain experts.",
        "The second consists on automatically comparing the list of candidate terms with a list of lexical unities extracted from a general corpus in BP.",
        "The automatic acquisition of hyper-onym/hyponymy relation from corpus is commonly based on linguistic methods.",
        "These methods look for linguistic clues that indisputably indicate the relation of interest (Hearst, 1992).",
        "The linguistic clues are basically lexico-syntactic patters such as: [NP such {NP,}*{(or|and)} NP] (e.g., \"works by such authors as Herrick, and Shakespeare\").",
        "The hierarchical relations extrated from corpus are commonly validated by domain experts.",
        "(b) The Linguistic-Computational Domain",
        "In this domain, the overall information selected and organized in the preceding domain is molded into a computer-tractable representation; in the case of a WordNet-like database, the computer-tractable representation is based on the notions of: • word form - a orthographic representation of an individual word or a string of individual words joined with underscore characters; synset - a set of words built on the basis of the notion of synonymy in context, i.e. word interchangeability in some context; lexical matrix - associations of sets of word forms and the concepts they lexicalize; relational pointers - formal representations of the relations between the word forms in a syn-set and other synsets; synonymy of word forms is implicit by inclusion in the same synset; hyperonymy always relates one synset to another, and is an example of a semantic relation; hyperonymy, in particular, is represented by reflexive pointers (i.e., if a synset contains a pointer to another synset, the other synset should contain a corresponding reflexive pointer back to the original synset).",
        "(c) The Computational Domain",
        "In this domain, the computer-tractable representations are assembled by utilities (i.e., a computational tool to create and edit lexical knowledge).",
        "In other words, it is generated, in this domain, the terminet database.",
        "The software tool that we will use to generate the terminet database is under investigation."

        "The number of students in DE courses has grown 24.9% in relation to 2006.",

        "Despite the relevance of the DE in the Brazilian educational (and political) scenario, there is no a lexical-conceptual representation of this domain, especially in a machine-readable format.",
        "Consequently, the instantiated methodology will be validated by building DE.WordNet (DE.WN), a specialized wordnet of the Distance Education (or Distance Learning) domain in BP.",

        "The corpus typology in the TermiNet project was specified based on: (i) the conception of \"corpus\", (ii) the type of lexical resource to be built, and (iii) the project decisions (Di Felippo and Souza, 2009).",
        "The corpus definition or conception is commonly related to three criteria: representativeness, balance and authenticity.",
        "According to the representativeness criterion, we have been compiled a representative corpus of the DE domain.",
        "There have been many attempts to set the size, or at least establish a minimum number of texts, from which a specialized corpus may be compiled.",
        "To satisfy the representativeness criterion, we have been constructed a medium-large corpus, with at least 1 million of words.",
        "In a specialized corpus, it is important to gather texts from different genres (i.e. technical-scientific, scientific divulgation, instructional, informative, and technical-administrative) and media (i.e, newswire, books, periodicals, etc.).",
        "Following the balance and authenticity criteria, we have been constructed a corpus with a balanced number of real texts per genre.",
        "Besides, the format of the lexical database (i.e. a terminet) determined some characteristics of the corpus.",
        "Specifically, the corpus has to be syn-chronic/ contemporary, since a wordnet (terminological or not) encodes synchronic lexical-conceptual knowledge.",
        "The corpus has only to store written texts, since wordnets are lingwares for written language processing.",
        "Finally, the corpus in the TermiNet project has only to store texts from a specialized domain and in one language.",
        "Additionally, some project decisions determined other characteristics of the corpus.",
        "Two initial decisions in the project were: (i) to apply semiautomatic methods of lexical-conceptual knowledge extraction, and (ii) to share the resources and results of the TermiNet project with Computational Linguistics community.",
        "As a consequency of the project decision described in (i), the corpus will be annotated with part-of-speech (PoS) information, since some automatic extraction methods require it.",
        "As a consequency of the decision presented in (ii), the corpus will be available and usable as widely as possible on the web.",
        "Finally, we also decided that once the corpus has been assembled, it will not be changed until the first version of DE.WN is ready.",

        "Specifically, the corpus compilation comprises two processes: (i) the selection of resources and (ii) the collect of texts from these resources.",
        "In the TermiNet project, the web is the main source for collecting texts of DE.",
        "The choice of web reflects the fact that web has become an unprecedented and virtually inexhaustible source of authentic natural language data for researchers in linguistics.",
        "Although there are many computational tools that assist in gathering a considerable amount of texts on the web, the selection/collection of texts has been followed a manual process, which is composed of three steps: (i) to access a webpage whose content is important for compiling the corpus, (ii) to search the texts on the webpage by search queries as \"distance education\" and \"distance learning\", and (iii) to save the text files on the computer.",
        "In the preprocessing step, the text files in a non-machine readable format (e.g. pdf) are manually converted to text format (txt), which is readable by machines.",
