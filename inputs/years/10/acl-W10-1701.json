        "Word alignment is used in various natural language processing applications, and most statistical machine translation systems rely on word alignment as a preprocessing step.",
        "Traditionally the word alignment model is trained in an unsupervised manner, e.g. the most widely used tool GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), which implements the IBM Models (Brown et.",
        "al., 1993) and the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "However, for language pairs such as Chinese-English, the word alignment quality is often unsatisfactory (Guzman et al., 2009).",
        "There has been increasing interest on using manual alignments in word alignment tasks.",
        "Ittycheriah and Roukos (2005) proposed to use only manual alignment links in a maximum entropy model.",
        "A number of semi-supervised word aligners are proposed (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006; Niehues and Vogel, 2008; Taskar et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Moore, 2005).",
        "These approaches use held-out manual alignments to tune the weights for discriminative models, with the model parameters, model scores or alignment links from unsupervised word aligners as features.",
        "Also, several models are proposed to address the problem of improving generative models with small amount of manual data, including Model 6 (Och and Ney, 2003) and the model proposed by Fraser and Marcu (2006) and its extension called LEAF aligner (Fraser and Marcu, 2007).",
        "The approaches use labelled data to tune parameters to combine different components of the IBM Models.",
        "An interesting question is, if we only have partial alignments of sentences, can we make use of them?",
        "Figure 1 shows the comparison of partial alignments (the bold link) and full alignments (both of the dashed and the bold links).",
        "A partial alignment of a sentence only provides a portion of links of the full alignment.",
        "Although it seems to be trivial, they actually convey different information.",
        "In the example, if the full alignment is given, we can assert 2005 is only aligned to 2005nian, not to de or xiatian, but if only the partial alignment is given we cannot make such assertion.",
        "Partial alignments can be obtained from various sources, for example, we can fetch them by manually correcting unsupervised alignments, by simple heuristics such as dictionaries of technical terms, by rule-based alignment systems that have high accuracy but low recall rate.",
        "The functionality is considered useful in many scenarios.",
        "For example, the researchers can analyse the alignments generated by GIZA++ and fix common error patterns, and perform training again.",
        "On another way, an application can combine active learning (Arora et al., 2009) and crowdsourcing, asking non-expertise such as workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk to label crucial alignment links that can improve the system with low cost, which is now a promising methodology in NLP areas (Callison-Burch, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised extension of the IBM Models that can utilize partial alignment links.",
        "More specifically, we are seeking answers for the following questions:",
        "• Given the partial alignment of a sentence, how to find the most probable alignment that is consistent with the partial alignment.",
        "• Given a set of partially aligned sentences, how to get the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the sentence pairs with alignments consistent with the partial alignments",
        "• Given a set of partially aligned sentences, with conflicting partial alignments, how to answer the two questions above.",
        "In the proposed approach, the manual partial alignment links are treated as ground truth, therefore, they will be fixed.",
        "However, for all other links we make no additional assumption.",
        "When using manual alignments, there can be links conflicting with each other.",
        "These conflicting evidences are treated as options and the generative model will choose the most probable alignment from them.",
        "An efficient training algorithm for fertility-based models is proposed.",
        "The algorithm manipulates the Moving and Swapping matrices used in the hill-climbing algorithm (Och and Ney, 2003) to rule out inconsistent alignments in both E-step and M-step of the training.",
        "A similar attempt has been made by Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2004), where the authors interpolate the parameters estimated by sentence-aligned and word-aligned corpus.",
        "Our approach is different from their method that we do not require fully aligned data and we do not need to interpolate two parameter sets.",
        "All the training is done within a unified framework.",
        "Our approach is also different from LEAF (Fraser and Marcu, 2007) and Model 6 (Och and Ney, 2003) that we do not use these additional links to tune additional parameters to combine model components, as a result, it is not limited to fully aligned corpus.",
        "A question may raise why the proposed method is superior over using the partial alignment links as features in discriminative aligners?",
        "There are three possible explanations.",
        "First, the method preserves the power of the generative model in which the algorithm utilizes large amount of unlabeled data.",
        "More importantly, the additional information can propagate over the whole corpus through better estimation of model parameters.",
        "In contrast, if we use the alignment links in discriminative aligners as a feature, one link can only affect the particular word, or at most the sentence.",
        "Second, although the discriminative word alignment methods provide flexibility to utilize labeled data, most of them still rely on generative aligners.",
        "Some rely on the model parameters of the IBM Models (Liu et al., 2005; Blunsom and Cohn, 2006), others rely on the alignment links from GIZA++ as features or as training data (Taskar et al., 2005), or use both the model parameters and the alignment links (Niehues and Vogel, 2008).",
        "Therefore, improving the generative aligner is still important even when using discriminative aligners.",
        "Third, these methods require full alignment of sentences to provide positive (aligned) and negative (non-aligned) information, which limits the availability of data (Niehues and Vogel, 2008).",
        "The proposed method has been successfully applied on various tasks, such as utilizing manual alignments harvested from Amazon Mechanical Turk (Gao and Vogel, 2010), and active learning methods for improving word alignment (Ambati et al., 2010).",
        "This paper provides the detailed algorithm of the method and controlled experiments to demonstrate its behavior.",
        "The paper is organized as follows, in section 2 we describe the proposed model as well as the modified training algorithm.",
        "Section 3 presents two approaches of obtaining manual alignment links, The experimental results will be shown in section 4.",
        "We conclude the paper in section 5."

        "In this study, our major contribution is a novel generative model extended from IBM Model 4 to utilize partial manual alignments.",
        "The proposed method enables us to efficiently enforce subtle alignment constraints into the EM training.",
        "We performed experiments on manually aligned corpora to prove the validity.",
        "We also demonstrated using the method with simple heuristics to boost the translation quality on moderate size unlabelled corpus.",
        "The results show that our method is effective in promoting the word alignment qualities with small amounts of partial alignments and with high-precision-low-recall heuristics.",
        "Also the method of using dictionary to generate manual alignment links showed an average improvement of 0.35 BLEU points across 8 test sets.",
        "The algorithm has small impact on the speed of GIZA++, and can easily be added to current multi-thread implementation of GIZA++.",
        "Therefore it is suitable for large scale training.",
