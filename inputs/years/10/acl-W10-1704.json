        "As German is morphologically more complex than English, the default policy which consists in treating each word form independently from the others is plagued with data sparsity, which poses a number of difficulties both at training and decoding time.",
        "When aligning parallel texts at the word level, German compound words typically tend to align with more than one English word; this, in turn, tends to increase the number of possible translation counterparts for each English type, and to make the corresponding alignment scores less reliable.",
        "In decoding, new compounds or unseen morphological variants of existing words artificially increase the number out-of-vocabulary (OOV) forms, which severely hurts the overall translation quality.",
        "Several researchers have proposed normalization (Niessen and Ney, 2004; Corston-oliver and Gamon, 2004; Goldwa-ter and McClosky, 2005) and compound splitting (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Stymne, 2008; Stymne, 2009) methods.",
        "Our approach here is similar, yet uses different implementations; we also studied the joint effect of combining both techniques.",
        "In German, determiners, pronouns, nouns and adjectives carry inflection marks (typically suffixes) so as to satisfy agreement constraints.",
        "Inflections vary according to gender, case, and number information.",
        "For instance, the German definite determiner could be marked in sixteen different ways according to the possible combinations of genders (3), case (4) and number (2), which are fused in six different tokens der, das, die, den, dem, des.",
        "With the exception of the plural and genitive cases, all these words translate to the same English word: the.",
        "In order to reduce the size of the German vocabulary and to improve the robustness of the alignment probabilities, we considered various normalization strategies for the different word classes.",
        "In a nutshell, normalizing amounts to collapsing several German forms of a given lemma into a unique representative, using manually written normalization patterns.",
        "A pattern typically specifies which forms of a given morphological paradigm should be considered equivalent when translating into English.",
        "These normalization patterns use the lemma information computed by the TreeTagger and the fine-grained POS information computed by the RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), which uses a tagset containing approximately 800 tags.",
        "Table 1 displays the analysis of an example sentence.",
        "In most cases, normalization patterns replace a word form by its lemma; in order to partially preserve some inflection marks, we introduced two generic suffixes, +s and +en which respectively denote plural and genitive wherever needed.",
        "Typical normalization rules take the following form:",
        "• For articles, adjectives, and pronouns (Indefinite , possessive, demonstrative, relative and reflexive), if a token has;",
        "- Genitive case: replace with lemma+en (Ex.",
