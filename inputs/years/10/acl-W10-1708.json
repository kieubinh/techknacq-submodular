        "In recent years the quality of machine translation (MT) output has improved greatly, although each paradigm suffers from its own particular kind of errors: statistical machine translation (SMT) often shows poor syntax, while rule-based engines (RBMT) experience a lack in vocabulary.",
        "Hybrid systems try to avoid these typical errors by combining techniques from both paradigms in a most useful manner.",
        "In this paper we present the improved version of the hybrid system we developed last year's shared task (Federmann et al., 2009).",
        "We take the output from an RBMT engine as basis for our hybrid translations and substitute noun phrases by translations from an SMT engine.",
        "Even though a general increase in quality could be observed, our system introduced errors of its own during the substitution process.",
        "In an internal error analysis, these degradations were classified as follows:",
        "- the translation by the SMT engine is incorrect",
        "- the structure degrades through substitution (because of e.g. capitalization errors, double prepositions, etc.)",
        "- the phrase substitution goes astray (caused by alignment problems, etc.)",
        "Errors of the first class cannot be corrected, as we have no way of knowing when the translation by the SMT engine is incorrect.",
        "The other two classes could be eliminated, however, by introducing additional steps for pre-and post-processing as well as improving the hybrid algorithm itself.",
        "Our current error analysis based on the results of this year's shared task does not show these types of errors anymore.",
        "Additionally, we extended our coverage to also include the language pairs English^French and English^Spanish in both directions as well as English^German, compared to last year's initial experiments for German^English only.",
        "We were able to achieve an increase in translation quality for this language set, which shows that the substitution method works for different language configurations."

        "Our hybrid translation system takes translation output from a) the Lucy RBMT system (Alonso and Thurmair, 2003) and b) a Moses-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "We then identify noun phrases inside the rule-based translation and compute the most likely correspondences in the statistical translation output.",
        "For these, we apply a factored substitution method that decides whether the original RBMT phrase should be kept or rather be replaced by the Moses phrase.",
        "As this shallow substitution process may introduce problems at phrase boundaries, we afterwards perform several post-processing steps to cleanup and finalize the hybrid translation result.",
        "A schematic overview of our hybrid system and its main components is given in figure 1.",
        "Lucy RBMT System We obtain the translation as well as linguistic structures from the RBMT system.",
        "An internal evaluation has shown that these structures are usually of a high quality which supports our initial decision to consider the RBMT output as an appropriate \"template\" for our hybrid translation approach.",
        "The Lucy translation output can include additional markup that allows to identify unknown words or other, local phenomena.",
        "The Lucy system is a transfer-based MT system that performs translation in three phases, namely analysis, transfer, and generation.",
        "Intermediate tree structures for each of the translation phases can be extracted from the Lucy system to guide the hybrid system.",
        "Sadly, only the 1-best path through these three phases is given, so no alternative translation possibilities can be extracted from the given data; a fact that clearly limits the potential for more deeply integrated hybrid translation approaches.",
        "Nevertheless, the availability of the 1-best trees already allows to improve the translation quality of the RBMT system as we will show in this paper.",
        "Moses SMT System We used a state-of-the-art Moses SMT system to create statistical phrase-based translations of our input text.",
        "Moses has been modified so that it returns the translation results together with the bidirectional word alignments between the source texts and the translations.",
        "Again, we make use of markup which helps to identify unknown words as these will later guide the factored substitution method.",
        "Both of the translation models and the language models within our SMT systems were only trained with lowercased and tokenized Europarl training data.",
        "The system used sets of feature weights determined using data sets also from Europarl (test2008).",
        "In addition, we used LDC gigaword corpus to train large scale n-gram language models to be used in our hybrid system.",
        "We tokenized the source texts using the standard tokenizers available from the shared task website.",
        "The SMT translations are re-cased before being fed into the hybrid system together with the word alignment information.The hybrid system can easily be adapted to support other statistical translation engines.",
        "If the alignment information is not available, a suitable alignment tool would be necessary to compute it as the alignment is a key requirement for the hybrid system.",
        "We compute alignment in several components of the hybrid system, namely:",
        "source-text-to-tree: we first find an alignment between the source text and the corresponding analysis tree(s).",
        "As Lucy tends to subdivide large sentences into several smaller units, it sometimes becomes necessary to align more than one tree structure to a given source sentence.",
        "analysis-transfer-generation: for each of the analysis trees, we reconstruct the path from its tree nodes, via the transfer tree, and their corresponding generation tree nodes.",
        "tree-to-target-text: similarly to the first alignment process, we find a mapping between generation tree nodes and the actual translation output of the RBMT system.",
        "source-text-to-tokenized: as the Lucy RBMT system works on non-tokenized input text and our Moses system takes tokenized input, we need to align the source text to its tokenized form.",
        "Given the aforementioned alignments, we can then correlate phrases from the rule-based translation with their counterparts from the statistical translation, both on source or target side.",
        "As our hybrid approach relies on the identification of such phrase pairs, the computation of the different alignments is critical to obtain good combination performance.",
        "Please note that all these tree-based alignments can be computed with a very high accuracy.",
        "However, due to the nature of statistical word alignment, the same does not hold for the alignment obtained from the Moses system.",
        "If the alignment process has produced erroneous phrase tables, it is very likely that Lucy phrases and their \"aligned\" SMT matches simply will not fit.",
        "Or put the other way round: the better the underlying SMT word alignment, the greater the potential of the hybrid substitution approach.",
        "Given the results of the alignment process, we can then identify \"interesting\" phrases for substitution.",
        "Following our experimental setup from last year's shared task, we again decided to focus on noun phrases as these seem to be best-suited for in-place swapping of phrases.",
        "Our initial assumption is that SMT phrases are better on a lexical level, hence we aim to replace Lucy's noun phrases by their Moses counterparts.",
        "Still, we want to perform the substitution in a controlled manner in order to avoid problems or non-matching insertions.",
        "For this, we have (manually) derived a set of factors that are checked for each of the phrase pairs that are processed.",
        "The factors are described briefly below:",
        "identical?",
        "simply checks whether two candidate phrases are identical.",
        "too complex?",
        "a Lucy phrase is \"too complex\" to substitute if it contains more than 2 embedded noun phrases.",
        "many-to-one?",
        "this factor checks if a Lucy phrase containing more than one word is mapped to a Moses phrase with only one token.",
        "contains pronoun?",
        "checks if the Lucy phrase contains a pronoun.",
        "contains verb?",
        "checks if the Lucy phrase contains a verb.",
        "unknown?",
        "checks whether one of the phrases is marked as \"unknown\".",
        "length mismatch computes the number of words for both phrases and checks if the absolute difference is too large.",
        "language model computes language model scores for both phrases and checks which is more likely according to the LM.",
        "All of these factors have been designed and adjusted during an internal development phase using data from previous shared tasks.",
        "After the hybrid translation has been computed, we perform several post-processing steps to clean up and finalize the result:",
        "cleanup first, we perform basic cleanup operations such as whitespace normalization, capitalizing the first word in each sentence, etc.",
        "multi-words then, we take care of proper handling of multi-word expressions.",
        "Using the tree structures from the RBMT system we eliminate superfluous whitespace and join multi-words, even if they were separated in the SMT phrase.",
        "prepositions finally, we give prepositions a special treatment.",
        "Experience from last year's shared task had shown that things like double prepositions contributed to a large extent to the amount of avoidable errors.",
        "We tried to circumvent this class of error by identifying the correct prepositions; erroneous prepositions are removed."
