        "Our word lattices are similar to those used by Dyer et al.",
        "(2008) for handling word segmentation in Chinese and Arabic.",

        "While the models permit some local reordering, systematic differences in word order involving movements of more than a few words pose major problems.",
        "In particular, Statistical Machine Translation between German and English is notoriously impacted by the different fundamental word order in subordinate clauses, where German Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order contrasts with English Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order.",
        "In our English-German system, we made the observation that the verb in an SVO subordinate clause following a punctuation mark frequently gets moved before the preceding punctuation.",
        "This movement is triggered by the German language model, which prefers verbs preceding punctuation as consistent with SOV order, and it is facilitated by the fact that the distance from the verb to the end of the preceding clause is often smaller than the distance to the end of the current phrase, so moving the verb backwards results in a better score from the distance-based reordering model.",
        "This tendency can be counteracted effectively by enabling the Moses decoder's monotone-at-punctuation feature, which makes sure that words are not reordered across punctuation marks.",
        "The result is a modest gain from 14.28 to 14.38 BLEU points ( ).",
        "In the German-English system, we applied a chunk-based technique to produce lattices representing multiple permutations ofthe test sentences in order to enable long-range reorderings of verb phrases.",

        "There are three important features specific to the FBK systems at WMT 2010: mixtures of large language models, German morphological reduction and decompounding and word reordering.",
        "Our approach to using large language models proved successful at the 2009 NIST MT evaluation.",
        "In the present evaluation, its effectiveness was reduced by a number of technical problems, which were mostly due to the limitations of disk access throughput in our parallel computing environment.",
        "We are working on methods to reduce and distribute disk accesses to large language models, which will be implemented in the IRSTLM language modelling toolkit (Federico et al., 2008).",
        "By doing so, we hope to overcome the current limitations and exploit the power of language model mixtures more fully.",
        "The Gertwol-based morphological reduction and decompounding component we used is a working solution that results in a significant improvement in translation quality.",
        "It is an alternative to the popular statistical compound splitting methods, such as the one by Koehn and Knight (2003), incorporating a greater amount of linguistic knowledge and offering morphological reduction even of simplex words to their base form in addition.",
        "It would be interesting to compare the relative performance of the two approaches systematically.",
        "Word reordering between German and English is a complex problem.",
        "Encouraged by the success of chunk-based verb reordering lattices on Arabic-English (Bisazza and Federico, 2010), we tried to adapt the same approach to the German-English language pair.",
        "It turned out that there is a larger variety of long reordering patterns in this case.",
        "Nevertheless, some experiments performed after the official evaluation showed promising results.",
        "We plan to pursue this work in several directions: Defining a lattice weighting scheme that distinguishes between original word order and reordering paths could help the decoder select the more promising path through the lattice.",
        "Applying similar reordering rules to the training corpus would reduce the mismatch between the training data and the reordered input sentences.",
        "Finally, it would be useful to explore the impact of different distortion limits on the decoding of reordering lattices in order to find an optimal trade-off between decoder-driven short-range and lattice-driven long-range reordering.",
