        "Our phrase-based translation system is similar to the one described in (Zens and Ney, 2008).",
        "Phrase pairs are extracted from a word-aligned bilingual corpus and their translation probability in both directions is estimated by relative frequencies.",
        "Additional models include a standard n-gram language model, phrase-level IBM1, word-, phrase-and distortion-penalties and a discriminative reordering model as described in (Zens and Ney, 2006).",
        "Our hierarchical phrase-based system is similar to the one described in (Chiang, 2007).",
        "It allows for gaps in the phrases by employing a context-free grammar and a CYK-like parsing during the decoding step.",
        "It has similar features as the phrase-based system mentioned above.",
        "For some systems, we only allowed the non-terminals in hierarchical phrases to be substituted with initial phrases as in (Iglesias et al., 2009), which gave better results on some language pairs.",
        "We will refer to this as \"shallow rules\".",

        "(2006).",
        "Several improvements have been added later (Matusov et al., 2008).",
        "This approach includes an enhanced alignment and reordering framework.",
        "Alignments between the systems are learned by GIZA++, a one-to-one alignment is generated from the learned state occupation probabilities.",
        "From these alignments, a confusion network (CN) is then built using one of the hypotheses as \"skeleton\" or \"primary\" hypothesis.",
        "We do not make a hard decision on which of the hypotheses to use for that, but instead combine all possible CNs into a single lattice.",
        "Majority voting on the generated lattice is performed using the prior probabilities for each system as well as other statistical models such as a special trigram language model.",
        "This language model is also learned on the input hypotheses.",
        "The intention is to favor longer phrases contained in individual hypotheses.",
        "The translation with the best total score within this lattice is selected as consensus translation.",
        "Scaling factors of these models are optimized similar to MERT using the Downhill Simplex algorithm.",
        "As the objective function for this optimization, we selected a linear combination of BLEU and TER with a weight of 2 on the former; a combination that has proven to deliver stable results on several MT evaluation measures in preceding experiments.",
        "In contrast to previous years, we now include a separate consensus true casing step to exploit the true casing capabilities of some of the input systems: After generating a (lower cased) consensus translation from the CN, we sum up the counts of different casing variants of each word in a sentence over the input hypotheses, and use the majority casing over those.",
        "In previous experiments, this showed to work significantly better than using a fixed non-consensus true caser, and maintains flexibility on the input systems."

        "The phrase alignment is produced by a modified version of the translation decoder.",

        "Nevertheless, systems with triplets were used for system combination, as extended lexicon models often help to predict content words and to capture long-range dependencies.",
        "Thus they can help to find a strong consensus hypothesis.",
        "Due to the small size of the English^German resources available for language modeling as well as for lexicon extraction, we decided to apply the unsupervised adaptation suggested in (Schwenk and Senellart, 2009).",
        "We use a baseline SMT system to translate in-domain monolingual source data, filter the translations according to a decoder score normalized by sentence length, add this synthetic bilingual data to the original one and rebuild the SMT system from scratch.",
        "The motivation behind the method is that the phrase table will adapt to the genre, and thus let phrases which are domain related have higher probabilities.",
