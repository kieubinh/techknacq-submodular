        "For example, sentence pairs with numerous numbers, non-alphanumeric characters or words starting with capital letters were removed.",
        "Moreover, training material was tokenized with the tool provided for the workshop and truecased, meaning that the words occuring after a strong punctuation mark were lowercased when they belonged to a dictionary of common all-lowercased forms; the others were left unchanged.",
        "In order to reduce the number of words unknown to the translation models, all numbers were serialized, i.e. mapped to a special unique token.",
        "The original numbers are then placed back in the translation in the same order as they appear in the source sentence.",
        "Since translations are mostly monotonic between French and English, this simple algorithm works well most of the time.",
        "We trained Kneser-Ney discounted 5-gram language models (LMs) on each available corpus using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "These",
        "LMs were combined through linear interpolation: first, an out-of-domain LM was built from Europari, un and gw; then, this model was combined with the two in-domain LMs trained on news-commentary and news.shuffled, which will be referred to as nc and ns in the remainder of the article.",
        "Weights were fixed by optimizing the perplexity of a development corpus made of",
        "news-test2008 and news-syscomb2009 texts.",
        "In order to reduce the size of the LMs, we limited the vocabulary of our models to 1 M words for English and French.",
        "The words of these vocabularies were selected from the computation of the number of their occurences using the method proposed by Venkataraman and Wang (2003).",
        "The out-of-vocabulary rate measured on news-test2009 and news-test2010 with a so-built vocabulary varies between 0.6 % and 0.8 % for both English and French, while it was between 0.4 % and 0.7 % before the vocabulary was pruned.",
        "To train the LM on the 48 M-sentence English ns corpus, 32 Gb RAM were required and up to 16 Gb RAM, for the other corpora.",
        "To reduce the memory needs during decoding, LMs were pruned using the SRILM prune option.",
        "All parallel corpora were aligned with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",

        "Weights of LM, phrase table and lexicalized reordering model scores were optimized on the development corpus thanks to the MERT algorithm (Och, 2003).",
        "This section reports experiments done on the news-test20 0 9 corpus for testing various configurations.",
        "In these first experiments, we trained LMs and translation models on the Europarl corpus.",
        "Case We tested two methods to handle case.",
        "The first one lowercases all training data and documents to translate, while the second one normalizes all training data and documents into their natural case.",
        "These two methods require a postprocessing recapitalization but this last step is more basic for the truecase method.",
        "Training models on lowercased material led to a 23.15 % case-insensitive BLEU and a 21.61 % case-sensitive BLEU; from truecased corpora, we obtained a 23.24% case-insensitive BLEU and a 22.13% case-sensitive BLEU.",
        "As truecasing induces an increase of the two metrics, we built all our models in truecase.",
        "The results shown in the remainder of this paper are reported in terms of case-insensitive BLEU which showed last year a better correlation with human judgments than case-sensitive BLEU for the two languages we consider (Callison-Burch et al., 2009).",
        "Tokenization Two tokenizers were tested: one provided for the workshop and another we developed.",
        "They differ mainly in the processing ofcom-pound words: our in-house tokenizer splits these words (e.g. percentage-wise is turned into percentage - wise), which improves the lexical coverage of the models trained on the corpus.",
        "This feature does not exist in the WMT tool.",
        "However, using the WMT tokenizer, we measured a 23.24% BLEU, while our in-house tokenizer yielded a lower BLEU of 22.85 %.",
        "Follow these results prompted us to use the WMT tokenizer.",
        "Serialization In order to test the effect of serialization, i.e. the mapping of all numbers to a special unique token, we measured the BLEU score obtained by a PBM trained on Europarl for English-French, when numbers are left unchanged (Table 1, line 1) or serialized (line 2).",
        "These results exhibit a slight decrease of BLEU when serialization is performed.",
        "Moreover, if BLEU is computed using a serialized reference (line 3), which is equivalent to ignoring deserialization errors, a minor gain of BLEU is observed, which validates our recovering method.",
        "Since resorting to serialization/deserialization yields comparable performance to a system not using it, while reducing the model's size, we chose to use it.",
