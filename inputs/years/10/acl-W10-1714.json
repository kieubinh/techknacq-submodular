      "text": [
        "The European Union's policy on multilingualism requires enormous amounts of documents to be translated into the 23 official languages (which yield 506 translation directions).",
        "To cope with this task, the EU has the biggest translation service in the world, employing almost 5000 internal staff as translators (out of which 1750 at the European Commission (EC) and 760 at the European Parliament (EP) alone), backed up by more than 2000 support staff.",
        "In 2009, the total output of the Commission's Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) and the Parliament's Directorate-General for Translation (DG TRAD) together was more than 3 million translated pages.",
        "Thus, it is not surprising that the cost of all translation and interpreting services of all the EU institutions amounts to 1% of the annual EU budget (2008 figures).",
        "According to our estimations, this is more than =€ 1 billion per year.",
        "Technologies at EU Institutions",
        "In order to make the translators' work more efficient so that they can translate more pages in the same time, a number of tools like terminology databases, bilingual concordancers, and, most importantly, translation memories are at their disposition, most of which are heavily used.",
        "In real translation production scenarios, Machine Translation is usually used to complement translation memory tools (TM tool).",
        "Translation memories are databases that contain text segments (usually sentences) that are stored together with their translations.",
        "Each such pair of source and target language segments is called a translation unit.",
        "Translation units also contain useful meta-data (creation date, document type, client, etc.)",
        "that allow us to filter the data both for translation and machine translation purposes.",
        "A TM tool tries to match the segments within a document that needs to be translated with segments in the translation memory and propose translations.",
        "If the memory contains an identical string then we have a so-called exact or 100% match which yields a very reliable translation.",
        "Approximate or partial matches are called fuzzy matches and usually, the minimum value of a fuzzy match is set to 65%-70%.",
        "Lower matches are not considered as usable since they demand more editing time than typing a translation from scratch.",
        "First experiments have shown that the quality of SMT output for certain language pairs is equal or similar to 70% fuzzy matches.",
        "Consequently, the cases where machine translation can play a helpful role in this context is when, for a segment to be translated, there is no exact match and the available fuzzy matches do not exceed a certain threshold.",
        "This threshold in our case is expected to be 85% or lower.",
        "To this end, there exists a system called ECMT (European Commission Machine Translation; also accessible to other European institutions) which is a rule-based system.",
        "However, only certain translation directions are covered by ECMT, and its maintenance is quite complicated and requires quite a lot of dedicated and specialized human resources.",
        "In the light of these facts and with the addition of the languages of (prospective) new member states, statistical approaches to machine translation seem to offer a viable alternative.",
        "First of all, SMT is data-driven, i.e. it exploits parallel corpora of which there are plenty at the EU institutions in the form of translation memories.",
        "Translation memories have two main advantages over other parallel corpora.",
        "First of all, they contain almost exclusively perfectly aligned segments, as each segment is stored together with its translation, and secondly, they contain cleaner data since their content is regularly maintained by linguists and database administrators.",
        "SMT systems are quicker to develop and easier to maintain than rule-based systems.",
        "The availability of free, open-source software like Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the like constitutes a further argument in their favor.",
        "Early experiments with Moses were started by members of DGT's Portuguese Language Department as early as summer 2008 (Leal Fontes and Machado, 2009), then turned into a wider interinstitutional project with the codename Exodus, currently combining resources from European Commission's DGT and European Parliament's DGTRAD.",
        "Exodus is the first joint project of the interinstitutional Language Technology Watch group where a number of EU institutions join forces in the field of language technology."

      "text": [
        "After the English-Portuguese experiments, the first language pair for which we developed a system with a sizeable amount of training data was English-to-French.",
        "This system has been developed for testing at the European Parliament.",
        "As English-to-French is also one of the eight translation directions evaluated in this year's shared translation task, we decided to participate.",
        "The reasons behind this decision are manifold: We would like to",
        "• know where we stand in comparison to other systems,",
        "• learn about what system adaptations are the most beneficial,",
        "• make our project known to potential collaborators,",

        "There is, however, one major difference between the evaluation as carried out in WMT10 and our in-house evaluation: The test data of WMT10 consists exclusively of news articles and is thus out-of-domain for our system intended for use within the European Parliament.",
        "This means that the impact of training oursystem on the in-domain data we obtain from our translation memories cannot be assessed properly, i.e. taking into consideration our specific translation production needs.",
        "Therefore, we would like to invite other interested groups to also translate our in-domain test data with the goal of seeing how our translation scenario could benefit from their setups.",

        "To build our English-to-French MT system, we did not use any of the data provided by the organizers of the WMT10 shared translation task.",
        "Instead, we used data that was extracted from the translation memories at the core of EURAMIS (European Advanced Multilingual Information System; (Theologitis, 1997; Blatt, 1998)) which are the fruit of thousands of man-years contributed by translators at EU institutions who, each day, upload the majority of the segments they translate.",
        "Initially (before pre-processing), our EN-FR corpus contained 10,446,450 segments and included documents both from the Commission and the EP from common legislative procedures.",
        "These segments were extracted in November 2009 from 7 translation memories hosted in Euramis.",
        "Currently, we do not have information about the exact document types coming from the Commission's databases.",
        "The Parliament's document types used include, among others:",
        "• legislative documents such as draft reports, final reports, amendments, opinions, etc.,",
        "• documents for the plenary such as questions, resolutions or session amendments,",
        "• committee and delegation documents,",
        "• documents concerning the ACP and the EMPA,",
        "• internal documents such as budget estimates, staff regulations, rules of procedure, etc.,",
        "• calls for tender.",
        "Any sensitive or classified documents or Commission-internal documents that do not belong to common legislative procedures have been excluded from the data.",
        "In terms of preprocessing, we performed several steps.",
        "First, we obtained translation memory exchange (TMX) files from EURAMIS and converted them to UTF-8 text as the Euramis native character encoding is UCS-2.",
        "Then we removed certain control characters which otherwise would have halted processing, we extracted the two single-language corpora into a plaintext file, tokenized and lowercased the data.",
        "Finally, we separated the corpus into training data (9,300,682 segments), and data for tuning and testing - 500 segments each.",
        "These segments did not exceed a maximum length of 60 tokens and were excluded from the preparation of the translation and language models.",
        "The models were then trained on the remaining segments.",
        "The maximum length of 60 tokens was applied here as well."

        "This was done on a serverrunning Sun Solaris with 64 GB of RAM and 8 double core CPU's @1800 Mhz (albeit shared with other processes running simultaneously).",
        "In general, we simply used a vanilla Moses installation at this point, leaving the integration of more sophisticated features to a later moment, i.e. after a thorough analysis of the results of the present evaluation campaign when we will know which adaptations yield the most significant improvements.",
        "For the word alignments, we chose MGIZA (Gao and Vogel, 2008), using seven threads per MGIZA instance, with the parallel option, i.e. one MGIZA instance per pair direction running in parallel.",
        "The target language model is a 7-gram, binarized IRSTLM (Federico et al., 2008).",

        "After the actual translation with Moses, an additional recasing \"translation\" model was applied in the same manner.",
        "Finally, the translation output underwent minimal automatic postprocessing based on regular expression replacements.",

        "Then, for each system, a score is computed that tells how often it was ranked equally or better than the other system.",
        "For our system, this score is 32.35%, meaning it ranked 17th out of 19 systems for English-to-French.",
        "A number of automatic scores were also calculated and appear in Table 1.",
        "As the goal behind building our system has been to provide a tool to translators at EU institutions, we have also had it evaluated by two of our colleagues, both",

        "For this purpose, we had 1742 sentences of in-house documents translated by our system as well as by the rule-based ECMT and the statistics-based Google Translate.",
        "We developed an online evaluation tool based on the one used by the WMT evaluation campaign in the last years (Callison-Burch et al., 2009) where we asked the evaluators to perform three different tasks.",
        "In the first one, they were shown the three automatic translations plus a human reference in random order and asked to rank the four versions relative to each other on a scale from 1 to 5.",
        "The average relative ranks can be seen in Table 2.",
        "The second task consisted of post-editing a given translation.",
        "Again, the sentence might come from one of three MT systems, or be a human translation.",
        "The absolute number of items that did not need any corrections, had to be edited, or were impossible to correct are shown in Table 3.",
        "For the third and last task, only translations of our own system were displayed.",
        "Here, the evaluators should simply assign them to one of four quality categories as proposed by (Roturier, 2009), and additionally tick boxes standing for the presence of 13 different types of errors in the sentence concerning word order, punctuation, or different types of syntactic/semantic problems.",
