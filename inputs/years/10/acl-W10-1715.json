        "On average we outperformed our submission from last year by 2.16 bleu points on the same newstest2009 test set.",
        "While the submitted system follows the factored phrase-based approach, we also built hierarchical and syntax-based models for the English-German language pair and report on its performance on the development test sets.",
        "All our systems are based on the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "We achieved gains over the systems from last year by consistently exploiting all available training data, using large-scale domain-interpolated, and consistent use of the factored translation model to integrate n-gram models over speech tags.",
        "We also experimented with novel domain adaptation methods, with mixed results."

      "heading": "2. Baseline System",
      "text": [
        "The baseline system uses all available training data, except for the large UN and 10 corpora, as well as the optional LDC Gigaword corpus.",
        "It uses a straightforward setup of the Moses decoder.",
        "Some relevant parameter settings are:",
        "• maximum sentence length 80 words",
        "• tokenization with hyphen splitting",
        "• truecasing",
        "• grow-diag-final-and alignment heuristic",
        "• msd-bidirectional-fe lexicalized reordering",
        "• interpolated 5-gram language model",
        "• tuning on newsdev2009",
        "• testing during development on newstest2009",
        "• MBR decoding",
        "• no reordering over punctuation",
        "• cube pruning",
        "We used most of these setting in our submission last year (Koehn and Haddow, 2009).",
        "The main difference to our baseline system from the submission from last year is the use of additional training data: larger releases of the News Commentary, Europarl, Czeng, and monolingual news corpora.",
        "The first two parallel corpora increased roughly 10-20% in size, while the Czeng parallel corpus and the monolingual news corpora are five times and twice as big, respectively.",
        "We also handled some of the corpus preparation steps with more care to avoid some data inconsistency problems from last year (affecting mostly the French language pairs).",
        "An overview of the results is given in Table 1.",
        "The baseline outperforms our submission from last year by an average of+1.25 points.",
        "The gains for the individual language pairs track the increase in training data (most significantly for the Czech-English pairs), and the French-English data processing issue.",
        "Note that last year's submission used special handling of the German-English language pair, which we did not replicate in the baseline system, but report on below.",
        "The table also contains results on the extensions discussed in the next section.",
        "French-English Czech-English",
        "Table 1: Overview of results: baseline system and extensions.",
        "On average we outperformed our submission from last year by 1.87 bleu points on the same newstest2009 test set.",
        "For additional gains for French-English and German-English, please see Tables 7 and 8.",
        "Table 2: English LM interpolation: number of tokens, perplexity, and interpolation weight for the different corpora",
        "The WMT training data exhibits an increasing diversity of corpora: Europarl, News Commentary, UN, 10, News – and seven different sources within the Czeng corpus.",
        "It is well known that domain adaptation is an important step in optimizing machine translation systems.",
        "A relatively simple and straightforward method is the linear interpolation of the language model, as we explored previously (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007; Schwenk and Koehn, 2008).",
        "We trained domain-specific language models separately and then linearly interpolated them using SRILM toolkit (Stolke, 2002) with weights optimized on the development set newsdev2009.",
        "See Table 2 for numbers on perplexity, corpus sizes, and interpolation weights.",
        "Note, for instance, the relatively high weight for the News Commentary corpus (0.204) compared to the Eu-roparl corpus (0.105) in the English language model for the French-English system, despite the latter being about 25 times bigger.",
        "As last year, we deal with uppercase and lowercase forms of the same words by truecasing the corpus.",
        "This means that we change each surface word occurrence of a word to its natural case, e.g., the, Europe.",
        "During truecasing, we change the first word of a sentence to its most frequent casing.",
        "During de-truecasing, we uppercase the first letter of the first word of a sentence.",
        "See Table 3 for the performance of this method.",
        "In this table, we compare the cased and uncased bleu scores, and observe that we lose on average roughly one bleu point due to wrong casing.",

        "(2006) applied ideas from language model smoothing to the translation model.",
        "Good Turing smoothing (Good, 1953) uses counts of counts statistics to assess how likely we will see a word (or, in our case, a phrase) again, if we have seen it n times in the training corpus.",
        "Instead of using the raw counts, adapted (lower) counts are used in the estimation of the conditional probability distribution.",
        "The count of counts are collected for the phrase pairs.",
        "See Table 4 for details on how this effects the French-English model.",
        "For instance, we find singleton 357,929,182 phrase pairs and 24,966,751 phrase pairs that occur twice.",
        "The Good Turing formula tells us to adapt singleton counts to 32547,99626^715812 = 0.14.",
        "This means for our degenerate example of a single occurrence of a single French phrase that its single English translation has probability ^y = 0.14 (we do not adjust the denominator).",

        "While we already used the UN data in the language model for the Spanish-English and French-English language pairs, we now also add it to the translation model.",
        "The corpus is very large, four times bigger than the already used training data, but relatively out of domain, as indicated by the high perplexity and low interpolation weight during language model interpolation (recall Table 2).",
        "Adding the corpus to the four systems gives improvements of +0.60 BLEU points on average.",
        "For details refer back to Table 1.",
        "The factored model approach (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) allows us to integrate 7-gram models over part-of-speech tags.",
        "The part-of-speech tags are produced during decoding by the phrase mapping of surface words on the source side to a factored representation of surface words and their part-of-speech tags on the target side in one translation step.",
        "We previously used this additional scoring component for the German-English language pairs with success.",
        "Thus we now applied to it all other language pairs (except for English-Czech due to the lack of a Czech part-of-speech tagger).",

        "A major extension of the capabilities of the Moses system is the accommodation of tree-based models (Hoang et al., 2009).",
        "While we have not yet carried out sufficient experimentation and optimization of the implementation, we took the occasion of the shared translation task as a opportunity to build large-scale systems using such models.",
        "We build two translation systems: One using tree-based models without additional linguistic annotation, which are known as hierarchical phrase-based models (Chiang, 2005), and another system that uses linguistic annotation on the target side, which are known under many names such as string-to-tree models or syntactified target models (Marcu et al., 2006).",
        "Both models are trained using a very similar pipeline as for the phrase model.",
        "The main difference is that the translation rules do not have to be contiguous phrases, but may contain gaps with are labeled and coordinated by non-terminal symbols.",
        "Decoding with such models requires a very different algorithm, which is related to syntactic chart parsing.",
        "In the target syntax model, the target gaps and the entire target phrase must map to constituents in the parse tree.",
        "This restriction may be relaxed by adding constituent labels such as det+adj or np\\det to group neighboring constituents or indicate constituents that lack an initial child, respectively (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).",
        "We applied these models to the English-German language direction, which is of particular interest to us due to the rich target side morphology and large degree of reordering, resulting in relatively poor performance.",
        "See Table 10 for experimental results with the two traditional models (phrase-based model and a factored model that includes a 7-gram morphological tag model) and the two newer models (hierarchical and target syntax).",
        "The performance of the phrase-based, hierarchical, and target syntax model are close in terms of bleu."

        "We obtained substantial gains over our systems from last year for all language pairs.",
        "To a large part, these gains are due to additional training data and our ability to exploit them.",
        "We also saw gains from adding linguistic annotation (in form of 7-gram models over part-of-speech tags) and promising results for tree-based models.",
        "At this point, we are quite satisfied being able to build competitive systems with these new models, which opens up major new research directions.",
        "Everything we described here is part of the open source Moses toolkit.",
