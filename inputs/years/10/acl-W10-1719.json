        "The difficult reordering between German and English was modeled using POS-based reordering rules.",
        "These rules were learned using a word-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "The POS tags for the reordering models are generated using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for all languages.",

        "We used the data provided for the WMT for training, optimizing and testing our systems: Our training corpus consists of Europarl and News Commentary data, for optimization we use new-stest2008 as development set and newstest2009 as test set.",
        "The baseline language models are trained on the target language part of the Europarl and News Commentary corpora.",
        "Additional, bigger language models were trained on monolingual corpora.",
        "For both systems the News corpus was used while an English language model was also trained on the even bigger Gigaword corpus.",
        "The training data was preprocessed before used for training.",
        "In this step different normalizations were done like mapping different types of quotes.",
        "In the end the first word of every sentence was smart-cased.",
        "For the German text, additional preprocessing steps were applied.",
        "First, the older German data uses the old German orthography whereas the newer parts of the corpus use the new German orthography.",
        "We tried to normalize the text by converting the whole text to the new German orthography.",
        "In a first step, we search for words that are only correct according to the old writing rules.",
        "Therefore, we selected all words in the corpus, that are correct according to the hunspell lexicon using the old rules, but not correct according to the hunspell lexicon using the new rules.",
        "In a second step we tried to find the correct spelling according to the new rules.",
        "We first applied rules describing how words changed from one spelling system to the other, for example replacing 'ÃŸ' by 'ss'.",
        "If the new word is a correct word according to the hun-spell lexicon using the new spelling rules, we map the words.",
        "When translating from German to English, we apply compound splitting as described in Koehn and Knight (2003) to the German corpus.",

        "The translation model was trained on the parallel corpus and the word alignment was generated by a discriminative word alignment model, which is described below.",
        "The phrase table was trained using the Moses training scripts, but for the German to English system we used a different phrase extraction method described in detail in Section 4.2.",
        "In addition, we applied phrase table smoothing as described in Foster et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Furthermore, we extended the translation model by additional features for unaligned words and introduced bilingual language models.",
        "In most phrase-based SMT systems the heuristic grow-diag-final-and is used to combine the alignments generated by GIZA++ from both directions.",
        "Then these alignments are used to extract the phrase pairs.",
        "We used a discriminative word alignment model (DWA) to generate the alignments as described in Niehues and Vogel (2008) instead.",
        "This model is trained on a small amount of hand-aligned data and uses the lexical probability as well as the fertilities generated by the PGIZA++ Toolkit and POS information.",
        "We used all local features, the GIZA and indicator fertility features as well as first order features for 6 directions.",
        "The model was trained in three steps, first using maximum likelihood optimization and afterwards it was optimized towards the alignment error rate.",
        "For more details see Niehues and Vogel (2008).",
        "In translations from German to English, we often have the case that the English verb is aligned to both parts of the German verb.",
        "Since this phrase pair is not continuous on the German side, it cannot be extracted.",
        "The phrase could be extracted, if we also reorder the training corpus.",
        "For the test sentences the POS-based reordering allows us to change the word order in the source sentence so that the sentence can be translated more easily.",
        "If we apply this also to the training sentences, we would be able to extract the phrase pairs for originally discontinuous phrases and could apply them during translation of the reordered test sentences.",
        "Therefore, we build lattices that encode the different reorderings for every training sentence, as described in Niehues et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Then we can not only extract phrase pairs from the monotone source path, but also from the reordered paths.",
        "So it would be possible to extract the example mentioned before, if both parts of the verb were put together by a reordering rule.",
        "To limit the number of extracted phrase pairs, we extract a source phrase only once per sentence even if it may be found on different paths.",
        "Furthermore, we do not use the weights in the lattice.",
        "If we used the same rules as for reordering the test sets, the lattice would be so big that the number of extracted phrase pairs would be still too high.",
        "As mentioned before, the word reordering is mainly a problem at the phrase extraction stage if one word is aligned to two words which are far away from each other in the sentence.",
        "Therefore, the short-range reordering rules do not help much in this case.",
        "So, only the long-range reordering rules were used to generate the lattices for the training corpus.",
        "Guzman et al.",
        "(2009) analyzed the role of the word alignment in the phrase extraction process.",
        "To better model the relation between word alignment and the phrase extraction process, they introduced two new features into the log-linear model.",
        "One feature counts the number of unaligned words on the source side and the other one does the same for the target side.",
        "Using these additional features they showed improvements on the Chinese to English translation task.",
        "In order to investigate the impact on closer related languages like English and German, we incorporated those two features into our systems.",
        "Motivated by the improvements in translation quality that could be achieved by using the n-gram based approach to statistical machine translation, for example by Allauzen et al.",
        "(2009), we tried to integrate a bilingual language model into our phrase-based translation system.",
        "To be able to integrate the approach easily into a standard phrase-based SMT system, a token in the bilingual language model is defined to consist of a target word and all source words it is aligned to.",
        "The tokens are ordered according to the target language word order.",
        "Then the additional tokens can be introduced into the decoder as an additional target factor.",
        "Consequently, no additional implementation work is needed to integrate this feature.",
        "If we have the German sentence Ich bin nach Hause gegangen with the English translation I went home, the resulting bilingual text would look like this: IIch wentJbin .gegangen home Mause.",
        "As shown in the example, one problem with this approach is that unaligned source words are ignored in the model.",
        "One solution could be to have a second bilingual text ordered according to the source side.",
        "But since the target sentence and not the source sentence is generated from left to right during decoding, the integration of a source side language model is more complex.",
        "Therefore, as a first approach we only used a language model based on the target word order.",
        "The main advantage of POS-based information is that there are less data sparsity problems and therefore a longer context can be considered.",
        "Consequently, if we want to use this information in the translation model of a phrase-based SMT system, the POS-based phrase pairs should be longer than the word-based ones.",
        "But this is not possible in many decoders or it leads to additional computation overhead.",
        "If we instead use a bilingual POS-based language model, the context length of the language model is independent from the other models.",
        "Consequently, a longer context can be considered for the POS-based language model than for the word-based bilingual language model or the phrase pairs.",
        "Instead of using POS-based information, this approach can also be applied with other additional linguistic word-level information like word stems."
