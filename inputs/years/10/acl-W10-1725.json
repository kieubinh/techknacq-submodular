        "For this year's translation shared task, the Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technologies (PRHLT) research group of the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia submitted runs for the English-Spanish translation task.",
        "In this paper, we report the configuration of such a system, together with preliminary experiments performed to establish the final setup.",
        "As in 2009, the central focus of the Shared Task is on Domain Adaptation, where a system typically trained using out-of-domain data is adjusted to translate news commentaries.",
        "For the preliminary experiments, we used only a small amount of the largest available bilingual corpus, i.e. the United Nations corpus, by including into our system only those sentences which were considered similar.",
        "Language model interpolation using a development set was explored in this work, together with a technique to cope with the problem of \"out of vocabulary words\".",
        "Finally, a reordering constraint using walls and zones was used in order to improve the performance of the submitted system.",

        "Although the most obvious thing to do is to concatenate all the data available and train a single language model on the whole data, we also investigated a \"smarter\" use of such data, by training one language model for each of the available corpora."

        "Currently, it is common to of huge bilingual corpora for SMT.",
        "For some common language pairs, corpora of millions of parallel sentences are available.",
        "In some of the cases big corpora are used as out-of-domain corpora.",
        "For example, in the case of the shared task, we try to translate a news text using a small in-domain bilingual news corpus (News Commentary) and two big out-of-domain corpora: Europarl and United Nations.",
        "Europarl is a medium size corpus and can be completely incorporated to the training set.",
        "However, the use of the UN corpus requires a big computational effort.",
        "In order to alleviate this problem, we have chosen only those bilingual sentences from the United Nations that are similar to the in-domain corpus sentences.",
        "As a similarity measure, we have chosen the alignment score.",
        "Alignment scores have already been used as a filter for noisy corpora (Khadivi and Ney, 2005).",
        "We trained an IBM model 4 using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) with the in-domain corpus and computed the alignment scores over the United Nations sentences.",
        "We assume that the alignment score is a good measure of similarity.",
        "An important factor in the alignment score is the length of the sentences, so we clustered the bilingual sentences in groups with the same sum of source and target language sentence sizes.",
        "In each of the groups, the higher the alignment score is, the more similar the sentence is to the in-domain corpus sentences.",
        "Hence, we computed the average alignment score for each one of the clusters obtained for the corpus considered in-domain (i.e. the News-Commentary corpus).",
        "This being done, we assessed the similarity of a given sentence by computing the probability of such sentence with respect to the alignment model of the in-domain corpus, and established the following similarity levels:",
        "• Level 1: Sentences with an alignment score equal or higher than the in-domain average.",
        "• Level 2: Sentences with an alignment score equal or higher than the in-domain average, minus one standard deviation.",
        "• Level 3: Sentences with an alignment score equal or higher than the in-domain average, minus two standard deviations.",
        "Naturally, such similarity levels establish partitions of the out-of-domain corpus.",
        "Then, such partitions were included into the training set used for building the SMT system, and rebuilt the complete system from scratch."

        "Some of those out of vocabulary words are present in the sentences discarded from the United Nations Corpus.",
        "Thus, recovering the discarded sentences with out of vocabulary words is needed.",
        "The out of vocabulary words recovery method is simple: the out of vocabulary words from the test, when taking into account the reduced training set, are obtained and then discarded sentences that contain at least one of them are retrieved.",
        "Then, those sentences are added to the reduced training set.",
        "Finally, alignments with the resulting training set were computed and the usual training procedure for phrase-based systems was performed."

        "The weights of the log-linear interpolation were optimised by means of MERT (Och, 2003).",
        "In addition, a 5-gram LM with Kneser-Ney (Kneser and Ney, 1995) smoothing and interpolation was built by means of the SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) toolkit.",
        "For building our baseline system, the News-Commentary and Europarl v5 (Koehn, 2005) data were employed, with maximum sentence length set to 40 in the case of the data used to build the translation models, and without restriction in the case of the LM.",
        "Statistics of the bilingual data can be seen in Table 1.",
        "In all the experiments reported, MERT was run on the 2008 test set, whereas the test set 2009 was considered as test set as such.",

        "The final system submitted to the shared task included a linear interpolation of four language models, one for each of the monolingual resources available for Spanish (see Table 2).",
        "The results can be seen in Table 3.",
        "As a first experiment, only the in-domain corpus, i.e. the News-Commentary data (NC data) was used for building the LM.",
        "Then, all the available monolingual Spanish data was included into a single LM, by concatenating all the data together (pooled).",
        "Next, in interpolated, one LM for each one of the provided monolingual resources was trained, and then they were linearly interpolated so as to minimise the perplexity of the 2008 test set, and fed such interpolation to the SMT system.",
        "We found out that weights were distributed quite unevenly, since the News-shuffled LM received a weight of 0.67, whereas the other three corpora received a weight of 0.11 each.",
        "It must be noted that even the in-domain LM received a weight of 0.11 (less than the News-shuffled LM).",
        "The reason for this might be that, although the in-domain LM should be more appropriate and should receive a higher weight, the News-shuffled corpus is also news related (hence not really out-of-domain), but much larger.",
        "For this reason, the result of using only such LM (News) was also analysed.",
