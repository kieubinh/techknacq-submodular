        "This year we have focused on two issues: translation of verbs, which is problematic for translation between English and German since the verb placement is different with German verbs often being placed at the end of sentences; and OOVs, out-of-vocabulary words, which are problematic for machine translation in general.",
        "Verb translation is targeted by trying to improve alignment, which we believe is a crucial step for verb translation since verbs that are far apart are often not aligned at all.",
        "We do this mainly by moving verbs to the end of sentences previous to alignment, which we also combine with other alignments.",
        "We transform OOVs into known words in a post-processing step, based on casing, stemming, and splitting of hyphenated compounds.",

        "(2008), instead of lowercased data.",
        "This means that there is no need for a full recasing step after translation, instead we only need to uppercase the first word in each sentence.",
        "We participated in the constrained task, where we only trained the Liu system on the news and Eu-roparl corpora provided for the workshop.",
        "The translation and reordering models were trained using the bilingual Europarl and news commentary corpora, which we concatenated.",

        "This constrained the possibilities of using the data provided by the workshop to the full.",
        "The main problem was training the language models, since the monolingual data was very large compared to the bilingual data.",
        "In order to train language models that were both fast at runtime, and possible to train with the available memory, we chose to use the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), with entropy-based pruning, with 10-8 as a threshold.",
        "To reduce the model size we also used lower order models for the large corpus; 4-grams instead of 5-grams for words and 6-grams instead of 7-grams for the morphological models.",
        "It was still impossible to train on the monolingual English news corpus, with nearly 50 million sentences, so we split that corpus into three equal size parts, and trained three models, that were interpolated with equal weights."

        "For English we used part-of-speech tags obtained using Tree-Tagger (Schmid, 1994), enriched with more finegrained tags for the number of determiners, in order to target more agreement issues, since nouns already have number in the tagset.",

        "For German the factor was also used for compound merging.",
        "Prior to training and translation, compound processing was performed, using an empirical method splits words if they can be split into parts that occur in a monolingual corpus, choosing the splitting option with the highest arithmetic mean of its part frequencies in the corpus.",
        "We split nouns, adjectives and verbs, into parts that are content words or particles.",
        "We imposed a length limit on parts of 3 characters for translation from German and of 6 characters for translation from English, and we had a stop list of parts that often led to errors, such as arische (Aryan) in konsularische (consular).",
        "We allowed 10 common letter changes (Langer, 1998) and hyphens at split points.",
        "Compound parts were given a special part-of-speech tag that matches the head word.",
        "For translation into German, compound parts were merged into full compounds using a method described in Stymne and Holmqvist (2008), which is based on matching of the special part-of-speech tag for compound parts.",
        "A word with a compound POS-tag were merged with the next word, if their POS-tags were matching.",
        "Tables 1 and 2 show the results of the additional morphological processing.",
        "Adding the sequence models on morphologically enriched part-of-speech tags gave a significant improvement for translation into German, but similar or worse results as the baseline for translation into English.",
        "This is not surprising, since German morphology is more complex than English morphology.",
        "The addition of compound processing significantly improved the results on Meteor for translation into",
        "English, and it also reduced the number of OOVs in the translation output by 20.8%.",
        "For translation into German, compound processing gave a significant improvement on both metrics compared to the baseline, and on Bleu compared to the system with morphological sequence models.",
        "Overall, we believe that both compound splitting and morphology are useful; thus all experiments reported in the sequel are based on the baseline system with morphology models and compound splitting, which we will call base."
