      "text": [
        "The main motivation of our submission was to test the use of adaptive language and translation models in a standard phrase-based SMT setting for the adaptation to wider context beyond sentence boundaries.",
        "Adaptive language models have a long tradition in the speech recognition community and various approaches have been proposed to reduce model perplexity in this way.",
        "The general task is to adjust statistical models to essential properties of natural language which are usually not captured by standard n-gram models or other local dependency models.",
        "First of all, it is known that repetition is very common especially among content words (see, for example, words like \"honey\", \"milk\", \"land\" and \"flowing\" in figure 1).",
        "In most cases a repeated occurrence of a content word is much more likely than its first appearance, which is not predicted in this way by a static language model.",
        "Secondly, the use of expressions is related to the topic in the current discourse and the chance of using the same topicrelated expressions again in running text is higher than a mixed-topic model would predict.",
        "In translation another phenomenon can be observed, namely the consistency of translations.",
        "Polysemous terms are usually not ambiguous in their context and, hence, their translations become consistent according to the contextual sense.",
        "Even the choice between synonymous translations is rather consistent in translated texts as we can see in the example of subtitle translations in figure 1 (taken from the OPUS corpus (Tiedemann, 2009)).",
        "The 10 commandments Kerd ma lui",
        "To some land flowing with milk and honey!",
        "Till ett land fullt av mjolk och honung.",
        "I've never tasted honey.",
        "Jag har aldrig smakat honung.",
        "But will sympathy lead us to this land flowing with milk and honey?",
        "Men kan sympati leda oss till detta mjolkens och honungens land?",
        "Mari honey ... Mari, gumman Sweetheart, where are you Alskling, var",
        "Who was that, honey?",
        "Vem var det, gumman?",
        "Ambiguous terms like \"honey\" are consistently translated into the Swedish counterpart \"honung\" (in the sense of the actual substance) or \"gumman\" (in the metaphoric sense).",
        "Observe that this is true even in the latter case where synonymous translations such as \"alskling\" would be possible as well.",
        "In other words, deciding to stick to consistent lexical translations should be preferred in MT because the chance of alternative translations in repeated cases is low.",
        "Here again, common static translation models do not capture this property at all.",
        "In the following we explain our attempt to integrate contextual dependencies using cache-based adaptive models in a standard SMT setup.",
        "We have already successfully applied this technique to a domain-adaptation task (Tiedemann, 2010).",
        "Now we would like to investigate the robustness of this model in a more general case where some in-domain training data is available and input data is less repetitive."

      "text": [
        "The basic idea behind cache-based models is to mix a large static background model with a small local model that is dynamically estimated from recent items from the input stream.",
        "Dynamic cache language models have been introduced by (Kuhn and Mori, 1990) and are often implemented in the form of linear mixtures:",
        "The background model is usually a standard n-gram model taking limited amount of local context from the history into account and the cache model is often implemented as a simple (unsmoothed) unigram model using the elements stored in a fixed-size cache (100-5000 words) to estimate its parameters.",
        "Another improvement can be achieved by making the importance of cached elements a function of recency.",
        "This can be done by introducing a decaying factor in the estimation of cache probabilities (Clarkson and Robinson, 1997):",
        "This is basically the model that we applied in our experiments as it showed the largest perplexity reduction in our previous experiments on domain adaptation.",
        "Similarly, translation models can be adapted as well.",
        "This is especially useful to account for translation consistency forcing the decoder to prefer identical translations for repeated terms.",
        "In our approach we try to model recency again using a decay factor to compute translation model scores from the cache in the following way (only for source language phrases fn for which a translation option exist in the cache; we use a score of zero otherwise):",
        "The importance of a cached translation option exponentially decays and we normalize the sum of cached occurrences by the number of translation options with the same foreign language item that we condition on.",
        "Plugging this in into a standard phrase-based SMT engine is rather straightforward.",
        "The use of cache-based language models in SMT have been investigated before (Raab, 2007).",
        "In our case we used Moses as the base decoder (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The cache-based language model can be integrated in the decoder by simply adjusting the call to the language modeling toolkit appropriately.",
        "We implemented the exponentially decaying cache model within the standard SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) and added command line arguments to Moses to switch to that model and to set cache parameters such as interpolation, cache size and decay.",
        "Adding the translation model cache is a bit more tricky.",
        "For this we added a new feature function to the global log-linear model and implemented the decaying cache as explained above within the decoder.",
        "Again, simple command-line arguments can be used to switch caching on or off and to adjust cache parameters.",
        "One important issue is to decide when and what to cache.",
        "As we explore a lot of different options in decoding it is not feasible to adapt the cache continuously.",
        "This would mean a lot of cache operations trying to add and remove hypotheses from the cache memory.",
        "Therefore, we opted for a context model that considers history only from previous sentences.",
        "Once decoding is finished translation options from the best hypothesis found in decoding are put into language and translation model cache.",
        "This is arguably a strong approximation of the adaptive approach.",
        "However, considering our special concern about wider context across sentence boundaries this seems to be a reasonable compromise between completeness and efficiency.",
        "Another issue is related to the selection of items to be cached.",
        "As discussed earlier repetition is most likely to be found among content words.",
        "Similarly, translation consistency is less likely to be true for function words.",
        "In the best case one would know the likelihood of specific terms to be repeated.",
        "This could be trained on some development data possibly in connection with word classes instead of fully lexicalized parameters in order to overcome data sparseness and to improve generality.",
        "Even though this idea is very tempting it would require a substantial extension of our model and would introduce language and domain-specific parameters.",
        "Therefore, we just added a simplistic approach filtering tokens by their length in characters instead.",
        "Assuming that longer items are more likely to be content words we simply set a threshold to decide whether to add a term to the cache or not.",
        "This threshold can be adjusted using command-line arguments.",
        "Finally, we also need to be careful about noise in the cache.",
        "This is essential as the caching approach is prone to error propagation.",
        "However, detecting noise is difficult.",
        "If there would be a notion of noise in translation hypotheses, the decoder would avoid it.",
        "In related work (Nepveu et al., 2004) have studied cache-based translation models in connection with interactive machine translation.",
        "In that case, one can assume correct input after post-editing the translation suggestions.",
        "One way to approach noise reduction in non-interactive MT is to make use of transition costs in the translation lattice.",
        "Assuming that this cost (which is estimated internally within the decoder during the expansion of translation hypotheses) refers to some kind of confidence we can discard translation options above a certain threshold, which is what we did in the implementation of our translation model cache."

        "Primarily we concentrated our efforts on German-English (de-en) and English-German (en-de) using the constrained track, i.e. using the provided training and development data from Europarl and the News domain.",
        "Later we also added experiments for Spanish (es) and English using a similar setup.",
        "Our baseline system incorporates the following components: We trained two separate 5-gram language models for each language with the standard smoothing strategies (interpolation and Kneser-Ney discounting), one for Europarl and one for the News data.",
        "All of them were estimated using the SRILM toolkit except the English News LM for which we applied RandLM (Talbot and Osborne, 2007) to cope with the large amount of training data.",
        "We also included two separate translation models, one for the combined Europarl and News data and one for the News data only.",
        "They were estimated using the standard tools GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) applying default settings and lowercased training data.",
        "Lexicalized reordering was trained on the combined data set.",
        "All baseline models were then tuned on the News test data from 2008 using minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).",
        "The results in terms of lower-case BLEU scores are listed in table 1.",
        "In the adaptation experiments we applied exactly the same models using the feature weights from the baseline with the addition of the caching components in both, language models and translation models.",
        "Cache parameters are not particularly tuned for the task in our initial experiments which could be one reason for the disappointing results we obtained.",
        "Some of them can be integrated in the MERT procedure, for example, the interpolation weight of the translation cache.",
        "However, tuning these parameters with the standard procedures appears to be difficult as we will see in later experiments presented in section 3.2.",
        "Initially we used settings that appeared to be useful in previous experiments.",
        "In particular, we used a language model cache of 10,000 words with a decay of a = 0.0005 and an interpolation weight of 0.001.",
        "A cache was used in all language models except the English News model for which caching was not available (because we did not implement this feature for RandLM).",
        "The translation cache size was set to 5,000 with a decay factor of 0.001.",
        "The weight for the translation cache was set to 0.001.",
        "Furthermore, we filtered items for the translation cache using a length constraint of 4 characters or more and a transition cost threshold (log score) of -4.",
        "The final results of the adaptive runs are shown in table 1.",
        "In all but one case the cache-based result is below the baseline which is, of course, quite disappointing.",
        "For German-English a small improvement can be observed.",

        "We can see a very blurred picture of these individual scores and the general conclusion is that caching failed.",
        "One problem is that the individual news items are very short (around 20 sentences each) which is probably too little for caching to show any positive effect.",
        "Surprising, however, is the negative influence of caching even on these small documents which is quite similar to the runs on the entire sets.",
        "The drop in performance for English-Spanish is especially striking.",
        "We have no explanation at this point for this exceptional behavior.",
        "A second observation is the variation in individual n-gram precision scores (see table 1).",
        "In all but one case the unigram precision goes up which indicates that the cache models often improve lexical choice at least in terms of individual words.",
        "The first example in figure 2 could be seen as a slight improvement due to a consistent lexical choice of \"missile\" (instead of \"rocket\").",
        "The main problem, however, in the adaptive approach seems to appear in local contexts which might be due to the simplistic language modeling cache.",

        "However, as already mentioned, we had to interrupt tuning and there is still some chance that MERT would have improved in later iterations.",
        "At least intuitively, there seems to be some logic behind the tuned weights (shown in table 4).",
        "The out-of-domain LM (Eu-roparl) obtains a higher weight with caching than without and the in-domain LM (News) is better without it and, therefore, the cached version obtains a negative weight.",
