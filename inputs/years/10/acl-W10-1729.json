        "The effect of morphological variation in languages can be alleviated by using word analysis schemes, which may include morpheme discovery, part-of-speech tagging, or other linguistic information.",
        "Words are very convenient and even efficient representation in statistical natural language processing, especially with English, but morphologically rich languages can benefit from more fine-grained information.",
        "For instance, statistical morphs discovered with unsupervised methods result in better performance in automatic speech recognition for highly-inflecting and agglutinative languages (Hirsimaki et al., 2006; Kurimo et al., 2006).",
        "Virpioja et al.",
        "(2007) applied morph-based models in statistical machine translation (SMT) between several language pairs without gaining improvement in BLEU score, but obtaining reductions in out-of-vocabulary rates.",
        "They utilized morphs both in the source and in the target language.",
        "Later, de Gispert et al.",
        "(2009) showed that Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) combination of word-based and morph-based translation models improves translation with Arabic-to-English and Finnish-to-English language pairs, where only the source language utilized morph-based models.",
        "Similar results have been shown for Finnish-to-English and Finnish-to-German in performance evaluation of various unsupervised morpheme analysis algorithms in Morpho Challenge 2009 competition (Kurimo et al., 2009).",
        "We continue the research described above and examine how the level of decomposition affects both the individual morph-based systems and MBR combinations with the baseline word-based model.",

        "In this work, morphological analyses are conducted on the source language data, and each different analysis is applied to create a unique segmentation of words into morphemes.",
        "Translation systems are trained with the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) from each differently segmented version of the same source language to the target language.",
        "Evaluation with BLEU is performed on both the individual systems and system combinations, using different levels of decomposition.",
        "Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz and Lagus, 2007, etc.)",
        "is a family of methods for unsupervised morphological segmentation.",
        "Mor-fessor does not limit the number of morphemes for each word, making it suitable for agglutinative and compounding languages.",
        "An analysis of a single word is a list of non-overlapping segments, morphs, stored in the model lexicon.",
        "We use both the Morfessor Baseline (Creutz and Lagus, 2005b) and the Morfessor Categories-MAP (Creutz and Lagus, 2005a) algorithms.",
        "Both are formulated in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework, i.e., the learning algorithm tries to optimize the product of the model prior and the data likelihood.",
        "The generative model applied by Morfessor Baseline assumes that the morphs are independent.",
        "The resulting segmentation can be influenced by using explicit priors for the morph lengths and frequencies, but their effect is usually minimal.",
        "The training data has a larger effect on the results: A larger data set allows a larger lexicon, and thus longer morphs and less morphs per word (Creutz and Lagus, 2007).",
        "Moreover, the model can be trained with or without taking into account the word frequencies.",
        "If the frequencies are included, the more frequent words are usually un-dersegmented compared to a linguistic analysis, whereas the rare words are oversegmented (Creutz and Lagus, 2005b).",
        "An easy way to control the amount of segmentation is to weight the training data likelihood by a positive factor a.",
        "If a > 1, the increased likelihood results in longer morphs.",
        "If a < 1, the morphs will be shorter and the words more segmented.",
        "Words that are not present in the training data can be segmented using an algorithm similar to Viterbi.",
        "The algorithm can be modified to allow new morphs types to be used by using an approximative cost of adding them into the lexicon (Vir-pioja and Kohonen, 2009).",
        "The modification prevents oversegmentation of unseen word forms.",
        "In machine translation, this is important especially for proper nouns, for which there is usually no need for translation.",
        "The Morfessor Categories-MAP algorithm extends the model by imposing morph categories of stems, prefixes and suffixes, as well as transition probabilities between them.",
        "In addition, it applies a hierarchical segmentation model that allows it to construct new stems from smaller pieces of \"non-morphemes\" (Creutz and Lagus, 2007).",
        "Due to these features, it can provide reasonable segmentations also for those words that contain new morphemes.",
        "The drawback of the more sophisticated model is the slower and more complex training algorithm.",
        "In addition, the amount of the segmentation is harder to control.",
        "Morfessor Categories-MAP was applied to statistical machine translation by Virpioja et al.",
        "Kurimo et al.",
        "(2009) report that Morfessor Baseline outperformed Categories-MAP in Finnish-to-English and German-to-English tasks both with and without MBR combination, although the differences were not statistically significant.",
        "In all the previous cases, the models were trained on word types, i.e., without using their frequencies.",
        "Here, we also test models trained on word tokens.",
        "We utilize the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) for statistical machine translation.",
        "The default parameter values are used except with the segmented source language, where the maximum sentence length is increased from 80 to 100 tokens to compensate for the larger number of tokens in text.",
        "For combining individual models, we apply Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) system combination (Sim et al., 2007).",
        "N-best lists from multiple SMT systems trained with different morphological analysis methods are merged; the posterior distributions over the individual lists are interpolated to form a new distribution over the merged list.",
        "MBR hypotheses selection is then performed using sentence-level BLEU score (Kumar and",
        "Byrne, 2004).",
        "In this work, the focus of the system combination is not to combine different translation systems (e.g., Moses and Systran), but to combine systems trained with the same translation algorithm using the same source language data with with different morphological decompositions."
