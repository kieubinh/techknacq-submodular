        "The principle of maximum entropy states that, given known constraints, the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with the largest entropy.",
        "Maximum entropy models based on this principle have been widely used in Natural Language Processing, e.g. for tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), parsing (Charniak, 2000), and named entity recognition (Bender et al., 2003).",
        "Maximum entropy models have the following form where fi is a feature function, Ai is its weight, and",
        "Z (x) is the normalizing factor",
        "In statistical machine translation (SMT), translation model (TM) p(t|s) is the probability that the string t from the target language is the translation of the string s from the source language.",
        "Typical approach in SMT is to use backward translation model p(s|t) according to Bayes' rule and noisy-channel model.",
        "However, in this paper we deal only with the forward (direct) model.",
        "The idea of using maximum entropy for constructing forward translation models is not new.",
        "It naturally allows to make use of various features potentially important for correct choice of target-language expressions.",
        "Let us adopt a motivating example of such a feature from (Berger et al., 1996) (which contains the first usage of maxent translation model we are aware of): \"If house appears within the next three words (e.g., the phrases in the house and in the red house), then dans might be a more likely [French] translation [of in].\"",
        "Incorporating non-local features extracted from the source sentence into the standard noisy-channel model in which only the backward translation model is available, is not possible.",
        "This drawback of the noisy-channel approach is typically compensated by using large target-language n-gram models, which can - in a result - play a role similar to that of a more elaborate (more context sensitive) forward translation model.",
        "However, we expect that it would be more beneficial to exploit both the parallel data and the monolingual data in a more balance fashion, rather than extract only a reduced amount of information from the parallel data and compensate it by large language model on the target side.",
        "A deeper discussion on the potential advantages of maximum entropy approach over the noisy-channel approach can be found in (Foster, 2000) and (Och and Ney, 2002), in which another successful applications of maxent translation models are shown.",
        "Log-linear translation models (instead of MLE) with rich feature sets are used also in (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007) and (Gimpel and Smith, 2009); the idea can be traced back to (Papineni et al., 1997).",
        "What makes our approach different from the previously published works is that",
        "1. we show how the maximum entropy translation model can be used in a dependency framework; we use deep-syntactic dependency trees (as defined in the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic et al., 2006)) as the transfer layer,",
        "2. we combine the maximum entropy translation model with target-language dependency tree model and use tree-modified Viterbi search for finding the optimal lemmas labeling of the target-tree nodes.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we give a brief overview of the translation framework TectoMT in which the experiments are implemented.",
        "In Section 3 we describe how our translation models are constructed.",
        "Section 4 summarizes the experimental results, and Section 5 contains a summary."

        "We use tectogrammatical (deep-syntactic) layer of language representation as the transfer layer in the presented MT experiments.",
        "Tectogrammatics was introduced in (Sgall, 1967) and further elaborated within the Prague Dependency Treebank project (Hajic et al., 2006).",
        "On this layer, each sentence is represented as a tectogrammatical tree, whose main properties (from the MT viewpoint) are following: (1) nodes represent autosemantic words, (2) edges represent semantic dependencies (a node is an argument or a modifier of its parent), (3) there are no functional words (prepositions, auxiliary words) in the tree, and the autosemantic words appear only in their base forms (lemmas).",
        "Morphologically indispensable categories (such as number with nouns or tense with verbs, but not number with verbs as it is only imposed by agreement) are stored in separate node attributes (grammatemes).",
        "The intuition behind the decision to use tec-togrammatics for MT is the following: we believe that (1) tectogrammatics largely abstracts from language-specific means (inflection, agglutination, functional words etc.)",
        "of expressing non-lexical meanings and thus tectogrammatical trees are supposed to be highly similar across languages, (2) it enables a natural transfer factorization, (3) and local tree contexts in tectogram-matical trees carry more information (especially for lexical choice) than local linear contexts in the original sentences.",
        "In order to facilitate transfer of sentence 'syn-tactization', we work with tectogrammatical nodes enhanced with the formeme attribute (Zabokrtsky et al., 2008), which captures the surface mor-phosyntactic form of a given tectogrammatical node in a compact fashion.",
        "For example, the value n:pred+4 is used to label semantic nouns that should appear in an accusative form in a prepositional group with the preposition pred in Czech.",
        "For English we use formemes such as n:subj (semantic noun (SN) in subject position), n:for+X (SN with preposition for), n:X+ago (SN with postposition ago), n:poss (possessive form of SN), v:because+fin (semantic verb (SV) as a subordinating finite clause introduced by because), v:without+ger (SV as a gerund after without), adj:attr (semantic adjective (SA) in attributive position), adj:compl (SA in complement position).",
        "We have implemented our experiments in the TectoMT software framework, which already offers tool chains for analysis and synthesis of Czech and English sentences (Zabokrtsky et al., 2008).",
        "The translation scenario proceeds as follows.",
        "1.",
        "The input English text is segmented into sentences and tokens.",
        "2.",
        "The tokens are lemmatized and tagged with Penn Treebank tags using the Morce tagger (Spoustova et al., 2007).",

        "\".",
        "3.",
        "Then the Maximum Spanning Tree parser (McDonald et al., 2005) is applied and a surface-syntax dependency tree (analytical tree in the PDT terminology) is created for each sentence (Figure 1a).",
        "4.",
        "This tree is converted to a tectogrammatical tree (Figure 1b).",
        "Each autosemantic word with its associated functional words is collapsed into a single tectogrammatical node, labeled with lemma, formeme, and semantically indispensable morphologically categories; coreference is also resolved.",
        "Collapsing edges are depicted by wider lines in the Figure 1a.",
        "5.",
        "The transfer phase follows, whose most difficult part consists in labeling the tree with target-side lemmas and formemes (changes of tree topology are required relatively infrequently).",
        "See Figure 1c.",
        "6.",
        "Finally, surface sentence shape (Figure 1d) is synthesized from the tectogrammatical tree, which is basically a reverse operation for the tectogrammatical analysis: adding punctuation and functional words, spreading morphological categories according to grammatical agreement, performing inflection (using Czech morphology database (Hajic, 2004)), arranging word order etc."

        "In addition, we describe a target-language tree model (3.4), which can be combined with both the translation models using the Hidden Tree Markov Model approach and tree-modified Viterbi search, similarly to the approach of (Zabokrtsky and Popel, 2009).",
        "We used Czech-English parallel corpus CzEng 0.9 (Bojar and Zabokrtsky, 2009) for training the translation models.",
        "CzEng 0.9 contains about 8 million sentence pairs, and also their tectogram-matical analyses and node-wise alignment.",
        "We used only trees from training sections (about 80 % of the whole data), which contain around 30 million pairs of aligned tectogrammatical nodes.",
        "From each pair of aligned tectogrammatical nodes, we extracted triples containing the source (English) lemma, the target (Czech) lemma, and the feature vector.",
        "In order to reduce noise in the training data, we pruned the data in two ways.",
        "First, we disregarded all triples whose lemma pair did not occur at least twice in the whole data.",
        "Second, we computed forward and backward maximum likelihood (ML) translation models (target lemma given source lemma and vice versa) and deleted all triples whose probability according to one of the two models was lower than the threshold 0.01.",
        "Then the forward ML translation model was reestimated using only the remaining data.",
        "For a given pair of aligned nodes, the feature vector was of course derived only from the source-side node or from the tree which it belongs to.",
        "As already mentioned in the introduction, the advantage of the maximum entropy approach is that a rich and diverse set of features can be used, without limiting oneself to linearly local context.",
        "The following features (or, better to say, feature templates, as each categorical feature is in fact converted to a number of 0-1 features) were used:",
        "• formeme and morphological categories of the given node,",
        "• lemma, formeme and morphological categories of the governing node,",
        "• lemmas and formemes of all child nodes,",

        "The baseline TM is basically the ML translation model resulting from the previous section, linearly interpolated with several translation models making use of regular word-formative derivations, which can be helpful for translating some less frequent (but regularly derived) lemmas.",
        "For example, one of the derivation-based models estimates the probability p(zajimavelinterestingly) (possibly unseen pair of deadjectival adverbs) by the value of p(zajimavylinteresting).",
        "More detailed description of these models goes beyond the scope of this paper; their weights in the interpolation are very small anyway.",
        "The MaxEnt TM was created as follows:",
        "1. training triples (source lemma, target lemma, feature vector) were disregarded if the source lemma was not seen at least 50 times (only the baseline model will be used for such lemmas),",
        "2. the remaining triples were grouped by the English lemma (over 16 000 groups),",
        "3. due to computational issues, the maximum number of triples in a group was reduced to 1000 by random selection,",
        "4. a separate maximum entropy classifier was trained for each group (i.e., one classifier per source-side lemma) using AI::MaxEntropy Perl module,",
        "5. due to the more aggressive pruning of the training data, coverage of this model is smaller than that of the baseline model; in order not to loose the coverage, the two models were combined using linear interpolation (1:1).",
        "Selected properties of the maximum entropy translation model (before the linear interpolation with the baseline model) are shown in Figure 2.",
        "We increased the size of the training data from 10 000 training triples up to 31 million and evaluated three relative quantities characterizing the translation models:",
        "• coverage - relative frequency of source lemmas for which the translation model offers at least one translation,",
        "• first - relative frequency of source lemmas for which the target lemmas offered as the first by the model (argmax) are the correct ones,",
        "• oracle - relative frequency of source lemmas for which the correct target lemma is among the lemmas offered by the translation model.",
        "As mentioned in Section 3.1, there are context features making use both of local linear context and local tree context.",
        "After training the MaxEnt model, there are about 4.5 million features with non-zero weight, out of which 1.1 million features",

        "A preliminary analysis offeature weights seems to support our intuition that the linear context is preferred especially in the case of more stable collocations.",

        "Of course, the lexical choice is influenced also by the governing lemmas, as can be illustrated with the word native.",
