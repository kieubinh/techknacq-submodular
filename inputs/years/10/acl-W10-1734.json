        "The central result of work by (Koehn and Knight, 2003) is that corpus-driven approaches to compound splitting perform better than approaches based on linguistic analysis, and this result has since been confirmed by other researchers (Popovic et al., 2006; Stymne, 2008).",
        "This is despite the fact that linguistic analysis performs better in terms of matching a gold standard splitting.",
        "Our work shows that integrating these two approaches, by employing high-recall linguistic analysis disambiguated using corpus statistics, effectively combines the benefits of both approaches.",
        "This is important due to the wide usage of the Koehn and Knight approach in statistical machine translation systems.",
        "The splittings we produce are best in terms of both end-to-end machine translation performance (resulting in an improvement of 0.59 BLEU and 0.84 METEOR over the corpus-driven approach of Koehn and Knight on the development test set used for WMT 2009) and two gold standard evaluations (see section 4).",
        "We provide an extensive analysis of the improvements of our approach over the corpus-driven approach.",
        "The approach we have developed may help show how to improve previous approaches to handling compounds in such applications as speech recognition (e.g., (Larson et al., 2000)) or information retrieval (e.g., (Braschler and Ripplinger, 2004)).",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses previous work on compound splitting for statistical machine translation.",
        "Section 3 presents approaches for compound splitting and also presents Smor, the morphological analyzer that is a key knowledge source for our approach.",

        "As can be seen from Table 3, all variants of the hybrid splitting approach, reach higher accuracies than the corpus-driven approach, and again, the most restrictive one (smc@nn) performs best: it is the only one that achieves a slightly higher accuracy than raw (97.34% vs. 96.90%).",
        "Even though the number of correct splits of smc@nn (123) is lower than for e.g. smc (with 128, the highest recall 83.12%), the number of correct not splittings is higher (4,744 vs. 4,666).",
        "Generally speaking, the results of both gold standards show that linguistic knowledge enhances the number of correct splits, while at the same time it considerably reduces oversplitting, which is the main shortcoming of the corpus-driven approach.",
        "A detailed error analysis is provided in the following section 4.3.",
        "In gold standard evaluation, the purely corpus-driven approach exhibited a number of erroneous splits.",
        "These splits are not linguistically motivated and are thus filtered out a priori by the Smor-based systems.",
        "In the following, we give some examples for wrong splits that are typical for the corpus-driven approach.",
        "In Table 4 we divide typical errors into two categories: frequency-based where wrong splitting is solely due to higher frequencies of the parts from the wrong splitting and insertions/deletions where filler letters or deletions of letters lead to wrong splittings of which the parts are again more frequent than for the correct splitting.",

        "The lookup of word frequencies is done case-insensitively, i.e. the casing variant with the highest frequency is chosen.",
        "This leads to cases like traumatisch (\"traumatic\"), where adjectives are split into nominal head words (namely Trauma| Tisch = \"trauma| table\"), which is impossible from a linguistic point of view.",
        "If, however, Traumatisch occurs uppercased and is thus to be interpreted as a noun, the splitting into Trauma| Tisch is correct.",
        "The splitting accuracy of the corpus-driven method is highly dependent on the quality of the monolingual training corpus from which word frequencies are derived.",
        "The examples Themen (\"themes\") and Toynbeesche (\"Toynbeean\") in Table 4 show how foreign language material from a language like English in the training corpus can lead to severe splitting errors.",
        "In order to account for the lack of linguistic knowledge, the corpus-driven approach has to allow for a high flexibility of filler letters, deletion of letters and combinations of both.",
        "The examples in the lower part of Table 4 show that this flexibility often leads to erroneous splits that completely modify the semantic content of the original word.",
        "For example, the verb participle form of \"to break out\", entbrannte is split into Ente| brannte (\"duck| burned\"), because the corpus-driven approach allows to add an \"e\" at the end of each but the rightmost part.",
        "This transformation is required to cover compounds like Kirchturm (\"church tower\" (or also \"steeple\")) that are composed of the words Kirche (\"church\") and Turm (\"tower\").",
        "often, one high frequent part of the (possible) compound determines the split of a word, even though the other part(s) are much less frequent.",
        "This is the case for Belangen (442 occurrences), where the high frequent Gen (\"gene\", 1,397 occurrences) leads to a splitting of the word, even though the proper name Bela is much less frequent (165 occurrences).",

        "See footnote 5 in section 3.2, for the list of stopwords we used in our implementation.",
        "Previous approaches to corpus-driven compound splitting used a part-of-speech (Pos) tagger to reduce the number of erroneous analyses (e.g. (Koehn and Knight, 2003), (Stymne, 2008)): the word class of the rightmost (possible) part of the compound is restricted to match the word class of the whole compound, which is coherent to German compositional morphology.",
        "This constraint lead to higher accuracies in gold standard evaluations, but it did not improve translation quality in the experiments of Koehn and Knight (2003) and Stymne (2008), and therefore, we did not reimplement the corpus-driven approach with this Pos-constraint.",
        "However, some of the errors presented in this section could have been prevented if the Pos-constraint was used: the erroneous splits of lebenstreuen and traumatisch were avoided, but for the splittings of Belangen and entbrannte, the Pos-constraint would not help.",

        "During the development of the hybrid splitting approach, we did an extensive gold standard evaluation along the way, as described in section 4.1 above.",
        "The performance of the hybrid approach is limited by the performance of its constituents, namely the coverage of Smor and the quality of the corpus from which part frequencies are derived.",

        "frequency-based: Smor found the correct split, but",
        "a wrong split was scored higher unknown to SMOR: lexeme or rule missing in Smor lexicalized in SMOR: lexeme exists in Smor, but fully lexicalized (no splitting possible)",

        "As the corpus-driven approach uses the same disambiguation component, there must be an overlap of the frequency-based errors of the two approaches.",
