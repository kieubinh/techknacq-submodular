      "text": [
        "To solve the word-order problem between SVO languages and SOV langugages, we introduced a new reordering rule called Head Finalization.",
        "This rule is simple, and we do not have to consider POS tags or rule weights.",
        "We also showed that this reordering improved automatic evaluation scores of English-to-Japanese translation.",
        "Improvement of the BLEU score is not very impressive, but other evaluation scores (WER, TER, LOUGE-L, and IMPACT) are greatly improved.",
        "However, Head Finalization requires a sophisticated HPSG tagger such as Enju.",
        "We showed that severe failures are caused by Enju's POS tagging mistakes.",
        "We discussed the problems ofother parsers and how to solve them.",
        "Our future work is to build our own parser that makes fewer errors and to apply Head Finalization to other SOV languages such as Korean."
