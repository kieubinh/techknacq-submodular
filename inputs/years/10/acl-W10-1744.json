        "The scheme consists of aligning 1-best outputs from each system using the METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) aligner, identifying candidate combinations by forming left-to-right paths through the aligned system outputs, and scoring these candidates using a battery of features.",

        "Confusion networks (Rosti et al., 2008) are the most popular form of system combination.",

        "This backbone determines word order while other outputs vote for substitution, deletion, and insertion operations.",
        "Essentially, the backbone is edited to produce a combined output which largely preserves word order.",
        "Our approach differs in that we allow paths to switch between sentences, effectively permitting the backbone to switch at every word.",
        "Other system combination techniques typically use TER (Snover et al., 2006) or ITGs (Karakos et al., 2008) to align system outputs, meaning they depend solely on positional information to find approximate matches; we explicitly use stem, synonym, and paraphrase data to find alignments.",
        "Our use of paraphrases is similar to Leusch et al.",

        "Synonyms come from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and are only available in English.",

        "Tokens that METEOR aligned are alternatives and cannot both be used.",
        "Weak Monotonicity This prevents the scheme from reordering too much.",
        "Specifically, the path cannot jump backwards more than r tokens, where positions are measured relative to the beginning of sentence.",
        "It cannot make a series of smaller jumps that add up to more than r either.",
        "Equivalently, once a token in the ith position of some system output is used, all tokens before the i â€“ rth position in their respective system outputs become unusable.",
        "The value of r is a hyperparameter considered in Section 6.",
        "Completeness Tokens may not be skipped unless the sentence ends or another constraint would be violated.",
        "Specifically, when a token from some system is used, it must be the first (leftmost in the system output) available token from that system.",
        "For example, the first decoded token must be the first token output by some system.",
        "Together, these define the search space.",
        "The candidate starts at the beginning of sentence by choosing the first token from any system.",
        "Then it can either continue with the next token from the same system or switch to another one.",
        "When it switches to another system, it does so to the first available token from the new system.",
        "The repetition constraint requires that the token does not repeat content.",
        "The weak monotonicity constraint ensures that the jump to the new system goes at most r words back.",
        "The process repeats until the end of sentence token is encountered.",
        "The previous version (Heafield et al., 2009) also had a hard phrase constraint and heuristics to define a phrase; this has been replaced with new match features.",
        "Search is performed using beam search where the beam contains partial candidates of the same length, each of which starts with the beginning of sentence token.",
        "In our experiments, the beam size is 500.",
        "When two partial candidates will extend in the same way (namely, the set of available tokens is the same) and have the same feature state (i.e. language model history), they are recombined.",

        "Section 5.2 details our training data and backoff features.",
        "Features are combined into a score using a linear model.",
        "Equivalently, the score is the dot product of a weight vector with the vector of our feature values.",
        "The weight vector is a parameter optimized in Section 6.",
        "The n-gram match features reward agreement between the candidate combination and underlying system outputs.",
        "For example, feature m1;1 counts tokens in the candidate that also appear in system 1 's output for the sentence being combined.",
        "Feature m1)2 counts bigrams appearing in both the candidate and the translation suggested by system 1 .",

        "This can be seen in Figure 2 where System 1's unigram match count includes \"Supported\" even though the candidate chose \"Support\".",
        "Longer matches are defined similarly: a bigram match consists of two consecutive alignments without reordering.",
        "Since METEOR generates several types of alignments as shown in Figure 1, we wonder whether all alignment types should count as matches.",
        "If we count all types of alignment, then the match features are blind to lexical choice, leaving only the language model to discriminate.",
        "If only exact alignments count, then less systems are able to vote on a word order decision mediated by the bigram and trigram features.",
        "We find that both versions have their advantages, and therefore include two sets of match features: one that counts only exact alignments and another that counts all alignments.",
        "We also tried copies of the match features at the stem and synonym level but found these impose additional tuning cost with no measurable improvement in quality.",
        "Since systems have different strengths and weaknesses, we avoid assigning a single system confidence (Rosti et al., 2008) or counting n-gram matches with uniform system confidence (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2009).",
        "The weight on match feature msn corresponds to our confidence in n-grams from system s. These weights are fully tunable.",
