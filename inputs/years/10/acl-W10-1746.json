        "System Combination refers to the method of combining output of multiple MT systems, to produce a output better than each individual system.",
        "Currently, there are several approaches to machine translation which can be classified as phrase-based, hierarchical, syntax-based (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008) which are equally good in their translation quality even though the underlying frameworks are completely different.",
        "The motivation behind System Combination arises from this diversity in the state-of-art MT systems, which suggests that systems with different paradigms make different errors, and can be made better by combining their strengths.",
        "One approach of combining translations is based on representing translations by confusion network and then aligning these confusion networks using string alignment algorithms (Rosti et.al, 2009), (Karakos and Khudanpur, 2008).",
        "Another approach generates features for every translation to train algorithms for ranking systems based on their quality and the top ranking output is considered to be a candidate translation, (Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008) is an example of ranking based combination.",
        "We use ideas from ranking based approaches to learn order in which systems should be aligned in a confusion network based approach.",
        "Our approach is based on incremental alignment of confusion networks (Karakos et.al, 2008), wherein each system output is represented by a confusion network.",
        "The confusion networks are then aligned in a predefined order to generate a combination output.",
        "This paper contributes two enhancements to (Karakos et.al, 2008).",
        "First, use of Support Vector Machines to learn order in which the system outputs should be aligned.",
        "Second, we explore use of Google n-grams for building dynamic language model and interpolate the resulting language model with a large static language model for rescoring of system combination outputs.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 illustrates the idea and pipeline of the baseline combination system; Section 3 gives details of SVM ranking for learning system order for combination; Section 4 explains use of Google n-gram based language models; Results are discussed in Section 5; Concluding remarks are given in Section 6;"

        "Two alternatives for deciding the system order are discussed in Section 3.",
        "Inversion-Transduction Grammar (Wu, 1997) is used for alignments and the cost function for aligning two confusion networks is where b1 and b2 are two different bins, | b11 and | b21 is the number of tokens in bland b2 respectively, c(v) and c(w) are the number of words of token v and token w. which are in b1 and b2 separately.",
        "The idea of this cost is to compute the probability that a word from bin b1 is not equal to a word from bin b2.",
        "The final confusion network is rescored with a 5-gram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "To generate the final output, we need to find the best (minimum-cost) path through the rescored confusion network.",
