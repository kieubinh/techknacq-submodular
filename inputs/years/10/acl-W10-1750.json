        "Current automatic similarity measures for Machine Translation (MT) evaluation operate all, without exception, at the segment level.",
        "Translations are analyzed on a segment-by-segmentfashion, ignoring the text structure.",
        "Document and system scores are obtained using aggregate statistics over individual segments.",
        "This strategy presents the main disadvantage of ignoring cross-sentential/discursive phenomena.",
        "In this work we suggest widening the scope of evaluation methods.",
        "We have defined genuine document-level measures which are able to exploit the structure of text to provide more informed evaluation scores.",
        "For that purpose we take advantage of two coincidental facts.",
        "First, test beds employed in recent MT evaluation campaigns include a document structure grouping sentences related to the same event, story or topic (Przybocki et al., 2008; Przybocki et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2009).",
        "Second, we count on automatic linguistic processors which provide very detailed discourselevel representations oftext (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Discourse representations allow us to focus on relevant pieces of information, such as the agent (who), location (where), time (when), and theme (what), which may be spread all over the text.",
        "Counting on a means of discerning the events, the individuals taking part in each of them, and their role, is crucial to determine the semantic equivalence between a reference document and a candidate translation.",
        "Moreover, the discourse analysis of a document is not a mere concatenation of the analyses of its individual sentences.",
        "There are some phenomena which may go beyond the scope of a sentence and can only be explained within the context of the whole document.",
        "For instance, in a newspaper article, facts and entities are progressively added to the discourse and then referred to anaphorically later on.",
        "The following extract from the development set illustrates the importance of such a phenomenon in the discourse analysis: 'Among the current or underlying crises in the Middle East, Rod Larsen mentioned the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Iranian nuclear portfolio, as well as the crisis between Lebanon and Syria.",
        "He stated: \"All this leads us back to crucial values and opinions, which render the situation prone at any moment to getting out ofcontrol, more so than it was in past days.\"''.",
        "The subject pronoun \"he\" works as an anaphoric pronoun whose antecedent is the proper noun \"Rod Larson\" .",
        "The anaphoric relation established between these two elements can only be identified by analyzing the text as a whole, thus considering the gender agreement between the third person singular masculine subject pronoun \"he\" and the masculine proper noun \"Rod Larson \".",
        "However, if the two sentences were analyzed separately, the identification of this anaphoric relation would not be feasible due to the lack of connection between the two elements.",
        "Discourse representations allow us to trace links across sentences between the different facts and entities appearing in them.",
        "Therefore, providing an approach to the text more similar to that of a human, which implies taking into account the whole text structure instead of considering each sentence separately.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes our evaluation methods and the linguistic theory upon which they are based.",
        "Experimental results are reported and discussed in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 presents the metric submitted to the evaluation challenge.",
        "Future work is outlined in Section 5.",
        "As an additional result, document-level metrics generated in this study have been incorporated to the IQmt package for automatic MT evaluation."

        "This section provides a brief description of our approach.",
        "First, in Section 2.1, we describe the underlying theory and give examples on its capabilities.",
        "Then, in Section 2.2, we describe the associated similarity measures.",
        "As previously mentioned in Section 1, a document has some features which need to be analyzed considering it as a whole instead of dividing it up into sentences.",
        "The anaphoric relation between a subject pronoun and a proper noun has already been exemplified.",
        "However, this is not the only anaphoric relation which can be found inside a text, there are some others which are worth mentioning:",
        "• the connection between a possessive adjective and a proper noun or a subject pronoun, as exemplified in the sentences \"Maria bought a new sweater Her new sweater is blue \" , where the possessive feminine adjective \"her\" refers to the proper noun \"Maria\" .",
        "• the link between a demonstrative pronoun and its referent, which is exemplified in the sentences \"He developed a new theory on grammar However, this is not the only theory he developed\" .",
        "In the second sentence, the demonstrative pronoun \"this\" refers back to the noun phrase \"new theory on grammar\" which occurs in the previous sentence.",
        "• the relation between a main verb and an auxiliary verb in certain contexts, as illustrated in the following pair of sentences \"Would you",
        "like more sugar?",
        "Yes, I would\".",
        "In this example, the auxiliary verb \"would\" used in the short answer substitutes the verb phrase \"would like\" .",
        "In addition to anaphoric relations, other features need to be highlighted, such as the use ofdiscourse markers which help to give cohesion to the text, link parts of a discourse and show the relations established between them.",
        "Below, some examples are given:",
        "• \"Moreover\", \"Furthermore\", \"In addition\" indicate that the upcoming sentence adds more information.",
        "• \"However\", \"Nonetheless\", \"Nevertheless\" show contrast with previous ideas.",
        "• \"Therefore\", \"As a result\", \"Consequently\" show a cause and effect relation.",
        "• \"For instance\", \"For example\" clarify or illustrate the previous idea.",
        "It is worth noticing that anaphora, as well as discourse markers, are key features in the interface between syntax, semantics and pragmatics.",
        "Thus, when dealing with these phenomena at a text level we are not just looking separately at the different language levels, but we are trying to give a complete representation of both the surface and the deep structures of a text.",
        "In this work, as a first proposal, instead of elaborating on novel similarity measures, we have borrowed and extended the Discourse Representation (DR) metrics defined by Gimenez and Marquez (2009).",
        "These metrics analyze similarities between automatic and reference translations by comparing their respective discourse representations over individual sentences.",
        "For the discursive analysis of texts, DR metrics rely on the C&C Tools (Curran et al., 2007), specifically on the Boxer component (Bos, 2008).",
        "This software is based on the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) by Kamp and Reyle (1993).",
        "DRT is a theoretical framework offering a representation language for the examination of contextually dependent meaning in discourse.",
        "A discourse is represented in a discourse representation structure (DRS), which is essentially a variation of first-order predicate calculus – its forms are pairs of first-order formulae and the free variables that occur in them.",
        "DRSs are viewed as semantic trees, built through the application of two types of DRS conditions:",
        "basic conditions: one-place properties (predicates), two-place properties (relations), named entities, time-expressions, cardinal expressions and equalities.",
        "complex conditions: disjunction, implication, negation, question, and propositional attitude operations.",
        "For instance, the DRS representation for the sentence \"Every man loves Mary.\"",
        "is as follows:",
        "3y named(y, mary, per) A (Va; man(x) – > 3z love(z) A event(z) A agent(z,x) A patient(z,y)).",
        "DR integrates three different kinds of metrics:",
        "DR-STM These metrics are similar to the Syntactic Tree Matching metric defined by Liu and Gildea (2005), in this case applied to DRSs instead of constituent trees.",
        "All semantic sub-paths in the candidate and reference trees are retrieved.",
        "The fraction of matching subpaths of a given length (1=4 in our experiments) is computed.",
        "DR-Or(*) Average lexical overlap between discourse representation structures of the same type.",
        "Overlap is measured according to the formulae and definitions by Gimenez and Marquez (2007).",
        "DR-Orp(*) Average morphosyntactic overlap, i.e., between grammatical categories -parts-of-speech- associated to lexical items, between discourse representation structures of the same type.",
        "We have extended these metrics to operate at document level.",
        "For that purpose, instead of running the C&C Tools in a sentence-by-sentence fashion, we run them document by document.",
        "This is as simple as introducing a \"<META>\" tag at the beginning of each document to denote document boundaries."

        "The total number of segments is 249.",
        "The average number of segments per document is, thus, 9.96.",

        "Each translation segment was assessed by two judges.",
        "After independently and completely assessing the entire set, the judges reviewed their individual assessments together and settled on a single final score.",

        "In our experiments, metrics are evaluated in terms of their correlation with human assessments.",
        "We have computed Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients between metric scores and adequacy assessments.",

        "We have computed correlation coefficients and confidence intervals applying bootstrap resampling at a 99% statistical significance (Efron and Tibshirani, 1986; Koehn, 2004).",
        "Since the cost of exhaustive resampling was prohibitive, we have limited to 1,000 resamplings.",
        "Confidence intervals, not shown in the tables, are in all cases lower than 10~.",
        "Table 1 shows correlation coefficients at the document level for several DR metric representatives, and their document-level counterparts (DR<ioc).",
        "For the sake of comparison, the performance of the METEOR metric is also reported.",
        "Contrary to our expectations, DRioc variants obtain lower levels of correlation than their DR counterparts.",
        "There are three different factors which could provide a possible explanation for this negative result.",
        "First, the C&C Tools, like any other automatic linguistic processor are not perfect.",
        "Parsing errors could be causing the metric to confer less informed scores.",
        "This is especially relevant taking into account that candidate translations are not always well-formed.",
        "Secondly, we argue that the way in which we have obtained document-level quality assessments, as an average of segment-level assessments, may be biasing the correlation.",
        "Thirdly, perhaps the similarity measures employed are not able to take advantage of the document-level features provided by the discourse analysis.",
        "In the following subsection we show some error analysis we have conducted by inspecting particular cases.",
        "Table 2 shows correlation coefficients at system level.",
        "In the case of DR and DRioc metrics, system scores are computed by simple average over individual documents.",
        "Interestingly, in this case DRioc variants seem to obtain higher correlation than their DR counterparts.",
        "The improvement is especially substantial in terms of Spearman and Kendall coefficients, which do not consider absolute values but ranking positions.",
        "However, it could be the case that it was just an average effect.",

        "In order to clarify this result, we have modified DR metrics so as to compute system scores as an average of document scores (DR' variants, the last three rows in the table).",
        "It can be observed that DR' variants outperform their DR<ioc counterparts, thus confirming our suspicion about the averaging effect.",
        "It is worth noting that DR<ioc metrics are able to detect and deal with several linguistic phenomena related to both syntax and semantics at sentence and document level.",

        "In Example 1 a couple of control structures must be identified and DR(ioc metrics deal correctly with the argument structure of all the verbs involved.",
        "Thus, in the first part of the sentence, a subject control verb can be identified being \"the minister \" the agent of both verb forms \"go\" and \"say\".",
        "On the other hand, in the quoted question, the verb \"invite\" works as an object control verb because its patient \"Chechen representatives\" is also the agent of the verb visit.",
