        "Alignments are formed in two stages: search space construction and alignment selection.",

        "Stem: Words are stemmed using a language-appropriate Snowball Stemmer (Porter, 2001) and matched if the stems are identical.",
        "Synonym: Words are matched if they are both members of a synonym set according to the WordNet (Miller and Fellbaum, 2007) database.",
        "Paraphrase: Phrases are matched if they are listed as paraphrases in a paraphrase table.",
        "The tables used are described in Section 3.",
        "Previously, full support has been limited to English, with French, German, and Spanish having exact and stem match support only, and Czech having exact match support only.",
        "Although the exact, stem, and synonym matchers identify word matches while the paraphrase matcher identifies phrase matches, all matches can be generalized to phrase matches with a start position and phrase length in each string.",
