        "Many natural language processing applications, such as machine translation (MT), parsing, and language modeling, benefit from the N-best reranking framework (Shen et al., 2004; Collins and Koo, 2005; Roark et al., 2007).",
        "The advantage of N-best reranking is that it abstracts away the complexities of first-pass decoding, allowing the researcher to try new features and learning algorithms with fast experimental turnover.",
        "In the N-best reranking scenario, the training data consists of sets of hypotheses (i.e. N-best lists) generated by a first-pass system, along with their labels.",
        "Given a new N-best list, the goal is to rerank it such that the best hypothesis appears near the top of the list.",
        "Existing research have focused on training a single reranker directly on the entire data.",
        "This approach is reasonable if the data is homogenous, but it fails when features vary significantly across different N-best lists.",
        "In particular, when one employs sparse feature sets, one seldom finds features that are simultaneously active on multiple N-best lists.",
        "In this case, we believe it is more advantageous to view the N-best reranking problem as a multitask learning problem, where each N-best list corresponds to a distinct task.",
        "Multitask learning, a subfield of machine learning, focuses on how to effectively train on a set of different but related datasets (tasks).",
        "Our heterogenous N-best list data fits nicely with this assumption.",
        "The contribution of this work is three-fold:",
        "1.",
        "We introduce the idea of viewing N-best reranking as a multitask learning problem.",
        "This view is particularly apt to any general reranking problem with sparse feature sets.",
        "2.",
        "We propose a simple meta-algorithm that first discovers common feature representations across N-bests (via multitask learning) before training a conventional reranker.",
        "Thus it is easily applicable to existing systems.",

        "We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the conventional reranking approach on a English-Japanese biomedical machine translation task involving millions of features.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the feature sparsity problem and Section 3 presents our multitask solution.",
        "The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated by experiments demonstrated in Section 4.",

        "For concreteness, we will describe N-best rerank-ing in terms of machine translation (MT), though our approach is agnostic to the application.",
        "In MT reranking, the goal is to translate a foreign language sentence f into an English sentence e by picking from a set of likely translations.",
        "A standard approach is to use a linear model:",
        "arg max wT where h(e, f ) is a D-dimensional feature vector, w is the weight vector to be trained, and N(f ) is the set of likely translations of f, i.e. the N-best list.",
        "The feature h(e, f ) can be any quantity defined in terms of the sentence pair, such as translation model and language model probabilities.",
        "Here we are interested in situations where the feature definitions can be quite sparse.",
        "A common methodology in reranking is to first design feature templates based on linguistic intuition and domain knowledge.",
        "Then, numerous features are instantiated based on the training data seen.",
        "For example, the work of (Watanabe et al., 2007) defines feature templates based on bilingual word alignments, which lead to extraction of heavily-lexicalized features of the form:",
        "One can imagine that such features are sparse because it may only fire for input sentences that contain the word \"Monsieur\".",
        "For all other input sentences, it is an useless, inactive feature.",
        "Another common feature involves word ngram templates, for example:",
        "{ 1 if English trigram \"Mr. Smith said\" occurs in e 0 otherwise",
        "In this case, all possible trigrams seen in the N-best list are extracted as features.",
        "One can see that this kind of feature can be very sensitive to the first-pass decoder: if the decoder has loose reordering constraints, then we may extract exponentially many nonsense ngram features such as \"Smith said Mr.\" and \"said Smith Mr.\".",
        "Granted, the reranker training algorithm may learn that these nonsense ngrams are indicative of poor hypotheses, but it is unlikely that the exact same nonsense ngrams will appear given a different test sentence.",
        "In summary, the following issues compound to create extremely sparse feature sets:",
        "1.",
        "Feature templates are heavily-lexicalized, which causes the number of features to grow unbounded as the the amount of data increases.",
        "2.",
        "The input (f ) has high variability (e.g. large vocabulary size), so that features for different inputs are rarely shared.",
        "3.",
        "The N-best list output also exhibits high variability (e.g. many different word reorder-ings).",
        "Larger N may improve reranking performance, but may also increase feature sparsity.",
        "When the number of features is too large, even popular reranking algorithms such as SVM (Shen et al., 2004) and MIRA (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2009) may fail.",
        "Our goal here is to address this situation."

        "In the following, we first give an intuitive comparison between single vs. multiple task learning (Section 3.1), before presenting the general meta-algorithm (Section 3.2) and particular instantiations (Section 3.3).",
        "Given a set of I input sentences {f*}, the training data for reranking consists of a set of I N-best lists {(H*, y*)}i=i,...)/, where H* are features and y* are labels.",
        "To clarify the notation: for an input sentence f *, there is a N-best list N(f *).",
        "For a N-best list N(f *), there are N feature vectors corresponding to the N hypotheses, each with dimension D. The collection of feature vectors for N(f *) is represented by H*, which can be seen as a D x N matrix.",
        "Finally, the N-dimensional vector of labels y* indicates the translation quality of each hypothesis in N(f *).",
        "The purpose of the reranker training algorithm is to find good parameters from {(H y* )}.",
        "if foreign word \"Monsieur\" and English word \"Mr.\" co-occur in e,f [ 0 otherwise",
        "The conventional method of training a single reranker (single task formulation) involves optimizing a generic objective such as:",
        "where w G RD is the reranker trained on all lists, and L( ) is some loss function.",
        "Q(w) is an optional regularizer, whose effect is traded-off by the constant A.",
        "For example, the SVM reranker for MT (Shen et al., 2004) defines L( ) to be some function of sentence-level BLEU score, and Q(w) to be the large margin regularizer.",
        "On the other hand, multitask learning involves solving for multiple weights, w,w,...,w, one for each N-best list.",
        "One class of multitask learning algorithms, Joint Regularization, solves the following objective:",
        "The loss decomposes by task but the joint regu-larizer ^(w,w ) couples together the different weight parameters.",
        "The key is to note that multiple weights allow the algorithm to fit the heteroge-nous data better, compared to a single weight vector.",
        "Yet these weights are still tied together so that some information can be shared across N-best lists (tasks).",
        "One instantiation of Eq.",
        "5 is l1 /l2 regular-ization: ^(ww ) = ||W||1;2, where W = [w |w| ... |wI]T is a I-by-D matrix of stacked weight vectors.",
        "The norm is computed by first taking the 2-norm on columns of W, then taking a 1-norm on the resulting D-length vector.",
        "This encourages the optimizer to choose a small subset of features that are useful across all tasks.",
        "For example, suppose two different sets of weight vectors Wa and Wb for a 2 lists, 4 features reranking problem.",
        "The l1/l2 norm for Wais 14; the l1 /l2 norm for Wb is 12.",
        "If both have the same loss L( ) in Eq.",
        "5, the multitask optimizer would prefer Wb since more features are shared:",
        "We are now ready to present our general reranking meta-algorithm (see Algorithm 1), termed Rerank-ing by Multitask Learning (RML).",
        "Algorithm 1 Reranking by Multitask Learning Input: N-best data {(H*, y*)}^^^ Output: Common feature representation hc(e, f ) and weight vector wc",
        "The first step, random hashing, is optional.",
        "Random hashing is an effective trick for reducing the dimension of sparse feature sets without suffering losses in fidelity (Weinberger et al., 2009; Ganchev and Dredze, 2008).",
        "It works by collapsing random subsets of features.",
        "This step can be performed to speed-up multitask learning later.",
        "In some cases, the original feature dimension may be so large that hashed representations may be necessary.",
        "The next two steps are key.",
        "A multitask learning algorithm is run on the N-best lists, and a common feature space shared by all lists is extracted.",
        "For example, if one uses the multitask objective of Eq.",
        "5, the result of step 2 is a set of weights W. ExtractCommonFeature(W) then returns the feature id's (either from original or hashed representation) that receive nonzero weight in any of W. The new features hc(e, f ) are expected to have lower dimension than the original features h(e, f ).",
        "Section 3.3 describes in detail different multitask methods that can be plugged-in to this step.",
        "The final two steps involve a conventional reranker.",
        "In step 4, we remap the N-best list data according to the new feature representations hc(e, f).",
        "In step 5, we train a conventional reranker on this common representation, which by now should have overcome sparsity issues.",
        "Using a conventional reranker at the end allows us to exploit existing rerankers designed for specific NLP applications.",
        "In a sense, our meta-algorithm simply involves a change of representation for the conventional reranking scenario, where the new representation is found by multitask methods which are well-suited to heterogenous data.",
        "Here, we describe various multitask methods that can be plugged in Step 2 of Algorithm 1.",
        "Our goal is to demonstrate that a wide range ofexisting methods from the multitask learning literature can be brought to our problem.",
        "We categorize multitask methods into two major approaches:",
        "1.",
        "Joint Regularization: Eq.",
        "5 is an example of joint regularization, with l1 /l2 norm being a particular regularizer.",
        "The idea is to use the reg-ularizer to ensure that the learned functions of related tasks are close to each other.",
        "The popular l1 /l2 objective can be optimized by various methods, such as boosting (Obozinski et al., 2009) and convex programming (Argyriou et al., 2008).",
        "Yet another regularizer is the norm (Quattoni et al., 2009), which replaces the 2-norm with a max.",
        "One could also define a regularizer to ensure that each task-specific w* is close to some average parameter, e.g. % ||w* – wavg||2.",
        "If we interpret wavg as a prior, we begin to see links to Hierarchical Bayesian methods for multitask learning (Finkel and Manning, 2009; Daume, 2009).",
        "2.",
        "Shared Subspace: This approach assumes that there is an underlying feature subspace that is common to all tasks.",
        "Early works on multitask learning implement this by neural networks, where different tasks have different output layers but share the same hidden layer (Caruana, 1997).",
        "Another method is to write the weight vector as two parts w = [u; v] and let the task-specific function be uT • h(e, f ) + vT • 9 • h(e, f ) (Ando and Zhang, 2005).",
        "9 is a D' x D matrix that maps the original features to a subspace common to all tasks.",
        "The new feature representation is computed by the projection hc(e, f) = 9 • h(e, f).",
        "Multitask learning is a vast field and relates to areas like collaborative filtering (Yu and Tresp, 2005) and domain adaptation.",
        "Most methods assume some common representation and is thus applicable to our framework.",
        "The reader is urged to refer to citations in, e.g. (Argyriou et al., 2008) for a survey."

        "Previous reranking work in NLP can be classified into two different research focuses:",
        "1.",
        "Engineering better features: In MT, (Och and others, 2004) investigates features extracted from a wide variety of syntactic representations, such as parse tree probability on the outputs.",
        "Although their results show that the proposed syntactic features gave little improvements, they point to some potential reasons, such as domain mismatch for the parser and overfitting by the reranking",
        "Table 2: Results for different feature sets, with corresponding feature size and train/test BLEU/PER.",
        "All multitask features give statistically significant improvements over the baselines (boldfaced), e.g.",
        "Shared Subspace: 29.1 BLEU vs Baseline: 28.6 BLEU.",
        "Combinations of multitask features with high frequency features also give significant improvements over the high frequency features alone.",
        "method.",
        "Recent work by (Chiang et al., 2009) describes new features for hierarchical phrase-based MT, while (Collins and Koo, 2005) describes features for parsing.",
        "Evaluation campaigns like (Paul, 2009) also contains a wealth of information for feature engineering in various MT tasks.",
        "2.",
        "Designing better training algorithms: N-best reranking can be seen as a subproblem of structured prediction, so many general structured prediction algorithms (c.f.",
        "(Bakir et al., 2007)) can be applied.",
        "In fact, some structured prediction algorithms, such as the MIRA algorithm used in dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005) and MT (Watanabe et al., 2007) uses iterative sets of N-best lists in its training process.",
        "Other training algorithms include perceptron-style algorithms (Liang et al., 2006), MaxEnt (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), and boosting variants (Kudo etal., 2005).",
        "The division into two research focuses is convenient, but may be suboptimal if the training algorithm and features do not match well together.",
        "Our work can be seen as reconnecting the two focuses, where the training algorithm is explicitly used to help discover better features.",
        "Multitask learning is currently an active subfield within machine learning.",
        "There has already been some applications in NLP: For example, (Col-lobert and Weston, 2008) uses a deep neural network architecture for multitask learning on part-of-speech tagging, chunking, semantic role labeling, etc.",
        "They showed that jointly learning these related tasks lead to overall improvements.",
        "(De-selaers et al., 2009) applies similar methods for machine transliteration.",
        "In information extraction, learning different relation types can be naturally cast as a multitask problem (Jiang, 2009; Carlson et al., 2009).",
        "Our work can be seen as following the same philosophy, but applied to N-best lists.",
        "In other areas, (Reichart et al., 2008) introduced an active learning strategy for annotating multitask linguistic data.",
        "(Blitzer et al., 2006) applies the multitask algorithm of (Ando and Zhang, 2005) to domain adaptation problems in NLP.",
        "We expect that more novel applications of multitask learning will appear in NLP as the techniques become scalable and standard."
