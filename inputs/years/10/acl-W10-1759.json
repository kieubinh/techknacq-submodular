        "Two types of resources are needed to train statistical machine translation (SMT) systems: parallel corpora to train the translation model and monolingual texts in the target language to build the language model.",
        "The performance of both models depends of course on the quality and quantity of the available resources.",
        "Today, most SMT systems are generic, i.e. the same system is used to translate texts of all kinds.",
        "Therefore, it is the domain of the training resources that influences the translations that are selected among several choices.",
        "While monolingual texts are in general easily available in many domains, the freely available parallel texts mainly come from international organisations, like the European Union or the United Nations.",
        "These texts, written in particular jargon, are usually much larger than in-domain bitexts.",
        "As an example we can cite the development of an NIST Arabic/English phrase-based translation system.",
        "The current NIST test sets are composed of a news wire part and a second part of web-style texts.",
        "For both domains, there is only a small number of in-domain bitexts available, in comparison to almost 200 millions words of out-of-domain UN texts.",
        "The later corpus is therefore likely to dominate the estimation of the probability distributions of the translation model.",
        "It is common practice to use a mixture language model with coefficients that are optimized on the development data, i.e. by these means on the domain of the translation task.",
        "Domain adaptation seems to be more tricky for the translation model and it seems that very little research has been done that seeks to apply similar ideas to the translation model.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no commonly accepted method to weight the bitexts coming from different sources so that the translation model is best optimized to the domain of the task.",
        "Mixture models are possible when only two different bitexts are available, but are rarely used for more corpora (see discussion in the next section).",
        "In this work we propose a new method to adapt the translation model of an SMT system.",
        "We only perform experiments with phrase-based systems, but the method is generic and could be easily applied to an hierarchical or syntax-based system.",
        "We first associate a weighting coefficient to each bitext.",
        "The main idea is to use resampling to produce a new collection of weighted alignment files, followed by the standard procedure to extract the phrases.",
        "In a second step, we also consider the alignment score of each parallel sentence pair, emphasizing by these means good alignments and down-weighting less reliable ones.",
        "All the parameters of our procedure are automatically tuned by optimizing the BLEU score on the development data.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",

        "This additional table was used with the existing generic phrase table.",
        "(Ueffing, 2007) further refined this approach by using transduc-tive semi-supervised methods for effective use of monolingual data from the source text.",

        "(Matsoukas et al., 2009) propose to weight each sentence in the training bitext by optimizing a discriminative function on a given tuning set.",
        "Sentence level features were extracted to estimate the weights that are relevant to the given task.",
        "Then certain parts of the training bitexts were down-weighted to optimize an objective function on the development data.",
        "This can lead to parameter over-fitting if the function that maps sentence features to weights is complex.",
        "The technique proposed in this paper is somehow related to the above approach of weighting the texts.",
        "Our method does not require an explicit specification of the in-domain and out-of-domain training data.",
        "The weights of the corpora are directly optimized on the development data using a numerical method, similar to the techniques used in the standard minimum error training of the weights of the feature functions in the log-linear criterion.",
        "All the alignments of the bitexts are re-sampled and given equal chance to be selected and therefore, influence the translation model in a different way.",

        "Resampling is used for validating models on given data set by using random subsets.",
        "It overcomes the limitations to make assumptions about the distribution of the data.",

        "We are not aware of a procedure to calculate these coefficients in an easy and fast way without building an actual SMT system.",
        "Note that there is an EM procedure to do this for language modeling.",
        "In the next section, we will experimentally compare equal coefficients, coefficients set to the same values than those obtained when building an interpolated language model on the source language, and a new method to determine the coefficients by optimizing the BLEU score on the development data.",
        "One could imagine to directly use these coefficients when calculating the various probabilities of the extracted phrases.",
        "In this work, we propose a different procedure that makes no assumptions on how the phrases are extracted and probabilities are calculated.",

        "Secondly when sentences are aligned, some alignments are reliable and some are less.",
