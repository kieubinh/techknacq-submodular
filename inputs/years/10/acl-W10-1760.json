        "The task of word segmentation, i.e., identifying word boundaries in continuous text, is one of the fundamental preprocessing steps of data-driven NLP applications like Machine Translation (MT).",
        "In contrast to Indo-European languages like English, many Asian languages like Chinese do not use a whitespace character to separate meaningful word units.",
        "The problems of word segmentation are:",
        "(1) ambiguity, e.g., for Chinese, a single character can be a word component in one context, but a word by itself in another context.",
        "(2) unknown words, i.e., existing words can be combined into new words such as proper nouns, e.g. \"White House''.",
        "Purely dictionary-based approaches like (Cheng et al., 1999) addressed these problems by maximum matching heuristics.",
        "Recent research on unsupervised word segmentation focuses on approaches based on probabilistic methods.",
        "For example, (Brent, 1999) proposes a probabilistic segmentation model based on unigram word distributions, whereas (Venkataraman, 2001) uses standard n-gram language models.",
        "An alternative non-parametric Bayesian inference approach based on the Dirichlet process incorporating unigram and bigram word dependencies is introduced in (Gold-water et al., 2006).",
        "The focus of this paper, however, is to learn word segmentations that are consistent with phrasal segmentations of SMT translation models.",
        "In case of small translation units, e.g. single Chinese or Japanese characters, it is likely that such tokens have been seen in the training corpus, thus these tokens can be translated by an SMT engine.",
        "However, the contextual information provided by these tokens might not be enough to obtain a good translation.",
        "For example, a Japanese-English SMT engine might translate the two successive characters \"Ü\" (\"white\") and \"J^>\" (\"bird\") as \"white bird\", while a human would translate \" \" as \"swan\".",
        "Therefore, the longer the translation unit, the more context can be exploited to find a meaningful translation.",
        "On the other hand, the longer the translation unit, the less likely it is that such a token will occur in the training data due to data sparseness of the language resources utilized to train the statistical translation models.",
        "Therefore, a word segmentation that is \"consistent with SMT models\" is one that identifies translation units that are small enough to be translatable, but large enough to be meaningful in the context of the given input sentence, achieving a trade-off between the coverage and the translation task complexity of the statistical models in order to improve translation quality.",
        "The use of monolingual probabilistic models does not necessarily yield a better MT performance (Chang et al., 2008).",
        "However, improvements have been reported for approaches taking into account not only monolingual, but also bilingual information, to derive a word segmentation suitable for SMT.",
        "Due to the availability of language resources, most recent research has focused on optimizing Chinese word segmentation (CWS) for Chinese-to-English SMT.",
        "For example, (Xu et al., 2008) proposes a Bayesian Semi-Supervised approach for CWS that builds on (Goldwater et al., 2006).",
        "The generative model first segments Chinese text using an off-the-shelf segmenter and then learns new word types and word distributions suitable for SMT.",
        "Similarly, a dynamic programming-based variational Bayes approach using bilingual information to improve MT is proposed in (Chung and Gildea, 2009).",
        "Concerning other languages, for example, (Kikui and Yamamoto, 2002) extended Hidden-Markov-Models, where hidden n-gram probabilities were affected by co-occurring words in the target language part for Japanese word segmentation.",
        "Recent research on SMT is also focusing on the usage of multiple word segmentation schemes for the source language to improve translation quality.",
        "For example, (Zhang et al., 2008) combines dictionary-based and CRF-based approaches for Chinese word segmentation in order to avoid out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "Moreover, the combination of different morphological decomposition of highly inflected languages like Arabic or Finnish is proposed in (de Gispert et al., 2009) to reduce the data sparseness problem of SMT approaches.",
        "Similarly, (Nakov et al., 2009) utilizes SMT engines trained on different word segmentation schemes and combines the translation outputs using system combination techniques as a post-process to SMT decoding.",
        "In order to integrate multiple word segmentation schemes into the SMT decoder, (Dyer et al., 2008) proposed to generate word lattices covering all possible segmentations of the input sentence and to decode the lattice input.",
        "An extended version of the lattice approach that does not require the use (and existence) of monolingual segmentation tools was proposed in (Dyer, 2009) where a maximum entropy model is used to assign probabilities to the segmentations of an input word to generate diverse segmentation lattices from a single automatically learned model.",
        "The method of (Ma and Way, 2009) also uses a word lattice decoding approach, but they iteratively extract multiple word segmentation schemes from the training bitext.",
        "This dictionary-based approach uses heuristics based on the maximum matching algorithm to obtain an agglomeration of segments that are covered by the dictionary.",
        "It uses all possible source segmentations that are consistent with the extracted dictionary to create a word lattice for decoding.",
        "The method proposed in this papers differs from previous approaches in the following points:",
        "• it works for any language pair where the source language is unsegmented and the target language segmentation is known.",
        "• it can be applied for the translation of a source language where no linguistically motivated word segmentation tools are available.",
        "• it applies machine learning techniques to identify segmentation schemes that improve translation quality for a given language pair.",
        "• it decodes directly from unsegmented text using segmentation information implicit in the phrase-table to generate the target and thus avoids issues of consistency between phrase-table and input representation.",
        "• it uses segmentations at all iterative levels of the bootstrap process, rather than only those from the final iteration allowing the consideration of segmentations from many levels of granularity.",
        "Word segmentations are learned using a parallel corpus by aligning character-wise source language sentences to word units separated by a white-space in the target language.",
        "Successive characters aligned to the same target words are merged into a larger source language unit.",
        "Therefore, the granularity of the translation unit is defined in the given bitext context.",
        "In order to minimize the side effects of alignment errors and to achieve segmentation consistency, a Maximum-Entropy (ME) algorithm is applied to learn the source language word segmentation that is consistent with the translation model of an SMT system trained on the re-segmented bitext.",
        "The process is iterated until no further improvement in translation quality is achieved.",
        "In order to integrate multiple word segmentation into a single SMT system, the statistical translation models trained on differently segmented source language corpora are merged by characterizing the source side of each translation model, summing up the probabilities of identical phrase translation pairs, and rescoring the merged translation model (see Section 2).",
        "The proposed segmentation method is applied to the translation of five Asian languages, i.e., Japanese, Korean, Thai, and two Chinese dialects (Standard Mandarin and Taiwanese Mandarin), into English.",
        "The utilized language resources and the outline of the experiments are summarized in Section 3.",
        "The experimental results revealed that the proposed method outperforms not only a baseline system that translates characterized source language sentences, but also all SMT models trained on any of the learned word segmentations.",

        "Using these alignment-based word boundary annotations, a Maximum-Entropy (ME) method is applied to learn the word segmentation consistent with the SMT translation model (see Section 2.1), to resegment the original source language corpus, and to retrain a phrase-based SMT engine that will hopefully achieve a better translation performance than the initial SMT engine.",
        "This process should be repeated as long as an improvement in translation quality is achieved.",
        "Eventually, the concatenation of succeeding translation units will result in overfitting, i.e., the newly created token can only be translated in the context of rare training data examples.",
        "Therefore, a lower translation quality due to an increase of untranslatable source language phrases is to be expected (see Section 2.2).",
        "However, in order to increase the coverage and to reduce the translation task complexity of the statistical models, the proposed method integrates multiple segmentation schemes into the statistical translation models of a single SMT engine so that longer translation units are preferred for translation, if available, and smaller translation units can be used otherwise (see Section 2.3).",

        "This paper proposes a new language-independent method to segment languages that do not use whitespace characters to separate meaningful word units in an unsupervised manner in order to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art SMT system.",
        "The proposed method does not need any linguistic information about the source language which is important when building SMT systems for the translation of relatively resource-poor languages which frequently lack morphological analysis tools.",
        "In addition, the development costs are far less than those for developing linguistic word segmentation tools or even paying humans to segment the data sets manually, since only the bilingual corpus used to train the SMT system is needed to train the segmenter.",
        "The effectiveness of the proposed method was investigated for the translation of Japanese, Korean, Thai, and two Chinese dialects (Standard Mandarin and Taiwanese Mandarin) into English for the domain of travel conversations.",
        "The automatic evaluation of the translation results showed consistent improvements of 2.0 to 9.1 bleu points and 2.0 to 5.9 meteor points compared to a baseline system that translates characterized input.",
        "Moreover, it improves the best performing SMT engine of the iterative learning procedure by 0.4 to 1.6 bleu points and 0.7 to 4.6 meteor points.",
        "In addition, the proposed method achieved translation results similar to SMT models trained on bitext segmented with linguistically motivated tools, even outperforming these for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese in the human evaluation, although no external information and only the given bitext was used to train the segmentation models.",
        "The experiments using Thai are interesting because the script is a segmental writing system using tone markers and vowel dependencies.",
        "This exposed some issues that are related to the definition of what a \"character\" is and motivates further study on how to incorporate features on language scripts into our machine learning framework.",
