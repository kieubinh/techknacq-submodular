        "The exponential growth of the subjective information with Web 2.0 created the need to develop new Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to automatically process and manage the content available on the Internet.",
        "Apart from the traditional textual genres, at present we have new ones such as blogs, forums and reviews.",
        "The main difference between them is that the latter are predominantly subjective, containing personal judgments.",
        "At the moment, NLP tools and methods for analyzing objective information have a better performance than the new ones the research community is creating for managing the subjective content.",
        "The survey called \"The State of the Blogosphere 2009\", published by Tech-norati , demonstrates that users are blogging more than ever.",
        "Furthermore, in contrast to the general idea about bloggers, each day it is more and more the number of professionals who decide to use this means of communication, contradicting the common belief about the predominance of an informal editing (Balahur et al., 2009).",
        "Due to the growing interest in this text type, the subjective data of the Web is increasing on a daily basis, becoming a reflection of people's opinion about a wide range of topics.",
        "(Cui, Mittal and Datar, 2006).",
        "Blogs represent an important source of real-time, unbiased information, useful for the development of many applications for concrete purposes.",
        "Given the proved importance of automatically processing this data, a new task has appeared in NLP task, dealing with the treatment of subjective data: Sentiment Analysis (SA).",
        "The main objective of this paper is to present EmotiBlog (Boldrini et al., 2009), a fine-grained annotation scheme for labeling subjectivity in the new textual genres.",
        "Subjectivity can be reflected in text through expressions of emotions beliefs, views (a way of considering something) and opinions, generally denominated \"private states\" (Uspensky, 1973), not open to verification (Wiebe, 1994).",
        "We performed a series of experiments focused on demonstrating that EmotiBlog represents a step forward to previous research in this field; its use allows a finer-grained and more precise learning of subjectivity expression models.",
        "Starting form (Wiebe, Wilson and Cardie, 2005) we created an annotation schema able to capture a wide range and key elements, which give subjectivity, moving a step forward the mere polarity recognition.",
        "In particular, the experiments concern expressions of emotion, as a finer-grained analysis of affect in text and a subsequent task to opinion mining (OM) and classification.",
        "To that aim, we employ corpora of different textual genres-a set of annotated reported speech extracted from news articles (denominated JRC quotes) (Bala-hur et al., 2010) and the set of news titles annotated with polarity and emotion from the SemE-val 2007 Task No.",
        "14 (Strapparava and Mihal-cea, 2007), as well as a corpus of real-life self-expressed emotion entitled ISEAR (Scherer and Walbott, 1999).",
        "We subsequently show, through the quality of the results obtained, that Emoti-Blog, through its structure and annotation paradigm, offers high quality training for systems dealing both with opinion mining, as well as emotion detection."

      "heading": "3. Motivation and Contribution",
      "text": [
        "The main motivation of this research is the demonstrated necessity to work towards the harmonization and interoperability of the increasingly large number of tools and frameworks that support the creation, instantiation, manipulation, querying, and exploitation of annotated resource.",
        "This necessity is stressed by the new tools and resources, which have been recently created for processing the subjectivity in the new-textual genres born with the Web 2.0.",
        "Such predominantly subjective data is increasing at an exponential rate (about 75000 new blogs are reported to be created every day) and contains opinions on the most diverse set of topics.",
        "Given its worldwide availability, the subjective data on the Web has become a primary source of information (Balahur et al., 2009).",
        "As a consequence, new mechanisms have to be implemented so that this data is effectively analyzed and processed.",
        "The main challenge of the opinionated content is that, unlike the objective one, which presents facts, the subjective information is most of the times difficult and complex to extract and classify using in grammatically static and fixed rules.",
        "Expression of subjectivity is more spontaneous and even if the majority is quite formal, new means of expressivity can be encountered, such as the use of colloquialisms, sayings, collocations or anomalies in the use of punctuation; this is motivated by the fact that subjectivity expression is part of our daily life.",
        "For example, at the time of taking a decision, people search for information and opinions expressed on the Web on their matter of interest and base their final decision on the information found.",
        "At the same time, when using a product, people often write reviews on it, so that others can have a better idea of the performance of that product before purchasing it.",
        "Therefore, on the one hand, the growing volume of opinion information available on the Web allows for better and more informed decisions of the users.",
        "On the other hand, the amount of data to be analyzed requires the development of specialized NLP systems that automatically extract, classify and summarize the data available on the Web on different topics.",
        "(Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) define OM as a recent discipline at the crossroads of Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics, which is concerned not with the topic a document is about, but with the opinion it expresses.",
        "Research in this field has proven the task to be very difficult, due to the high semantic variability of affective language.",
        "Different authors have addressed the problem of extracting and classifying opinion from different perspectives and at different levels, depending on a series of factors which can be level of interest (overall/specific), querying formula (\"Nokia E65\"/\"Why do people buy Nokia E65?",
        "\"), type of text (review on forum/blog/dialogue/press article), and manner of expression of opinion - directly (using opinion statements, e.g. \"I think this product is wonderful!",
        "\"/\"This is a bright initiative\"), indirectly (using affect vocabulary, e.g. \"I love the pictures this camera takes!",
        "\"/\"Personally, I am shocked one can propose such a law! \")",
        "or implicitly (using adjectives and evaluative expressions, e.g. \"It's light as a feather and fits right into my pocket!\"",
        ").",
        "While determining the overall opinion on a movie is sufficient for taking the decision to watch it or not, when buying a product, people are interested in the individual opinions on the different product characteristics.",
        "When discussing a person, one can judge and give opinion on the person's actions.",
        "Moreover, the approaches taken can vary depending on the manner in which a user asks for the data (general formula such as \"opinions on X\" or a specific question \"Why do people like X? \"",
        "and the text source that needs to be queried).",
        "Retrieving opinion information in newspaper articles or blogs posts is more complex, because it involves the detection of different discussion topics, the subjective phrases present and subsequently their classification according to polarity.",
        "Especially in the blog area, determining points of view expressed in dialogues together with the mixture of quotes and pastes from newspapers on a topic can, additionally, involve determining the persons present and whether or not the opinion expressed is on the required topic or on a point previously made by another speaker.",
        "This difficult NLP problem requires the use of specialized data for system training and tuning, gathered, annotated and tested within the different text spheres.",
        "At the present moment, these specialized resources are scarce and when they exist, they are rather simplistically annotated or highly domain-dependent.",
        "Moreover, most of these resources created are for the English.",
        "The contribution we describe in this paper intends to propose solutions to the above-mentioned problems, and consists of the following points: first of all, we overcome the problem of corpora scarcity in other languages except English and also improve the English ones; we present the manner in which we compiled a multilingual corpus of blog posts on different topics of interest in three languages-Spanish, Italian and English.",
        "The second issue we tried to solve was the coarse-grained annotation schemas employed in other annotation schema.",
        "Thus, we describe the new annotation model, EmotiBlog built up in order to capture the different subjectivity/objectivity, emotion/opinion/attitude aspects we are interested in at a finer-grained level.",
        "We justify the need for a more detailed annotation model, the sources and the reasons taken into consideration when constructing the corpus and its annotation.",
        "Thirdly, we address an aspect strongly related to blogs annotation: due the presence of \"copy and pastes\" from news articles or other blogs, the frequent quotes, we include the annotation of both the directly indicated source, as well as the anaphoric references at cross-document level.",
        "We discuss on the problems encountered at different stages and comment upon some of the conclusions we have reached while performing this research.",

        "In recent years, different researchers have addressed the needs and possible methodologies from the linguistic, theoretical and practical points of view.",
        "Thus, the first step involved resided in building lexical resources of affect, such as WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, \"emotion triggers\" (Balahur and Montoyo, 2009).",
        "All these lexicons contain single words, whose polarity and emotions are not necessarily the ones annotated within the resource in a larger context.",
        "We also employed the ISEAR corpus, consisting of phrases where people describe a situation when they felt a certain emotion.",
        "Our work, therefore, concentrates on annotating larger text spans, in order to consider the undeniable influence of the context.",
        "The starting point of research in emotion is represented by (Balahur and Montoyo, 2008), who centered the idea of subjectivity around that of private states, and set the benchmark for subjectivity analysis as the recognition of opinion-oriented language in order to distinguish it from objective language and giving a method to annotate a corpus depending on these two aspects - MPQA (Wiebe, Wilson and Cardie, 2005).",
        "Furthermore, authors show that this initial discrimination is crucial for the sentiment task, as part of Opinion Information Retrieval (last three editions of the TREC Blog tracks competitions, the TAC 2008 competi-tion), Information Extraction (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) and Question Answering (Stoyanov et al., 2004) systems.",
        "Once this discrimination is done, or in the case of texts containing only or mostly subjective language (such as e-reviews), opinion mining becomes a polarity classification task.",
        "Our work takes into consideration this initial discrimination, but we also add a deeper level of emotion annotation.",
        "Since expressions of emotion are also highly related to opinions, related work also includes customer review classification at a document level, sentiment classification using unsupervised methods (Turney, 2002), Machine Learning techniques (Pang and Lee, 2002), scoring of features (Dave, Lawrence and Pennock, 2003), using PMI, syntactic relations and other attributes with SVM (Mullena and Collier, 2004), sentiment classification considering rating scales (Pang and Lee, 2002), supervised and unsupervised methods (Chaovalit and Zhou, 2005) and semisupervised learning (Goldberg and Zhou, 2006).",
        "Research in classification at a document level included sentiment classification of reviews (Ng, Dasgupta and Arifin, 2006), sentiment classification on customer feedback data (Gamon, Aue, Corston-Oliver, Ringger, 2005), comparative experiments (Cui, Mittal and Datar, 2006) .",
        "Other research has been conducted in analysing sentiment at a sentence level using bootstrapping techniques (Riloff, Wiebe, 2003), considering gradable adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou, Wiebe, 2000), semisupervised learning with the initial training some strong patterns and then applying NB or self-training (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) finding strength of opinions (Wolson, Wiebe, Hwa, 2004) sum up orientations of opinion words in a sentence (or within some word window) (Kim and Hovy, 2004), (Wilson and Wiebe, 2004), determining the semantic orientation of words and phrases (Turney and Littman, 2003), identifying opinion holders (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006), comparative sentence and relation extraction and feature-based opinion mining and summarization (Turney, 2002).",
        "Finally, finegrained, feature-based opinion summarization is defined in (Hu and Liu, 2004) and researched in these approaches concentrate on finding and classifying the polarity of opinion words, which are mostly adjectives, without taking into account modifiers or the context in general.",
        "Our work, on the other hand, represents the first step towards achieving a contextual comprehension of the linguistic roots of emotion expression."

        "The EmotiBlog annotation is divided into different levels (Figure 1).",
        "As we can observe in Figure 1, the first distinction to be made is between objective and subjective speech.",
        "If we are labelling an objective sentence, we insert the source element, while if we are annotating a subjective discourse, a list of elements with the corresponding attributes have to be added.",
        "We select among the list of subjective elements and specify the element's attributes.",
        "Table 1 presents the annotation model in detail.",

        "For each element we are labelling the annotator has to insert his level of confidence.",
        "In this way we will assign each label a weight that will be computed for future evaluations.",
        "Moreover, the annotator has to insert the polarity, which can be positive or negative, the level (high, medium, low) and also the sentiment this element is expressing.",
        "Table 2 presents a complete list of the emotions we selected to be part of EmotiBlog.",
        "We grouped all sentiments into subgroups in order to help the evaluation process.",
        "In fact emotions of the same subgroup will have less impact when calculating the interannotation agreement.",
        "In order to make this subdivision proper and effective division, we were inspired by (Scherer, 2005) who created an alternative dimensional structure of the semantic space for emotions.",
        "The graph below represents the mapping of the term Russell (1983) uses for his claim of an emotion circumflex in twodimensional valence by activity/arousal space (upper-case terms).",
        "As we can appreciate, the circle is divided by 4 axes.",
        "Moreover, Scherer distinguishes between positive and negative sentiments and after that between active and passive.",
        "Furthermore emotions are grouped between obstructive and conductive, and finally between high power and low power control.",
        "We started form this classification, grouping sentiments into positive and negative, but we divided them as high/low power control, obstructive/conductive and active/passive.",
        "Further on, we distributed the sentiments within our list into the Scherer slots creating other smaller categories included in the abovementioned general ones.",
        "The result of this division is shown in Table 2:",
        "Following with the description of the model, we said that the first distinction to be made is between objective and subjective speech.",
        "Analysing the texts we collected, we realised that even if the writer uses an objective speech, sometimes it is just apparently objective and for this reason we added two elements: reader and author interpretation.",
        "The first one is the impression/feeling/reaction the reader has reading the intervention and what s/he can deduce from the piece of text and the author interpretation is what we can understand from the author (politic orientation, preferences).",
        "All this information can be deduced form some linguistic elements that apparently are not so objective as they may appear.",
        "Another innovative element we inserted in the model is the coreference but just at a cross-post level.",
        "It is necessary because blogs are composed by posts linked between them and thus crossdocument coreference can help the reader to follow the conversations.",
        "We also label the unusual usage of capital letters and repeated punctuation.",
        "In fact, it is very common in blogs to find words written in capital letter or with no conventional usage of punctuation; these features usually mean shouts or a particular mood of the writer.",
        "Using EmotiBlog, we annotate the single elements, but we also mark sayings or collocations, representative of each language.",
        "A saying is a well-known and wise statement, which often has a meaning, different from the simple meanings of the words it contains; while a collocation is a word or phrase, which is frequently used with another word or phrase, in a way that sounds correct to native speakers, but might not be expected from the individual words' meanings6.",

        "The feature vector for each of the sentences contains the feature vectors of each of its words and 0s for the corresponding feature vectors of the words, which the current sentence has less than the longest annotated sentence.",
        "Finally, we add for each sentence as feature binary features for subjectivity and polarity, the value corresponding to the intensity of opinion and the general emotion.",

        "A second model (EmotiBlog II) is created by adding to the collection of single opinion and emotion words annotated in EmotiBlog, the Opinion Finder lexicon and the opinion words found in MicroWordNet, the General Inquirer resource and WordNet Affect.",
        "In order to evaluate the performance of the models extracted from the features of the annotations in EmotiBlog, we performed different tests.",
        "The first one regarded the evaluation of the polarity and intensity classification task using the Emoit-blog I and II constructed models on two test sets - the JRC quotes collection and the SemEval 2007 Task Number 14 test set.",
        "Since the quotes often contain more than a sentence, we consider the polarity and intensity of the entire quote as the most frequent result in each class, corresponding to its constituent sentences.",
        "Also, given the fact that the SemEval Affective Text headlines were given intensity values between -100 and 100, we mapped the values contained in the Gold Standard of the task into three categories: [100, -67] is high (value 3 in intensity) and negative (value 1 in polarity), [-66, 34] medium negative and [33, 1] is low negative.",
        "The values between [1 and 100] are mapped in the same manner to the positive category.",

        "The results shown in Table 2 show a significantly high improvement over the results obtained in the SemEval task in 2007.",
        "This is explainable, on the one hand, by the fact that systems performing the opinion task did not have at their disposal the lexical resources for opinion employed in the EmotiBlog II model, but also because of the fact that they did not use machine learning on a corpus comparable to EmotiBlog (as seen from the results obtained when using solely the EmotiBlog I corpus).",
        "Compared to the NTCIR 8 Multilingual Analysis Task this year, we obtained significant improvements in precision, with a recall that is comparable to most of the participating systems.",
        "In the second experiment, we tested the performance of emotion classification using the two models built using Emo-tiBlog on the three corpora - JRC quotes, SemE-val 2007 Task No.",
        "14 test set and the ISEAR corpus.",
        "The JRC quotes are labeled using Emoti-Blog; however, the other two are labeled with a small set of emotions - 6 in the case of the Se-mEval data (joy, surprise, anger, fear, sadness, disgust) and 7 in ISEAR (joy, sadness, anger, fear, guilt, shame, disgust).",
        "Moreover, the Se-mEval data contains more than one emotion per title in the Gold Standard, therefore we consider as correct any of the classifications containing one of them.",
        "In order to unify the results and obtain comparable evaluations, we assessed the performance of the system using the alternative dimensional structures defined in Table 1.",
        "The ones not overlapping with the category of any of the 8 different emotions in SemEval and ISEAR are considered as \"Other\" and are not included either in the training, nor test set.",

        "Moreover, from the analysis performed on the errors, we realized that many of the affective phenomena presented were more explicit in the case of texts expressing strong emotions such as \"joy\" and \"anger\", and were mostly related to common-sense interpretation of the facts presented in the weaker ones.",
        "As it can be seen in Table 3, results for the texts pertaining to the news category obtain better results, most of all news titles.",
        "This is due to the fact that such texts, although they contain a few words, have a more direct and stronger emotional charge than direct speech (which may be biased by the need to be diplomatic, find the best suited words etc.).",
        "Finally, the error analysis showed that emotion that is directly reported by the persons experiencing is more \"hidden\", in the use of words carrying special signification or related to general human experience.",

        "Furthermore, we addressed the presence of \"copy and pastes\" from news articles or other blogs, the frequent quotes.",

        "We performed several experiments on three different corpora, aimed at finding and classifying both the opinion, as well as the expressions of emotion they contained; we showed that the fine and coarse-grained levels of annotation that EmotiBlog contains offers important information on the structure of affective texts, leading to an improvement of the performance of systems trained on it.",

        "Last but not least, our idea is to include the existing tools for a more effective semi-supervised annotation.",
        "After the training of the ML system we obtain automatically some markables which have to be validated or not by the annotator and the ideal option would be to connect these terms the system detects automatically with tools, such as the mapping with an opinion lexicon based on WordNet (SentiWordNet, WordNet Affect, MicroWordNet), in order to automatically annotate all the synonyms and antonyms with the same or the opposite polarity respectively and assigning them some other elements contemplated into the Emo-tiBlog annotation schema.",
