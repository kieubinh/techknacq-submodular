        "In TXV we adapted the tools to the recruitment domain in a short time frame.",
        "The aim was to extract key information from curricula vitae (CVs) for matching applicants to job adverts and to each other.",
        "The TM output is visualized in a web application with search navigation that captures relationships between candidates, their skills and organizations etc.",
        "This web interface allows recruiters to find hidden information in large volumes of unstructured text.",
        "Both projects were managed using agile, test-driven software development, i.e. solutions were created based on the principles of rapid-prototyping and iterative development cycles of deliverable versions of the TM system and the web application.The same principles were also applied to other project work, including the manual annotation.",
        "The aim of this annotation was to produce annotated data for training ML-based TM technology as well as evaluating system components.",
        "Collecting data, drawing up annotation guidelines and getting annotators to annotate this data in sequential steps is similar to the waterfall model in software engineering (Royce, 1970).",
        "This approach can be inefficient and costly if annotators unknowingly carried out work that could have been avoided and it can lead to difficulties if at the end of the process the requirements no longer match the annotations.",

        "In this paper, we describe a way of testing this agile annotation in practice.",

        "The main advantages of this approach are:",
        "• The annotation scheme evolves over time which ensures that annotations are consistent and remain focussed on the research that is carried out.",
        "An iterative annotation process therefore improves the annotation guidelines but keeps the annotations suitable to the relevant research questions.",
        "• Problems with the annotation guidelines, errors in the annotation and issues with the setup become apparent immediately and can be corrected early on.",

        "The doubly annotated CVs were used to determine inter-annotator agreement (iaa) in regular intervals (see Section 5).",
        "Some of the documents in the pool were not genuine CVs but either job adverts or CV writing advice.",
        "We let the annotators carry out the filtering process of only choosing genuine CVs of software developers and programmers for annotation and reject but record any documents that did not fit this category.",
        "The annotators rejected 99 files as being either not CVs at all (49) or being out-of-domain CVs from other types of professionals (50).",
        "Therefore, just over 50% of the documents in the pool were used up during the annotation process.",

        "The MMAX2 GUI allows annotators to mark up nested structures as well as intra-and inter-sentential relations.",
        "Both of these functionalities were crucial to our annotation effort.",
        "As the files used for annotation already contained some NEs which were recognized automatically using the rule-based NER system and stored in standoff XML, the conversion into and out of the MMAX2 format was relatively straightforward.",

        "Regarding the zones, we settled on annotating zone titles in a similar way as NEs.",
        "Our assumption was that recognizing the beginning of a zone can sufficiently identify zone boundaries.",
        "We did not include relations between NEs at this stages, as we wanted to get a clearer idea of the definitions of relevant NEs first before proceeding to relations.",
        "We then carried out a second pilot annotation using 10 more CVs selected from the candidate pool.",
        "We used the revised annotation scheme and this time the annotation was done electronically using MMAX2.",
        "The annotators also had access to the PDF and DOC versions of each file in case crucial structural or formatting information was lost in the conversion.",
        "Files were annotated for NEs and zone titles.",
        "We also asked the annotators to answer the following questions:",
        "• Does it make sense to annotate the proposed markables and what are the difficulties in doing",
        "• Are there any interesting markables missing from the list?",
        "• Are there are any issues with using the annotation tool?",
        "Half way through the second pilot we scheduled a further meeting to discuss their answers, addressed any question, comments or issues with regard to the annotation and adjusted the annotation guidelines accordingly.",
        "At this point, as we felt that the definitions of NEs were sufficiently clear and added guidelines for annotating various types of binary relations between NEs, for example a loc-org relation referring to a particular organization situated at a particular location, e.g. Google - Dublin.",
        "We list the final set of markables as defined at the end of the annotation process in Tables 2 and 3.",
        "During the second half of the second pilot we asked the annotators to time their annotation and established that it can take between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours to annotate a CV.",
        "We then calculated pairwise iaa for two doubly annotated files which allowed us to get some evidence for which definition of NEs, zone titles and relations were still ambiguous or not actually relevant.",
        "In parallel with both pilots, we also liaised closely with a local recruitment company to gain a firsthand understanding of what information recruiters are interested in when matching candidates to employments or employers.",
        "This consultation as well as the conclusions made after the second pilot led to further adaptions of the annotation scheme before the main annotation phase began.",
        "Based on the feedback from the second pilot annotation, we also made some changes to the data conversion and the annotation tool setup to reduce the amount of work for annotators but without restricting the set of markables.",
        "In the case of some nested NEs, we propagated relations between embedded NEs that could be referred from the relations of the containing NEs.",
        "For example, two date entities nested within a daterange entity, the latter of which the annotator related to an org entity, were related to the same org entity automatically.",
        "We also introduced a general group entity which could be used by the annotators to mark up lists of NEs, for example, if they were all related to a different NE mention of type x.",
        "In that case, the annotators only had to mark up a relation between the g rou p and x.",
        "All implicit relations between the NEs nested in the group and x were propagated during the conversion from the MMAX2 format back into the in-house XML format.",
        "This proved particularly useful for annotating relations between skill entities and other types of NEs.",
        "Once those changes had been made, the main annotation phase began.",
        "Each in-domain CV that was loaded into the annotation tool already contained some NEs pre-annotated by the rule-based NER system (see Section 3.2).",
        "The annotators had to correct the annotations in case they were erroneous.",
        "Overall, the annotators reported this pre-annotation to be useful rather than hindering as they did not have to do too many corrections.",
        "At the end of each day, the annotators checked in their work into the project's subversion (SVN) repository.",
        "This provided us with additional control and backup in case we needed to go back to previous versions at later stages.",
        "The annotation guidelines still evolved during the main annotation.",
        "Regular annotation meetings were held in case the annotators had questions on the guidelines or if they wanted to discuss specific examples.",
        "If a change was made to the annotation guidelines, all annotators were informed and asked to update their annotations accordingly.",
        "Moreover, IAA was calculated regularly on subsections of the doubly annotated data.",
        "This provided more empirical evidence for the types of markables the annotators found difficult to mark up and where clarifications where necessary.",
        "The reasons for this were that their definitions were ambiguous or underspecified.",
        "We deliberately kept the initial annotation scheme simple.",
        "The idea was for the annotators to shape the annotation scheme based on evidence in the actual data.",
        "We believe that this approach made the data set more useful for its final use to train and evaluate TM components.",

        "Table 4 also lists the final scores of the automatic ML-based NER and RE components (Alex et al., 2008b) which were adapted to the recruitment domain during the TXV project.",
        "Following agile methods, we trained and evaluated models very early into the annotation process.",
        "During the system optimization, learning curves helped to investigate for which markables having more training data available would improve performance.",
        "The NER component recognizes NEs and zone titles simultaneously with an overall Fi of 71.4 (84.2% of iaa) and 63.2 (65.0% of iaa), respectively.",
        "Extremely high or higher than average scores were obtained for date, daterange, email, loc, phone, postcode, timespan and url entities.",
        "Mid-range to lower scores were obtained for address, dob, job, org, per, qual and skill entities.",
        "One reason is the similarity between NE types, e.g. dob is difficult to differentiate from date.",
        "The layout of CVs and the lack of full sentences also pose a challenge as the NER component is trained using contextual features surrounding NEs that are often not present in CV data.",
        "Finally, the strict evaluation counts numerous boundary errors for NEs which can be considered correct, e.g. the system often recognizes organization names like \"Sun Microsystems, Inc\" whereas the annotator included the full stop at the end (\"Sun Microsystems, Inc.\").",
        "The RE component (Haddow, 2008) performs with an overall F1 of 59.0 on the CV test set (69.7% of iaa).",
        "It yields high or above average scores for 10 relation types (date-loc, datequal, daterange-job, daterange-loc, daterange-org, daterange-qual, job-loc, locorg, loc-qual, org-qual).",
        "It yields midrange to low scores for the other relation types (datejob, date-org, daterange-skill, date-skill, job-org, job-timespan, loc-timespan, org-timespan, skill-timespan).",
        "The most frequent type is daterange-skill, a skill obtained during a particular time period.",
        "Its entities tend to be found in the same zone but not always in immediate context.",
        "Such relations are inter-sentential, i.e. their entities are in different sentences or what is perceived as sentences by the system.",
        "Due to nature of the data, there are few intra-sentential relations, relations between",
        "NEs in the same sentence.",
        "The further apart two related NEs are, the more difficult it is to recognize them.",
        "Similarly to NER, one challenge for RE from CVs is their diverse structure and formatting."

        "The increase in the iaa figures for the markables over time show that agile corpus annotation resulted in more qualitative annotations.",
        "It is difficult to prove that the final annotation quality is higher than it would have been had we followed the traditional way of annotation.",
        "Comparing two such methods in parallel is very difficult to achieve as the main aim of annotation is usually to create a corpus and not to investigate the best and most efficient method.",
        "However, using the agile approach we identified problems early on and made improvements to the annotation scheme and the setup during the process rather than at the end.",
        "Given a fixed annotation time frame and the proportion of time we spent on correcting errors throughout the annotation process, one might conclude that we annotated less data than we may have done, had we not followed the agile approach.",
        "However, Voormann and Hut (2008) argue that agile annotation actually results in more useable data at the end and in less data being thrown away.",
        "Had we followed the traditional approach, we would unlikely have planned a correction phase at the end.",
        "The two main reason for that are cost and the general belief that the more annotated data the better.",
        "A final major correction phase is usually viewed as too expensive during an annotation project.",
        "In order to avoid this cost, the traditional approach taken tends to be to create a set of annotation guidelines when starting out and hold off the main annotation until the guidelines are finalized and considered sufficiently defined.",
        "This approach does not lend itself well to changes and adjustments later on which are inevitable when dealing with natural language.",
        "As a result the final less accurate annotated corpus tends to be accepted as the ground truth or gold standard and may not be as suitable and useful for a given purpose as it could have been following the agile annotation approach.",
        "Besides changing the way in which annotators work, we recognize the need for more flexible annotation tools that allow annotators to implement changes more rapidly."
