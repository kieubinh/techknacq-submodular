        "Parallel corpora – texts and their translations – have become essential in the development of machine translation (MT) systems.",
        "Alignment quality is crucial to these corpora; as Tiede-mann (2003) states, \"[t]he most important feature of texts and their translations is the correspondence between source and target segments\" (p. 2).",
        "While being useful for translation studies and foreign language pedagogy (see, e.g., Botley et al., 2000; McEnery and Wilson, 1996), parallel treebanks – syntactically-annotated parallel corpora – offer additional useful information for machine translation, cross-language information retrieval, and word-sense disambiguation (see, e.g., Tiedemann, 2003),",
        "While high-quality alignments are desirable, even gold standard annotation can contain annotation errors.",
        "For other forms of linguistic annotation, the presence of errors has been shown to create various problems, from unreliable training and evaluation of NLP technology (e.g., Padro and Marquez, 1998) to low precision and recall of queries for already rare linguistic phenomena (e.g., Meurers and Müller, 2008).",
        "Even a small number of errors can have a significant impact on the uses of linguistic annotation, e.g., changing the assessment of parsers (e.g., Habash et al., 2007).",
        "One could remove potentially unfavorable sentence pairs when training a statistical MT system, to avoid incorrect word alignments (Okita, 2009), but this removes all relevant data from those sentences and does not help evaluation.",
        "We thus focus on detecting errors in the annotation of alignments.",
        "Annotation error detection has been explored for part-of-speech (POS) annotation (e.g., Loftsson, 2009) and syntactic annotation (e.g., Ule and Simov, 2004; Dickinson and Meurers, 2005), but there have been few, if any, attempts to develop general approaches to error detection for aligned corpora.",
        "Alignments are different in nature, as the annotation does not introduce abstract categories such as POS, but relies upon defining translation units with equivalent meanings.",
        "We use the idea that variation in annotation can indicate errors (section 2), for consistency checking of alignments, as detailed in section 3.",
        "In section 4, we outline language-independent heuristics to sort true ambiguities from errors, and evaluate them on a parallel treebank in section 5.",
        "In section 6 we turn to a complementary method, exploiting compositional properties of aligned treebanks, to align more nodes.",
        "The methods are simple, effective, and applicable to any aligned treebank.",

      "text": [
        "As a starting point for an error detection method for aligned corpora, we use the variation n-gram approach for syntactic annotation (Dickinson and Meurers, 2003, 2005).",
        "The approach is based on detecting strings which occur multiple times in the corpus with varying annotation, the so-called variation nuclei.",
        "The nucleus with repeated surrounding context is referred to as a variation n-gram.",
        "The basic heuristic for detecting annotation errors requires one word of recurring context on each side of the nucleus, which is sufficient for detecting errors in grammatical annotation with high precision (Dickinson, 2008).",
        "The approach detects bracketing and labeling errors in constituency annotation.",
        "For example, the variation nucleus last month occurs once in the Penn Treebank (Taylor et al., 2003) with the label NP and once as a non-constituent, handled through a special label NIL.",
        "As a labeling error example, next Tuesday occurs three times, twice as NP and once as PP (Dickinson and Meur-ers, 2003).",
        "The method works for discontinuous constituency annotation (Dickinson and Meurers, 2005), allowing one to apply it to alignments, which may span over several words.",
        "For the experiments in this paper we will use the Smultron parallel treebank of Swedish, German, and English (Gustafson-Capkova et al., 2007), containing syntactic annotation and alignment on both word and phrase levels.",
        "Additionally, alignments are marked as showing either an exact or a fuzzy (approximate) equivalence.",
        "Corpora with alignments often have undergone some error-checking.",
        "Previous consistency checks for Smultron, for example, consisted of running one script for comparing differences in length between the source and target language items, and one script for comparing alignment labels, to detect variation between exact and fuzzy links.",
        "For example, the pair and (English) and samt (German, 'together with') had 20 fuzzy matches and 1 (erroneous) exact match.",
        "Such methods are limited, in that they do not, e.g., handle missing alignments.",
        "The TreeAligner tool for annotating and querying aligned parallel treebanks (Volk et al., 2007) employs its own consistency checking, recently developed by Torsten Marek.",
        "One method uses 2 x 2 contingency tables over words, looking, e.g., at the word-word or POS-POS combinations, pinpointing anomalous translation equivalents.",
        "While potentially effective, this does not address the use of alignments in context, i.e., when we might expect to see a rare translation.",
        "A second, more treebank-specific method checks for so-called branch link locality: if two nodes are aligned, any node dominating one of them can only be aligned to a node dominating the other one.",
        "While this constraint can flag erroneous links, it too does not address missing alignments.",
        "The two methods we propose in this paper address these limitations and can be used to complement this work.",
        "Furthermore, these methods have not been evaluated, whereas we evaluate our methods."

      "text": [
        "To adapt the variation n-gram method and determine whether strings in a corpus are consistently aligned, we must: 1) define the units of data we expect to be consistently annotated (this section), and 2) define which information effectively identifies the erroneous cases (section 4).",
        "Alignment relates words in a source language and words in a target language, potentially mediated by phrase nodes.",
        "Following the variation n-gram method, we define the units of data, i.e., the variation nuclei, as strings.",
        "Then, we break the problem into two different source-to-target mappings, mapping a source variation nucleus to a target language label.",
        "With a German-English aligned corpus, for example, we look for the consistency of aligning German words to their English counterparts and separately examine the consistency of aligning English words with their German \"labels.\"",
        "Because a translated word can be used in different parts of a sentence, we also normalize all target labels into lower-case, preventing variation between, e.g., the and The.",
        "jemanden",
        "Although alignment maps strings to strings for this method, complications arise when mediated by phrase nodes: if a phrase node spans over only one word, it could have two distinct mappings, one as a word and one as a phrase, which may or may not result in the same yield.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates this.",
        "On the left side, Osterglocken is aligned to daffodils at the word level, and the same string is aligned on the phrase level (NP to NP).",
        "In contrast, on the right side, the word Spiegel is aligned to the word mirror, while at the phrase level, Spiegel (NP) is aligned to the mirror (NP).",
        "As word and phrase level strings can behave differently, we split error detection into word-level and phrase-level methods, to avoid unnecessary variation.",
        "By splitting the problem first into different source-to-target mappings and then into words and phrases, we do not have to change the underlying way of finding consistency.",
        "Multiple Alignment The mapping between source strings and target labels handles n-to-m alignments.",
        "For example, if Garten maps to the gardens, the and gardens is considered one string.",
        "Likewise, in the opposite direction, the gardens maps as a unit to Garten, even if discontinuous.",
        "Unary Branches With syntactic annotation, unary branches present a potential difficulty, in that a single string could have more than one label, violating the assumption that the string-to-",
        "someonel else",
        "2: The word someone aligned as a phrase left, but not; a phrase by itself on the right.",
        "label mapping is a function.",
        "For example, in Penn Treebank-style annotation, an NP node can dominate a QP (quantifier phrase) node via a unary branch.",
        "Thus, an annotator could (likely erroneously) assign different alignments to each phrasal node, one for the NP and one for the QP, resulting in different target labels.",
        "We handle all the (source) unary branch alignments as a conjunction of possibilities, ordered from top to bottom.",
        "Just as the syntactic structure can be relabeled as NP/QP (Dickinson and Meurers, 2003), we can relabel a string as, e.g., the man/man.",
        "If different unary nodes result in the same string (the man/the man), we combine them (the man).",
        "Note that unary branches are unproblematic in the target language since they always yield the same string, i.e., are still one label.",
        "Error detection for syntactic annotation finds inconsistencies in constituent labeling (e.g., NP vs. QP) and inconsistencies in bracketing (e.g., NP vs. NIL).",
        "Likewise, we can distinguish inconsistency in labeling (different translations) from inconsistency in alignment (aligned/unaligned).",
        "Detecting inconsistency in alignment deals with the completeness of the annotation, by using the label NIL for unaligned strings.",
        "We use the method from Dickinson and Meur-ers (2005) to generate NILs, but using NIL for unaligned strings is too coarse-grained for phraselevel alignment.",
        "A string mapping to NIL might be a phrase which has no alignment, or it might not be a phrase and thus could not possibly have an alignment.",
        "Thus, we create NIL-C as a new label, indicating a constituent with no alignment, differing from NIL strings which do not even form a phrase.",
        "For example, on the left side of Figure 2, the string someone aligns to jemanden on the phrase level.",
        "On the right side of Figure 2, the string someone by itself does not constitute a phrase (even though the alignment in this instance is correct) and is labeled NIL.",
        "If there were instances of someone as an NP with no alignment, this would be NIL-C. NIL-C cases seem to be useful for inconsistency detection, as we expect consistency for items annotated as a phrase.",
        "Aligned corpora often specify additional information about each alignment, e.g., a \"sure\" or \"possible\" alignment (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "In Smultron, for instance, an exact alignment means that the strings are considered direct translation equivalents outside the current sentence context, whereas a fuzzy one is not as strict an equivalent.",
        "For example, something in English exact-aligns with etwas in German.",
        "However, if something and irgend etwas ('something or other') are constituents on the phrase level, <something, irgend etwas> is an acceptable alignment (since the corpus aligns as much as possible), but is fuzzy.",
        "Since exact alignments are the ones we expect to consistently align with the same string across the corpus, we attach information about the alignment type to each corpus position.",
        "This can be used to filter out variations involving, e.g., fuzzy alignments (see section 4.4).",

        "Within the 8-word English AD VP (almost twice... ), there are six words which align to words in the corresponding German sentence, all under the same NP.",
        "It does not matter that some words are unaligned; the fact that the English ADVP and the German NP cover basically the same set of words suggests that the phrases should be aligned, as is the case here.",

        "The prediction of an aligned node in 1a allows for multiple possibilities: in 1aiii, we only check that a mother node t' covers all the target children, disregarding extra children, since translations can contain extra words.",
        "In general, many such dominating nodes exist, and most are poor candidates for alignment of the node in question.",
        "This is the reason for the bidirectional check in steps 2 and 3.",
        "For example, in (3), we correctly predict alignment between the NP dominating you in English and the NP dominating man in German.",
        "From the word alignment, we generate a list of mother nodes of man as potential alignments for the you NP.",

        "In figure 3, for example, the sentence pair is an entire rephrasing; < her, ihr> is the only word alignment.",
        "For each phrasal node in the SL, the method only requires that all its words be aligned with the words under the TL node.",
        "Thus, the English PP on her, the VP had just been dumped on her, and the two VPs in between are predicted as possible alignments with the German VP ihr einfach in die Wiege gelegt worden or its immediate VP daughter: they all have her and ihr aligned, and no contradicting alignments.",
        "Sparse word alignments lead to multiple possible phrase alignments.",
        "After intersecting, we mark cases with more than one predicted source or target phrase and do not evaluate them.",
        "If in step 1aiii, no target mother (t') exists, but there is alignment in the corpus, then in step 1bi, we output predicted non-alignment.",
        "In Example (2), for instance, the English NP the outskirts of a sprawling suburb is (incorrectly) predicted to have no alignment, although most words align to words within the same German NP.",
        "This prediction arises because the aligns to a word (am) outside of the German NP, due to am being a contraction of the preposition an and the article dem, (cf. on and the, respectively).",
        "The method for predicting phrase alignments, however, relies upon words being within the constituent.",
        "We thus conclude that: 1) the cases in step 1bi are unlikely to be errors, and 2) there are types of alignments which we simply will not find, a problem also for automatic alignment based on similar assumptions (e.g., zhechev and Way, 2008).",

        "6.2 Evaluation",

        "21 of the phrases have zero difference in length between source and target, while 34 have differences of up to 9 tokens.",
        "Of the phrases with zero-length difference, 18 should have been aligned (precision=85.7%), while only 7 with length differences should have been aligned.",
        "This is in line with previous findings that length difference can help predict alignment (cf., e.g., Gale and Church, 1993).",
        "About half of all phrase pairs that should be aligned should be exact, regardless of the length difference.",
        "The method is good at predicting the alignment of one-word phrases, e.g., pronouns, as in (3).",
        "Of the 11 suggested alignments where both source and target have a length of 1, all were correct suggestions.",
        "This is not surprising, since all words under the phrases are (trivially) aligned.",
        "Although shorter phrases with short length differences generally means a higher rate of correct suggestions, we do not want to filter out items based on phrase length, since there are outliers that are correct suggestions, e.g., phrase pairs with lengths of 15 and 13 (difference=2) or 31 and 36 (difference=5).",
        "It is worth noting that checking the suggestions took very little time."

        "This paper explores two simple, language-independent ways to detect errors in aligned corpora.",
        "In the first method, applicable to any aligned corpus, we consider alignment as a string-to-string mapping, where a string could be the yield of a phrase.",
        "Treating the target string as a label, we find inconsistencies in the labeling of each source string.",
        "Despite setting the problem up in a similar way to grammatical annotation, we also demonstrated that new heuristics are needed to sort errors.",
        "The second method examines phrase nodes which are predicted to be aligned, based on the alignment of their yields.",
        "Both methods are effective, in complementary ways, and can be used to suggest alignments for annotators or to suggest revisions for incorrect alignments.",
        "The wide range of possible translations and the linguistic information which goes into them indicate that there should be other ways of finding errors.",
        "One possibility is to use more abstract source or target language representations, such as POS, to overcome the limitations of string-based methods.",
        "This will likely also be a useful avenue to explore for language pairs more dissimilar than English and German.",
        "By investigating different ways to ensure alignment consistency, one can begin to provide insights into automatic alignment (zhechev and Way, 2008).",
        "Additionally, by correcting the errors, one can determine the effect on machine translation evaluation."
