        "Manual annotation of language data in order to capture linguistic knowledge has become increasingly important for semantic and pragmatic annotation tasks.",
        "A very short list of a few such tasks illustrates the range of types of annotation, in varying stages of development: predicate argument structure (Palmer et al., 2005b), dialogue acts (Hu et al., 2009), discourse structure (Carbone et al., 2004), opinion (Wiebe and Cardie, 2005), emotion (Alm et al., 2005).",
        "The number of efforts to create corpus resources that include manual annotations has also been growing.",
        "A common approach in assessing the resulting manual annotations is to report a single quantitative measure reflecting the quality of the annotations, either a summary statistic such as percent agreement, or an agreement coefficient from the family of metrics that include Krippendorff 's alpha (Krippendorff, 1980) and Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960).",
        "We present some new assessment methods to use in combination with an agreement coefficient for understanding annotator behavior when there are multiple annotators and many annotation values.",
        "Anveshan (Annotation Variance Estimation) is a suite of procedures for analyzing patterns of agreement and disagreement among annotators, as well as the distributions of annotation values across annotators.",
        "Anveshan thus makes it possible to explore annotator behavior in more detail.",
        "Currently, it includes three types of analysis: inter-annotator agreement (IA) among all subsets of annotators, leverage of annotation values for outlier detection, and metrics for comparing annotators' distributions of annotation values (e.g., Kullbach-Liebler divergence).",
        "As an illustration of the utility of Anveshan, we compare two groups of annotators on the same annotation word sense annotation tasks: a half dozen trained annotators and fourteen Mechanical Turk-ers.",
        "Previous work has argued that it can be cost effective to collect multiple labels from untrained labelers at a low cost per label, and to combine the multiple labels through a voting method, rather than to collect single labels from highly trained labelers (Snow et al., 2008; Sheng et al., 2008; Lam and Stork, 2003).",
        "The tasks included in (Snow et al., 2008), for example, include word sense annotation; in contrast to our case, where the average number of senses per word is 9.5, the one word sense annotation task had three senses.",
        "We find that the same half dozen trained annotators can agree well or not on sense labels for poly-semous words.",
        "When they agree less well, we find that it is possible to distinguish between problems in the labels (e.g., confusable senses) and systematic differences of interpretation among annotators.",
        "When we use twice the number of Mechanical Turkers as trained annotators for three of our ten polysemous words, we find inconsistent results.",
        "The next section of the paper presents the motivation for Anveshan and its relevance to the word sense annotation task, followed by a section on related work.",
        "The word sense annotation data is given in section 5.",
        "Anveshan is described in the subsequent section, followed by the results of its application to the two data sets.",
        "We discuss the comparison of trained annotators and Mechanical Turkers, as well as differences among words, in section 7.",

        "Assessing the reliability of an annotation typically addresses the question of whether different annotators (effectively) assign the same annotation labels.",
        "Various measures can be used to compare different annotators, including agreement coefficients such as Krippendorff 's alpha (Krippendorff, 1980).",
        "Extensive reviews of the properties of such coefficients have been presented elsewhere, e.g., (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).",
        "Briefly, an agreement produce values in the interval [-1,1] indicating how much of the observed agreement is above (or below) agreement that would be predicted by chance (value of 0).",
        "To measure reliability in this way is to assume that for most of the instances in the data, there is a single correct response.",
        "Here we present the use of reliability metrics and other measures for word sense annotation, and we assume that in some cases there may not be a single correct response.",
        "When annotators have less than excellent agreement, we aim to examine possible causes.",
        "We take word sense to be a problematic annotation to perform, thus requiring a deeper understanding of the conditions under which annotators might disagree.",
        "The many reasons can only be touched on here.",
        "For example, word senses are not discrete, atomic units that can be delimited and enumerated.",
        "While dictionaries and other lexical resoures, such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) or the Hector lexicon (cf. SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000)), do provide enumerations of the senses for a given word, and their interrelations (e.g., a list of senses, a tree of senses), it is widely agreed that this is a convenient abstraction, if for no other reason than the fact that words shift meanings along with the communicative needs of the groups of individuals who use them.",
        "The context in which a word is used plays a significant role in restricting the current sense.",
        "As a result, it is often argued that the best representation for word meaning would consist in clustering the contexts in which words are used (Kilgarriff, 1997).",
        "Yet even this would be insufficient because new communities arise, new behaviors and artifacts emerge along with them, hence new contexts of use and new clusters.",
        "At the same time, contexts of use and the senses that go along with them can fade away (cf. the use of handbag discussed in (Kilgar-riff, 1997) pertaining to disco dancing).",
        "Because an enumeration of word senses is somewhat artificial, annotators might disagree on word senses because they disagree on the boundaries between one sense and another, just as professional lexicographers do.",
        "Apart from the artificiality of creating flat or hierarchical sense inventories, the meanings of words can vary in their subjectivity, due to differences in the perception or experience of individuals.",
        "This can be true for word senses that are inherently relative, such as cold (as in, turn up the thermostat, it's too cold in here); or that derive their meaning from cultural norms that may differ from community to community, such as justice; or that change as one grows older, e.g., whether a long time to wait pertains to hours versus days.",
        "Despite the arguments against using word sense inventories, until they are replaced with an equally convenient and more representative abstraction, they are an extremely convenient computational representation.",
        "We rely on WordNet senses, which are presented to annotators with a gloss (definition) and with example uses.",
        "In order to better understand reasons for disagreement on senses, we collect labels from multiple annotators.",
        "When annotators agree, having multiple annotators is redundant.",
        "But when annotators disagree, having multiple annotators is necessary in order to determine whether the disagreement is due to noise based on insufficiently clear sense definitions versus a systematic difference between individuals, e.g., those who see a glass as half empty where others see it as half full.",
        "To insure the opportunity to observe how varied the labeling of a single word can be, we collect word sense annotations from multiple annotators.",
        "One potential benefit of such investigation might be a better understanding of how to model word meaning.",
        "In sum, we hypothesize the following cases:",
        "• Outliers: A small proportion of annotators may assign senses in a manner that differs markedly from the remaining annotators.",
        "• Confusability of senses: If multiple annotators assign multiple senses in an apparently random fashion, it may be that the senses are not sufficiently distinct.",
        "• Systematic differences among subsets of an-notators: If the same 50% of annotators always pick sense X where the remaining annotators always pick sense Y, it may be that properties of the annotators, such as their age cohort, account for the disagreement."

        "Anveshan not only helps us understand underlying patterns in annotator behavior and remove noise from IA scores, but also helps identify cases where there is no noise and no systematic subsets of annotators that agree with each other.",
        "An example can be seen in for the noun work.",
        "We observed that the annotators do not have largely different behavior, which is reflected in Figure 9.",
        "As none of the annotators are significantly different from the others, the KLD scores are low and the plotted line does not have any steep rises, as seen in Figure 2.",
        "Similar to the results for TA data, Anveshan was successful in identifying outliers in Mechanical Turk data as well.",
        "In order to compare the agreement among TAs and MTs, we looked at IA scores of all subsets of annotators for the three adjectives in the Mechanical Turk data.",
        "We observed that MTs used much more senses than TAs for all words and that there was a lot of noise in sense usage distribution.",
        "Figure 10 illustrates the sense usage statistics for long among MTs, for frequently used senses.",
        "We also looked at agreement scores among all subsets of MTs to see if there are any subsets of annotators who agree as much as TAs, and we observed that for both long and quiet, there were no subsets of MT annotators whose agreement was comparable or greater than the same number of the TAs, however for fair, we found one set of 5 annotators whose IA score (0.61) was greater than the IA score (0.54) of trained annotators.",
        "We also observed that among both these pairs of annotators, the frequently used senses were the same, as illustrated in Figure 11.",
        "Still, the two groups ofan-notators have sufficiently distinct sense usage that the overall IA for the combined set drops to 0.43.",

        "For annotations on a subjective task, there are cases where there is no single correct label.",
        "In this paper, we presented Anveshan, an approach to study annotator behavior and to explore datasets with multiple annotators, and with a large set of annotation values.",
        "Here we looked at data from half a dozen trained annotators and fourteen untrained Mechanical Turkers on word sense annotation for polysemous words.",
        "The analysis using Anveshan provided many insights into sources of disagreement among the annotators.",
        "We learn that IA Scores do not give us a complete picture and it is necessary to delve deeper and study annotator behavior in order to identify noise possibly due to sense confusability, to eliminate noise due to outliers, and to identify systematic differences where subsets of annotators have much higher IA than the full set.",
        "The results from Anveshan are encouraging and the methodology can be readily extended to study patterns in human behavior.",
        "We plan to extend our work by looking at JSD scores of all subsets of annotators instead of pairs, to identify larger subsets of annotators who have similar behavior.",
        "We also plan to investigate other statistical methods of outlier detection such as the orthogonalized Gnanadesikan-Kettenring estimator."
