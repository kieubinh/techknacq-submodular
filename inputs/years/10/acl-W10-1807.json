        "Training a machine-learning based part-of-speech (POS) tagger implies manually tagging a significant amount of text.",
        "The cost of this, in terms of human effort, slows down the development of taggers for under-resourced languages.",
        "One usual way to improve this situation is to automatically pre-annotate the corpus, so that the work of the annotators is limited to the validation of this pre-annotation.",
        "This method proved quite efficient in a number of POS-annotated corpus development projects (Marcus et al., 1993; Dandapat et al., 2009), allowing for a significant gain not only in annotation time but also in consistency.",
        "However, the influence of the pre-tagging quality on the error rate in the resulting annotated corpus and the bias introduced by the pre-annotation has been little examined.",

        "Marcus et al.",
        "(1993) thus showed that manual tagging took twice as long as correcting pre-tagged text and resulted in twice the inter-annotator disagreement rate, as well as an error rate (using a gold-standard annotation) about 50% higher.",
        "The pre-annotation was done using a tagger trained on the Brown Corpus, which, due to errors introduced by an automatic mapping of tags from the Brown tagset to the Penn Treebank tagset, had an error rate of 7-9%.",
        "However, they report neither the influence of the training of the annotators on the potential biases in correction, nor that of the quality of the tagger on the correction time and the obtained quality.",
        "Dandapat et al.",
        "(2009) went further and showed that, for complex POS-tagging (for Hindi and Bangla), pre-annotation of the corpus allows for a gain in time, but not necessarily in consistency, which depends largely on the pre-tagging quality.",
        "They also noticed that untrained annotators were more influenced by pre-annotation than the trained ones, who showed \"consistent performance\".",
        "However, this very complete and interesting experiment lacked a reference allowing for an evaluation of the quality of the annotations.",

        "Cu-ration consists in reading through electronic version of papers and entering retrieved information into a template.",

        "Less perfect pre-annotation still leads to a gain in time, but less so (a little less than 1/4th).",
        "They also tested the effect of higher recall or precision of pre-annotation on one annotator (curator), who rated recall more positively than precision.",
        "However, as they notice, this result can be explained by the curation style and should be tested on more annotators.",

        "They asked 6 annotators to annotate or correct frame assignment using a task-specific annotation tool.",
        "Here again, pre-annotation was done using only two types of pre-tagging quality, state-of-the-art and enhanced.",
        "The results of the experiments are a bit disappointing as they could not find a direct improvement of annotation time using pre-annotation.",
        "The authors reckon this might be at least partly due to \"an interaction between time savings from pre-annotation and time savings due to a training effect.\"",
        "For the same reason, they had to exclude some of the annotation results for quality evaluation in order to show that, in line with (Marcus et al., 1993), quality pre-annotation helps increasing annotation quality.",
        "They also found that noisy and low quality pre-annotation does not overall corrupt human judgment.",
        "On the other hand, Fort et al.",
        "(2009) claim that pre-annotation introduces a bias in named entity annotation, due to the preference given by annotators to what is already annotated, thus preventing them from noticing entities that were not pre-annotated.",
        "This particular type of bias should not appear in POS-tagging, as all the elements are to be annotated, but a pre-tagging could influence the annotators, preventing them from asking themselves questions about a specific pre-annotation.",
        "In a completely different field, Barque et al.",
        "(2010) used a series of NLP tools, called MACAON, to automatically identify the central component and optional peripheral components of dictionary definitions.",
        "This preprocessing gave disappointing results as compared to entirely manual annotation, as it did not allow for a significant gain in time.",
        "The authors consider that the bad results are due to the quality of the tool that they wish to improve as they believe that \"an automatic segmentation of better quality would surely yield some gains.\"",
        "Yet, the question remains: is there a quality threshold for pre-annotation to be useful?",
        "and if so, how can we evaluate it?",

      "text": [
        "The idea underlying our experiments is the following.",
        "We split the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) in a usual manner, namely we use Sections 2 to 21 to train various instances of a POS tagger, and Section 23 to perform the actual experiments.",
        "In order to measure the impact of the POS tagger's quality, we trained it on subcorpora of increasing sizes, and pre-annotated Section 23 with these various POS taggers.",
        "Then, we manually annotated parts of Section 23 under various experimental setups, either from scratch or using various pre-annotations, as explained below.",
        "We used the MElt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009), a maximum-entropy based system that is able to take into account both information extracted from a training corpus and information extracted from an external morphological lexicon.It has been shown to lead to a state-of-the-art POS tagger for French.",
        "Trained on Sections 2 to 21 of the Penn Treebank (MEltgn ), and evaluated on Section 23, MElt exhibits a 96.4% accuracy, which is reasonably close to the state-of-the-art (Spoustova et al.",
        "(2009) report 97.4%).",
        "Since it is trained without any external lexicon, MEltAnLL is very close to the original maximum-entropy based tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), which has indeed a similar 96.6% accuracy.",
        "We trained MElt on increasingly larger parts of the POS-tagged Penn Treebank, thus creating different taggers with growing degrees of accuracy (see table 1).",
        "We then POS-tagged the Section 23 with each of these taggers, thus obtaining for each sentence in Section 23 a set of pre-annotations, one from each tagger.",
        "We designed different experimental setups to evaluate the impact of pre-annotation and pre-annotation accuracy on the quality of the resulting corpus.",
        "The subparts of Section 23 that we used for these experiments are identified by sentence ids (e.g., 1-100 denotes the 100 first sentences in Section 23).",
        "Two annotators were involved in the experiments.",
        "They both have a good knowledge of linguistics, without being linguists themselves and had only little prior knowledge of the Penn Treebank POS tagset.",
        "One of them had previous expertise in POS tagging (Annotator1).",
        "It should also be noticed that, though they speak fluent English, they are not native speakers of the language.",
        "They were asked to keep track of their annotation time, noting the time it took them to annotate or correct each series of 10 sentences.",
        "They were also asked to use only a basic text editor, with no macro or specific feature that could help them, apart from the usual ones, like Find, Replace, etc.",
        "The set of 36 tags used in the Penn Treebank and quite a number of particular cases is a lot to keep in mind.",
        "This implies a heavy cognitive load in short-term memory, especially as no specific interface was used to help annotating or correcting the pre-annotations.",
        "It was demonstrated that training improves the quality of manual annotation in a significant way as well as allows for a significant gain in time (Marcus et al., 1993; Dandapat et al., 2009; Mikulova and Stepanek, 2009).",
        "In particular, Marcus et al.",
        "(1993) observed that it took the Penn Treebank annotators 1 month to get fully efficient on the POS-tagging correction task, reaching a speed of 20 minutes per 1,000 words.",
        "The speed of annotation in our experiments cannot be compared to this, as our annotators only annotated and corrected small samples of the Penn Treebank.",
        "However, the annotators' speed and correctness did improve with practice.",
        "As explained below, we took this learning curve into account, as previous work (Rehbein et al., 2009) showed it has an significant impact on the results.",
        "Also, during each experiment, sentences were annotated sequentially.",
        "Moreover, the experiments were conducted in the order we describe them below.",

        "1.",
        "Impact of the pre-annotation accuracy on precision and inter-annotator agreement:",

        "4.1 Impact of the Pre-annotation Accuracy on Precision and Inter-annotator Agreement",
        "The quality of the annotations created during experiment 1 was evaluated using two methods.",
        "First, we considered the original Penn Treebank annotations as reference and calculated a simple precision as compared to this reference.",
        "Figure 1 gives an overview of the obtained results (note that the scale is not regular).",
        "However, this is not sufficient to evaluate the quality of the annotation as, actually, the reference annotation is not perfect (see below).",
        "We therefore evaluated the reliability of the annotation, calculating the inter-annotator agreement between An-notator1 and Annotator2 on the 100-sentence series they both annotated.",
        "We calculated this agreement on some of the subcorpora using n, aka Car-letta's Kappa (Carletta, 1996).",
        "The results of this are shown in table 2.",
        "The results show a very good agreement according to all scales (Krippendorff, 1980; Neuendorf, 2002; Krippendorff, 2004) as n is always superior to 0.9.",
        "Besides, it improves with training (from 0.955 at the beginning to 0.963 at the end).",
        "We also calculated n on the corpus we used to evaluate the pre-annotation bias (Experiment 3).",
        "The results of this are shown in table 3.",
        "Here again, the results are very good, though a little bit less so than at the beginning of the mixed annotation session.",
        "They are almost perfect with MEltA„LL.",
        "Finally, we calculated n throughout Experiment 2.",
        "The results are given in Figure 2 and, apart from a bizarre peak at MElt;, they show a steady progression of the accuracy and the inter-annotator agreement, which are correlated.",
        "As for the MElt;!",
        "peak, it does not appear in Figure 1, we therefore interpret it as an artifact.",
        "Before discussing the results of Experiment 2, annotation time measurements during Experiment 3 confirm that using a good quality pre-annotation (say, MEltALL) strongly reduces the annotation time as compared with fully manual annotation.",
        "For example, Annotator1 needed an average time of approximately 7.5 minutes to annotate 10 sentences without pre-annotation (Experiment 3), whereas Experiment 2 shows that it goes down to approximately 2.5 minutes when using MEltA„LLpre-annotation.",
        "For Annotator2, the corresponding figures are respectively 11.5 and 2.5 minutes.",
        "Figure 3 shows the impact on the pre-annotation type on annotation times.",
        "Surprisingly, only the worst tagger (MElt,!,) produces pre-annotations that lead to a significantly slower annotation.",
        "In other words, a 96.4% accurate pre-annotation does not significantly speed up the annotation process with respect to a 81.6% accurate pre-annotation.",
        "This is very interesting, since it could mean that the development of a POS-annotated corpus for a new language with no POS tagger could be drastically sped up.",
        "Annotating approximately 50 sentences could be sufficient to train a POS tagger such as MElt and use it as a pre-annotator, even though its quality is not yet satisfying.",

        "One interpretation of this could be the following.",
        "Annotation based on pre-annotations involves two different tasks: reading the pre-annotated sentence and replacing incorrect tags.",
        "The reading task takes a time that does not really depends on the pre-annotation quality.",
        "But the correction task takes a time that is, say, linear w.r.t.",
        "the number of pre-annotation errors.",
        "Therefore, when the number of pre-annotation errors is below a certain level, the correction task takes significantly less time than the reading task.",
        "Therefore, below this level, variations in the pre-annotation error rate do not lead to significant overall annotation time.",
        "Apparently, this threshold is between 66.5% and 81.6% pre-annotation accuracy, which can be reached with a surprisingly small training corpus.",
        "We evaluated both the bias induced by a pre-annotation with the best tagger, MEltALL, and the one induced by one of the least accurate taggers,",
        "MElt.",
        "The results are given in table 4 and 5, respectively.",
        "They show a very different bias according to the annotator.",
        "Annotator2's accuracy raises from 94.6% to 95.2% with a 81.6% accuracy tagger (MElt) and from 94.1% to 97.1% with a 96.4% accuracy tagger (MEltALL).",
        "Therefore, Annota-tor2, whose accuracy is less than that of Annota-tor1 under all circumstances (see figure 1), seems to be positively influenced by pre-annotation, whether it be good or bad.",
        "The gain is however much more salient with the best pre-annotation (plus 3 points).",
        "As for Annotator1, who is the most accurate annotator (see figure 1), the results are more surprising as they show a significant degradation of accuracy, from 98.1 without pre-annotation to 95.8 with pre-annotation using MElt, the less accurate tagger.",
        "Examining the actual results allowed us to see that, first, Annotator1 non pre-annotated version is better than the reference, and second, the errors made in the pre-annotated version with MElt are so obvious that they can only be due to a lapse in concentration.",
        "The results, however, remain stable with pre-annotation using the best tagger (from 98.4 to 98.2), which is consistent with the results obtained by Dandapat et al.",
        "(2009), who showed that better trained annotators are less influenced by pre-annotation and show stable performance.",

        "It seems that the rather good results of the taggers cause the attention of the annotators to be reduced, even more so as the task is repetitive and tedious.",
        "However, annotators also had the feeling that fully manual annotation could be more subject to oversights.",
        "These impressions are confirmed by the comparison of the contingency tables, as can be seen from Tables 6, 7 and 8 (in these tables, lines correspond to tags from the annotation and columns to reference tags; only lines containing at least one cell with 2 errors or more are shown, with all corresponding columns).",
        "For example, Anno-tator1 makes more random errors when no pre-annotation is available and more systematic errors when MEltAnLL pre-annotations are used (typically, JJ instead of VBN, i.e., adjective instead of past participle, which corresponds to a systematic trend in MEltAnLL's results).",

        "The series of experiments we detailed in this article confirms that pre-annotation allows for a gain in quality, both in terms of accuracy w.r.t.",
        "a reference and in terms of inter-annotator agreement, i.e., reliability.",
        "We also demonstrated that this comes with biases that should be identified and notified to the annotators, so that they can be extra careful during correction.",
        "Finally, we discovered that a surprisingly small training corpus could be sufficient to build a pre-annotation tool that would help drastically speeding up the annotation.",
        "This should help developing taggers for under-resourced languages.",
        "In order to check that, we intend to use this method in a near future to develop a POS tagger for Sorani Kurdish.",
        "We also want to experiment on other, more precision-driven, annotation tasks, like complex relations annotation or definition segmentation, that are more intrinsically complex and for which there exist no automatic tool as accurate as for",
