        "In recent years, supervised learning has become the dominant paradigm in Natural Language Processing (NLP), thus making the creation of handannotated corpora a critically important task.",
        "A corpus where each instance is annotated by a single tagger unavoidably contains errors.",
        "To improve the quality of the data, an annotation project may choose to annotate each instance twice and adjudicate the disagreements, thus producing the (largely) error-free gold standard.",
        "For example, OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006), a large-scale annotation project, chose this option.",
        "However, given a virtually unlimited supply of unlabeled data and limited funding - a typical set of constraints in NLP - an annotation project must always face the realization that for the cost of double annotation, more than twice as much data can be single annotated.",
        "The philosophy behind this alternative says that modern machine learning algorithms can still generalize well in the presence of noise, especially when given larger amounts of training data.",
        "Currently, the commonly accepted wisdom sides with the view that says that blind double annotation followed by adjudication of disagreements is necessary to create annotated corpora that leads to the best possible performance.",
        "We provide empirical evidence that this is unlikely to be the case.",
        "Rather, the greatest value for your annotation dollar lies in single annotating more data.",
        "There may, however, be other considerations that still argue in favor of double annotation.",
        "In this paper, we also consider the arguments of Beigman and Klebanov (2009), who suggest that data should be multiply annotated and then filtered to discard all of the examples where the annotators do not have perfect agreement.",
        "We provide evidence that single annotating more data for the same cost is likely to result in better system performance.",
        "This paper proceeds as follows: first, we outline our evaluation framework in Section 2.",
        "Next, we compare the single annotation and adjudication scenarios in Section 3.",
        "Then, we compare the annotation scenario of Beigman and Klebanov (2009) with the single annotation scenario in Section 4.",

        "To make the size of the dataset more manageable, we randomly selected 500 examples of each of the 15 most frequent verbs.",

        "There is an upfront cost associated with any annotation effort to organize the project, design an annotation scheme, set up the environment, create annotation guidelines, hire and train the annotators, etc.",
        "We will assume, for the sake of this paper, that this cost is fixed and is the same regardless of whether the data is single annotated or the data is double annotated and disagreements adjudicated.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a scenario where there is essentially no difference in cost to collect additional data to be annotated, as is often the case (e.g., there is virtually no additional cost to download 2.5 versus 1.0 million words of text from the web).",
        "However, this is not always the case (e.g., collecting speech can be costly).",
        "To calculate a cost per annotated instance for blind annotation, we take the total expenses associated with the annotators in this group less training costs and any costs not directly associated with annotation and divide by the total number of blind instance annotations.",
        "This value, $0.0833, is the per instance cost used for single annotation.",

        "For example, it may be possible to train fewer annotators, and invest the savings into annotating more data.",
        "Perhaps more appropriately, it may be feasible to simply cut back on the amount of training provided per annotator and instead annotate more data.",
        "On the other hand, when the unlabeled data is not freely obtainable, double annotation may be more suitable as a route to improving system performance.",
        "There may also be factors other than cost-effectiveness which make double annotation desirable.",

        "Calculating these rates requires double-blind annotation.",
        "Annotators who consistently produced ITA rates lower than average were also removed from the project.",
        "Therefore, caution is advised in determining when to dispense with double annotation in favor of more cost effective single annotation.",
