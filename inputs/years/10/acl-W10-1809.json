        "Typhoons arise in this part of the Pacific = Some typhoons... OR Most/All typhoons...",
        "This behaviour has so far prevented linguists from agreeing on a single formalisation for all generics.",
        "The only accepted assumption is that an operator GEN exists, which acts as a silent quantifier over the restrictor (subject) and matrix (verbal predicate) of the generic statement.",
        "The formal properties of GEN are however subject to debate: in particular, it is not clear which natural language quantifier it would map onto (some view it as most, but this approach requires some complex domain restriction to deal with sentences such as 12).",
        "In this paper, we take a different approach which sidesteps some of the intractable problems associated with the literature on generics and which also extends to definite plurals.",
        "Instead of talking of ambiguous quantification, we will talk of underspeciied quantiication, or underquan-tiication.",
        "By this, we mean that the bare plural, rather than exhibiting a silent, GEN quantifier, simply features a placeholder in the logical form which must be filled with the appropriate quantifier (e.g., uq(x, cat'(x), sleep'(x)), where uq is the placeholder quantifier).",
        "This account caters for the facts that so-called generics can so easily be quantified via traditional quantifiers, that GEN is silent in all known languages, and it explains also why it is the bare form which has the highest productivity, and can refer to a range of quantified sets, from existentials to universals.",
        "Using the underquantification hypothesis, we can paraphrase any generic of the form 'X does Y' as 'there is a set of things X, a certain number of which do Y' (note the partitive construction).",
        "Such a paraphrase allows us to also resolve ambiguously quantified definite plurals, which have traditionally been associated with universals, outside of the genericity phenomenon (e.g. Lyons, 1999).",

      "text": [
        "It is usual to talk of 'annotation' generically, to cover any process that involves humans using a set of guidelines to mark some specific linguistic phenomenon in some given text.",
        "However, we would argue that, when considering the aims of an annotation task and its relation to the existing linguistic literature, it becomes possible to distinguish between various types of annotation.",
        "Further, we will show that our own effort situates itself in a little studied relation to formal semantics.",
        "The most basic type of annotation is the one where computational linguists mark large amounts of textual data with well-known and well-understood labels.",
        "The production of tree banks like the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) makes use of undisputed linguistic categories such as parts of speech.",
        "The aim is to make the computer learn and use irrefutable bits of linguistics.",
        "(Note that, despite agreement, the representation of those categories may differ: see for example the range of available parts of speech tag sets.)",
        "This type of task mostly involves basic syntactic knowledge, but can be taken to areas of syntax and semantics where the studied phenomena have a (somewhat) clear, agreed upon definition (Kingsbury et al., 2002).",
        "We must clarify that in those cases, the choice of a formalism may already imply a certain theoretical position - leading to potential incompatibilities between formalisms.",
        "However, the categories for such annotation are themselves fixed: there is a generally agreed broad understanding of concepts such as noun phrases and coordination.",
        "Another type of annotation concerns tasks where the linguistic categories at play are not fixed.",
        "One example is discourse annotation according to rhetorical function (Teufel et al., 2006) where humans are asked to differentiate between several discursive categories such as 'contrast' or 'weakness'.",
        "In such a task, the computational linguist develops a theory where different states or values are associated with various phenomena.",
        "In order to show that the world functions according to the model presented, experimentation is required.",
        "This usually takes the form of an annotation task where several human subjects are required to mark pieces of text following guidelines inferred from the model.",
        "The intuition behind the annotation effort is that agreement between humans support the claims of the theory (Teufel, in press).",
        "In particular, it may confirm that the phenomena in question indeed exist and that the values attributed to them are clearly defined and distinguishable.",
        "The work is mostly of a descriptive nature - it creates phenomenological definitions that encompass bits of observable language.",
        "Our own work is similar to the latter type of annotation in that it is trying to capture a phenomenon that is still under investigation in the linguistic literature.",
        "However, it is also different because the categories we use are fixed by language: the quantifiers some, most and all exist and we assume that their definition is agreed upon by speakers of English.",
        "What we are trying to investigate is whether those quantifiers should be used at all in the context of ambiguous quantification.",
        "The type of annotation carried out in this paper can be said to have more formal aims than the tasks usually attempted in computational linguistics.",
        "In particular, it concerns itself with some of the broad claims made by formal semantics: its model-theoretical view and the use of generalised quantifiers to formalise noun phrases.",
        "In Section 1, we assumed that quantifiers denote relations between sets and presented the task of quantification resolution as choosing the 'correct' set relation for a particular noun phrase in a particular sentence - implying some sort of truth value at work throughout the process: the correct set relation produces the sentence with truth value 1 while the other set relations produce a truth value of 0.",
        "What we declined to discuss, though, is the way that those reference sets were selected in natural language, i.e. we didn't make claims about what model, or models, are used by humans when they compute the truth value of a given quantified statement.",
        "The annotation task may not answer this question but it should help us ascertain to what extent humans share a model of the world.",
        "In Section 2, we also argued that all subject generic noun phrases could be analysed in terms of quantification.",
        "That is, an (underspecified) generalised quantifier is at work in sentences that contain such generic NPs.",
        "It is expected that if the annotation is feasible and shows good agreement between annotators, the quantification hypothesis would be confirmed.",
        "Thus, annotation may allow us to make semantic claims such as 'genericity does quantify'.",
        "Note that the categories we assume are intuitive and do not depend on a particular representation: it is possible to reuse our annotation with a different formalism as long as the theoretical assumption of quantification is agreed upon.",
        "We are not aware of any annotation work in computational linguistics that contributes to validating (or invalidating) a particular formal theory.",
        "In that respect, the experiments presented in this paper are of a slightly different nature than the standard research on annotation (despite the fact that, as we will show in the next section, they also aim at producing data for a language analysis system).",
        "The aim of our work being the production of an automatic quantification resolution system, we need an annotated corpus to train and test our machine learning algorithm.",
        "There is no corpus that we know of which would give us the required data.",
        "The closest contestants are the ACE corpus (2008) and the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000) which both focus on the phenomenon of genericity, as described in the linguistic literature.",
        "Unfortunately, neither of those corpora are suitable for use in a general quantification task.",
        "The ACE corpus only distinguishes between 'generic' and 'specific' entities.",
        "The classification proposed by the authors of the corpus is therefore a lot broader than the one we are attempting here and there is no direct correspondence between their labels and natural language quantifiers: we have shown in Section 2 that genericity didn't map to a particular division of the quantifi-cational space.",
        "Furthermore, the ACE guidelines contradict to some extent the literature on generic-ity.",
        "They require for instance that a generic mention be quantifiable with all, most or any.",
        "This implies that statements such as Mosquitoes carry malaria either refer to a kind only (i.e. they are not quantified) or are not generic at all.",
        "Further, despite the above reference to quantification, the authors seem to separate genericity and universal quantification as two antithetical phenomena, as shown by the following quote: \"Even if the author may intend to use a GEN reading, if he/she refers to all members of the set rather than the set itself, use the SPC tag\".",
        "The GNOME annotation scheme is closer in essence to the literature on genericity and much more detailed than the ACE guidelines.",
        "However, the scheme distinguishes only between generic and non-generic entities, as in the ACE corpus case, and the corpus itself is limited to three genres: museum labels, pharmaceutical leaflets, and tutorial dialogues.",
        "The guidelines are therefore tailored to the domains under consideration; for instance, bare noun phrases are said to be typically generic.",
        "This restricted solution has the advantage of providing good agreement between annotators (Poesio, 2004 reports a Kappa value of 0.82 for this annotation)."

        "In our scheme, we introduce the annotators to the concepts of quantiication and kind.",

        "To help our annotators make decisions in those cases, we ask them to distinguish what the noun phrase might refer to when they first hear it and what it refers to at the end of the sentence, i.e., when the verbal predicate has imposed further constraints on the quantification of the NP.",
        "Guidelines are provided for five basic phrase types: quantified noun phrases, proper nouns, plurals, non-bare singulars and bare singulars.",
