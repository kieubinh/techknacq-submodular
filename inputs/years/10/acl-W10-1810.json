        "To arrive at a solution, we have evaluated 3 different possible methods of annotation.",
        "The final method involves three passes: (1) manual identification of a light verb construction, (2) annotation based on the light verb construction's Frame File, and (3) a deterministic merging of the first two passes.",
        "We also discuss how in various languages the light verb constructions are identified and can be distinguished from the non-light verb word groupings."

        "One of the aims in natural language processing, specifically the task of semantic role labeling (SRL), is to correctly identify and extract the different semantic relationships between words in a given text.",
        "In such tasks, verbs are considered important, as they are responsible for assigning and controlling the semantic roles of the arguments and adjuncts around it.",
        "Thus, the goal of the SRL task is to identify the arguments of the predicate and label them according to their semantic relationship to the predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2003).",
        "To this end, PropBank (Palmer et.",
        "al., 2005) has developed semantic role labels and labeled large corpora for training and testing of supervised systems.",
        "PropBank identifies and labels the semantic arguments of the verb on a verb-by-verb basis, creating a separate Frame",
        "File that includes verb specific semantic roles to account for each subcategorization frame of the verb.",
        "It has been shown that training supervised systems with PropBank's semantic roles for shallow semantic analysis yield good results (see",
        "CoNLL 2005 and 2008).",
        "However, semantic role labeling tasks are often complicated by multiword expressions (MWEs) such as idiomatic expressions (e.g., 'Stop pulling my legV), verb particle constructions (e.g., 'You must get over your shyness.",
        "'), light verb constructions (e.g., 'take a walk', 'give a lecture'), and other complex predicates (e.g., V+V predicates such as Hindi's pctxH aw nikal gayaa, lit.",
        "'exit went', means 'left' or 'departed').",
        "MWEs that involve verbs are especially challenging because the subcategorization frame of the predicate is no longer solely dependent on the verb alone.",
        "Rather, in many of these cases the argument structure is assigned by the union of two predicating elements.",
        "Thus, it is important that the manual annotation of semantic roles, which will be used by automatic SRL systems, define and label these MWEs in a consistent and effective manner.",
        "In this paper we focus on the PropBank annotation of light verb constructions (LVCs).",
        "We have developed a multilingual schema for annotating LVCs that takes into consideration the similarities and differences shared by the construction as it appears in English, Arabic, Chinese, and Hindi.",
        "We also discuss in some detail the practical challenges involved in the crosslinguistic analysis of LVCs, which we hope will bring us a step closer to a unified crosslinguistic analysis.",
        "Since NomBank, as a companion to PropBank, provides corresponding semantic role labels for noun predicates (Meyers et al., 2004), we would like to take advantage of NomBank's existing nominalization Frame Files and annotations as much as possible.",
        "A question that we must therefore address is, \"Are nominalization argument structures exactly the same whether or not they occur within an LVC?\"",
        "as will be discussed in section 6.1."

        "Linguistically LVCs are considered a type of a complex predicate.",
        "Many studies from differing angles and frameworks have characterized complex predicates as a fusion of two or more predicative elements.",
        "For example, Rosen (1997) treats complex structures as complementation structures, where the argument structure of elements in a complex predicate are fused together.",
        "Goldberg (1993) takes a constructional approach to complex predicates and arrives at an analysis that is comparable to viewing complex predicates as a single lexical item.",
        "Similarly, Mohanan (1997) assumes different levels of linguistic representation for complex predicates in which the elements, such as the noun and the light verb, functionally combine to give a single clausal nucleus.",
        "Alsina (1997) and Butt (1997) suggest that complex predicates may be formed by syntactically independent elements whose argument structures are brought together by a predicate composition mechanism.",
        "While there is no clear-cut definition of LVCs, let alone the whole range of complex predicates, for the purposes of this study, we have adapted our approach largely from Butt's (2004) criteria for defining LVCs.",
        "LVCs are characterized by a light verb and a predicating complement (henceforth, true predicate) that \"combine to predicate as a single element.\"",
        "(Ibid.)",
        "In LVC, the verb is considered semantically bleached in such a way that the verb does not hold its full predicating power.",
        "Thus, the light verb plus its true predicate can often be paraphrased by a verbal form of the true predicate without loss of the core meaning of the expression.",
        "For example, the light verb 'gave' and the predicate 'lecture' in 'gave a lecture' , together form a single predicating unit such that it can be paraphrased by 'lectured'.",
        "True predicates in LVCs can be a noun (the object of the verb or the object of the preposition in a prepositional phrase), an adjective, or a verb.",
        "One light verb plus true predicate combination found commonly across all our PropBank languages (i.e., English, Arabic, Chinese, and Hindi) is the noun as the object of the verb as in 'Sara took [a stroll] along the beach'.",

        "The PropBank annotation process can be broken down into two major steps: creation of the Frame Files for verbs occurring in the data and annotation of the data using the Frame Files.",
        "During the creation of the Frame Files, the usages of the verbs in the data are examined by linguists (henceforth, \"framers\").",
        "Based on these observations, the framers create a Frame File for each verb containing one or more framesets, which correspond to coarse-grained senses of the predicate lemma.",
        "Each frameset specifies the PropBank labels (i.e., ARG0, ARG1,...ARG5) corresponding to the argument structure of the verb.",
        "Additionally, illustrative examples are included for each frameset, which will later be referenced by the annotators.",
        "These examples also include the use of the ARGM labels.",
        "Thus, the framesets are based on the examination of the data, the framers' linguistic knowledge and native-speaker intuition.",
        "At times, we also make use of the syntactic and semantic behavior of the verb as described by certain lexical resources.",
        "These resources include VerbNet (Kipper et.",
        "al., 2006) and FrameNet (Baker et.",
        "al., 1998) for English, a number of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries for Arabic, and Hindi WordNet and DS Parses available, we consult existing framesets of words with similar meanings across different languages.",
        "The data awaiting annotation are passed onto the annotators for a double-blind annotation process using the previously created framesets.",
        "The double annotated data is then adjudicated by a third annotator, during which time the differences of the two annotations are resolved to produce the Gold Standard.",
        "Two major guiding considerations during the framing and annotating process are data consistency and annotator productivity.",
        "During the frameset creation process, verbs that share similar semantic and syntactic characteristics are framed similarly.",
        "During the annotation process, the data is organized by verbs so that each verb is tackled all at once.",
        "In doing so, we firstly ensure that the framesets of similar verbs, and in turn, the annotation of the verbs, will both be consistent across the data.",
        "Secondly, by tackling annotation on verb-by-verb basis, the annotators are able to concentrate on a single verb at a time, making the process easier and faster for the annotators.",
        "Annotating LVC",
        "A similar process must be followed when annotating light verb constructions The first step is to create consistent Frame Files for light verbs.",
        "Then in order to make the annotation process produce consistent data at a reasonable speed, we have decided to carry out the light verb annotation in three passes (Table 1): (1) annotate the light verb, (2) annotate the true predicate, and (3) merge the two annotations into one.",
        "The first pass involves the identification of the light verb.",
        "The most important parts of this step are to identify a verb as having bleached meaning, thereafter assign a generic light verb frameset and identify the true predicating expression of the sentence, which would be marked with ARG-PRX (i.e., ARGument-PRedicating eXpression).",
        "For English, for example, annotators were instructed to use Butt's (2004) criteria as described in Section 2.",
        "These criteria required that annotators be able to recognize whether or not the complement of a potential light verb was itself a predicating element.",
        "To make this occasionally difficult judgment, annotators used a simple heuristic test of whether or not the complement was headed by an element that has a verbal counterpart.",
        "If so, the light verb frameset was selected.",
        "The second pass involves the annotation of the sentence with the true predicate as the relation.",
        "During this pass, the true predicate is annotated with an appropriate frameset.",
        "In the third pass, the arguments and the modifiers of the two previous passes are reconciled and merged into a single annotation.",
        "In order to reduce the number of hand annotation, it is preferable for this last pass, the Pass 3, to be done automatically.",
        "Since the nature of the light verb is different from that of other verbs as described in Section 2, the advantage of doing the annotation of the light verb and the true predicate on separate passes is that in the light verb pass the annotators will be able to quickly dispose of the verb as a light verb and in the second pass, they will be allowed to solely focus on the annotation of the light verb's true predicate.",
        "The descriptions of how the arguments and modifiers of the light verbs and their true predicates are annotated are mentioned in Table 1, but notably, none of the examples in it currently include the annotation of arguments and modifiers.",
        "This is intentional, as coming to an agreement concerning the details of what exactly each of the three passes looks like while meeting the needs of the four PropBank languages is quite challenging.",

        "Many of the objections so far to Methods 1 and 2 have centered on the issue of semantic fidelity during the annotation of each of the two passes.",
        "The debate of whether both passes should be annotated and to what extent has practical implications for the third Pass, as described above.",

        "Instead, we argue that the semantic argument structure of the light verb plus true predicate combination can in practice be different from that of the expressions taken independently as has been proposed by various studies (Butt, 2004; Rosen, 1997; Grimshaw & Mester, 1988).",
        "Thus, we resolve the cases in which the differences in argument roles as assigned by the light verb and the nominalization (Section 5.2) by handling the argument structure of the standard nominalization separately from that of the nominalization participating in the LVC.",
        "In the example 'Chen made another appearance in court', we annotate 'Chen' as the Agent (ARG0) of the full predicate '[make] [appearance]', which is different from the argument structure of the standard nominalization which would label 'Chen' to be the Patient argument (ARG1).",

        "In this final method, Pass 3 can be achieved completely deterministically.",
        "The major difference in this annotation scheme from that of Methods 1 and 2 is that instead of annotating in terms of the semantics of the bare noun, adjective or verb, the argument structure is determined for the entire predicate or the full event: semantics of the light verb plus the true predicate.",

      "text": [
        "As we have discussed in Section 2, we adapted our approach from Butt's (2004) definition of LVCs.",
        "That is, an LVC is characterized by a semantically bleached light verb and a true predicate.",
        "These elements combine as a single predicating unit, in such a way that the light verb plus its true predicate can be paraphrased by a verbal form of the true predicate without loss of the core meaning of the expression (e.g. 'lectured' for 'gave a lecture').",
        "Also, as discussed in Section 6.1, our approach advocates the notion that the semantic argument structure of the light verb plus true predicate is different from that of the expressions taken independently (as also proposed by Butt, 2004; Rosen, 1997; Grimshaw & Mester, 1988 among others).",
        "While these definitions are appropriate for the PropBank annotation task as we have presented it, there are still cases that merit closer attention.",
        "Even English with a rather limited set of verbs that are commonly cited as LVCs, includes a problematic mixture of what could arguably be termed either LVCs or idiomatic expressions: 'make exception', 'take charge'.",
        "This difficulty in part is the effect of frequency and entrenchment of particular constructions.",
        "The light verbs themselves do not diminish in form over time in a manner similar to auxiliaries (Butt, 2004), although the complements of common LVCs can change over time such that it is no longer clear that the complement is a predicating element.",
        "In the case of English, the expressions 'take charge' may be more commonly found today as a LVC than independently in its verbal form.",
        "As we discovered with our annotators, native English speakers are uncomfortable using the verb 'charge' (i.e. to burden with a responsibility) as an independent matrix verb.",
        "A similar phenomenon can be seen in Arabic, where the predicate H 6^ lit.",
        "'release name' exemplifies a prototypical LVC that means 'to name'.",
        "However, in our data we see cases in which the complement is missing, while the semantics of the LVC remains intact:",
        "conj rel be released.he prep-him/it def-sector def-public lit 'Or what is released to it \"the public sector\"' 'Or what is called/named \"the public sector.\"'",
        "This raises the question of: when does a construction that may have once been an LVC become more properly defined as an idiomatic expression due to such entrenchment?",
        "Idiomatic expressions can potentially be distinguished from LVCs through judgments of how fixed or syntactically variable a construction is, and on the basis of how semantically transparent or decomposable the construction is (Nunberg et.",
        "al., 1994).",
        "However, sometimes the dividing line is hard to draw.",
        "A similar problem arises in determining whether a construction is a case of an LVC or simply a usage with a distinct sense of the verb.",
        "Take, for example, the following Arabic sentence.",
        "take.he def-food lit.",
        "'(he) took food' 'he ate'",
        "Here, the Arabic word *l^=- 'food' is the noun derivation of the root shared by the verb s^*\" 'to eat', in such a way that the sentence could be rephrased as is^\" '(he) ate'.",
        "This example falls neatly into the LVC category.",
        "However, further examples suggest that the example is a case of a distinct sense of 'to take orally' where the restrictions on the object are that the theme must be something that can be taken by mouth:",
        "«lj^Jl Jjlïi «lin-.ll JjLïi take.he def-medicine take.he def-soup 'he took medicine' 'he took soup'",
        "Finally, determining the appropriate criteria to distinguish between a truly semantically bleached verb and verbs that seem to be participating in complex predication but contribute more to the semantics of the construction is a challenge for all languages.",
        "For example, in English data, there are potential LVCs with verbs that are not often thought of as light verbs, such as 'produce an alteration' and 'issue a complaint'.",
        "Although most English speakers would agree that the verbs in these constructions do not contribute to the semantics of the construction (e.g. 'issue a complaint' can be paraphrased to 'to complain'), there are similar constructions such as 'register a complaint,' wherein the verb cannot be considered light.",
        "For the purposes of annotation, where it is necessary for annotators to understand clear criteria for distinguishing light verbs, such cases are highly problematic because there is no deterministic way to measure the extent to which the verbal element contributes to the semantics of the construction.",
        "In turn, there is not a good way to distinguish some of these borderline verbs from their normal, heavy usages.",
        "Such problems can be resolved by establishing language-specific semantic or syntactic tests that can be used for taking care of the borderline cases of LVCs.",
        "However, there is one other plausible manner we have identified that could help in detecting such atypical LVCs.",
        "This can be done by focusing on the argument structures of predicating complements rather than focusing on the verbs themselves.",
        "Grimshaw & Mester (1988) suggest that the formation of LVCs involves argument transfer from the predicating complement to the verb, which is semantically bleached and thematically incomplete and assigns no thematic roles itself.",
        "Similarly, Stevenson et al.",
        "(2004) suggest that the acceptability of a potential LVC depends on the semantic properties of the complement.",
        "Thus, atypical LVCs, such as the English construction 'issue a complaint,' can potentially be detected during the annotation of eventive nouns, planned for all PropBank languages.",
        "This process will make our treatment of LVCs more comprehensive.",
        "Used with our language-specific semantic and syntactic criteria relating to both the verb and the predicating complement, it will help us to more effectively capture as many types of LVCs as possible, including those of the V+ADJ and V+V varieties."

      "heading": "8. Usefulness of our Approach",
      "text": [
        "Two basic approaches have previously been taken to handle all types of MWEs, including LVCs in natural language processing applications.",
        "The first is to treat MWEs quite simply as fixed expressions or long strings of words with spaces in between; the second is to treat MWEs as purely compositional (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "The words-with-spaces approach is adequate for handling fixed idiomatic expressions, but issues of lexical proliferation and flexibility quickly arise when this approach is applied to light verbs, which are syntactically flexible and can number in the tens of thousands for a given language (Stevenson et al., 2004; Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Nonetheless, large-scale lexical resources such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1999) continue to expand with entries that are MWEs.",
        "The purely compositional approach is also problematic for light verbs because it is notoriously difficult to predict which light verbs can grammatically combine with other predicating elements; thus, this approach leads to problems of overgeneration (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "In order to overcome this problem, Stevenson et al.",
        "(2004) attempted to determine which nominalizations could form a valid complement to the English light verbs take, give and make, using Levin's (1993) verb classes to group similar nominalizations.",
        "This approach was rather successful for take and give, but inconclusive for the verb make.",
        "Our approach can help to develop a resource that is useful whether one takes a words-with-spaces approach or a compositional approach.",
        "Specifically, for those implementing a words-with-spaces approach, the resulting PropBank annotation can serve as a lexical resource listing for LVCs.",
        "For those interested in implementing a compositional approach the PropBank annotation can serve to assist in predicting likely combinations.",
        "Moreover, information in the PropBank Frame Files can be used to generalize across classes of nouns that can occur with a given light verb with the help of lexical resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Baker et.",
        "al., 1998), and VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) (in a manner similar to the approach of Stevenson et al.",
