        "Complex predicates are predicates composed of more than one element but functionally equivalent to a single predicate.",
        "Examples of complex predicates (CPs) are constructions of verb+noun, like have a rest, take a walk, and constructions verb+verb, like the constructions with a causative verb in Portuguese, like mandar 1er o livro a alguem 'make read the book to someone'.",
        "These constructions raise interesting questions regarding the aspectual, semantic and syntactic properties which underlie the relationship between the elements of the CP.",
        "There are different theoretical perspectives on the compositional nature of CPs.",
        "For example, in the case of constructions of the type verb+noun, the verb is either considered a light verb (Jespersen, 1949) or a support verb (Gross, 1981), in the sense that it has lost part or all of its meaning and has no predicative value in the construction, or as an auxiliary verb with aspectual properties (Abeille et al., 1998).",
        "Our hypothesis is that both elements of the CP seem to contribute to the properties of complex predicates, in such a way that the argument structure and the attribution of thematic roles are determined by both constituents through the combination of their thematic structures (Grimshaw, 1988).",
        "One has to address several important questions: is there a systematic relationship between the syntactic and semantic selection properties of the two elements?",
        "How do the argument structure of the light verb and the derived noun combine and contribute to define the complex predicate?",
        "To study these questions we annotated the Portuguese CIN-TIL corpus (Barreto et al., 2006) with a new layer on CPs.",
        "By taking into consideration different types of CPs and by using corpus data for our analysis of their properties, the objective is to present a unified approach to CP formation, along which the CP constructions available in Portuguese may be accounted for, namely in what concerns their lexico-syntactic properties and their interpretation.",
        "Here we focus on the corpus annotation of complex predicates.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we discuss related work on the annotation of CPs in other languages.",
        "In section 3 we present a typology of complex predicates.",
        "In section 4 we detail our the annotation schema and also focus on several specific cases of CPs and the annotation labels for these cases.",
        "In section 5 we give more information about the CINTIL corpus and in 6 we show the outcomes of the annotations and present statistics on the types of CPs that we found in the corpus.",
        "We conclude in section 7."

        "For other languages, people have proposed different representations for CPs and for some languages there are corpora available enhanced with CP labeling.",
        "The Prague TreeBank for Czech, which is based on a dependency grammar, labels CPs explicitly.",
        "A complex predicate is represented by two nodes: the verb node is assigned a functor according to the function of the entire complex predicate in the sentence structure; the nominal node is assigned the CPHR functor, which signals that it is a part of a multi-word predicate, and is represented as an immediate daughter of the node for the verbal component (Mikulova et al., 2006; Cinkova and Kolaîova, 2005).",
        "For German there is an example corpus annotated with verb phrases and light verbs (Fellbaum et al., 2006).",
        "However, only idiomatic expressions are labeled in this German corpus while we focus on non-idiomatic CPs.",
        "Calzolari et al.",
        "(2002) treat support verb constructions (verb+noun), and focus their attention, just like we did in our approach, on constructions where the subject of the verb is a participant in the event denoted by the noun.",
        "Their objective is however not corpus annotation, but the creation of a computational lexicon of MWEs with both syntactic and semantic information.",
        "Also the field of semantic or thematic role labeling investigates constructions of verb+noun, but it focuses on predicate-argument structures in general, while we focus on a specific type of relations.",
        "FrameNet uses frame semantics theory to represent such predicate-argument structures which also includes handling complex predicates (e.g. (Johnson and Fillmore, 2000)).",
        "For German, there exists a fully annotated corpus with semantic frames (Erk et al., 2003).",
        "The basis of the Framenet semantic annotation are conceptual frames expressing an event or object and the semantic arguments (frame elements) that are (obligatory or optional) parts of the frames.",
        "They also specifically address support verbs and observe that support verbs often occur with nouns expressing an event (Johansson and Nugues, 2006).",
        "In a Framenet semantic annotation, support verbs are not considered as parts of frames or as part of the frame elements, they are annotated with a specific 'support verb' label.",
        "We, on the contrary, view CP as one semantic and syntactic unit.",
        "In Nombank, a distinction is made between idioms (which in principle are not marked) and light verb plus noun combinations, which are to be annotated, and criteria are given to make such distinction (English (Meyers, 2007), Chinese (Xue, 2006)).",
        "In (1) we show a NomBank annotation example of the sentence with a complex predicate.",
        "Usually, CPs of the type verb+verb are treated as infinitive dependent clauses and are not annotated as CPs (cf. the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the Portuguese treebank Cordial-SIN (Carrilho and Magro, 2009)).",

        "A complex predicate has: a multi-headed and complex argument structure; more than one lexical unit, each contributing part of the information normally associated with a single predicate and a grammatical functional structure equal to the one of a simple predicate.",
        "Several types of constructions are in accordance to this definition of CPs: (i) two main verbs, forming a restructuring construction, like querer estudar 'to want to study' (ii) two main verbs in a causative construction, like fazer rir 'to make laugh'; (iii) a light verb followed by a noun: dar um passeio 'to take a walk', ter medo 'to have fear'; (iv) a light verb followed by a secondary predicate: either an adjective, like tornar a historia credivel 'make the story believable', or a prepositional phrase, like fazer x em pedaçços 'to make x into pieces'; (v) two concatenated verbs (serial verb constructions), like O Pedro pegou e despediu-se (lit: 'Pedro took and said goodbye').",
        "This last construction is mostly restricted to the informal spoken register.",
        "Regarding constructions (1) and (ii) with two main verbs, it is generally assumed that these CPs include at least two verbs which behave as a single constituent under local phenomena such as Clitic Climbing or Long Object Movement (Kayne, 1975; Goncalves, 2002; Goncalves, 2003).",
        "Each one of the verbs preserves its own argument structure.",
        "In the case of constructions (iii) involving a light verb and a noun derived from a verb, one of the most frequently referred property is the possibility of being paraphrased by the main verb from which the noun is derived (see example 2), although this is not a necessary condition.",
        "(2) (a) dar um contributo /contribuir",
        "'to give a contribution' / 'to contribute' (b) ter um desmaio / desmaiar to have a blackout' / to faint'",
        "Light verbs occurring in these constructions have a rather similar semantics across different languages and involve mostly verbs like have, take and give in English (Bowern, 2006) and ter to have', dar to give', fazer to make' in Portuguese.",
        "Furthermore, both the light verb and the derived noun contribute to predicate information and argument structure and theta-role assignment appear to be determined simultaneously by the two constituents.",
        "It is important to determine the exact nature of the semantic contribution of light verbs to the whole predicate and the similarities and differences between the light verb construction and its lexicalized verbal counterpart, if it exists."

        "For example, contexts similar to (12) but with a singular NP, as in example 14a, can receive two possible structural interpretations: the NP justica 'justice' can be interpreted as the subject of the higher verb (a long object movement construction and consequently a CP construction) or as the direct object of the second verb (an impersonal construction).",

        "In causative constructions with CPs (Table 5 ), the verb fazer 'make' is clearly prominent in the written corpus, although it does not occur in the spoken one.",
        "The only causative verb in CP constructions in the spoken corpus is mandar 'order'.",
        "In causative constructions, contrary to restructuring ones, the genre seems to influence the lexical choice of the higher verb of the complex predicate.",
        "The verb+noun constructions are divided in two different tables, according to our categorization in bare nouns (Table 6) and nouns preceded by a determiner (Table 7).",
        "The same three verbs enter the constructions although their frequencies are different in the two different structures: the verb fazer is clearly dominant when followed by a noun preceded by a determiner, while the verb ter is the more frequent light verb with bare nouns."

        "We presented the annotation process of complex predicates in the CINTIL corpus.",
        "We first explained our theoretical framework and gave a broad typology of CPs.",
        "Next we detailed the annotation schema that we used and zoomed in on some difficult cases.",
        "We presented the outcomes of the annotation work.",
        "We gave a first broad statistical analysis of the annotations, and next we zoomed in on some insights in characteristics of CPs in Portuguese that this new annotation layer has offered.",
        "This new resource provides diversified authentic data that will enable a general overview of CP constructions and can shed new light on the Syntax-Semantics interface.",
        "It is also an important part for forthcoming tasks of syntactic and semantic corpus annotation.",
        "In the future we plan to further analyze the results of the verb+verb types of CPs.",
        "The large number of ambiguous cases and the few contexts which give us definite clues for categorizing the sequence as a CP challenges our concept of complex predicates.",
        "The causative and restructuring constructions require more attention and further study.",
        "As to the verb+noun constructions, we want to examine the contexts with and without determiner to see if the same CP can occur in both structures.",
        "We also want to look further into the high frequency of specific light verbs with bare nouns and the possible relationship with the semantics of the light verbs.",
        "In this study we restricted the annotation to a particular group of light verbs.",
        "In a next step we would like to look at a broader list to try to establish the necessary properties to categorize a verb as a light verb.",
        "We plan to address, for example, certain contexts of psych-nouns like sentir medo 'feel fear', experi-enciar uma profunda emocäo 'experience a deep emotion', where the predicative nature of the verb is unclear.",
        "We also plan to enlarge our description and annotation of CPs to include idiomatic expressions with light verbs.",
