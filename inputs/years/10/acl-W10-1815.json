        "Meaning is essential to language.",
        "The importance of expressive, attitudinal/emotive, or social/interpersonal meaning has been noted by prominent linguists (Bühler, 1934; Lyons, 1977; Jakobson, 1996; Halliday, 1996).",
        "However, affect is still an understudied phenomenon in linguistics, although many affective computing applications actually apply to language (Picard, 1997).",
        "The motivation behind this discussion is to bring a special and rather unique dataset to the attention of reseachers in the field of natural language processing, affective computing, and related areas.",
        "This paper discusses affect representation, presents an affect dataset, and then focuses on clear-cut cases of affective meaning and expression in text with a summary of an analysis of data for which human annotators highly agreed on the assignment of affect labels.",

        "There is a lack of consensus on a model of affect (Picard, 1997; Scherer, 2003) and controversy surrounds such modeling.",
        "Pragmatically, different views of affect complement each other and jointly create a basis for understanding affective language phenomena.",
        "Affect modeling decisions are arguably application dependent.",
        "For a detailed literature review on previous work on how to characterize affect, affect in text-based linguistics and in subjective NLP or speech technology, and tales and oral narratives, see Alm (2009).",
        "Also see http://emotion-research.net/.",
        "Resulting originally from an interest in text analysis for child-directed expressive text-to-speech synthesis, this dataset relies on a categorical annotation scheme of basic emotions; a model supported by the compelling observation that emotive facial expressions were cross-culturally recognized well above chance (Ekman and Friesen, 1998).",
        "In vision and speech research \"the Big Six\" (Cornelius, 2000) (i.e. happiness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust, and sadness) appear quite often.",
        "Nevertheless, the Ekmanian view remains controversial.",
        "For instance, Russel and Fernandez-Dols (1998) have critiqued the relevance, methods, and rigor of the \"Facial Expression Program\" for emotion.",
        "One alternative is free labeling (i.e. annotators may come up with their own labels), but that may result in impractical, large label sets.",
        "A study grouping items from open-ended responses to a perception test on characterizing certain fairy tale sentences noted that although other cases occurred, Big Six emotions were frequent in answers (Brale et al., 2005).",
        "As regards the dataset's use of affect categories, several empirical studies have shown above chance performance for recognition of categorical emotions in classification tasks involving prosody.",
        "Categorical labels may be more straightforward for annotators to conceptualize compared to dimensional scales, as participants pointed out in a study (Francisco and Gervas, 2006).",
        "Also, categories are arguably suitable for pedagogy, and they naturally fit computational classification.",
        "A basic affect category is also broad enough to span related affect states, e.g. the emotion family (Ek-man, 1994) of angry could also cover concepts such as irritated, annoyed and enraged.",
        "Finally, the foundational nature of basic, categorical affects intuitively seems to fit a child-directed context and fairy tales contents, which may include certain canonical topics and behaviors, compared to more spontaneous discourse."

      "text": [
        "The affect dataset consists of 176 stories (more than 15,000 sentences) by Beatrix Potter, the Brothers Grimm and H. C. Andersen, manually annotated at the sentence level by pairs of annotators.",
        "For the annotation process, annotators read tales and had to make a choice from a set of affect categories for sentences.",
        "Each sentence was given four affect labels since each of two annotators assigned both a primary emotion (guided by the pre-cence of a feeler, mostly a character or character type in the text) and a background mood to a sentence.",
        "The four labels were then combined into a sentence's affect labels.",
        "For more details on the annotation process, cf. (Alm, 2009).",
        "The label set consisted of a set of categorical affect labels.",
        "Prior to the analysis below, angry and disgusted were merged (motivated by data sparsity and related semantics) into one category, as were positively and negatively surprised, yielding a merged set of affect labels: angry-disgusted,",
        "fearful, happy, neutral, sad, surprised.",
        "Interannotator agreement can be an artifact of annotation scheme and procedure.",
        "For example, pairs might be trained to annotate similarly, across-the-board rules (e.g. questions are negative) might ignore subtle decisions, or problematic items might be removed.",
        "Such approaches may yield higher agreement, cleaner data, and perhaps better performance and more consistent",
        "Figure 1: (Dis)agreement: merged labels trained applications.",
        "But, the relevance of that for study of linguistic behavior is less clear.",
        "Za-enen (2006) noted that \"[f]or interannotator agreement, it suffices that all annotators do the same thing.",
        "But even with full annotator agreement it is not sure that the task captures what was originally intended\" (577); this should not be confused with understanding a linguistic issue.",
        "Fig.",
        "1 reports on a diagnostic alternative with the ratios of (dis)agreement types.",
        "This avoids the concept of ground truth, which may not hold for all language phenomena.",
        "Affect, which is highly subjective, is arguably better captured by flexible acceptability.Fig.",
        "1 shows that sentences only labeled neutral were frequent, as were disagreements, which were more common for sentences marked both with neutral and one or more affect classes.",
        "This parallels findings for polarity expressions in subjective texts (Wilson et al., 2005), and shows that the border between affective and neutral is fuzzy.",
        "(Affect perception lacks clear definitions and is subjective, and neutrality suffers from the same dilemma.)",
        "A sentence with high agreement affect was defined as all four primary emotion and mood labels having the same affective label (given the merged label set).",
        "These were more common than mixed affective labels."

        "Also, phrases in boldface illustrate the discussed characteristic, whereas phrases that annotators noted are underlined (single underscore for non-overlapping vs. double underscore for overlapping mark-up), and their feeler/s for the primary emotion annotation is/are included (with annotator subscripts to show if they had indicated the same or not) in parenthesis in small caps.",
        "Content words that directly name an affective state (e.g. reflecting a particular intensity) are common in high agreement sentences, cf.:",
        "angry-disgusted: They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.",
        "That narration can directly announce affective states is an indication of the important narrative role affect can play in stories.",
        "Also, Wilson and Wiebe (2003) interestingly noted that annotators agreed more strongly with strong subjective expressions, which affect words are examples of.",

        "Special cases include negation (e.g. not happy for sad); figurative/idiomatic phrases (e.g. one of his heartstrings had broken for sad); or appearance with more than one affect (e.g. anguish for SAD or FEARFUL).",
        "Expressions in the sentential context naming related or contrastive affective states not in the label set (e.g. dull, pride, relief, or shame) may also help evoke a particular affect, as in: happy: They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, \"Gee-up, my five horses.\"",
        "(hero1;2)",
        "Lexical items or phrases which describe actions, properties, behaviors, cognitive states, or objects associated with particular affects occur frequently in the examined high agreement subset, e.g. as in: happy: They laughed and they wept; and Peter embraced the old Fire-drum.",

        "MOTHER2, (TRUE) FATHER2)",

        "Negations may occur.",
        "Words or expressions of positive or negative polarity can help to set the scene with a particular affective mode, in particular with relation to context and acquired knowledge.",
        "Expressions of opposing polarity may be used as a contrast, as in: happy: It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and his little treasure upon earth.",
        "Modifiers can intensify the affective load.",
        "Lexical words and phrases may have permanent vs. occasional attitudinal meaning (Hedquist, 1978).",
        "Readers may from experience associate aquired knowledge about situations, visualizations, and behaviors with particular affects.",
        "For example, it is common knowledge that starving is traumatic: sad: He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.",
        "(hero1;2).",
        "Story worlds tend to involve canonical representations of characters, actions, functions, situations and objects.",
        "Surrounding context can be important for affective interpretations.",
        "Scenarios may include, e.g. an inspiration from weather, flowers, nature, or God; singing (or dancing, jumping); physical lack and need; sleep deprivation or allowance; addiction; incapability; unexpected observation; appearance/posture (or intonation); contextual guidance; or relate to marriage (see (Alm, 2009) for examples).",
        "In fact, arguably most discussed characteristics can be traced to acquired knowledge, experience, associations, or context.",
        "Speech acts reflect a certain kind of communicative knowledge that can have affective meaning (such as cursing, insulting, commanding), e.g.:",
        "angry-disgusted:",

        "(villain1;2)",

        "Affective high agreement sentences also include cases of mixed emotions, e.g. affect or affect-related words referring to more than one affect.",
        "The 'winning' affect may be inferred.",
        "Contrast might make it more prominent, as in: happy (mixed sad): He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.",
        "(main character/hero1;2)",

        "The high agreement sentence data may be particularly interesting for affect research, while other parts of the annotated, larger corpus may reveal insights on affect variation in text and perception thereof (bearing in mind that the dataset is not necessarily representative across domains and text types, nor of contemporary texts).",
        "Lastly, as noted above, developed knowledge, experience, associations, and context appear very important for affect understanding.",
        "This is also a substantial part of what makes the problem of automatically predicting affect from text so challenging; it involves levels of deep cognitive understanding rather than just extractable surface features.",
        "Whereas the discussed characteristics naturally do not consistute the answer to affect understanding, they may inform future search for it.",
