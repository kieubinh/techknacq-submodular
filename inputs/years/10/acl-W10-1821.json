        "The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the annotation of noun phrases in the Tubingen Treebank of Written German (TuBa-D/Z) can be transformed into chunks with no internal structure, as proposed in the CoNLL 2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).",
        "Chunk parsing is a form of partial parsing, in which non-recursive phrases are annotated while difficult decisions, such as prepositional phrase attachment, are left unsolved.",
        "Flat chunk representations are particularly suitable for machine learning approaches to partial parsing and are inspired by the IOB approach to NP chunking first proposed by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).",
        "They are particularly relevant for approaches that require an efficient analysis but not necessarily a complete syntactic analysis.",
        "German allows a higher degree of syntactic complexity in prenominal modification of the syntactic head of an NP compared to English.",
        "This is particularly evident in written texts annotated in the TuBa-D/Z.",
        "The complexity of German NPs that causes problems in the conversion to CoNLL-style chunks also affects PCFG parsing approaches to German.The complexity of NPs is one of the phenomena that have been addressed in tree transformation approaches for German parsing (Trushkina, 2004; Ule, 2007; Versley and Rehbein, 2009)."

      "heading": "2. Defining Chunks",
      "text": [
        "The notion of a chunk is orginally due to Abney (1991), who considers chunks as non-recursive phrases which span from the left periphery of a phrase to the phrasal head.",
        "Accordingly, the sentence \"The woman in the lab coat thought you had bought an expensive book.\"",
        "is assigned the chunk structure: \"[S [NP The woman] [PP in [NP the lab coat] ] [VP thought] ] [S [NP you] [VP had bought] [NP an [ADJP expensive] book]] .\".",
        "Abney-style chunk parsing is implemented as cascaded, finite-state transduction (cf. (Abney, 1996; Karlssonetal., 1995)).",
        "Notice that cascaded, finite-state transduction allows for the possibility of chunks containing other chunks as in the above sentence, where the prepositional chunk contains a noun chunk within.",
        "The only constraint on such nested chunks is the prohibition on recursive structures.",
        "This rules out chunks in which, for example, a noun chunk contains another noun chunk.",
        "A much stricter constraint on the internal structure of chunks was subsequently adopted by the shared task on chunk parsing as part of the Conference for Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) in the year 2000 (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).",
        "In this shared task, chunks were defined as non-overlapping, non-recursive phrases so that each word is part of at most one chunk.",
        "Based on this definition, the prepositional phrase in the sentence above would be chunked as \"[Prep in] [NP the lab coat]\".",
        "Since the prepositional chunk cannot have an embedded noun chunk, the definition of the CoNLL shared task assumed that the prepositional chunk only contains the preposition, thus taking the definition seriously that the chunk ends with the head.",
        "The noun chunk remains separate.",
        "Additionally, the noun phrase \"an expensive book\" is annotated as a noun chunk without internal structure.",
        "The CoNLL shared task definition of chunks is",
        "Der Spitzenreiter in ART NN APPR der europäischenGastgeberliga war ART ADJA NN VAFIN",
        "bei APPR den bosnischerBürgerkriegsflüchtlingen noch weitaus großzügiger ART ADJA NN ADV ADV ADJD",
        "useful for machine learning based approaches to chunking since it only requires one level of analysis, which can be represented as IOB-chunking (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).",
        "For English, this definition of chunks has become standard in the literature on machine learning.",
        "For German, chunk parsing has been investigated by Kermes and Evert (2002) and by Müller (2004).",
        "Both approaches used an Abney-style chunk definition.",
        "However, there is no corresponding flat chunk representation for German because of the complexity of pre-head modification in German noun phrases.",
        "Sentence (1) provides a typical example of this kind.",
        "'the father who loves his son'",
        "The structure in (1) violates both the Abney-style and the CoNLL-style definitions of chunks -Abney's because it is recursive and the CoNLL-style definition because of the embedding.",
        "A single-level, CoNLL-style chunk analysis will have to cope with the separation of the determiner \"der\" and the head of the outer phrase.",
        "We will discuss an analysis in section 5."
