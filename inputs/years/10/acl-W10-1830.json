        "Treebanks have become valuable resources in natural language processing as training corpora for natural language parsers, as repositories for linguistic research, or as evaluation corpora for different NLP systems.",
        "We define a treebank as a collection of syntactically annotated sentences.",
        "The annotation can vary from constituent to dependency or tecto-grammatical structures.",
        "The term treebank is mostly used to denote manually checked collections, but recently it has been extended to also refer to automatically parsed corpora.",
        "We have built manually checked treebanks for various text genres (see section 3): economy texts, a popular science philosophy novel, and technical user manuals.",
        "We are now entering a new genre, mountaineering reports, with the goal to link textual to spatial information.",
        "We build French and German treebanks of translated texts from the Swiss Alpine Club.",
        "This genre contains a multitude of geographical names (e.g. mountains and valleys, glaciers and rivers).",
        "Therefore we need to include the identification and grounding of these toponyms as part of the annotation process.",
        "In this paper we first describe our corpus of alpine texts, then our work on creating parallel treebanks which includes aligning the parallel trees on word and phrase level.",
        "We sketch the difficulties in disambiguating the toponyms and describe our integration of the toponym identifiers as a special kind of semantic annotation in the treebank."

      "text": [
        "In recent years the combined research on treebanks and parallel corpora has led to parallel treebanks.",
        "We have built a parallel treebank (English, German, Swedish) which contains 1500 sentences in three languages: 500 sentences each from Jostein Gaarder's novel \"Sophie's World\", from economy texts (e.g. business reports from mechanical engineering company ABB and from the bank SEB), and from a technical manual with usage instructions for a DVD player (Gohring, 2009).",
        "We have annotated the English sentences according to the well-established Penn Treebank guidelines.",
        "For German we followed the TIGER annotation guidelines, and we adapted these guidelines also for Swedish (see (Volk and Samuelsson, 2004)).",
        "For French treebank-ing we are looking for inspiration from the Le Monde treebank (Abeille et al., 2003) and from L'Arboratoire (Bick, 2010).",
        "The Le Monde treebank is a constituent structure treebank partially annotated with functional labels.",
        "L'Arboratoire is based on constraint grammar analysis but can also output constituent trees.",
        "After finishing the monolingual trees we aligned them on the word level and phrase level.",
        "For this purpose we have developed the TreeAligner (Lundborg et al., 2007).",
        "This program comes with a graphical user interface to insert or modify alignments between pairs of syntax trees.",
        "The TreeAligner displays tree pairs with the trees in mirror orientation (one top-up and one top-down).",
        "This has the advantage that the alignment lines cross fewer parts of the lower tree.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a tree pair with alignment lines.",
        "The lines denote translation equivalence.",
        "Both trees are constituent structure trees, but the edge labels contain function labels (like subject, object, attribute) which can be used to easily convert the trees to dependency structures (cf. (Marek et al., 2009)).",
        "Recently we have extended the TreeAligner's functionality from being solely an alignment tool to also being a powerful search tool over parallel treebanks (Volk et al., 2007; Marek et al., 2008).",
        "This enables our annotators to improve the alignment quality by cross-checking previous alignments.",
        "This functionality makes the TreeAligner also attractive to a wider user base (e.g. linguists, translation scientists) who are interested in searching rather than building parallel treebanks.",
        "Parallel treebanks have evolved into an active research field in the last decade.",
        "Cmejrek et al.",
        "(2003) have built a parallel treebank for the specific purpose of machine translation, the Czech-English Penn Treebank with tecto-grammatical dependency trees.",
        "Other parallel treebank projects include Croco (Hansen-Schirra et al., 2006) which is aimed at building a English-German treebank for translation studies, LinES an English-Swedish parallel treebank (Ahrenberg, 2007), and the English-French HomeCentre treebank (Hearne and Way, 2006), a hand-crafted parallel treebank consisting of 810 sentence pairs from a Xerox printer manual.",
        "Some researchers have tried to exploit parallel treebanks for example-based or statistical machine translation (Tinsley et al., 2009).",
        "Since manually created treebanks are too small for this purpose, various researchers have worked on automatically parsing and aligning parallel treebanks.",
        "Zhechev (2009) and Tiedemann and Kotze (2009) have presented methods for automatic cross-language phrase alignment.",
        "There have been various attempts to enrich treebanks with semantic information.",
        "For example, the Propbank project has assigned semantic roles to Penn treebank sentences (Kingsbury et al., 2002).",
        "Likewise the SALSA project has added frame-semantic annotations on top of syntax trees from the German TIGER treebank (Burchardt et al., 2006).",
        "Frame-semantics was extended to parallel treebanks by (Pado, 2007) and (Volk and Samuelsson, 2007).",
        "To our knowledge a treebank with grounded toponym information has not been created yet."
