        "Morphological analysis, tagging and lemmatization are essential for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications of both practical and theoretical nature.",
        "Modern taggers and analyzers are very accurate.",
        "However, the standard way to create them for a particular language requires substantial amount of expertise, time and money.",
        "A tagger is usually trained on a large corpus (around 100,000+ words) annotated with the correct tags.",
        "Morphological analyzers usually rely on large manually created lexicons.",
        "For example, the Czech analyzer (Hajic, 2004) uses a lexicon with 300,000+ entries.",
        "As a result, most of the world languages and dialects have no realistic prospect for morphological taggers or analyzers created in this way.",
        "We have been developing a method for creating morphological taggers and analyzers of fu-sional languages without the need for large-scale knowledge-and labor-intensive resources (Hana et al., 2004; Hana et al., 2006; Feldman and Hana, 2010) for the target language.",
        "Instead, we rely on (i) resources available for a related language and (ii) a limited amount of high-impact, low-",
        "!Fusional languages are languages in which several feature values are realized in one morpheme.",
        "For example Indo-European languages, including Czech, German, Romanian and Farsi, are predominantly fusional.",
        "cost manually created resources.",
        "This greatly reduces cost, time requirements and the need for (language-specific) linguistic expertise.",
        "The focus of our paper is on the creation of resources for the system we developed.",
        "Even though we have reduced the manual resource creation to the minimum, we have encountered a number of problems, including training language annotators, documenting the reasoning behind the tagset design and morphological paradigms for a specific language as well as creating support tools to facilitate and speed up the manual work.",
        "While these problems are analogous to those that arise with standard resource creation, the approach to their solution is often different as we discuss in the following sections."

        "• a reference grammar book for information",
        "about paradigms and closed class words,",
        "• a large amount of plain text for learning a lexicon, e.g. newspapers from the Internet,",
        "• a large annotated training corpus of a related language,",
        "• optionally, a dictionary (or a native speaker) to provide analyses of the most frequent words,",
        "• a non-expert (not a linguist and not a native speaker) to create the resources listed below,",
        "• limited access to a linguist (to make non-obvious decisions in the design of the resources),",
        "• limited access to a native speaker (to annotate a development corpus, to answer a limited number of language specific questions).",
        "and these resources must be created:",
        "• a list of morphological paradigms,",
        "• a list of closed class words with their analyses,",
        "• optionally, a list of the most frequent forms,",
        "• a small annotated development corpus.",
        "For evaluation, an annotated test corpus must be also created.",
        "As this corpus is not part of the resource-light system per se, it can (and should) be as large as possible.",
        "Since our goal is to create resources cheaply and fast, we intentionally limit (but not completely exclude) the inclusion of any linguist and of anybody knowing the target language.",
        "We also limit the time of training and encoding of the basic target-language linguistic information to a minimum.",
        "In traditional settings, a tagset is usually designed by a linguist, moreover a native speaker.",
        "The constraints of a resource-light system preclude both of these qualifications.",
        "Instead, we have standardized the process as much as possible to make it possible to have the tagset designed by a non-expert.",
        "All languages we work with are morphologically rich.",
        "Naturally, such languages require a large number of tags to capture their morphological properties.",
        "An obvious way to make it manageable is to use a structured system.",
        "In such a system, a tag is a composition of tags each coming from a much smaller and simpler atomic tagset tagging a particular morpho-syntactic property (e.g. gender or tense).",
        "This system has many benefits, including the 1) relative easiness for a human annotator to remember individual positions rather than several thousands of atomic symbols; 2) systematic morphological description; 3) tag decomposability; and 4) systematic evaluation.",
        "Instead of starting from scratch each time a tagset for a new language is created, we have provided an annotated tagset template.",
        "A particular tagset can deviate from this template, but only if there is a linguistic reason.",
        "The tagset template includes the following items:",
        "• order of categories (POS, SubPOS, gender, animacy, number, case, ...) - not all might be present in that language; additional categories might be needed;",
        "• which categories we do not distinguish, even though we could (proper vs. common nouns);",
        "• a fully worked out commented example (as mentioned above).",
        "Such a template not only provides a general guidance, but also saves a lot of time, because many of rather arbitrary decisions involved in any tagset creation are done just once (e.g. symbols denoting basic POS categories, should numerals be included as separate POS, etc.).",
        "As stated, a tagset may deviate from such a template, but only if there is a specific reason for it.",
        "Our morphological analyzer relies on a small set of morphological paradigms and a list of closed class and/or most frequent words.",
        "For each target language, we create a list of morphological paradigms.",
        "We just encode basic facts about the target language morphology from a standard grammar textbook.",
        "On average, the basic morphology of highly inflected languages, such as Slavic languages, are captured in 70-80 paradigms.",
        "The choices on what to cover involve a balance between precision, coverage and effort.",
        "Entering a lexicon entry is very costly, both in terms of time and knowledge needed.",
        "While it is usually easy (for a native speaker) to assign a word to one of the major paradigm groups, it takes considerably more time to select the exact paradigm variant differing only in one or two forms (in fact, this may be even idiolect-dependent).",
        "For example, in Czech, it is easy to see that the word atom 'atom' does not decline according to the neuter paradigm mesto 'town', but it takes more time to decide to which of the hard masculine inanimate paradigms it belongs.",
        "On the other hand, entering possible analyses for individual word forms is usually very straightforward.",
        "Therefore, our system uses a list of manually provided analyses for the most common forms.",
        "Note that the process of providing the list of forms is not completely manual - the correct analyses are selected from those suggested on the basis of the words' endings.",
        "This can be done relatively quickly by a native speaker or by a non-native speaker with the help of a basic grammar book and a dictionary.",
        "Since the main idea of the project is to create resources quickly for an arbitrarily selected fu-sional language, we cannot possibly create annotation and language encoding manuals for each language.",
        "So, we created a manual that explains the annotation and paradigm encoding procedure in general and describes the main attributes and possible values that a language consultant needs to consider when working on a specific language.",

        "The resource creation procedure involves at least two people: a native speaker who can annotate a development corpus, and a non-native speaker who is responsible for the tagset design, morphological paradigms, and a list of closed class words or frequent forms.",
        "Below we describe our procedure in more detail.",
        "We have realized that even though we do not need a native speaker, some understanding of at least basic morphological categories the language uses is helpful.",
        "So, based on our experience, it is better to hire a person who speaks (natively or not) a language with some features in common.",
        "For example, for Polish, somebody knowing Russian is ideal, but even somebody speaking German (it has genders and cases) is much better than a person speaking only English.",
