        "The TDB follows the annotation scheme of the PDTB (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).",
        "The lexicalized approach adopted in the TDB assumes that discourse relations are set up by lexical items called discourse connectives.",
        "Connectives are considered as discourse level predicates which take exactly two arguments.",
        "The arguments are abstract objects like propositions, facts, events, etc.",
        "(Asher, 1993).",
        "They can be linked either by explicitly realized connectives or by implicit ones recognized by an inferential process.",
        "We annotate explicit connectives; implicit connectives are future work.",
        "We use the naming convention of the PDTB.",
        "Conn stands for the connective, Arg1 and Arg2 for the first and the second argument, respectively.",
        "Conn, Arg1 and Arg2 are assumed to be required components of discourse relations.",
        "Supplementary materials which are relevant to but not necessary for the interpretation are also annotated.",
        "Our main data is METU Turkish Corpus(MTC) (Say et al., 2002).",
        "MTC is a written source of Turkish with approximately 2 million words.",
        "The original MTC files include informative tags, such as the author of the text, the paragraph boundaries in the text, etc.",
        "We removed these tags to obtain raw text files and set the character encoding of the files to \"UTF-8\".",
        "These conversions are useful for programming purposes such as visualizing the data in different platforms and the use of third-party libraries.",
        "We developed an annotation environment to mark up the discourse relations, which we call DATT (Discourse Annotation Tool for Turkish).",
        "DATT produces XML files as annotation data which are generated by the implementation of a stand-off annotation methodology.",
        "We present in §2 the data from Turkish discourse, which forced us to use stand-off annotation instead of in-line markup.",
        "The key aspect is potential crossing of the markup links.",
        "However, stand-off annotation is also advantageous for separate licensing.",

        "In Turkish discourse, the meaning of a connective may change according to the inflectional category of the word that precedes it.",
        "For example, the word just before the connective\"için\" can be inflected with \"-dik\" and \"-mak\"(the infinitive) suffixes.",

        "In Turkish, connectives can be inflected.",
