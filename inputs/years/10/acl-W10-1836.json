        "Recent years have witnessed a surge in available automated resources for the Arabic language.These resources can now be exploited by the computational linguistics community with the aim of improving the automatic processing of Arabic.",
        "This paper discusses semantic labeling.",
        "Shallow approaches to semantic processing are making large advances in the direction of efficiently and effectively deriving application relevant explicit semantic information from text (Pradhan et al., 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Moschitti, 2004; Moschitti et al., 2005; Diab et al., 2008).",
        "Indeed, the existence of semantically annotated resources in English such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003; Palmer et al., 2005) corpora have marked a surge in efficient approaches to automatic semantic labeling of the English language.",
        "For example, in the English sentence, 'John enjoys movies', the predicate is 'enjoys' and the first argument, the subject, is 'John', and the second argument, the object, is 'movies'.",
        "'John' would be labeled as the agent/experiencer and 'movies' would be the theme/content.",
        "According to Prop-Bank, 'John' is labeled Arg0 (or enjoyer) and 'movies' is labeled Arg1 (or thing enjoyed).",
        "Crucially, that independent of the labeling formalism adopted, the labels do not vary in different syntactic constructions, which is why proposition annotation is different from syntactic Treebank annotation.",
        "For instance, if the example above was in the passive voice, 'Movies are enjoyed by John', 'movies' is still the Theme/Content (Arg1) and (thing enjoyed), while 'John' remains the Agent/Experiencer (Arg0) and (enjoyer).",
        "Likewise for the example 'John opened the door' vs. 'The door opened', in both of these examples 'the door' is the Theme (Arg1).",
        "In addition to English, there are PropBank efforts in Chinese (Xue et al., 2009), Korean (Palmer et al.",
        "2006) and Hindi (Palmer et al., 2009), as well as FrameNet annotations in Chinese, German, Japanese, Spanish and other languages (Hans 2009).",
        "Being able to automatically apply this level of analysis to Arabic is clearly a desirable goal, and indeed, we began a pilot Arabic PropBank effort several years ago (Palmer et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we present recent work on adapting the original pilot Arabic Proposition Bank (APB) annotation to the recent changes that have been made to the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2008).",
        "These changes have presented both linguistic and engineering challenges as described in the following sections.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss major linguistics changes in the Arabic Treebank annotation, and any impact they might have for the APB effort.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss the engineering ramifications of adding and deleting nodes from parse trees, which necessitates moving all of the APB label pointers to new tree locations.",
        "Finally, in Section 4 we discuss the current APB annotation pipeline, which takes into account all of these changes.",
        "We conclude with a statement of our current goals for the project."

        "The Arabic syntactic Treebank Part 3 v3.1 was revised according to the new Arabic Treebank Annotation Guidelines.",
        "Major changes have affected the NP structure and the classification of verbs with clausal arguments, as well as improvements to the annotation in general.",
        "The Arabic Treebank (ATB) is at the core of the APB annotations.",
        "The current revisions have resulted in a more consistent treebank that is closer in its analyses to traditional Arabic grammar.",
        "The ATB was revised for two levels of linguistic representation, namely morphological information and syntactic structure.",
        "Both of these changes have implications for APB annotations.",
        "The new ATB introduced more consistency in the application of morphological features to POS tags, hence almost all relevant words in the ATB have full morphological features of number, gender, case, mood, and definiteness associated with them.",
        "This more comprehensive application has implications on agreement markers between nouns and their modifiers and predicative verbs and their arguments, allowing for more consistent semantic analysis in the APB.",
        "In particular, the new ATB explicitly marks the gerunds in Arabic known as maSAdir (singular maSdar.)",
        "MaSAdirs, now annotated as VN, are typically predicative nouns that take arguments that should receive semantic roles.",
        "The nouns marked as VN are embedded in a new kind of syntactic S structure headed by a VN and having subject and object arguments similar to verbal arguments.",
        "This syntactic structure, namely S-NOM, was present in previous editions/versions of the ATB but it was headed by a regular noun, hence it was difficult to find.",
        "This explicit VN annotation allows the APB effort to take these new categories into account as predicates.",
        "For instance [^]VN [-^]ARG0 pj*£ j^]ARG1, transliterated as takab~udi-, meaning 'suffered' is an example of predicative nominal together with its semantically annotated arguments ARG0 transliterated as -him, meaning 'they' and ARG1 transliterated as xasA}ira kabiyrap, meaning 'heavy losses'.",
        "Other changes in the ATB include idafa constructions (a means of expressing possession) and the addition of a pseudo-verb POS tag for a particular group of particles traditionally known as \"the sisters of ùJ <in~a 'indeed' \".",
        "These have very little impact on the APB annotation."

        "One of the challenges that we faced during the process of revising the APB was the transfer of the already existing annotation to the newly revised trees -- especially since APB data encoding is tightly coupled with the explicit tree structure.",

        "i.",
        "Changes to the tree structure",

        "The APB modifications are performed within the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al.",

        "The tool is modified to perform a three-step mapping process:",
        "a) Dereference the existing (tree) node-level annotations to the respective token spans; b) Align the original token spans to the best possible token spans in the revised trees.",
        "This was usually straight forward, but sometimes the to-kenization affected the boundaries of a span in which case careful heuristics had to be employed to find the correct mapping.",
        "We incorporated the standard \"diff utility into the API.",
        "A simple space separated token-based diff would not completely align cases where the tokenization had been changed in the new tree.",
        "For these cases we had to back-off to a character based alignment to recover the alignments.",
        "This two-pass strategy works better than using character-based alignment as a default since the diff tool does not have any specific domain-level constraints and gets spurious alignments; c) Create the PropBank (tree) node-pointers for the revised spans.",
        "As expected, this process is not completely automatic.",
        "There are cases where we can deterministically transfer the annotations to the new trees, and other cases (especially ones that involve decision making based on newly added traces) where we cannot.",
        "We automatically transferred all the annotation that could be done deterministically, and flagged all the others for human review.",
        "These cases were grouped into multiple categories for the convenience of the annotators.",
        "Some of the part of speech changes invalidated some existing annotations, and created new predicates to annotate.",
        "In the first case, we simply dropped the existing annotations on the affected nodes, and in the latter we just created new pointers to be annotated.",
        "We could automatically map roughly 50% of the annotations.",

        "Figure 2 illustrates a sample annotation.",
        "Once the data has been double-blind annotated, the adjudication process begins.",
        "An adjudicator, a member of the framing team, provides the Gold Standard annotation by going over the tagged instances to settle any differences in the choices.",
        "Occasionally a verb will be mis-lemmatized (e.g. the instance may actually be Jüh\" sah~al 'to cause to become easy' but it is lemmatized under Jt\"> sahul-u 'to be easy' which looks identical without vocalization.)",
        "At this point the lemmas are corrected and sent back to the annotators to tag before the adjudicators can complete their work.",
        "The framers and annotators meet regularly at least every fortnight.",
        "These meetings are important for the framers since they may need to convey to the annotators any changes or issues with the frames, syntactic matters, or anything else that may require extra training or preparation for the annotators.",
        "It is important to note that while the framers are linguists, the annotators are not.",
        "This means that the annotators must be instructed on a number of things including, but not limited to, how to read trees, and what forms a constituent, as well as how to get familiar with the tools in order to start annotating the data.",
        "Therefore, little touches, such as the addition of Arabic synonyms to the framesets (especially since not all of the annotators have the same level of fluency in English), or confronting specific linguistic phenomena via multiple modalities are a necessary part of the process.",
        "To these meetings, the annotators mostly bring their questions and concerns about the data they are working on.",
        "We rely heavily on the annotator's language skills.",
        "They take note of whether a frame appears to be incorrect, is missing an argument, or is missing a sense.",

        "Since everything is discussed together as a group people frequently benefit from the conversations and issues that are raised.",

        "The APB has decided to thoroughly tackle light verb constructions and multi-word expressions as part of an effort to facilitate mapping between the different languages that are being Prop-Banked.",
        "In the process of setting this up a number of challenges have surfaced which include: how can we cross-linguistically approach these phenomena in a (semi) integrated manner, how to identify one construction from the other, figuring out a language specific reliable diagnostic test, and whether we deal with these constructions as a whole unit or as separate parts; and how?",

        "During the Pilot Propbank project these files were created manually by editing the XML file related to a particular predicate.",
        "This proved to be time consuming and prone to many formatting errors.",
        "The Frame File creation for the revised APB is now performed with the recently developed Cornerstone tool (Choi et al., 2010a), which is a PropBank frameset editor that allows the creation and editing of Propbank framesets without requiring any prior knowledge of XML.",
        "Moreover, the annotation is now performed by Jubilee, a new annotation tool, which has improved the annotation process by displaying several types of relevant syntactic and semantic information at the same time.",
        "Having everything displayed helps the annotator quickly absorb and apply the necessary syntactic and semantic information pertinent to each predicate for consistent and efficient annotation (Choi et al., 20010b).",
        "Both tools are available as Open Source tools on Google code.",
        "We have currently created 1955 verb predicate Frame Files which correspond to 2446 framesets, since one verb predicate Frame File can contain one or more framesets.",
