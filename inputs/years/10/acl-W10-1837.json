        "Annotated corpora are sets of structured text used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that contain supplemental knowledge, such as tagged parts-of-speech, semantic concepts assigned to phrases, or semantic relationships between these concepts.",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that studies how computers can obtain knowledge and create predictive models.",
        "These models require annotated corpora to learn rules and patterns.",
        "However, these annotated corpora must be manually curated for each domain or task, which is labor intensive and tedious (Scannell, 2007), thereby creating a bottleneck for advancing ML and NLP prediction tools.",
        "Furthermore, knowledge captured by a specific annotated corpus is often not transferable to another task, even to the same NLP task in another language.",
        "Domain and language specific corpora are useful for many language technology applications, including named entity recognition (NER), machine translation, spelling correction, and machine-readable dictionaries.",
        "The An Crubadan Project, for example, has succeeded in creating corpora for more than 400 of the world's 6000+ languages by Web crawling.",
        "With a few exceptions, most of the 400+ corpora, however, lack any linguistic annotations due to the limitations of annotation tools (Rayson et al., 2006).",
        "Despite the many documented advantages of annotated data over raw data (Granger and Rayson, 1998; Mair, 2005), there is a dearth of annotated corpora in many domains.",
        "The majority of previous corpus annotation efforts relied on manual annotation by domain experts, automated prediction tagging systems, and hybrid semi-automatic systems that used both approaches.",
        "While yielding high quality and enormously valuable corpora, manually annotating corpora can be prohibitively costly and time consuming.",
        "For example, the GENIA corpus contains 9,372 sentences, curated by five part-time annotators, one senior coordinator, and one junior coordinator over 1.5 years (Kim et al., 2008).",
        "Semiautomatic approaches decrease human effort but often introduce significant error, while still requiring human interaction.",
        "The Web can help facilitate semi-automatic approaches by connecting distributed human users at a previously unfathomable scale and presents an opportunity to expand annotation efforts to countless users using Human Computation, the concept of outsourcing certain computational processes to humans, generally to solve problems that are intractable or difficult for computers.",
        "This concept is demonstrated in our previous work, WebBANC (Green et al., 2009) and",
        "BioDEAL (Breimyer et al., 2009), which allows users to annotate Web documents through a Web browser plugin for the purposes of creating linguistically and biologically tagged annotated corpora and with micro-tasking via Mechanical Turk, which allows for a low cost option for manual labor tasks (Snow et al., 2008; Kittur et al., 2008).",
        "While the Web and Human Computation may be a powerful tandem for generating data and solving difficult problems, in order to succeed, users must be motivated to participate.",
        "Humans have been fascinated with games for centuries and play them for many reasons, including for entertainment, honing skills, and gaining knowledge (FAS Summit, 2006).",
        "Every year, a large amount of hours are spent playing online computer games.",
        "The games range form simple card and word games to more complex 3-D world games.",
        "One such site for word, puzzle, and card games is Pogo.com1.",
        "According to protrackr, Pogo has almost 6 million unique visitors a day.",
        "Alexa.comshows that the average user is on the site for 11 minutes at a time.",
        "When the average time spent on the site is propagated to each user, the combined time is equal to more than 45,000 days of human time.",
        "Arguably if, the games on Pogo were used to harvest useful data, various fields of Computer Science research could be advanced.",
        "There has been a recent trend to leverage human's fascination in game playing to solve difficult problems through Human Computation.",
        "Two such games include ESP and Google's Image Labeler (Ahn and Dabbish, 2004), in which players annotate images in a cooperative environment to correctly match image tags with their partner.",
        "Semantic annotation has also been addressed in the game Phrase Detectives (Chamberlain et al., 2009), which has the goal of creating large scale training data for anaphora resolution.",
        "These types of games are part of a larger, serious games, initiative (Annetta, 2008).",
        "This paper introduces the Web-enabled collaborative game framework, PackPlay, and investigates how collaborative online gaming can affect annotation throughput and annotation accuracy.",
        "There are two main questions for such systems: first, will overall throughput increase compared to traditional methods of annotating, such as the manual construction of the Genia Corpus?",
        "Second, how accurate are the collective annotations?",
        "A successful human computation environment, such as PackPlay, would represent a paradigm shift in the way annotated corpora are created.",
        "However, adoption of such a framework cannot be expected until these questions are answered.",
        "We address both of these questions in multiple games in our PackPlay system through evaluation of the collective players' annotations with precision and recall to judge accuracy of players' annotations and the number of games played to judge throughput.",
        "We show improvements in both areas over traditional annotation methods and show accuracy comparable to expert prediction systems that could be used for semi-supervised annotation."

        "We empirically show casual game players' ability to accurately and throughly annotate corpora by conducting experiments following the process described in Section 2.1 with 8 players using the PackPlay System.",
        "The testers annotate the datasets described in Section 2.2 and results are analyzed using the equations in Section 2.3.",
        "Figure 1 shows the average PackPlay process flow that a player will follow for a multi-player game.",
        "Assuming the player is registered, the player will always start by logging in and selecting the game he or she wants to play.",
        "Once in the game screen, the system will try to pair the player with another player who is waiting.",
        "After a set time limit, the game will automatically pair the user with a PlayerBot.",
        "It is important to note that the player will not know that his or her partner is a PlayerBot.",
        "Once paired, a game can start.",
        "In most games, a question will be sampled from our database.",
        "How this sampling takes place is up to the individual game.",
        "Once sampled, the question will be displayed to one player or all players, depending on whether the game is synchronous or asynchronous (see definitions in Sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.2).",
        "Once the question is displayed, two things can happen.",
        "Precision =",
        "First, the timer can run out; this timer is set by each game individually.",
        "Second, the player may answer the question and move on to the next question.",
        "After either one of those two options, a new question will be sampled.",
        "This cycle continues until the game session is over.",
        "This is usually determined by the game, as each game can set the number of questions in a session, or by a player quiting the game.",
        "To compare named entity results, PackPlay uses sentences and annotations from CoNLL 2003, a \"gold\" standard corpus (Tjong et al., 2003).",
        "We use the CoNLL 2003 corpus since it has been curated by experts and the PackPlay system can compare our players' annotations vs those of 16 submitted predictive models, also refered to as the CoNLL average, in the 2003 conference on natural language learning.",
        "This paper will refer to the training corpus as the CoNLL corpus, and we selected it for our evaluation due to its widespread adoption as a benchmark corpus.",
        "To measure how thoroughly and accurately our players annotate the data, we calculate both recall (Equation 1) and precision (Equation 2), in which a is the set of words annotated in PackPlay and ß is the set of words in the base CoNLL corpus.",
        "Recall =",
        "Each game module in the PackPlay system has its own scoring module, which is intended to improve the players' precision.",

        "While this annotation task could be done by one person, it is a very time consuming activity.",

        "A synchronous game is one in which both players have the same task in the game, in this case, to annotate a sentence.",

        "Since PackPlay is still in the experimental stages, players may not always be available.",
        "For this reason, we have implemented a PlayerBot system.",

        "We try to minimize the errors, which guessing might produce, in a second game, Name That Entity (Section 3.2).",
        "To annotate a sentence, the player simply highlights a word or phrase and clicks on a relevant entity.",

        "From this point on, the player is free to annotate more phrases in the sentence.",

        "Scoring can be done in a variety of ways, each having an impact on players' performance and enjoyment.",
        "For Entity Discovery, we decided to give each user a flat score of 100 points for every answer that matched their partner.",
        "At the end of each game session, the player will see what answers matched with their partner.",
        "For instance, if both players tagged \"Jimi Hendrix\" as a Person, they will both receive 100 points.",
        "We do not show the players their matched scores after each sentence, since this might bias the user to tag more or less depending on what their partner does.",
        "Figure 3 shows a typical scoring screen at the end of a game; in Figure 3, the players matched 4 phrases, totaling 400 points.",
        "It is important to note that at this stage we do not distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations, just whether the two players agree.",
        "To examine Entity Discovery as a collaborative game toward the creation of an annotated corpus, we conducted a user experiment to collect sample data on a known data set.",
        "Over a short time, 8 players were asked to play both Entity Discovery and Name That Entity.",
        "In PackPlay, throughput can be estimated, since each game has a defined time limit, defined as the average number of entities annotated per question times the number of users times the average number of questions seen by a user.",
        "Unlike other systems such as Mechanical Turk (Snow et al., 2008; Kittur et al.,",
        "BANC (Green et al., 2009), in PackPlay we define the speed at which a user annotates.",
        "Each game in Entity Discovery consists of 10 sentences from the CoNLL corpus.",
        "These sentences are not guaranteed to have a named entity within them.",
        "The users in the study were not informed of the entity content as to not bias the experiment and falsely raise our precision scores.",
        "With only 8 players, we obtained 291 annotations, which averaged to about 40 annotations per user.",
        "This study was not done over a long period oftime, so each user only played, on average, 3.6 games.",
        "Two players were asked to intentionally annotate poorly.",
        "The goal of using poor annotators was to simulate real world players, who may just click answers to ruin the game or who are clueless to what a named entity is.",
        "This information can be used in later research to help automatically detect \"bad\" annotators using anomaly detection techniques.",
        "PackPlay also stores information not used in this study, such as time stamps for each question answered.",
        "This information will be incorporated into future experiment analysis to see if we can further improve our annotated corpora based on the order and time spent forming an annotation.",
        "For instance, the first annotation in a sentence may have a higher probability than the last annotation.",
        "It is possible that if a user answers too fast, the answer is likely an error.",
        "Every player completes part of a 60 sentence pretest in which we know the answers.",
        "For each game, the questions are sampled without replacement but this does not carry over after a game.",
        "For instance, if a player finishes game 1, he or she will never see the same question twice.",
        "For game two, no question within the game will be repeated, however, the player might see a question he or she answered in game 1.",
        "Because of this, each user will not see all 60 questions, but we will have a good sample to judge whether a user is accurate or not.",
        "The ability to repeat a question in different games allows us, in future research, to test players using intra-annotator agreement statistics.",
        "This tests how well a player agrees with himself or herself.",
        "From this set of 60 questions we have calculated each player's recall and precision scores.",
        "As Table 2 shows, the recall scores for Entity Discovery in this experiment were 0.94, 0.95, and 0.85 for Person, Location, and Organization, respectively.",
        "The overall average was 0.9, which beats out the CoNLL average, an average of 16 expert systems, for recall.",
        "Entity Discovery's numbers are similar to the pattern seen in the CoNLL predictive systems for Person, Location and Organization, in which Organization was the lowest and Person was the highest.",
        "The precision numbers were quite lower, with an average of 0.62.",
        "When examining the data, most of the precision errors occurred because of word phrase boundary issues with the annotation and also players often are unsure whether to include titles such as President, Mr., or Dr.",
        "There were also quite a few errors where players annotated concepts as People such as \"The Judge\" or \"The scorekeeper.\"",
        "While this is incorrect for named entity recognition, it might be of interest to a co-reference resolution corpus.",
        "The precision numbers are likely low because of our untrained players and because some of the players were told to intentionally annotate entities incorrectly.",
        "To improve on these numbers, we applied a coverage requirement and majority voting.",
        "The coverage requirement requires that more than one player has annotated a given phrase for the annotation to be included in the corpus.",
        "Majority voting indicates that the phrase is only included if 50% or more of the playerss who annotated a phrase, agreed on the specific entity assigned to the phrase.",

        "This ratio has not been determined and will need to be tested.",
        "A more successful way to detect errors in our annotations may be to create a separate game to verify given answers.",

        "Unlike Entity Discovery, this allows us to focus the annotation effort on particular words or phrases.",
        "Once again, this is modeled as a two-player game but the players are not playing simultaneously.",
        "The goal for the player is to select the same entity type for the highlighted word that their partner selects.",

        "In the PackPlay framework this allows us to detect playerss who are randomly guessing and are therefore not consistent with themselves.",

        "Annotated corpora generation presents a major obstacle to advancing modern Natural Language Processing technologies.",
        "In this paper we introduced the PackPlay framework, which aims to leverage a distributed web user community in a collaborative game to build semantically-rich annotated corpora from players annotations.",
        "PackPlay is shown to have high precision and recall numbers when compared to expert systems in the area of named entity recognition.",
        "These annotated corpora were generated from two collaborative games in PackPlay, Entity Discovery and Name That Entity.",
        "The two games combined let us exploit the benefits of both synchronous and asynchronous gameplay as mechanisms to verify the quality of our annotated corpora.",
        "Future work should combine the players output with a player confidence score based on conflict resolution algorithms, using both inter-and intra-annotator metrics."
