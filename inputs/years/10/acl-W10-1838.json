        "Among the many proposals to promote alternatives to costly to create gold standards, just recently the idea of a fully automatically, and thus cheaply, to set up silver standard has been launched.",
        "However, the current construction policy for such a silver standard requires crucial parameters (such as similarity thresholds and agreement cut-offs) to be set a priori, based on extensive testing though, at corpus compile time.",
        "Accordingly, such a corpus is static, once it is released.",
        "We here propose an alternative policy where silver standards can be dynamically optimized and customized on demand (given a specific goal function) using a gold standard as an oracle."

        "Training natural language systems which rely on (semi-)supervised machine learning algorithms, or measuring the systems' performance requires some standardized ground truth from which one can learn or against which one evaluate, respectively.",
        "Usually, a manually crafted gold standard is provided that is generated by human language or domain experts after lots of iterative, guideline-based training rounds.",
        "This procedure is expensive, slow and yields only small, yet highly trustable, amounts of meta data - because human experts are in the loop.",
        "In the Calbc project, an alternative approach is currently under investigation (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2010a).",
        "The basic idea is to generate the much needed ground truth automatically.",
        "This is achieved by letting a flock of named entity taggers run on a corpus, without imposing any restriction on the type(s) being annotated.",
        "The (most likely) heterogeneous results are automatically homogenized subsequently, thus yielding a consensus-based, machine-generated ground truth.",
        "Considering the possible benefits (e.g., the positive experience from boosting-style machine learners (Freund, 1990)), but also being aware of the possible drawbacks (varying quality ofthe different systems, skewed coverage of entity types, different types of guidelines on which they were trained, etc.",
        "), the Calbc consortium refers to the outcome of this process as a silver standard (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2010a).",
        "This procedure is inexpensive, fast, yields huge amounts of meta data - because computers are in the loop but after all its applicability and validity has yet to be determined experimentally.",
        "The first silver standard corpus (SSC) that came out of the Calbc project was generated by the four main partners' named entity taggers.",
        "The various contributions covered, among others, annotations for genes and proteins, chemicals, diseases, etc (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2010b).",
        "After the submission of their runs, the SSC was generated by, first, harmonizing stretches of text in terms of entity mention identification and, second, by mapping these normalized mentions to agreed-upon type systems (such as the Mesh Semantic Groups as described by Bodenreider and McCray (2003) for entity type normalization).",
        "Basically, the harmonization steps included rules when entity mentions were considered to match or overlap (using a cosine-based similarity criterion) and entity types referred to the same class.",
        "For consensus generation, finally, simple rules for majority votes were established.",
        "The Calbc consortium is fully aware of the fact that the value of an SSC can only be assessed by comparing, e.g., systems trained on such a silver standard with systems trained on a gold standard (preferably, though not necessarily, one that is a subset of the document set which makes up the SSC).",
        "In the absence of such a gold standard, the Calbc consortium has spent enormous efforts to find out the most reasonable parameter settings for, e.g., the cosine threshold (setting similar mentions apart from dissimilar ones) or the consensus constraint (where a certain number of entity types equally assigned by different taggers makes one type the consensual silver one and discards all alternative annotations).",
        "Once these criteria are made effective, the SSC is completely fixed.",
        "As an alternative, we are looking for a more flexible solution.",
        "Our investigation was fuelled by the following observations:",
        "• The idiosyncrasies of guidelines (on which (some) taggers were trained) do not necessarily lead to semantically totally different entities although they differ literally to some degree.",
        "Some guidelines prefer, e.g., \"human IL-7 protein\", others favor \"human IL-7\", and some lean towards \"IL-7\".",
        "As the cosine measure tends to penalize a pair such as \"human IL-7 protein\" and \"IL-7\" , we intended to avoid such a prescriptive mode and just look at the type assignment for single tokens as (parts of) entity mentions.",
        "thus avoiding inconclusive mention boundary discussions.",
        "• While we were counting, for all tokens of the document set, the votes a single token received from different taggers in terms of annotating this token with respect to some type, we generated confidence data for meta data assignments.",
        "Incorporating the distribution of confidence values into the configuration process, this allows us to get rid of a priori fixed majority criteria (e.g., two or three out of five systems must agree on this token) which are hard to justify in an absolute way.",
        "Summarizing, we believe that the nature of diverging tasks to be solved, the levels of entity type specificity to be reached, the sort of guidelines being preferred, etc.",
        "should allow prospective users of a silver standard to customize one on their own and not stick to one that is already prefabricated without concrete application in mind.",
        "As such an enterprise would be quite arbitrary without a reference standard, we even go one step further.",
        "We determine the suitability of, say, different voting scores and varying lexical extensions of mentions by comparison to a gold standard so that the 'optimal' configuration of a silver standard, given a set of goal-derived requirements, can be automatically learned.",
        "In real-world applications, such gold standard annotations would be delivered only for a fraction of the documents contained in the entire corpus being tagged by a flock of taggers.",
        "The gold standard is used to optimize parameters which are subsequently applied to the aggregation of automatically annotated data.",
        "Note that the gold standard is used for optimization only, not for training.",
        "We call such a flexible, dynamically adjustable silver standard a configurable Silver Standard Corpus (conSSC).",
        "In a second step, we split the various conSSCs, retrained our NER tagger on these data sets and, by comparison with the gold standard, were able to identify the optimal conSSC for this task (which is not the one (SSC I) made available by the Calbc consortium for the first challenge round)."

        "In this section, we describe the constituent parameters of a wide spectrum of SSCs.",
        "Mostly, these parameters were taken over from the design of the SSC as developed by the Calbc project members.",
        "Differing from that fixed SSC, we investigate the impact of different parameter settings on the construction of a collection of SSCs, and, first, evaluate their direct usefulness on a gold standard for protein-gene annotations.",
        "Second, we also assess their indirect usefulness by training NER classifiers on these SSCs and evaluate the NERs' performance on the gold standard.",
        "Thus, our approach is entirely data-driven without the need for human intervention in terms of choosing suitable parameter settings.",
        "Technically, we first aggregate the votes from the flock of taggers (in our experiments, we used the four taggers from the Calbc project members plus a second tagger of one of the members) for each text token (for confidence-based decisions) or at the entity level (for cosine-based decisions), then we determine the confidence values of these",

        "aggregated votes, and, finally, we compute the similarity of the various SSCs with the gold standard data in terms of F-scores (both exact and open boundaries) and accuracy on the token level.",
        "The metrical interpretation of consensus will be based on thresholded votes for semantic groups at the token level (cf.",
        "Section 2.1.1) and a cosine-based measure to determine contiguous stretches of entity mentions in the text (cf.",
        "Section 2.1.2).",
        "For each text token, we determine the entity type assignment as generated by each NER tagger which is part of the flock of Calbc taggers.",
        "We count and aggregate these votes such that each entity type has an associated type count value.",
        "We then compute the ratio of systems agreeing on the same single type assignment and call this the confidence attributed to a particular type for some token.",
        "The confidence value will subsequently be interpreted against the confidence threshold [0,1] that defines a measure of certainty a type assignment should have in order to be accepted as consensual.",
        "As the above policy of token-wise annotation decouples contiguous entity mentions spanning over more than one token, we also want to restitute this phrasal structure.",
        "This is achieved by constructing contiguous sequences of tokens that characterize a phrasal entity mention at the text level to which the same type label has been assigned.",
        "Since different taggers tend to identify different spans of text for the same entity type (as shown in the example from Section 1) we have to account for similar phrasal forms of named entity mentions.",
        "This is achieved by constructing vectors which represent entity mentions and by computing the cosine between the different entity mention vectors.",
        "Let E1 = T1T2T3 be an entity mention comprised of three tokens Ti to T3.",
        "Let E2 = T2T3 be an entity mention overlapping with Ei in the tokens T2 and T3.",
        "To decide whether Ei and E2 are considered similar, we first construct two vectors representing the entity mentions:",
        "with /i = IDF (Ti) being the inverse document frequency of the token T .",
        "We compute the inverse document frequency of tokens based on the corpus which is subject to analysis.",
        "Analogously, we construct the vector for E2 filling in a zero for the IDF of T1 since it is not covered by E2.",
        "The entity mentions Ei and E2 are considered equal or similar, if the cosine of the two vectors is greater or equal a given threshold, cos(v(E1 ),v(E2)) > threshold Wethen compute the numberofsystems considering anen-tity annotation as similar in the manner described above.",
        "The annotation is accepted and thus entered into the SSC, if a particular number of systems agree on one annotation.",
        "This approach was previously developed by the CALBC project partners (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2010a).",
        "The number ofagreeing systems and the threshold are the free parameters ofthis method and thus subject to optimization.",
        "In the experiments described in the next section, we will consider alternative parametrizations for Silver Standard Corpora, i.e., the required confidence threshold or cosine threshold and the number of agreeing systems.",
        "We will then discuss two variants for optimizing this collection of SSCs.",
        "The first one directly uses the gold standard for optimization.",
        "The task will be to find that particular parameter setting for an SSC which best fits the data contained in the gold standard.",
        "Once these parameters are determined they can be applied to the complete Calbc document set (composed of 100,000 documents) to produce the final, quasi-optimal SSC.",

        "The experiments reported in this paper strengthen the empirical basis of the novel idea of a silver standard corpus (SSC).",
        "While the originators of the SSC have come up with a fixed SSC, our experiments show that different parametrizations of SSCs allow to dynamically configure or select an optimal one given a gold standard for comparison during this optimization.",
        "Our experimental data reveals that the boosting hypothesis (the combination of several classifiers outperforms weaker single ones in terms ofperfor-mance) is confirmed for complete mergers as well as selected twin pairs of taggers.",
        "We also have evidence that boosting within the SSC paradigm tends to increase precision whereas it seems to decrease recall.",
        "This general observation becomes stronger and stronger when the size ofthe committees (i.e., the number of submitting classifiers) increases.",
        "It is also particularly interesting that both the intrinsic evaluation (groups of classifiers vs. gold standard), as well as the extrinsic evaluation of SSCs (groups of classifiers trained and tested on mutually exclusive partitions of the gold standard) reveal parallel patterns in terms of performance this indicates a surprising level of stability of the entire SSC approach.",
        "In our view, the strongest finding from our experiments is the possibility to calibrate an SSC according to requirements derived from the goal of annotation campaigns.",
        "In particular, one can adapt parameters to a specific use case, e.g., building a corpus with high precision when compared to the gold standard.",
        "Through the evaluation of the parameter space, one can assess the costs of reaching a specific goal.",
        "For instance, a precision of 99% can be reached, yet at the cost of the F-score plunging to 30%; only slightly lowering the precision to 97% boosts the F-score by 22 points (see last two rows in Table 3).",
