        "In the area of large French speech corpora, there is a demonstrated need for a common prosodic notation system allowing for easy data exchange, comparison, and automatic annotation.",
        "The major questions are: (1) how to develop a single simple scheme of prosodic transcription which could form the basis of guidelines for non-expert manual annotation (NEMA), used for linguistic teaching and research; (2) based on this NEMA, how to establish reference prosodic corpora (RPC) for different discourse genres (Cresti and Mo-neglia, 2005); (3) how to use the RPC to develop corpus-based learning methods for automatic prosodic labelling in spontaneous speech (Buhman et al., 2002; Tamburini and Caini 2005, Avanzi, et al.",

        "In this paper the case of the prosodic annotation of spontaneous French speech is discussed.",
        "Ever since the ToBI system was introduced in the international speech community (Silverman et al., 1992), it has been considered by some - irrespective of the language to be annotated - as a standard for prosodic annotation, while others contend that ToBI cannot be regarded as a universal annotation tool, i.e. it is not appropriate to capture the prosodic properties of certain languages.",
        "This is especially true when dealing with spontaneous speech, for which new methods of annotation must be found.",
        "In other words, a better pro-",
        "For French, see the work of Post (2000) and Jun & Fougeron (2002).",
        "sodic labelling is essential to improve linguistic analyses of prosody (Martin 2003, as well as research in speech technology (Wightman 2002).",
        "Linguistics and speech technology have dealt with prosodic transcription from various points of view, which makes a precise definition of the task difficult.",
        "An initial distinction can be drawn between (i) phonological approaches (Silverman et al., 1992; Hirst and Di Cristo, 1998; Delais-Roussarie, 2005; etc.",
        "), and (ii) acoustic-phonetic prosodic analysis (Beaugendre et al., 1992; Mertens, 2004).",
        "Nowadays, these two approaches still remain problematic.",
        "The coding schemes of the former reflect not only a specific, and rather narrow, phonological point of view, but also the phonetic poverty of the transcription (most of the time, only information about the fundamental frequency is delivered, and no information regarding intensity, vocal quality, variations in syllabic length and speech disfluen-cies is provided).",
        "In the second approach, very fine-grained descriptions and modelling have been conducted (House, 1990; Mertens, 2004), but they are too rich to be easily exportable.",
        "The question therefore remains: what is the best compromise between an overly detailed phonetic description and a phonological annotation which is too narrow from a theoretical point of view?",
        "In an attempt to answer this question, the following prerequisites underpin our approach to prosodic annotation.",
        "First, it should be based on a theory-independent phonologieal labelling.",
        "To achieve this, we have designed an inductive prosodic processing which does not impose a phonological (generative) mould, but in which various existing notation systems (such as ToBI, Intsint, IVTS, see references below) could be integrated.",
        "Second, the annotation proposed by the expert should be easily reproducible by non-expert annotators and finally carried out by computers (in order to reduce the cost of human processing and to avoid the subjectivity and variability of manual treatment).",
        "This paper deals with an initial set of fundamental questions: (i) What does it mean to develop a theory-independent method of annotation?",
        "What does it imply in terms of methodological choices?",
        "(ii) Can we consider a type of annotation which is based on a categorical processing of prosody as well as continuous judgment, or is the latter too difficult to implement and process in a shared prosodic annotation?",
        "(iii) What kind of preliminary analysis is required in order to write a well-documented guideline shar-able in the community for French prosody annotation?",
        "These three questions led us to conduct two pilot experiments in 2009, which are presented here.",
        "Each section is structured as follows: description of the corpus, the task, and the results, and a brief discussion of the experiment in question to explain the final choices made for the reference prosodic labelling summarized in the conclusion."

        "The goal of this section is to present (§2.1) the task and its different steps, (§2.2) the results of the coding regarding inter-annotator agreement and (§2.3) the major problems revealed by the results concerning the coding method.",
        "The prosodic annotation is based first on the marking of two boundary levels, second on the identification of perceptual prominences, and finally on the labelling of disfluencies and hesitations.",
        "Given our bias neutrality theory, no constraint was set a priori regarding prosodic domain and constituents separated by a prosodic break (rhythmic, syntactic or pragmatic units; this point concerns the functional interpretation to be conducted later).",
        "Concerning prominences, we considered that prominence was syllabic and had not to be merged with the notion of stress.",
        "This means that a prominent syllable is considered as a perceptual figure emerging from its background.",
        "Finally, we defined disfluency as an element which breaks the linear flow of speech, whatever the element is: it can be a syllable, a word, a morpheme unit, part of a sentence, etc.",
        "The starting point of the procedure is a semiautomatic alignment processing (Goldman, 2008) conducted under Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 2010 which provides a 3-layer segmentation structure: segmentation within a phones string, syllabic string, and words string.",
        "They are all displayed on 3 temporally aligned tiers.",
        "Three empty tiers aligned on the syllabic tier have to be annotated (FRONT for marking the prosodic boundaries, PROM for annotating prominences and DYSF for coding disfluencies).",

        "First, each annotator has to identify breath groups (henceforth BG, marker '2' at the end of the BG).",

        "Overall agreement scores indicate a significantly lower agreement for the second corpus.",
        "This is probably related to its higher complexity (low audio quality, high level of interaction, many disfluencies, regional accent) which made the task harder to process.",
        "The comparison of presence (corpus 1 = 0.71; corpus 2 = 0.56) versus strength (corpus 1 = 0.67; corpus 2 = 0.53) of the end of a prosodic package agreements suggests that categorical rating is more reliable than ordinal rating.",
        "In other words, annotators appear to perform better at rating the categorical status of a syllable rather than its precise degree.",
        "On the location problem, it is first interesting to note that the occurrence of such a location shift is significant in the prosodic labelling.",
        "In the present study, the location shift represents respectively 12% and 18% of syllables that were rated as PPP by at least one of the annotators (balance effect, see figure 5).",

        "Given the results of pilot experiments 1 and 2, we conclude that neither the static concept of prosodic boundary, nor its dynamic substitute prosodic packaging leads to a high inter-annotator consensus.",
        "In other words, these two concepts are probably too dependent on different levels of processing (syntactic, phonological, and rhythmic) and each annotator, depending on his own definition of the notion (formal or functional) will focus on one aspect or another.",
        "Consequently, even if precise instructions are given for annotation, the labelled data still remain heterogeneous.",
        "Therefore, these two concepts should not be used as the basis for the development of a shared prosodic annotation method aiming to establish a reference prosodic corpus and annotation software, which are essential tools in handling large volumes of speech data.",
        "In contrast, we hypothesize that prominence annotation based on perceptual criteria represents the cornerstone of speech prosodic segmentation, as prosodic structure will be generated from prominence labelling.",
        "Although the results of the first pilot experiment are rather poor 0.68), recent experiments have shown that the scores rise (0.86) after training sessions (Avanzi et al. 2010b).",
        "We have therefore decided to focus our annotation guideline on the labelling of prominences (two levels of prominence: strong or weak) and disfluencies (hesitations, false starts, speaker overlaps, post-tonic schwas, etc.).",
        "The method does not depend on some abstract property of words or groups of words, as in the case of lexical stress (Martin, 2006; Poiré, 2006; Post et al.",
        "2006), but is based on a neutral phonetic definition of prominence, associated with perceptual salience in the context of the speech background.",
        "This approach has the advantage of being consensual, whatever the theoretical framework adopted.",
        "Based on these criteria, a one day training session has been organized for 5 novice annotators (students in linguistics) in order to annotate 3.30 hours of different speech genres (private, public, professional), over 2 months (from February to April 2010).",
        "For each genre a monologal and an interactional sample of around 5 minutes (42 speech files altogether) have to be labelled.",
        "Prominences and disfluencies are coded on two independent tiers.",
