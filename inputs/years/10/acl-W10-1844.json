        "The Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) project aims to annotate the 500,000-word-subcorpus of the two-million-word METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al., 2002).",
        "The subcorpus includes a wide range of texts, e.g. fiction, interviews, memoirs, news articles, etc.",
        "reflecting the distribution of the genres in the MTC (Zeyrek et al., 2009).",
        "The main objective of the project is to annotate discourse connectives with their two arguments, modifiers and supplementary text spans.",
        "Following the Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB), we take discourse connectives as discourse-level predicates taking two (and only two) arguments, called Arg1 and Arg2, which may span one or more clauses and sentences that are adjacent or nonadjacent to the connective (Prasad et al., 2007, Webber, 2004).",
        "Discourse relations can certainly be expressed without connectives but we have chosen to annotate discourse relations encoded by connectives since they are more specific about their semantics.",
        "Discourse connectives are identifiable from three syntactic classes, namely, coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions, and discourse adverbials.",
        "As in the PDTB, we take elements belonging to these syntactic classes as discourse connectives when they semantically relate syntactic entitities such as clauses, sentences, sequences of sentences, and nominalizations having an abstract object interpretation i.e., eventualities, possibilities, situations, facts, and propositions (as in Asher, 1993, cf. Webber, et al., 2005).",
        "Major departures from the PDTB are, attribution is not annotated, only overt connectives are being annotated, and the nominal arguments of connectives are being annotated where they denote an abstract object.",
        "Annotation of implicit connectives is further work.",
        "Before the annotation process started, the annotators studied the guidelines, which defined some general principles and illustrated difficult cases.",
        "The guidelines were written in a way to allow the annotators enough freedom to reflect their intuitions on the annotations.",
        "The annotators were also told to observe the minimality principle (MP) of the PDTB guidelines, which expects them to mark as argument parts of a clause or sentence that are minimally sufficient and necessary for the discourse relation encoded by the connective.",
        "The annotation cycle includes three steps.",
        "First, the annotators go through the whole subcorpus to annotate a given connective at a time.",
        "Any disagreements are discussed and resolved by the project team.",
        "In the second step, the definitions in the annotation guidelines are revised with the new issues that emerged in annotating the connective.",
        "Finally, the agreed annotations are checked to ensure they obeyed the annotation guidelines fully.",
        "The annotations were created by a tool designed by Aktas.",
        "(2008).",
        "The connectives are being annotated for the categories given in the next section by three annotators, who have been in the project since the annotation effort started.",
        "The three-step annotation process and the number of annotators we use slow down the task considerably but given the complexity of discourse annotation and the need for annotation efforts in Turkish, we were compelled to target maximum reliability achieved by three annotators.",
        "The inter-coder reliability has recently stabilized and to speed the annotation effort, two annotators have started to carry out their task as a pair, while the other annotator works independently.",
        "This annotation style involves two annotators working side-by-side at one computer, continuously collaborating on one connective type at a time to code all its tokens in the subcorpus.",
        "One of the annotators carries out the task on the annotation tool, while the other observes her continuously for any defects and problems and suggests alternative solutions.",
        "This style of annotation, created by our group independently of pair programming, corresponds to the practice explained in Williams, et al. quite a beneficial and reliable method that also speeds up the process (Demirsahin, et al. ms).",
        "We give the preliminary results of this procedure in section 2.1.4.",
        "1.3 An outline of Turkish connectives and the annotation scheme",
        "We annotate discourse connectives belonging to the syntactic classes listed below, leaving out converbs that may function as discourse connectives.",
        "• Coordinating conjunctions (ve 'and', ya da 'or', ama 'but')",
        "• Complex subordinators (için 'for', ragmen 'although, despite'), converbs/simplex subordinators (-Ince 'when,' ken 'while, now that')",
        "• Anophoric connectives (bundan baçka 'in addition to/separate from these', bunun sonucunda 'as a result of this,' bunun için 'due to/for this reason', buna ragmen 'despite this') and discourse adverbials (oysa 'however', öte yandan 'on the other hand', then 'sonradan')",
        "In Turkish, coordinators are typically s(entence)-medial, they may also be found s-initially, or s-finally.",
        "Coordinators show an affinity with the second clause, as evidenced by punctuation and their ability to move to the end of the second clause.",
        "Subordinators take as their second argument a nonfinite clause that contains a genitive marked subject that agrees with the subordinate verb in terms of person and number.",
        "The subordinate clause may also be assigned case by the postposition that functions as the connective.",
        "The subordinator and its host clause are always adjacent and the subordinate clause may appear s-initially or s-finally.",
        "Anaphoric connectives are characterized by an anaphoric element in the phrase and hence they have the ability to access the inference in the prior discourse (Webber, et al. 2003).",
        "Furthermore, they may take as their first argument text spans that are nonadjacent to the sentence containing the connective (Zeyrek and Webber, 2008).",
        "As example (1) illustrates, discourse adverbials can be used with connectives from other syntactic classes, e.g. a coordinating conjunction, fakat 'but' may be used with sonradan 'then', and in accessing its first argument, the discourse adverbial may cross one or more clauses.",
        "In the examples, Arg1 is italicized, Arg2 set in bold, and the connective head is underlined.",
        "Except for ve 'and', the statistics reported in this paper reflect the agreement among 3 independent annotators.",
        "a. Bunlari açikladigimiz vakit yöneticiler evvela §a§irdilar",

        "But then they gained their composure.",
        "Largely following the annotation style of the PDTB, we determined the categories that form the annotation of a relation as follows:",
        "Conn: This is the connective head of an explicit connective.",
        "Arg2: This tag refers to the argument that forms a syntactic unit with the connective.",
        "Arg1: This tag is for the other argument that the connective relates semantically to Arg2.",
        "Sup1/Sup2: This attribute specifies either the material that makes the semantic contribution of the argument more specific (as in the PDTB), or the clause/sentence where an anaphoric element expressed in the argument is resolved.",
        "The Sup tag is not specifically used for anaphor resolution in the PDTB.",
        "Mod: This tag specifies the following features: (a) the adverbs that are used along with connective heads, e.g. tam aksine 'just to the contrary', (b) the focus particle dE used together with the connective head (e.g., ve de 'and-focus particle 'and'), (c) adverbs showing the determinacy of the relation, e.g. belki 'perhaps', sadece 'only' etc., (d) polarity of postpositional phrases (e.g. için degil 'not for').",
        "In the PDTB, the Mod category is utilized only for adverbs used together with connective heads.",
        "The other categories are used to capture aspects of attribution and verbs of attribution.",
        "Shared: This attribute identifies the subjects, objects, or any temporal adverbs shared by the arguments of the discourse relation.",
        "This category was required for Turkish, which is a pro-drop and free word-order language.",
        "In Turkish, subjects, objects or adverbs can appear s-initially, s-medially or s-finally.",
        "Subjects and objects are dropped if they are salient in the discourse.",
        "This category allows us to capture the variable position of subjects, objects and adverbs shared by the arguments of a discourse relation.",
        "The PDTB does not have this feature.",
        "In what follows, we will report on the intercoder reliability statistics on Arg1 and Arg2 of a set of connectives for which we obtained low inter-coder reliability results and discuss the most common inconsistencies.",
        "The remaining categories mentioned above are under use but inter-coder reliability statistics have not been calculated for them.",
        "2 A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the inconsistent annotations in the TDB",
        "So far, 60 types of discourse connectives amounting to 6873 relations have been annotated in the TDB project.",
        "We computed the reliability of the coders' agreement for Arg1 and Arg2 of these connectives by means of the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996).",
        "A value of K agreement coefficient (henceforth K values) between 0.80 and 1.00 shows a good agreement, and a value between 0.60 and 0.80 indicates some agreement (Poesio, 2000).",
        "The K values we obtained for Arg1 and Arg2 of most connectives annotated so far range between 0.80 and 1.00 but for the connectives that are in focus in this paper, the K values for Arg1 are less than 0.80 (see Appendix B).",
        "It is these connectives that we now turn to.",
        "These connectives are listed below again, along with the K values obtained for their Arg1 and Arg2.",
        "Before calculating the K values, all annotated text spans were reprocessed in order to express the annotations in (pseudo) categories.",
        "During re-processing, for each annotator the annotated text span boundary characters (i.e., the beginning and end characters) were coded as 1 and the remaining text was coded as 0, so that an agreement table could be constructed (Artstein, and Poesio, 2008; Di Eugenio and Glass, 2004).",

        "An examination of the 8 connectives for which K values were below 0.80 for Arg1 or Arg2 showed that there were 6 main sources for the inconsistencies.",

        "A frequent reason for inconsistent annotations was lack of agreement in determining the exact boundaries of argument spans, which is ultimately related to how the MP is interpreted.",
        "For example, in (3), the connective fakat 'but' may be taken as linking clauses (3a) and (3b).",
        "Yet, the scope of the predicative morpheme (i.e. -tir in (3c)) that determines finiteness is shared by the verbs of (3b) and (3c), i.e. this morpheme takes into its scope two consecutive clauses.",
        "While two annotators coded only clause (3b) as Arg2, the third annotator tended to interpret Arg2 as the clauses within the scope of the shared predicative morpheme (-tir), coding (3b) and (3c) as Arg2.",
        "It appears that the disagreement in example (3) stems from different interpretations of the MP coupled with a structural property of Turkish.",
        "a. Onlara sunulan kurbanlar, baslangiçta insanlardi At the beginning, it was humans that were sacrified for them.",
        "b. Fakat bu âdet sonralari hafifletilerek, insan yerine hayvanlar kurban edilmege baslanmis, But later on, loosening this tradition, (they) started to sacrifice animals instead of humans,",

        "finally, it was believed that it would be sufficient to throw a stone or paper animal figures to the water, as well as other objects that represent these animals.",
        "The text given in (4) further illustrates a case where the annotators disagreed on the final boundary of Arg2.",
        "One annotator selected as Arg2 the span \"this is .. noted\" (4b), while the other annotators selected the span \"this is.... a lost place\" ((4b)-(4c)); i.e., they included as Arg2 not only the clause adjacent to the connective, but they also selected the clause that followed where the cataphor is resolved.",
        "Faced with such inconsistencies, we decided to annotate the material that is needed for pronoun resolution as supplementary text.",

        "The inconsistencies that derive from different interpretations of the minimality requirement is particularly interesting from a theoretical perspective.",
        "It appears that this principle may be interpreted as syntactic minimality as illustrated in example (3), and as a factor that goes against basic insights of discourse interpretation such as anaphor/cataphor resolution as in example (4).",
        "In the former case, the MP pulls the annotators in one direction, and the need to reflect their understanding of the discourse in the annotations pulls them in the opposite direction, especially when there is morphological/syntactic evidence for them to choose more than one clause.",
        "In the latter case, the annotators seem to feel they would lose the anaphoric/coreference chains in the discourse if they left out the text span where the anaphor was resolved.",
        "After using the Sup label for anaphor resolution/coreference chains, disagreements of the latter sort diminished considerably but this was a methodological approach with a bias towards the MP rather than the desired solution of the role of anaphoric/coreference chains in argument spans.",
        "We aim to tackle this issue in further research.",
        "A parenthetical or evaluative clause in the argument span also led to inconsistencies in determining argument boundaries.",

        "Disagreements that arise from parenthetical clauses have diminished after we added a new principle to the guidelines, asking annotators to select the parenthetical together with the argument if it contributed to the meaning of the argument.",

        "Alternatively, the contrast can be interpreted between (1a) and (1b) on the one hand, and between (1a) and (1c) on the other.",

        "annotators, and a pair and an independent annotator 3 Summary",
        "In this paper we presented common sources of disagreement we observed in annotating the arguments of discourse connectives in the TDB, a project of discourse-level annotation on written Turkish.",
        "We defined our annotation scheme and annotation cycle.",
        "We achieved high agreement on argument annotations of discontinuous connectives but agreement on some other connectives was low, particularly for Arg1.",
        "Since these connectives belong to different syntactic classes, the inconsistencies cannot be easily explained by the properties of the syntactic class of connectives.",
        "We discussed various potential factors affecting inter-coder agreement, including the minimality principle coupled with language specific properties, the structure of discourse (as in the case of our example in tersine), cognitive salience of discourse relations, and ambiguity.",
        "We discussed inconsistencies resulting form the difficulty of distinguishing the non-abstract object interpretation of a nominalized clause from its abstract object interpretation.",
        "We argued that once inter-coder reliability stabilizes, it is beneficial to shift to the procedure where a pair of annotators works together to annotate a specific connective while the third works independently."
