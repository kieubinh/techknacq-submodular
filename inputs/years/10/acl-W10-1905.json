        "Bio-molecular events are useful for modeling and understanding biological systems, and their automatic extraction from text is one of the key tasks in Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP).",
        "In the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task on event extraction, participants constructed event extraction systems using a variety of different parsers, and the results indicated that the use of a parser was correlated with high ranking in the task (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "By contrast, the results did not indicate a clear preference for a particular parser, and there has so far been no direct comparison of different parsers for event extraction.",
        "While the outputs of parsers applying the same out format can be compared using a gold standard corpus, it is difficult to perform meaningful comparison of parsers applying different frameworks.",
        "Additionally, it is still an open question to what extent high performance on a gold standard treebank correlates with usefulness at practical tasks.",
        "Task-based comparisons of parsers provide not only a way to asses parsers across frameworks but also a necessary measure of their practical applicability.",

        "This paper focuses on the comparison of several syntactic parsers on a bio-molecular event extraction task with a state-of-the-art event extraction system.",
        "This section explains the details of the comparison.",
        "Section 2.1 presents the event extraction task setting, following that of the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task.",

        "The bio-molecular event extraction task considered in this study is that defined in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "The shared task provided common and consistent task definitions, data sets for training and evaluation, and evaluation criteria.",
        "The shared task consists of three subtasks: core event extraction (Task 1), augmenting events with secondary arguments (Task 2), and the recognition of speculation and negation of the events (Task 3) (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper we consider Task 1 and Task 2.",
        "The shared task defined nine event types, which can be divided into five simple events (Gene.expression, Transcription, Protein_catabolism, Phosphorylation, and Localization) that take one core argument, a multi-participant binding event (Binding), and three regulation events (Regulation, Positive-regulation, and Negative_regulation) that can take other events as arguments.",
        "In the two tasks considered, events are represented with a textual trigger, type, and arguments, where the trigger is a span of text that states the event in text.",

        "With the exception of Bikel, all the applied parsers have models specifically adapted for biomedical text.",
        "Further, all of the biomedical domain models have been created with reference and for many parsers with direct training on the data of (a subset of) the GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005).",
        "The results of parsing with these models as provided for the BioNLP Shared Task are used in this comparison.",
        "However, we note that the shared task data, drawn from the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008), contains abstracts that are also in the GENIA treebank.",
        "This implies that the parsers are likely to perform better on the texts used in the shared task than on other biomedical domain text, and similarly that systems building on their output are expected to achieve best performance on this data.",

        "The system was originally developed for finding core events (Task 1 in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task) using Enju and GDep with the native output of these parsers.",
        "The system consists of three supervised classification-based modules: a trigger detector, an event edge detector, and a complex event detector.",
        "The trigger detector classifies each word into the appropriate event types, the event edge detector classifies each edge between an event and a protein into an argument type, and the complex event detector classifies event candidates constructed by all edge combinations, deciding between event and non-event.",
        "The system uses one-vs-all support vector machines (SVMs) for the classifications.",
        "The system operates on one sentence at a time, building features for classification based on the syntactic analyses for the sentence provided by the two parsers as well as the sequence of the words in the sentence, including the target candidate.",
        "The features include the constituents/words around entities (triggers and proteins), the dependencies, and the shortest paths among the entities.",
        "The feature generation is format-independent regarding the shared properties of different formats, but makes use also of format-specific information when available for extracting features, including the dependency tags, word-related information (e.g. a lexical entry in Enju format), and the constituents and their head information.",
        "The previously introduced base system is here improved with two modifications.",
        "One modification is removing two classes of features from the original features (for details of the original feature representation, we refer to (Miwa et al., 2010)); specifically the features representing governor-dependent relationships from the target word, and the features representing each event edges in the complex event detector are removed.",
        "The other modification is to use head words in a trigger expression as a gold trigger word.",
        "This modification is inspired by the part-of-speech (POS) based selection proposed by Kilicoglu and Bergler (2009).",
        "The system uses a head word \"in\" as a trigger word in a trigger expression \"in the presence of instead of using all the words of the expression.",
        "In cases where there is no head word information in a parser output, head words are selected heuris-tically: if a word does not modify another word in the trigger expression, the word is selected as a head word.",
        "The system is also modified to find secondary arguments (Task 2 in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task).",
        "The second arguments are treated as additional arguments in Task 1: the trigger detector finds secondary argument candidates, the event edge detector finds secondary argument edge candidates, and the complex event detector finds events including secondary arguments.",
        "The features are extracted using the same feature extraction method as for regulation events taking proteins as arguments."

        "The results indicate that the contribution of the dependency types to extraction performance differs between the variants: the expected performance drop is most notable for the basic dependencies, and for the collapsed dependencies there is even a minute increase in performance, making results for collapsed dependencies best of the untyped results (by a very narrow margin).",
        "While this result doesn't unambiguously point to a specific explanation for why basic dependencies provide best performance when types are not removed, possible explanations include errors in typing or sparseness issues causing problems in generalization for the types of non-basic dependencies.",

        "We compared five parsers and three formats on a bio-molecular event extraction task with a stateof-the-art event extraction system.",
        "The specific task considered was the BioNLP shared task, allowing the use of the GENIA treebank as a gold standard parse reference.",
        "The event extraction system, modified for a higher performance and an additional subtask, showed high performance on the shared task subtasks considered.",
        "Four of the five considered parsers were applied using biomedical models trained on the GENIA treebank, and they were found to produce similar performance.",
        "Parser ensembles were further shown to allow improvement of the performance of the event extraction system.",
        "The contributions of this paper are 1) the comparison of several commonly used parsers on the event extraction task with a gold treebank, 2) demonstration of the usefulness of the parser ensemble on the task, and 3) the introduction of a state-of-the-art event extraction system.",
        "One limitation of this study is that the comparison between the parsers is not perfect, as the format conversions miss some information from the original formats and results with different formats depend on the ability of the event extraction system to take advantage of their strengths.",
        "To maximize comparability, the system was designed to extract features identically from similar parts of the dependency-based formats, further adding information provided by other formats, such as the lexical entries of the Enju format, from external resources.",
        "The results of this paper are expected to be useful as a guide not only for parser selection for biomedical information extraction but also for the development of event extraction systems.",
        "The selection of compared parsers and formats in the present evaluation is somewhat limited.",
        "As future work, it would be informative to extend the comparison to other syntactic representations, such as the PTB format.",
        "Finally, the evaluation showed that the system fails to recover approximately 40% of events even when provided with manually annotated treebank data, showing that other methods and resources need to be adopted to further improve bio-molecular event extraction systems.",
        "Such improvement is left as future work."
