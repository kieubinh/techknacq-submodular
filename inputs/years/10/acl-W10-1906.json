      "heading": "3. Methods",
      "text": [
        "In order to gain insight into the principles underlying expression of nominal arguments, we first determined the 50 most common nominalizations in MEDLINE citations that also occur in the UMLS SPECIALIST Lexicon, and then analyzed a corpus of 1012 sentences extracted from 476 citations containing those nominalizations.",
        "We further limited these sentences to those with no-minalizations containing two overt arguments (since SemRep only extracts predications with two arguments), resulting in a final set of 383 sentences.",
        "We determined 14 alternation patterns for nominalizations based on this analysis and devised an algorithm to accommodate them.",
        "We then conducted two evaluations, one to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm independently of other considerations and another to assess the contribution of enhanced nominalization processing to SemRep generally.",
        "Much work in identifying arguments of nomina-lizations assigns semantic role, such as agent, patient, etc., but SemRep does not.",
        "In this analysis, arguments are logical subject and object.",
        "Relational nouns often allow only one argument (e.g. the weight of the evidence), and either one or both of the arguments of a nominalization or gerund may be left unexpressed.",
        "SemRep doesn't interpret nominalizations with unexpressed arguments.",
        "If both arguments appear, they fall into one of several patterns, and the challenge in no-minalization processing is to accommodate these patterns.",
        "Cohen et al.",
        "(2008) note several such patterns, including those in which both arguments are to the right of the nominalization, cued by prepositions (treatment of fracture with surgery), the nominalization separates the arguments (fracture treatment with surgery, surgical treatment for fracture), and both arguments precede the nominalizations, as modifiers of it (surgical fracture treatment and fracture surgical treatment).",
        "Cohen et al.",
        "(2008) do not list several patterns we observed in the clinical domain, including those in which the subject appears to the right marked by a verb (the treatment of fracture is surgery) or as an appositive (the treatment of fracture, surgery), and those in which the subject appears to the left and the nominalization is either in a prepositional phrase (surgery in the treatment of fracture, surgery in fracture treatment) or is preceded by a verb or is parenthetical (surgery is (the best) treatment for fracture; surgery is (the best) fracture treatment; surgery, the best fracture treatment).",
        "One pattern, in which both arguments are on the right and the subject precedes the object, is seen most commonly in the clinical domain when the nominalization has a lexically specified cue (e.g. the contribution of stem cells to kidney repair).",
        "The nominal alternation patterns are listed in Table 1.",
        "Generalizations about arguments of nominali-zations are based on the position of the arguments, both with respect to each other and to the nominalization, and whether they modify the nominalization or not.",
        "A modifying argument is internal to the simple noun phrase of which the nominalization is the head; other arguments (both to the left and to the right) are external.",
        "(Relativization is considered external to the simple noun phrase.)",

        "Argument cuing plays a prominent role in defining these patterns.",
        "A cue is an overt syntactic element associated with an argument, and can be a preposition, a verb (most commonly a form of be), a comma, or parenthesis.",
        "A cued argument is in a dependency with the cue, which is itself in a dependency with the nominalization.",
        "The cue must occur between the nominalization and the argument, whether the argument is to the right (e.g. treatment of fracture) or to the left (e.g. surgery in the treatment).",
        "Prepositional cues for the objects of some nominalizations are stipulated in the lexicon; some of these are obligatory (e.g. contribution - to), while others are optional (treatment - for).",
        "External arguments of nominalizations must be cued, and cues unambiguously signal the role of the argument, according to the following cuing rules (Cohen et al., 2008).",
        "Verbs, comma, parenthesis, and the prepositions by, with, and via cue subjects only.",
        "(By is used for semantic role agent and with for instrument, but SemRep does not exploit this distinction.)",
        "Of cues subjects only if the nominalization has an obligatory (object) cue; it must cue objects otherwise.",
        "There is a class of nominalizations (e.g. cause) that do not allow a prepositionally cued subject.",
        "Considerable variation is seen in the order of subject and object; however, if the subject intervenes between the nominalization and the object, both must have equal cuing status (the only possibilities are that both be either uncued or cued with a preposition).",
        "In extending SemRep for identifying arguments of nominalizations, existing machinery was exploited, namely shallow parsing, mapping simple noun phrases to Metathesaurus concepts, and the application of indicator rules to map nominaliza-tions to enhanced Semantic Network ontological predications (which imposes restrictions on the semantic type of arguments).",
        "Finally, syntactic argument identification was enhanced specifically for nominalizations and exploits the linguistic generalizations noted.",

        "Therefore, prevention of cervical cancer with HPV vaccination may have a significant financial impact.",
        "Processing to identify arguments for prevention begins by determining whether the nomina-lization has a lexically specified object cue.",
        "This information is needed to determine the cuing function of of.",
        "Since it is common for there to be at least one argument on the right, identification of arguments begins there.",
        "Arguments on the right are external and must be cued.",
        "If a cued argument is found, its role is determined by the argument cuing rules.",
        "Since prevention does not have a lexically specified cue, of marks its object.",
        "Further, the semantic type of the concept for the object of of matches the object of the ontological predication ('Neoplastic Process').",
        "The algorithm next looks to the right of the first argument for the second argument.",
        "Since processing addresses only two arguments for nominalizations, subject and object, once the role of the first has been determined, the second can be inferred.",
        "For cued arguments, the process checks that the cue is compatible with the cuing rules.",
        "In all cases, the relevant semantic type must match the subject of the ontological predication.",
        "In this instance, with cues subjects and 'Therapeutic or Preventive Process' matches the subject of the ontological predication indicated.",
        "If only one noun phrase to the right satisfies the argument cuing rules, the second argument must be on the left.",
        "A modifier immediately to the left of the nominalization (and thus an internal argument) is sought first, and its role inferred from the first argument.",
        "Since internal arguments are not cued, there is no need to ensure cuing compatibility.",

        "The role of the first argument is found based on semantic type.",

        "We discuss a linguistically principled implementation for identifying arguments of nominaliza-tions in clinically focused biomedical text.",

        "The first evaluation resulted in an F-score of 0.646 (P=0.743, R=0.569), which is 20 points higher than the baseline, while the second showed that overall SemRep results were increased to F-score 0.689 (P=0.745, R=0.640), approximately 25 points better than processing without nominalizations.",
        "Since our nominalization processing is by extending SemRep, rather than by creating a dedicated system, we provide the interpretation of these structures in a broader context.",
