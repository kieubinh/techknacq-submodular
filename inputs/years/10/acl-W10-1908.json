        "In this paper we investigate an automated method of inferring the stage of a patient's breast cancer from discourse in an online forum.",
        "Such information can prove invaluable both for forum members, by enriching their use of this rapidly developing and increasingly popular medium, and for health researchers, by providing them with tools to quantify and better understand patient populations and how they behave online.",
        "Patients with chronic diseases like diabetes or life-threatening conditions like breast cancer get a wealth of information from medical professionals about their diagnoses, test results, and treatment options, but such information is not always satisfactory or sufficient for patients.",
        "Much of that is essential to their everyday lives and the management of their condition escapes the clinical realm.",
        "Furthermore, patients feel informed and empowered by exchanging experiences and emotional support with others in the same circumstances.",
        "Thus, it is not surprising that patient communities have flourished on the Web over the past decade, through active disease-specific discussion forums and mailing lists.",
        "For health professionals, this new medium presents exciting research avenues related to theories of psychosocial support and how patients manage their conditions.",
        "Qualitative analyses of forums and mailing list posts show that breast cancer patients and survivors provide and seek support to and from their peers and that support, while also emotional, is largely informational in nature (Civan and Pratt, 2007; Meier et al., 2007).",
        "Emotional support may include words of encouragement and prayers.",
        "Examples of informational support are providing personal experiences with a treatment, discussing new research, explaining a pathology report to a peer, as well as exchanging information pertinent to patients' daily lives, such as whether to shave one's head once chemotherapy starts.",
        "Given the kinds of benefits that patients and survivors seek and provide in online forums, it seems likely that they would be inclined to gravitate toward others whose circumstances most closely resemble their own, beyond sharing the general diagnosis of breast cancer.",
        "In fact, focus groups and surveys conducted with breast cancer patients identified and emphasized the need for online cancer forum participants to identify other patients of a particular age, stage of illness, or having opted for similar treatment (Rozmovits and Ziebland, 2004; van Uden-Kraan et al., 2008).",
        "The stage of a patient's cancer, in particular, can be a crucial proxy for finding those whose experiences are likely similar and relevant to one's own.",
        "For breast cancer, there are five high-level standard stages (0 to IV).",
        "While they do not give the whole picture about a particular cancer (the stages themselves can be described with finer granularity and they do no not encompass additional information like hormonal sensitivity), physicians have traditionally relied on them for prognosis and determining treatment options.",
        "For patients and survivors, they are a useful way to communicate to their peers their health status, as evidenced by the members' signatures on forums and mailing lists (Meier et al., 2007).",
        "Although many forums provide pre-set profile fields for users to populate with important background information, such as the stage of their cancer (e.g., the popular forum on breastcancer.",
        "org), in practice, only a fraction of members have a complete profile.",
        "Thus, an automated way of inferring member profile information via the social network created by a forum's users would help fill in the blanks.",
        "Beyond identifying other patients in a forum in similar circumstances, such a tool can have numerous practical benefits for both forum users and health researchers who study patients' online behavior.",
        "When a patient searches for a particular piece of information in a forum, incorporating contextual information about the user into the search mechanism can improve search results.",
        "For example, a search tool can rank higher the posts that were authored by patients with the same stage.",
        "For health researchers, questions which bring a better understanding of forum usage (i.e., \"are patients with stage IV cancer more or less active in a forum than patients with early stage cancer\") can be answered accurately only if all members of the forums are taken into account, not just the ones who filled out their member profiles.",
        "Furthermore, in the context of health communication, the more information is available about an individual, the more effective the message can be, from generic to personalized to targetted to tailored (Kreuter et al., 2000).",
        "Our research contributes an automated method to acquiring contextual information about forum participants.",
        "We focus on cancer stage as an exmple of context information.",
        "Our research question is whether it is possible to predict the stage of individuals' cancer based on their online discourse.",
        "By discourse we mean both the information she conveys and whom she talks to in a forum.",
        "Following ethical guidelines in processing of patient data online, we focus on a popular breast cancer forum with a large number of participants (Eysenbach and Till, 2001).",
        "We show that the content of members' posts and the stage of their interlocutors can provide complementary clues to identifying cancer stages."

        "Researchers have begun to explore the possibility of diagnosing patients based on their speech productions.",
        "Content analysis methods, which rely on patient speech transcripts or texts authored by patients, have been leveraged for understanding cancer coping mechanisms (Graves et al., 2005; Ban-tum and Owen, 2009), psychiatric diagnoses (Ox-man et al., 1988; Elvevaag et al., 2010), and the analysis of suicide notes (Pestian et al., 2008).",
        "In all cases, results, while not fully accurate, are promising and show that patient-generated content is a valuable clue to diagnosis in an automated framework.",
        "Our work departs from these experiments in that we do not attempt to predict the psychological state of a patient, but rather the status of a clinical condition.",
        "Staging breast cancer provides a way to summarize the status of the cancer based on clinical characteristics (the size of the tumor, whether the cancer is invasive or not, whether cancer cells are present in the lymph nodes, and whether the cancer has spread beyond the breast).",
        "There are five high-level stages for breast cancer.",
        "Stage 0 describes a non-invasive cancer.",
        "Stage I represents early stage of an invasive cancer, where the tumor size is less than 2 centimeters and no lymph nodes are involved (that is, the cancer has not spread outside of the breast).",
        "Stages II and III describe a cancer with larger tumor size and/or the cancer has spread outside of the breast.",
        "Stage IV describes a cancer that have metastasized to distant parts of the body, such as lungs and bones.",
        "In our work, we analyze naturally occurring content, generated by patients talking to each other online.",
        "As such, our sample population is much larger than in earlier works (typically less than 100 subjects).",
        "Like the researchers who focus on content analysis, we rely on the content generated by patients, but we also hypothesize that whom the patients interact with can help the prediction of cancer stage.",
        "In particular, we build a social network based on patients' interactions to boost text-based predictions.",
        "Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in the NLP community, and similar approaches have been employed and shown to perform well in other areas like question answering (Jurczyk, 2007) (Harabagiu et al., 2006), word-sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005), and textual entailment (Haghighi, 2005)."

        "In this paper, we investigated breast cancer stage prediction based on the online discourse of patients participating in a breast cancer-specific forum.",
        "We show that relying on lexical features derived from the content of the posts of a patient provides promising classification results.",
        "Furthermore, even a simple social network representing patient interactions on a forum, yields predictions with comparable results.",
        "Combining the two approaches boosts results, as content and interaction seem to model complementary aspects of patient discourse.",
        "Our experiments show that stage IV patients appear to exhibit specific textual and social patterns in forums.",
        "This point can prove useful to health researchers who want to quantify patient behaviors online.",
        "The strategy of combining two facets of discourse (content and interactions) introduces several interesting research questions.",
        "In the future, we plan to investigate some of them.",
        "In a first step, we plan to better model the interactions of patients online.",
        "For instance, we would like to analyze the content of the posts to determine further if two patients are in direct communication, and the domain of their exchange (e.g., clinical vs. day-to-day vs. emotional).",
        "As we have observed that the way edges in the network are weighted has an impact on overall performance, we could then investigate whether the domain(s) of interaction among users (clinical matters vs. emotional and instrumental matters for instance) has an impact on predicting cancer stage by taking the different domains of interaction in account in the weight computation.",
        "Finally, this work relies on a single, yet highly active and popular, forum.",
        "We would like to test our results on different breast cancer forums, but also on other disease-specific forums, where patients can be separated in clinically relevant groups."
