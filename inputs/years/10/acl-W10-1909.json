        "With almost 2000 articles being published daily in 2009, the amount of available research literature in the biomedical domain is increasing rapidly.",
        "Currently, MEDLINE contains reference records for almost 20 million articles (with about 10 million abstracts), and PubMed Central (PMC) contains almost two million full-text articles.",
        "These resources store an enormous wealth of information, but are proving increasingly difficult to navigate and interpret.",
        "This is true both for researchers seeking information on a particular subject and for database curators aiming to collect and annotate information in a structured manner.",
        "Text-mining tools aim to alleviate this problem by extracting structured information from unstructured text.",
        "Considerable attention has been given to some areas in text-mining, such as recognizing named entities (e.g. species, genes and drugs) (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2007; Hakenberg et al., 2008; Gerner et al., 2010) and extracting molecular relationships, e.g. proteinprotein interactions (Donaldson et al., 2003; Plake et al., 2006; Chowdhary et al., 2009).",
        "Many other areas of text mining in the biomedical domain are less mature, including the extraction of information about the expression of genes (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "The literature contains a large amount of information about where and when genes are expressed, as knowledge about the expression of a gene is critical for understanding its function and has therefore often been reported as part of gene studies.",
        "Gene expression profiles from genome-wide studies are available in specialized databases such as the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2009) and FlyAtlas (Chintapalli et al., 2007), but results on gene expression from smaller studies remain locked in the primary literature.",
        "Previously, a number of data-mining projects have combined text-mining methods with structured genome-wide gene expression data in order to allow further interpretation of the gene expression data (Natarajan et al., 2006; Fundel, 2007).",
        "However, only recently has interest in text-mining tools aimed at extracting gene expression profiles from primary literature started to grow.",
        "The 2009 BioNLP shared task (Kim et al., 2009) aimed at extracting biological \"events\", where one of the event types was gene expression.",
        "For this event type, participants were asked to determine locations in text documents where authors discussed the expression of a gene or protein and extract a trigger keyword (e.g. \"expression\") and its associated gene participant (the gene whose expression is discussed).",
        "The group that achieved the highest accuracy on the \"simple event\" task (where gene expression extraction was included) achieved recall and precision levels of 64.2% and 77.5%, respectively (Björne et al., 2009).",
        "A key limitation of the 2009 shared task was that all genes had been annotated prior to the beginning of the task, making it difficult to anticipate the accuracy of tools that do not rely on pre-annotated entities.",
        "Biologists are interested not only in finding statements of gene expression events, but also in knowing where and when a gene is expressed.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, no effort has previously been made to extract and map the expression of genes to specific tissues and cell types (and vice versa) from the literature.",
        "Thus, we have taken preliminary steps to construct a software tool, named Gene Expression Text Miner (GETM), capable of extracting information about what genes are expressed and where they are expressed.",
        "An additional goal of this work is to apply this tool to the whole of MED-LINE and PMC, and make both the tool and the extracted data available to researchers.",
        "We anticipate that the data extracted by GETM will provide researchers an overview about where a specific gene is expressed, or what genes are expressed in a specific anatomical location.",
        "Moreover, GETM will aid in the curation of gene expression databases by providing text passages and identifiers to database curators for verification.",
        "An overview of the workflow of GETM is given in Figure 1.",
        "Articles are initially scanned for mentions of gene entities, anatomical entities and keywords indicating the discussion of gene expression (called triggers following BioNLP terminology, e.g. \"expression\" and \"expressed in\").",
        "After the detection of the entities and triggers, abbreviations are detected and entities are grouped in the cases of enumerations.",
        "Finally, sentences are split and each sentence is processed in order to associate triggers with gene and anatomical entities.",
        "Each step is described below in more detail.",
        "In order to extract information on the expression of genes and their anatomical locations, a key requirement is the accurate recognition and normalization (mapping the recognized terms to database identifiers) of both the genes and anatomical locations in question.",
        "In order to locate and identify gene names, we utilized GNAT (Hakenberg et al., 2008), an interspecies gene name recognition software package.",
        "Among the gene name recognition tools capable of gene normalization, GNAT is currently showing the best accuracy (compared to the BioCreative corpora (Hirschman et al., 2005; Morgan et al., 2008)).",
        "The species identification component of GNAT, used to help disambiguate gene mentions across species, was performed by LINNAEUS (Gerner et al., 2010).",
        "In order to perform named entity recognition (NER) of anatomical locations, we investigated the use of various anatomical ontologies.",
        "A key challenge with these ontologies is that the terms",
        "Articles",
        "W Sentence splitting",
        "Determine gene",
        "and anatomy targets of triggers",
        "Results (web access)",
        "vary significantly from one species to another.",
        "For example, fruit flies have wings while humans do not, and humans have fingers, while fruit flies do not.",
        "Efforts have been made in creating unified species-independent anatomical ontologies, such as Uberon (Haendel et al.",
        ", 2009; Mungall et al.",
        ", 2010).",
        "However, in preliminary experiments we found that the coverage of Uberon was not extensive enough for this particular application (data not shown), motivating us to instead use a combination of various species-specific anatomical ontologies hosted at the OBO Foundry (Smith et al., 2007).",
        "These ontologies (n = 13) were chosen in order to cover terms from the main model organisms that are used in research (e.g. human, fruit fly, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans) and a few larger groups of organisms such as e.g. amphibians and fungi.",
        "It is worth noting that the more general terms, such as e.g. \"brain\", are likely to match anatomical locations in other species as well.",
        "In total, the selected ontologies contain terms for 38,459 different anatomical locations.",
        "We also utilized an ontology of cell lines (Romano et al., 2009), containing terms for a total of 8,408 cell lines (ranging across 60 species), as cell lines can be viewed as biological proxies for the anatomical locations that gave rise to them.",
        "For example, the HeLa cell line was derived from human cervical cells, and the THP1 cell line was derived from human monocytes (Romano et al., 2009).",
        "The anatomical and cell line NER, utilizing the OBO Foundry and cell line ontologies, was performed using dictionary-matching methods similar to those employed by LINNAEUS (Gerner et al., 2010).",
        "After performing gene and anatomical NER on the document, abbreviations were detected (using the algorithm by Schwartz and Hearst (2003)) in order to allow the detection and markup of abbreviated entity names in the cases where the abbreviations do not exist in any of the ontologies that are used.",
        "The trigger keywords indicating that an author is discussing the expression of one or several genes, such as e.g. \"expression\" and \"expressed in \" were detected using a manually created list of regular expressions.",
        "The regular expressions were designed to match variations of a set of terms, listed below, that were identified when inspecting documents not used when building the gold-standard corpus (see Section 3.1).",
        "The terms used to construct the trigger regular expressions were orthographical, morphological and derivational variations of \"expression\", \"production\" and \"transcription\".",
        "Descriptions of the level of expression were also considered for the different terms, such as \"over-expression,\" \"un-der-expression,\" \"positively expressed,\" \"negatively expressed,\" etc.",
        "Each gene expression mention that has been extracted by GETM contains information about the trigger term used by the author, allowing researchers to look only at e.g. the \"negative\" mentions (where genes are e.g. \"under-expressed\" or \"negatively expressed\") or the \"positive\" mentions (where genes are e.g. \"over-expressed\").",
        "To help associate triggers with the correct gene and anatomical entities, articles were first split into sentences, allowing each sentence to be processed in turn.",
        "In order to reduce the number of false positives and preserve a high level of precision, any sentences that did not contain a trigger, at least one gene mention and at least one anatomical mention were ignored.",
        "For the sentences that did contain a combination of all three requirements (trigger, gene and anatomical mention), the following pattern-and distance-based rules were employed in order to associate each trigger with the correct gene and anatomical mention:",
        "1.",
        "If there is only one gene mention and only one anatomical mention in the sentence, the trigger is associated with those mentions.",
        "2.",
        "If there is one gene mention (G) and one anatomical mention (A) in the sentence such that they match one of the patterns \"<G> is expressed in <A>\", \"expression of <G> in <A>\", \"<A> transcribes <G>\" or \"<A> produces <G>\", the gene mention <G> and anatomical mention <A> are associated with the trigger (variations of the triggers, such as \"over-expressed\" and \"negative expression\" are considered as well).",
        "Additional gene or anatomical mentions that fall outside the pattern are ignored.",
        "3.",
        "If neither of the above rules applies, the trigger is associated with the gene and anatomical mentions that are closest to the trigger.",
        "For the purposes of these rules, an enumeration of several genes or anatomical locations was handled as if it was only a single mention.",
        "For example, Rule 1 might trigger even if there are several genes mentioned in the same sentence, as long as they are mentioned together as part of an enumeration.",
        "In order to detect these enumerations, a rule-based algorithm for connecting enumerated gene and anatomical entity mentions (as in e.g. \"... RelB and DC-CK1 gene expression ...\") was also implemented.",
        "Being able to detect enumerations allowed the rules described above to recognize that a particular gene expression mention do not refer to only e.g. \"RelB\" or \"DC-CK1\", but both of them at the same time.",
        "Each trigger was processed independently, allowing the potential extraction of multiple gene expression statements from a single sentence.",
        "Initially, experiments were performed using stricter rules where only variations of Rule 2, requiring gene and anatomical mentions to conform to certain patterns, were used.",
        "However, recall was in these cases found to be extremely low (below 5%, data not shown).",
        "The current rules are more permissive, allowing higher recall.",
        "The fact that the method requires a combination of a trigger, a gene and an anatomical location makes it susceptible to false negatives: if any one of them cannot be found by the NER or trigger detection methods, the whole combination is missed."

        "However, the BioNLP corpus (Ohta et al., 2009) which is based on the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2008), does contain annotations about gene expression.",

        "In order to allow evaluation of the accuracy of our software, we extended the annotations of gene expression events in part of the BioNLP corpus.",
        "Each gene expression entry in the corpus was linked to the anatomical location or cell line that the author mentioned.",
        "In cases where gene expression was only discussed generally without referring to expression in a particular location, no association to an anatomical location could be made (these entries were ignored during evaluation).",
        "Note that named entities were only linked to their locations in the text, not to unique database identifiers (such as Entrez Gene or OBO Foundry identifiers).",
        "Because of this, subsequent evaluation in this extended corpus is limited to the accuracy of recognition (locating the entities in the text), but not normalization (linking the entities to database identifiers).",
        "In total, annotations for 150 abstracts (constituting the development set of the BioNLP corpus) were extended to also include anatomical locations.",
        "These abstracts contained 377 annotated gene expression events, of which 267 (71%) could be linked to anatomical locations.",
        "These results demonstrate that the majority of gene expression mentions include reference to an anatomical location.",
        "For a few cases where the author described the expression of a gene in several cell types, a single gene expression event gave rise to several distinct \"entries\" in the extended corpus, creating a total of 279 final gene expression entries that are linked to anatomical locations."

        "This limited recall to 25.7%, even if the rule-based method was working perfectly.",
        "Manual inspection of the false positives (after adjusting the false positives caused by incomplete annotations) allowed the identification of one clear cause: if the NER methods fail to recognize the entity associated with a manually annotated expression entry, but there are other entities (that have been recognized) in the sentence, those entities might be incorrectly associated with the trigger instead.",

        "When constructing text-mining applications, a balance between precision (reflecting the relative number of false positives) and recall (reflecting the relative number of false negatives) is often used to optimize system performance.",
        "Accordingly, a measure which often is used to evaluate the accuracy of software is the F-score (the harmonic mean of the precision and recall).",
        "In this work, we have decided that rather than trying to maximize the F-score, we have put more focus on precision in order to ensure that the data extracted by GETM are of as high quality as possible.",
        "This typically leads to lower recall, causing the software to detect a relatively smaller number of relevant passages.",
        "Nonetheless, we believe that for this particular application, a smaller amount of data with higher quality would be more useful to curators and biologists than a larger amount of data that is less reliable.",
        "It is difficult to compare the precision and recall levels of GETM (at 58.8% and 23.8%, respectively) against other tools, as GETM is the first tool aiming to perform this particular task.",
        "The closest comparison that can be made is against the software evaluated in the BioNLP shared task (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "However, software developed for the BioNLP shared task did not attempt to extract the anatomical location of gene expression mentions, nor did they need to identify the component entities involved.",
        "The tool with the highest accuracy for the simple event task (where gene expression extraction was included) showed precision and recall levels of 77.5% and 64.2%, respectively (Björne et al., 2009).",

        "When investigating the cause of the low level of recall, the main reason that emerged for the high number of false negatives was the high number of annotated entries that could not be automatically extracted due to at least one of the gene, anatomical or trigger mentions not being recognized.",
        "This fact underscores the importance of accurate NER for applications that rely on the extracted entity mentions, especially those that attempt to extract information from multiple entity types, like GETM.",

        "The high proportion (23%) of multi-sentence entries in our extended corpus differs from previously reported results.",
        "For the event annotations in the BioNLP corpus, previous analyses showed that only 5% of all entries spanned several sentences (Björne et al., 2009).",
        "This suggests that the mentions of anatomical locations are located outside of the \"trigger sentence\" more often than gene mentions or other entities in the BioNLP corpus."

        "In this paper, we have explored integrated mining of gene expression mentions and their anatomical locations from the literature and presented a new tool, GETM, which can be used to extract information about the expression of genes and where they are expressed from biomedical text.",
        "We have also extended part of a previously existing gold-standard corpus in order to allow evaluation of GETM.",
        "When evaluated against the gold-standard corpus, GETM performed with precision and recall levels of 58.8% and 23.8%, respectively.",
        "The relatively low level of recall was primarily caused by incomplete recognition of individual entities, indicating that - in order to increase the recall of GETM - future work would primarily need to focus on increasing the accuracy of the NER methods.",
        "With more accurate NER, while increasing recall, the higher number of recognized entities is also expected to increase the number of false positives, causing a need for deeper NLP methods in order to preserve and increase the level of precision.",
        "While having a low level of recall, GETM was nonetheless able to extract 716,541 statements from MEDLINE and PMC, constituting a large and potentially useful data set for researchers wishing to get an overview of gene expression for a particular gene or anatomical location.",
        "The high number of mentions extracted from MED-LINE can give an indication of the amount of data available in MEDLINE: if the recall on the BioNLP corpus is representative for MEDLINE as a whole, a tool with perfect accuracy might be able to extract almost 2.5 million entries.",
        "The level of precision (p = 58.8%) will most likely not be high enough for researchers to rely on the extracted data for high-throughput bioin-formatical experiments without some kind of verification.",
        "However, we believe that it nonetheless will be of high enough quality that researchers and curators will not feel inconvenienced by false positives, as currently the only alternatives are multi-word free text searches through PubMed or Google.",
        "Additionally, we provide an interface with the text context surrounding gene expression statements, making it easier for researchers to quickly locate relevant results.",
        "In the future, we will aim to evaluate the normalization of entities detected by GETM in order to quantify the level to which the identifiers assigned to the entities are correct.",
        "In addition, both the gene and anatomical NER components could be improved in order to both reduce the number of false negatives and cover gene and anatomical terms for a wider range of species, beyond the common model organisms.",
        "We also believe that extending this work by utilizing deeper NLP methods (e.g. dependency parsers) could further improve the accuracy of GETM and related approaches to mining the abundance of data on gene expression in the biomedical literature."
