        "Previous work on biomedical named entity recognition (BNER) has been mostly focused on gene/protein mention recognition.",
        "Machine learning (ML) based approaches for gene/protein mention recognition have already achieved a sufficient level of maturity (Torii et al., 2009).",
        "However, the lack of availability of adequately annotated corpora has hindered the progress of BNER research for other semantic types such as diseases (Jimeno et al., 2008; Leaman et al., 2009).",
        "Correct identification of diseases is crucial for various disease-centric knowledge extraction tasks (e.g. drug discovery (Agarwal and Searls, 2008)).",
        "Previous studies argue that the most promising candidate for the improvement of disease related relation extraction (e.g. disease-gene) is the correct identification of concept mentions including diseases (Bundschus et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we present a BNER system which uses a feature set specifically tailored for disease mention recognition.",
        "The system outperforms other approaches evaluated on the Arizona Disease Corpus (AZDC) (more details in Section 5.1).",

        "Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of locating boundaries of the entity mentions in a text and tagging them with their corresponding semantic types (e.g. person, location, gene and so on).",
        "Although several disease annotated corpora have been released in the last few years, they have been annotated primarily to serve the purpose of relation extraction and, for different reasons, they are not suitable for the development of ML based disease mention recognition systems (Leaman et al., 2009).",
        "For example, the BioText (Rosario and Hearst, 2004) corpus has no specific annotation guideline and contains several inconsistencies, while PennBioIE (Kulick et al., 2004) is very specific to a particular sub-domain of diseases.",
        "Among other disease annotated corpora, EBI disease corpus (Jimeno et al., 2008) is not annotated with disease mention boundaries which makes it unsuitable for BNER evaluation for diseases.",
        "Recently, an annotated corpus, named as Arizona has been released which has adequate and suitable annotation of disease mentions following specific annotation guidelines.",
        "There has been some work on identifying diseases in clinical texts, especially in the context of CMC Medical NLP Challenge and i2b2 Challenge.",
        "However, as noted by Meystre et al.",
        "(2008), there are a number of reasons that make clinical texts different from texts of biomedical literature, e.g. composition of short, telegraphic phrases, use of implicit templates and pseudotables and so on.",
        "Hence, the strategies adopted for NER on clinical texts are not the same as the ones practiced for NER on biomedical literature.",
        "As mentioned before, most of the work to date on BNER is focused on gene/protein mention recognition.",
        "State-of-the-art BNER systems are based on ML techniques such as conditional random fields (CRFs), support vector machines (SVMs) etc (Dai et al., 2009).",
        "These systems use either gene/protein specific features (e.g. Greek alphabet matching) or post-processing rules (e.g. extension of the identified mention boundaries to the left when a single letter with a hyphen precedes them (Torii et al., 2009)) which might not be as effective for other semantic type identification as they are for genes/proteins.",
        "There is a substantial agreement in the feature set that these systems use (most of which are actually various orthographical and morphological features).",
        "Bundschus et al.",
        "(2008) have used a CRF based approach that uses typical features for gene/protein mention recognition (i.e. no feature tailoring for disease recognition) for disease, gene and treatement recognition.",
        "The work has been evaluated on two corpora which have been annotated with those entities that participate in disease-gene and disease-treatment relations.",
        "The reported results show F-measure for recognition of all the entities that participate in the relations and do not indicate which F-measure has been achieved specifically for disease recognition.",
        "Hence, the reported results are not applicable for comparison.",

        "BANNER achieves an F-score of 54.84 for disease mention recognition on the BioText corpus (Leaman and Gonzalez, 2008).",
        "However, as said above, the BioText corpus contains annotation in-consistencies.",
        "So, the corpus is not ideal for comparing system performances.",

        "There are basically three stages in our approach -pre-processing, feature extraction and model training, and post-processing.",
        "At first, the system uses GeniaTagger to tokenize texts and provide PoS tagging.",
        "After that, it corrects some common inconsistencies introduced by GeniaTagger inside the tokenized data (e.g. Ge-niaTagger replaces double inverted commas with two single inverted commas).",
        "These PoS tagged tokized data are parsed using Stanford parser.",
        "The dependency relations provided as output by the parser are used later as features.",
        "The tokens are further processed using the following generalization and normalization steps:",
        "• each number (both integer and real) inside a token is replaced with '9'",
        "• each token is further tokenized if it contains either punctuation characters or both digits and alphabetic characters",
        "• all letters are changed to lower case",
        "• all Greek letters (e.g. alpha) are replaced with G and Roman numbers (e.g. iv) with R",
        "• each token is normalized using SPECIALIST lexicon tool to avoid spelling variations",
        "The features used by our system can be categorized into the following groups:",
        "• general linguistic features (Table 1)",
        "• orthographic features (Table 2)",
        "• contextual features (Table 3)",
        "• syntactic dependency features (Table 4)",
        "• dictionary lookup features (see Section 4)",
        "During dictionary lookup feature extraction, we ignored punctuation characters while matching dictionary entries inside sentences.",
        "If a sequence of tokens in a sentence matches an entry in the dictionary, the leftmost token of that sequence is labeled with B-DB and the remaining tokens of the sequence are labeled with I-DB.",
        "The label B-DB indicates the beginning of a dictionary match.",
        "If a token belongs to several dictionary matches, then all the other dictionary matches except the longest one are discarded.",
        "The syntactic dependency features are extracted from the output of the parser while the general linguistic features are extracted directly from the preprocessed tokens.",
        "To collect the orthographic features, the original tokens inside the corresponding sentences are considered.",
        "The contextual features are derived using other extracted features and the original tokens.",

        "Our system uses Mallet (McCallum, 2002) to train a first-order CRF model.",
        "CRF is a state-of-the-art ML technique applied to a variety of text processing tasks including named entity recognition (Klinger and Tomanek, 2007) and has been successfully used by many other BNER systems (Smith et al., 2008).",

        "• Bracket mismatch correction: If there is a mismatch of brackets in the identified mention, then the immediate following (or preceding) character of the corresponding mention is checked and included inside the mention if that character is the missing bracket.",
        "Otherwise, all the characters from the index where the mismatched bracket exists inside the identified mention are discarded from the corresponding mention.",
        "• One sense per discourse: If any instance of a character sequence is identified as a disease mention, then all the other instances of that character sequence inside the same sentence are also annotated as disease mentions.",
        "• Short/long form annotation: Using the algorithm of Schwartz and Hearst (2003), \"long form (shortform)\" instances are detected inside sentences.",
        "If the short form is annotated as disease mention, then the long form is also annotated and vice versa.",
        "• Ungrammatical conjunction structure correction: If an annotated mention contains comma (,) but there is no \"and\" in the following character sequence (from the character index of that comma) of that mention, then the annotation is splitted into two parts (at the index of the comma).",
        "Annotation of the original mention is removed and the splitted parts are annotated as two separate disease mentions.",
        "• Short and long form separation: If both short and long forms are annotated in the same mention, then the original mention is discarded and the corresponding short and long forms are annotated separately."

        "6 Why Features for Diseases and Genes/Proteins are not the Same",
        "Many of the existing BNER systems, which are mainly tuned for gene/protein identification, use features such as token shape (also known as word class and brief word class (Settles, 2004)), Greek alphabet matching, Roman number matching and so forth.",
        "As mentioned earlier, we have done extensive experiments with various feature combinations for the selection of disease specific features.",
        "We have observed that many of the features used for gene/protein identification are not equally effective for disease identification.",
        "Table 7 shows some of the results of those experiments.",
        "This observation is reasonable because gene/protein names are much more complex than entities such as diseases.",
        "For example, they often contain punctuation characters (such as parentheses or hyphen), Greek alphabets and digits which are unlikely in disease names.",
        "Ideally, the ML algorithm itself should be able to utilize information from only the useful features and ignore the others in the feature set.",
        "But practically, having non-informative features often mislead the model learning.",
        "In fact, several surveys have argued that the choice of features matter at least as much as the choice of the algorithm if not more (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007; Zweigenbaum et al., 2007).",
        "One of the interesting trends in gene/protein mention identification is to not utilize syntactic dependency relations (with the exception of Vla-chos (2007)).",
        "Gene/protein names in biomedical literature are often combined (i.e. without being separated by space characters) with other characters which do not belong to the corresponding mentions (e.g. p53-mediated).",
        "Moreover, as mentioned before, gene/protein mentions commonly have very complex structures (e.g. PKR(1-551)K64E/K296R or RXRalphaF318A).",
        "So, it is a common practice to tokenize gene/proten names adopting an approach that split tokens as much as possible to extract effective features (Torii et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2008).",
        "But while the extensive tokenization boosts performance, it is often difficult to correctly detect dependency relations for the tokens of the gene/protein names in the sentences where they appear.",
        "As a result, use of the syntactic dependency relations is not beneficial in such approaches.",
        "In comparison, disease mentions are less complex.",
        "So, the identified dependencies for disease mentions are more reliable and hence may be usable as potential features (refer to our experimental results in Table 6).",
        "The above mentioned issues are some of the reasons why a feature set for the well studied gene/protein focused BNER approaches is not necessarily suitable for other biomedical semantic types such as diseases."
