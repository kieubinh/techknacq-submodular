        "They are consistent in outperforming the other classifiers in all the three settings.",

        "As we can see from the figure, the best individual models have a major improvement over previous results.",

        "We obtain the same results for two semantic relations, No_Cure and Vague and we believe that this is the case due to the fact that these two classes are significantly under-represented compared to the other ones involved in the task.",
        "For the Treatment_Only relation our results are outperformed with 1.5 percentage points and for the Irrelevant relation with 0.1 percentage point, only when we use the same model for all relations.",

        "The representation techniques highly influence the results, common for the ML community, but more informative representations where the ones that consistently obtained the best results.",
        "As future work, we would like to extend the experimental methodology when the first setting is applied, and to use additional sources of information as representation techniques.",
