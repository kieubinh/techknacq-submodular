        "A recent shared task in biomedical text mining, the BioNLP'09 Shared Task on Event Extraction (Kim et al., 2009), showed that the biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) community is greatly interested in heading towards the extraction of deep, semantically rich relationships.",
        "The shared task focused on biomolecu-lar events involving proteins and called for methods that are capable of identifying nested structures.",
        "Biomolecular events are a major category of relationships in the biomedical domain in which, among others, relationships involving non-molecular entities such as diseases and static relations such as protein family memberships are also of interest.",
        "Earlier, well-studied extraction tasks typically cast the problem in such a manner that relationships can be considered as mutually independent atomic units.",
        "However, as a nested semantic structure grows in its depth and in the total number of relationship arguments, its simultaneous extraction becomes difficult, if not impossible.",
        "Systems that bypass this problem by identifying atomic units of nested structures in a mutually independent manner must still decide which of the units collectively comprise a complete structure.",
        "Another problem arises from the fact that a single syntactic token can refer to several, distinct relationships each having a unique combination of arguments.",
        "This is typically induced by coordinations which are common in the biomedical domain (Pyysalo et al., 2007).",
        "As a result, aside from the identification and classification of relationships and their potential arguments, extraction systems have to make decisions about how many relationships should be generated and how the arguments should be distributed among them.",
        "For example, the sentence \"the binding of A and B to DNA regulates C and D, respectively\" states that there are two binding events (A-DNA and B-DNA) the former of which regulates C and the latter D instead of, for example, that both binding events regulate both C and D or that there is a single binding event between A, B, and DNA.",

        "Nodes and edges can be extracted in a mutually independent manner but the resulting graph cannot necessarily express all the real relationships.",
        "Rather, the graph can be seen as a projection of the original graph: each node and edge has been mapped to the representative of its equivalence class which is determined by the node and edge types and the referred tokens.",

        "Several equal nodes can exist provided they have unique combinations of outgoing edges.",
        "Note that there is one-to-one correspondence between nodes and real relationships but many-to-one between nodes and syntactic tokens.",
        "A projected graph (see Figure 1B) is one generated by mapping each node and edge of a de-projected graph to the representative of its equivalence class.",
        "That is, each node represents a set of equal nodes of the deprojected graph, and similarly for edges.",
        "As a result, each token is referred to by at most one node and there is a one-to-many correspondence between nodes and valid, real relationships.",
        "Also, the edges that are mapped to from the outgoing edges of equal nodes of the de-projected graph are the outgoing edges of a single node of the projected graph.",
        "The deprojection of a semantic graph is the task of reproducing the original graph given a projected graph.",
        "This can also be seen as a task of finding the sets of outgoing edges that represent all the valid, real relationships.",
        "The objective of the first transformation is accomplished with a grouping algorithm: the direct successors of each node are grouped by their syntactic and semantic roles relative to the predecessor.",
        "The groups are represented as additional nodes in the graph.",
        "The rationale for this grouping is that similar arguments tend to either be mutually exclusive (and be associated with some other arguments) or together form a single relationship.",
        "This behaviour can easily be described with two classes: distributive and collective.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"A and B regulate C\", the entities A and B share both the argument type (agent) and the syntactic role (subject) relative to the relationship regulate.",
        "They form a group and are mutually exclusive (distributive) while this group forms a single relationship (collective) together with C. As a result, AC and BC pairs of regulation are generated.",
        "This approach relates to the collectivity and distributivity of plurals which have been studied, among others, by Scha and Stallard (1988) and Brisson (2003).",
        "Technically, the grouping is a series of transformations in each of which a set of successors is replaced with a single, newly-created successor and the original successors become the successors of this node.",
        "The successors are first trivially grouped by the corresponding edge type.",
        "Finally, they are recursively grouped by syntactic similarity until they form a single group or multiple singleton groups.",
        "As a result, nested groups are generated.",
        "The groups by syntax are determined by first mapping both the predecessor and the successors into the referred tokens in the syntactic graph.",
        "Then, the tokens referred to by the predecessor are removed if they are not also referred to by any of the successors.",
        "This removal step is recursively applied to the predecessors of the removed tokens.",
        "As a result, the syntactic graph is decomposed into several connected components, each of which representing a group.",
        "Thus, two successors are grouped if their referred tokens belong to the same connected component.",

        "The duplication of a node also duplicates its incoming edges which are then processed by the assigned class labels as follows.",

        "Another limitation is that the approach expects an annotation scheme in which relationship arguments have the tendency of following syntactic dependencies as observed for BioInfer by Bjorne et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "This expectation may deteriorate the performance on highly refined schemes which do not consider syntax.",
        "On the other hand, since it relies more on the syntactic than on the biological properties of the relationships, the proposed approach should be applicable beyond the domain of biomolecular events (e.g. to gene-disease relationships or static relations).",
        "The F1 scores in Table 1 indicate that the BioNLP'09 Shared Task corpus is easier to extract than BioInfer.",
        "This is likely due to the narrower scope and the stricter constraints of the former.",
        "In absolute terms, the proposed method yields the largest improvement over the baseline on the gold-standard graphs which suggests that it is negatively affected by the presence of false nodes/edges or that the predicted graphs contain relatively more relationships that are trivially de-projected.",
        "On the other hand, in relative terms, the largest improvements are observed for symmetric relationships in the BioNLP'09 Shared Task corpus but overall in BioInfer.",
        "This is likely due to the differences in the relationship type distributions.",
        "The system recently developed by Miwa et al.",
        "(2010), based on the architecture of Bjorne et al.",
        "(2010), utilises a ML-based deprojection which enumerates all possible argument combinations and classifies them as positive or negative.",
        "While this approach may be prohibitively expensive in more complex schemes in which the number of arguments and their types is higher, it should outperform the proposed method on the BioNLP'09 Shared Task corpus.",
        "Since Miwa et al.",
        "do not analyse the contribution of the deprojection to the overall performance, a direct comparison of the two methods is impossible.",
        "In any case, the systems of Bjorne et al.",
        "(2010) and Miwa et al.",
        "(2010) demonstrate the success of the architecture using deprojection and further motivate the investigation of deprojection methods.",
        "In the future, the proposed method will be studied and further improved with two other corpora, GENIA Event Annotation (Kim et al., 2008) and Gene Regulation Event Corpus (Thompson et al., 2009), which are similar in their purpose compared to the already-analysed corpora.",
        "The former corpus is interesting because of the co-operativity of event participants which relaxes the restrictions on asymmetric relationships while the latter contains an extensive annotation for non-primary arguments.",
        "The method could also be examined with the static relation extraction task recently introduced by Pyysalo et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "In addition to improving the method and extending it to non-primary arguments, embedding the presented approach to a joint inference system, such as Markov Logic Network (MLN), will be studied.",
        "Deprojection is likely to greatly benefit methods based on Markov Logic which is \"not yet able to deal with cases where the number and identity of entities is unknown, while relations/links between known objects can be readily modelled\" (Riedel et al., 2009).",
        "The objective is to combine the graph prediction and the deprojection steps as well as to simultaneously enforce task-specific constraints and adapt to the presence of false positive nodes and edges.",
        "This should be achievable by extending the methods developed for the BioNLP'09 Shared Task corpus by Riedel et al.",
        "(2009) or by Poon and Vanderwende (2010), both of which determine the correct argument combinations outside of the Markov Logic framework.",
        "Semantic role labelling (SRL) is a task similar to the graph-based relationship extraction applied in this paper although the former typically only concerns shallow predicate-argument structures (Hacioglu, 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2008).",
        "The similarities between the tasks suggest that exploring them jointly may benefit the development of information extraction methods.",
        "In the long term, semantic schemes should be developed such that, ideally, all syntactic tokens are considered for their semantics and semantic relationships readily follow from their dependencies.",
        "Such schemes, closely following the syntax, could improve both the graph prediction and the deprojection.",
        "In this research direction, graph-based knowledge representations such as conceptual graphs (Sowa, 1976; Chein and Mugnier, 2008) or graphical logical forms such as the one proposed by Allen et al.",
        "(2008) could be adopted.",
        "Given the frequency of coordinations in the biomedical domain, deprojection may prove to be useful in the development of deep semantic parsing in the biomedical domain.",
        "For example, with improved semantic schemes, it could provide a means to generate complete, detailed semantic graphs directly from deep dependency analyses in a single-step by applying joint inference to achieve simultaneous node/edge relabelling and graph de-projection."

        "This study presents a method for reconstructing the original semantic graphs from their projections by determining the correct combinations of relationship arguments.",
        "It generalises the postprocessing step of the system described by Bjorne et al.",
        "(2010) and extends the extraction capability ofthis system to arbitrary graphs of nested biomolecular relationships.",
        "The evaluation of the method on BioInfer and the BioNLP'09 Shared Task corpus indicates that the approach is viable for primary relationship arguments.",
        "For BioInfer, the outcome is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported result of the task of extracting the nested relationships in its original version.",
        "The presented method facilitates an IE approach in which the identification of semantic entities is performed on the one-entity-per-token basis and relationship arguments are identified in a mutually independent manner disregarding the semantics of the argument combinations.",
        "The method handles the selection of the correct argument combinations, which is non-trivial particularly when coordinations are involved, and generates the final output in which a single token can refer to several entities.",
        "This approach improves the utilisation of deep dependency analyses by simplifying the correlation between them and semantic graphs.",
        "Due to its independent nature, the method can be coupled to any system identifying relationships on the one-per-token basis.",
        "The implemented system will be available upon request."
