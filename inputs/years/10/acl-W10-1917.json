        "NLP methods for extracting mutation information from the bibliome have become an important new research area within bio-NLP, as manually curated databases, like the Protein Mutant Database (PMD) (Kawabata et al., 1999), cannot keep up with the rapid pace of mutation research.",
        "However, while significant progress has been made with respect to mutation detection, the automated extraction of the impacts of these mutations has so far not been targeted.",
        "In this paper, we describe the first work to automatically summarize impact information from protein mutations.",
        "Our approach is based on populating an OWL-DL ontology with impact information, which can then be queried to provide structured information, including a summary."

        "Mutations are alterations, rearrangements, or duplications of genetic material, impacting protein properties like stability or activity.",

        "H86A/E/F/K/Q/W decreased the enzyme stability at 60° C by up to 95% and the transition temperature by 2.5° C to 5.8° C.",
        "Impacts are described through other concepts, since mutational events may cause changes to physical quantities such as pH and temperature.",
        "As presented in the above example, the named mutations (H86A/E/F/K/Q/W) made changes to the thermostability by 2.5-2.8 degrees Celsius.",
        "Hence, we extract (i) units of measurement, e.g., %, degree Celsius, min; (ii) protein properties: stability, activity and others; and (iii) impact words, including increase, stabilize, and reduce.",
        "Measurable impacts can thus be classified based on the type of effect (increase, decrease or destabilize) on the protein property."
