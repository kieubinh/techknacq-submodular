        "For most of the previous decade, biomedical Information Extraction (IE) efforts have focused primarily on tasks that allow extracted information to be represented as simple pairs of related entities.",
        "This representation is applicable to many IE targets of interest, such as gene-disease associations (Chun et al., 2006) and protein-protein interactions (Nedellec, 2005; Krallinger et al., 2007).",
        "However, it has limited applicability to advanced applications such as semantic search, Gene Ontology term annotation, and pathway extraction, tasks for which and relatively few resources or systems (e.g. (Rzhetsky et al., 2004)) have been introduced.",
        "A number of recent studies have proposed more expressive representations of extracted information, introducing resources supporting advanced IE approaches (Pyysalo et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009; Ananiadou et al., 2010a).",
        "A significant step in the development of domain IE methods capable of extracting this class of representations was taken in the BioNLP'09 shared task on event extraction, where 24 teams participated in an IE task setting requiring the extraction of structured representations of multi-participant biological events of several types (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "While the introduction of structured event extraction resources and methods has notably advanced the state of the art in biomedical IE representations, the focus of event extraction studies carries other limitations frequently encountered in domain IE efforts.",
        "Specifically, resources annotated for biomedical events contain exclusively texts from publication abstracts, typically further drawn from small subdomains of molecular biology.",
        "These choices constrain not only the types of texts but also the types of events considered, restricting the applicability of event extraction.",
        "This paper presents results from one ongoing effort to extend an event extraction approach over these boundaries, toward event extraction from full text documents in the domain of infectious diseases.",
        "In this study, we consider the subdomain related to Type IV secretion systems as a model subdomain of interest within the broad infectious diseases domain.",
        "Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are mechanisms for transferring DNA and proteins across cellular boundaries.",
        "T4SS are found in a broad range of Bacteria and in some Ar-chaea.",
        "These translocation systems enable gene transfer across cellular membranes thus contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance and viru-",

        "This section presents the application of an event extraction approach to the T4SS domain.",
        "We base our information extraction approach on the model introduced in the BioNLP'09 shared task on event extraction.",
        "Central to this approach is the event representation, which can capture the association of multiple participants in varying roles and numbers and treats events as primary objects of annotation, thus allowing events to be participants in other events.",
        "Further, both entities and events are text-bound, i.e. anchored to specific expressions in text (Figure 1).",
        "The BioNLP'09 shared task defined nine event types and five argument types (roles): Theme specifies the core participant(s) that an event affects, Cause the cause of the the event, Site a specific domain or region on a participant involved in the event, and ToLoc and AtLoc locations associated with localization events (Table 1).",
        "Theme and Cause arguments may refer to either events or gene/gene product entities, and other arguments refer to other physical entities.",
        "The Theme argument is always mandatory, while others can be omitted when a relevant participant is not stated.",

        "The event approach considered in this study further extends on these opportunities in introducing a model allowing e.g. search by specific associations of the concepts of interest.",

        "This division applies straightforwardly to the T4SS annotations, suggesting an approach where bacteria and cell components retain their simple tagged-term representation and the biological processes and molecular functions are given an event representation.",

        "For event extraction, we applied an adaptation of the approach of the top-ranking system in the BioNLP'09 shared task (BjÃ¶rne et al., 2009): all sentences in the input text were parsed with the McClosky-Charniak (2008) parser and the resulting phrase structure analyses then converted into the Stanford Dependency representation using conversion included in the Stanford NLP tools (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "Trigger recognition was performed with a simple regular expression-based tagger covering standard surface form variation.",
        "Edge detection was performed using a supervised machine learning approach, applying the LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) Support Vector Machine implementation with a linear kernel and the feature representation of Bjorne et al' (2009), building largely around the shortest dependency path connecting a detected trigger with a candidate participant.",
        "The SVM regularization parameter was selected by a sparse search of the parameter space with evaluation using cross-validation on the training set.",
        "As the class of events targeted for extraction in this study are of a highly restricted type, each taking only of a single mandatory Cause argument, the construction of events from detected",
        "Precision Recall F-score",
        "triggers and edges could be implemented as a simple deterministic rule.",
        "For evaluating the performance of the taggers we apply a relaxed matching criterion that accepts a match between an automatically tagged and a gold standard entity if the two overlap at least in part.",
        "This relaxation is adopted to focus on true tagging errors.",
        "The GENETAG entity span guidelines differ from the GENIA GGP guidelines adopted here in allowing the inclusion of e.g. head nouns when names appear in modifier position, while the annotation guidelines applied here require marking only the minimal name.",
        "When applying strict matching criteria, a substantial number of errors may trace back to minor boundary differences (Wang et al., 2009), which we consider of secondary interest to spurious or missing tags.",
        "Overall results are microaverages, that is, precision, recall and f-score are calculated from the sum of true positive etc.",
        "counts over individual documents.",
        "For event extraction, we applied the BioNLP'09 shared task event extraction criteria (Kim et al., 2009) with one key change: to make it possible to evaluate the extraction of the high-level process participants, we removed the requirement that all events must define a Theme as their core argument.",
        "The initial GGP tagging results using BANNER are shown in Table 11.",
        "We find that even for the relaxed overlap matching criterion, the f-score is nearly 10% points lower than reported on GENETAG in the evaluation on abstracts.",
        "For full texts, performance is lower yet by a further 10% points.",
        "In both cases, the primary problem is the poor precision of the tagger, indicating that many non-GGPs are spuriously tagged.",
        "To determine common sources of error, we performed a manual analysis of 100 randomly selected falsely tagged strings (Table 12).",
        "We find",
        "GGP tagging.",
        "that the most frequent category consists of cases that are arguably correct by GENETAG annotation criteria, which allow named protein families of groups to be tagged.",
        "A similar argument can be made for domains or regions.",
        "Perhaps not surprisingly, a large number of false positives relate to features common in full texts but missing from the abstracts on which the tagger was trained, such as figure and table references.",
        "Finally, systematic errors are made for entities belonging to other categories such as named cell components or species.",
        "To address these issues, we applied a domain-adapted custom tagger that largely replicates the features of BANNER, further integrating information from the UMLS Metathesaurus, which provides a large dictionary containing terms covering 135 different semantic classes, and a custom dictionary of 1081 domain GGP names, compiled by (Ananiadou et al., 2010b).",
        "The non-GGP UMLS Metathesaurus terms provided negative indicators for reducing spurious taggings, and the custom dictionary positive indicators.",
        "Finally, we augmented the GENETAG training data with 10 copies of the training half of the T4SS GGP corpus as in-domain training data.",
        "Table 13 shows the results with the domain-adapted tagger.",
        "We find dramatically improved performance for both abstracts and full texts, showing results competitive with the state of the art performance on GENETAG (Wilbur et al., 2007).",

        "The performance of the adapted tagger is notably high given the modest size of the in-domain data, perhaps again reflecting the consistent GGP naming conventions of the subdomain.",
        "We performed an event extraction experiment following the training and test split described in Section 3.3.",
        "Table 14 shows the results of the applied machine learning-based method contrasted with a co-occurrence baseline replacing the edge detection with a rule that extracts a Cause edge for all trigger-GGP combinations co-occurring within sentence scope.",
        "This approach achieves 100% recall as the test data was found to only contain events where the arguments are stated in the same sentence as the trigger.",
        "The results show that the machine learning approach achieves very high performance, matching the best results reported for any single event type in the BioNLP'09 shared task (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "The very high co-occurrence baseline result suggests that the high performance largely reflects the relative simplicity of the task.",
        "With respect to the baseline result, the machine-learning approach achieves a 21% relative reduction in error.",
        "While this experiment is limited in both scope and scale, it suggests that the event extraction approach can be beneficially applied to detect domain events represented by novel argument structures.",
        "As a demonstration of feasibility the result is encouraging for both the applicability of event extraction to this specific new domain and for the adaptability of the approach to new domains in general."

        "We have presented a study of the adaptation of an event extraction approach to the T4SS subdomain as a step toward the introduction of event extraction to the broader infectious diseases domain.",
        "We applied a previously introduced corpus of subdomain full texts annotated for mentions of bacteria and terms from the three top-level Gene Ontology subontologies as a reference defining domain information needs to study how these can be met through the application of events defined in the BioNLP'09 Shared Task on event extraction.",
        "Analysis indicated that with minor revision of the arguments, the Binding and Localization event types could account for the majority of both biological processes and molecular functions of interest.",
        "We further identified a category of \"high-level\" biological processes such as the virulence process typical of the subdomain, which necessitated extension of the considered event extraction model.",
        "Based on argument analysis, we proposed a representation for high-level processes in the event model that substitutes Cause for Theme as the core argument.",
        "We further produced annotation allowing an experiment on the extraction of the dominant category of virulence processes with gene/gene product (GGP) causes, annotating 518 GGP mentions and 100 associations between these and the processes.",
        "Experiments indicated that with annotated in-domain resources both the GGP entities and their associations with processes could be extracted with high reliability.",
        "In future work we will extend the model and annotation proposed in this paper to the broader infectious diseases domain, introducing annotated resources and extraction methods for advanced information access.",
        "All annotated resources introduced in this study are available from the GENIA project homepage."
