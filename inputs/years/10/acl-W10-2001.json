        "In this paper we investigate a new source of information for syntactic category acquisition: sentence type (question, declarative, imperative).",
        "Sentence type correlates strongly with intonation patterns in most languages; we hypothesize that these intonation patterns are a valuable signal to a language learner, indicating different syntactic patterns.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we train a Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (and variants) on child-directed speech.",
        "We first show that simply training a separate model for each sentence type decreases performance due to sparse data.",
        "As an alternative, we propose two new models based on the BHMM in which sentence type is an observed variable which influences either emission or transition probabilities.",
        "Both models outperform a standard BHMM on data from English, Cantonese, and Dutch.",
        "This suggests that sentence type information available from intonational cues may be helpful for syntactic acquisition cross-linguistically."

        "Children acquiring the syntax of their native language have access to a large amount of contextual information.",
        "Acquisition happens on the basis of speech, and the acoustic signal carries rich prosodic and intonational information that children can exploit.",
        "A key task is to separate the acoustic properties of a word from the underlying sentence intonation.",
        "Infants become attuned to the pragmatic and discourse functions of utterances as signalled by intonation extremely early; in this they are helped by the fact that intonation contours of child and infant directed speech are especially well differentiated between sentence types (Stern et al., 1982; Fer-nald, 1989).",
        "Children learn to use appropriate intonational melodies to communicate their own intentions at the one word stage, before overt syntax develops (Snow and Balog, 2002).",
        "It follows that sentence type information (whether a sentence is declarative, imperative, or a question), as signaled by intonation, is readily available to children by the time they start to acquire syntactic categories.",
        "Sentence type also has an effect on sentence structure in many languages (most notably on word order), so we hypothesise that sentence type is a useful cue for syntactic category learning.",
        "We test this hypothesis by incorporating sentence type information into an unsupervised model of part of speech tagging.",
        "We are unaware of previous work investigating the usefulness of this kind of information for syntactic category acquisition.",
        "In other domains, intonation has been used to identify sentence types as a means of improving speech recognition language models.",
        "Specifically, (Taylor et al., 1998) found that using intonation to recognize dialogue acts (which to a significant extent correspond to sentence types) and then using a specialized language model for each type of dialogue act led to a significant decrease in word error rate.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we first present the Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (BHMM; Goldwater and Griffiths (2007)) that is used as the baseline model of category acquisition, as well as our extensions to the model, which incorporate sentence type information.",
        "We then discuss the distinctions in sentence type that we used and our evaluation measures, and finally our experimental results.",
        "We perform experiments on corpora in four different languages: English, Spanish, Cantonese, and Dutch.",
        "Our results on Spanish show no difference between the baseline and the models incorporating sentence type, possibly due to the small size of the Spanish corpus.",
        "Results on all other corpora show a small improvement in performance when sentence type is included as a cue to the learner.",
        "These cross-linguistic results suggest that sentence type may be a useful source of information to children acquiring syntactic categories."

        "We use a Bayesian HMM (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) as our baseline model.",
        "Like a standard trigram HMM, the BHMM assumes that the probability of tag ti depends only on the previous two tags, and the probability of word wi depends only on ti.",
        "This can be written as where T(t,t ) are the parameters of the multinomial distribution over following tags given previous tags (t, t') and œ(t) are the parameters of the distribution over outputs given tag t. The BHMM assumes that these parameters are in turn drawn from symmetric Dirichlet priors with parameters a and ß, respectively:",
        "Using these Dirichlet priors allows the multinomial distributions to be integrated out, leading to the following predictive distributions:",
        "where t-i = t1... ti-1, w-i = W1... Wi-1, C(ti-2, ti-1, ti) and C(ti, wi) are the counts of the trigram (ti-2, ti-1, ti) and the tag-word pair (ti, wi) in t-i and w-i, T is the size of the tagset, and Wti is the number of word types emitted by ti.",
        "Based on these predictive distributions, (Goldwa-ter and Griffiths, 2007) develop a Gibbs sampler for the model, which samples from the posterior distribution over tag sequences t given word sequences w, i.e., P(t| w, a, ß) °c P(w| t, ß)P(t| a).",
        "This is done by using Equations 5 and 6 to iteratively resample each tag ti given the current values of all other tags.",
        "The results show that the BHMM with Gibbs sampling performs better than the standard HMM using expectation-maximization.",
        "In particular, the Dirichlet priors in the BHMM constrain the model towards sparse solutions, i.e., solutions in which each tag emits a relatively small number of words, and in which a tag transitions to few following tags.",
        "This type of model constraint allows the model to find solutions which correspond to true syntactic parts of speech (which follow such a sparse, Zipfian distribution), unlike the uniformly-sized clusters found by standard maximum likelihood estimation using EM.",
        "In the experiments reported below, we use the Gibbs sampler described by (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) for the BHMM, and modify it as necessary for our own extended models.",
        "We also follow (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) in using Metropolis-Hastings sampling for the hyperparameters, which are inferred automatically in all experiments.",
        "A separate ß parameter is inferred for each tag.",
        "We wish to add a sentence type feature to each timestep in the HMM, signalling the current sentence type.",
        "We treat sentence type (s) as an observed variable, on the assumption that it is observed via intonation or",
        "Figure 1: Graphical model representation of the BHMM-T, which includes sentence type as an observed variable on tag transitions (but not emissions).",
        "punctuation features (not part of our model), and these features are informative enough to reliably distinguish sentence types (as speech recognition tasks have found to be the case, see Section 1).",
        "In the BHMM, there are two obvious ways that sentence type could be incorporated into the generative model: either by affecting the transition probabilities or by affecting the emission probabilities.",
        "The first case can be modeled by adding si as a conditioning variable when choosing ti, replacing line 1 from the BHMM definition with the following:",
        "We will refer to this model, illustrated graphically in Figure 1, as the BHMM-T.",
        "It assumes that the distribution over ti depends not only on the previous two tags, but also on the sentence type, i.e., that different sentence types tend to have different sequences oftags.",
        "In contrast, we can add si as a conditioning variable for wi by replacing line 2 from the BHMM with",
        "This model, the BHMM-E, assumes that different sentence types tend to have different words emitted from the same tag.",
        "The predictive distributions for these models are given in Equations 9 (BHMM-T) and 10 (BHMM-E):",
        "Of course, we can also create a third new model, the BHMM-B, in which sentence type is used to condition both transition and emission probabilities.",
        "This model is equivalent to training a separate BHMM on each type of sentence (with shared hyperparameters).",
        "Note that introducing the extra conditioning variable in these models has the consequence of splitting the counts for transitions, emissions, or both.",
        "The split distributions will therefore be estimated using less data, which could actually degrade performance if sentence type is not a useful variable.",
        "Our prediction is that sentence type is more likely to be useful as a conditioning variable for transition probabilities (BHMM-T) than for emission probabilities (BHMM-E).",
        "For example, the auxiliary inversion in questions is likely to increase the probability of the AUX – PRO transition, compared to declaratives.",
        "Knowing that the sentence is a question may also affect emission probabilities, e.g., it might increase the probability the word you given a PRO and decrease the probability of I; one would certainly expect wh-words to have much higher probability in wh-questions than in declaratives.",
        "However, many other variables also affect the particular words used in a sentence (principally, the current semantic and pragmatic context).",
        "We expect that sentence type plays a relatively small role compared to these other factors.",
        "The ordering of tags within an utterance, on the other hand, is principally constrained by sentences type (especially in the short and grammatically simple utterances found in child-directed speech)."

        "We report three evaluation measures in our experiments, in order to avoid the weaknesses inherent in any single measure and in an effort to be comparable to previous work.",
        "Matched accuracy (MA), also called many-to-one accuracy, is a commonly used measure for evaluating unlabeled clusterings in part of speech tagging.",
        "Each unlabeled cluster is given the label of the gold category with which it shares the most members.",
        "Given these labels, accuracy can be measured as usual, as the percentage of tokens correctly labeled.",
        "Note that multiple clusters may have the same label if several clusters match the same gold standard category.",
        "This can lead to a degenerate solution if the model is allowed an unbounded number of categories, in which each word is in a separate cluster.",
        "In less extreme cases, it makes comparing MA across clustering results with different numbers of clusters difficult.",
        "Another serious issue with MA is the \"problem of matching\" (Meila, 2007): matched accuracy only evaluates whether or not the items in the cluster match the majority class label.",
        "The non-matching items within a cluster might all be from a second gold class, or they might be from many different classes.",
        "Intuitively, the former clustering should be evaluated as better, but matched accuracy is the same for both clusterings.",
        "Variation of Information (VI) (Meila, 2007) is a clustering evaluation measure that avoids the matching problem.",
        "It measures the amount of information lost and gained when moving between two clusterings.",
        "More precisely:",
        "A lower score implies closer clusterings, since each clustering has less information not shared with the other: two identical clusterings have a VI ofzero.",
        "However, VI's upper bound is dependent on the maximum number of clusters in C or K, making it difficult to compare clustering results with different numbers of clusters.",
        "As a third, and, in our view, most informative measure, we use V-meaSure (VM; Rosenberg and Hirschberg (2007)).",
