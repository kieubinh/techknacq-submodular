        "One of the central insights to emerge from experimental psycholinguistics over the last half century is that human language comprehension and production are probability-sensitive.",
        "During language comprehension, language users exploit probabilistic information in the linguistic signal to make inferences about the speaker's most likely intended message.",
        "In syntactic comprehension specifically, comprehenders exploit statistical information about lexical and syntactic cooccurrence statistics.",
        "For instance, (1) is temporarily ambiguous at the noun phrase the study, since the NP can be parsed as either the direct object (DO) of the verb acknowledge or as the subject NP of a sentence complement (SC).",
        "(1) The reviewers acknowledged the study...",
        "• DO: ... in the journal.",
        "• SC: ... had been revolutionary.",
        "The ambiguity in the SC continuation is resolved at had been, which rules out the direct object interpretation of the study.",
        "Reading times at had been – the so-called point of disambiguation – are correlated with a variety of lexical-syntactic probabilities.",
        "For instance, if the probability of a SC is low, given the verb, subjects are garden-pathed and will display longer reading times at had been.",
        "Conversely, if the probability of a SC is high, the material at the point of disambiguation is relatively unsurprising (i.e. conveys less information), and reading times will be short.",
        "Readers are also sensitive to the probability of the post-verbal NP occurring as the direct object of the verb.",
        "This is often discussed in terms of plausibility – in (1), the study is a plausible direct object of acknowledge (relative to, say, the window), which will also contribute to longer reading times in the event of a SC continuation (Garnsey et al., 1997).",
        "Thus, humans make pervasive use of probabilistic cues in the linguistic signal.",
        "A question that has received very little attention, however, is how language users maintain or update their representations of the probability distributions relevant to language use, given new evidence – a phenomenon we will call adaptation.",
        "That is, while we know that language users have access to linguistic statistics, we know little about the dynamics of this knowledge in language users: is the probabilistic information relevant to comprehension derived from experience during a critical period of language acquisition, or do comprehenders update their knowledge on the basis of experience throughout adulthood?",
        "A priori, both scenarios seem plausible – given the sheer number of cues relevant to comprehension, it would be advantageous to limit the resources devoted to acquiring this knowledge; on the other hand, any learner's linguistic experience is bound to be incomplete, so the ability to adapt to novel distributional patterns in the linguistic input may prove to be equally useful.",
        "The goal of this paper is to explore this issue and to take an initial step toward providing a computational framework for characterizing adaptation in language processing.",
        "Both over time and across situations, humans are exposed to linguistic evidence that, in principle, ought to lead to shifts in our representations of the relevant probability distributions.",
        "An efficient language processing system is expected to take new evidence into account so that behavior (decisions during online production, predictions about upcoming words, etc.)",
        "will be guided by accurate estimates of these probability distributions.",
        "At least at the level of phonetic perception and production, there is evidence that language users quickly adapt to the statistical characteristics of the ambient language.",
        "For instance, over the course of a single interaction, the speech of two interlocutors becomes more acoustically similar, a phenomenon known as spontaneous phonetic imitation (Goldinger, 1998).",
        "Perhaps even more strikingly, Clayards et al.",
        "(2008) demonstrated that, given a relatively small number oftokens, compre-henders shift the degree to which they rely on an acoustic cue as the variance of that cue changes, reflecting adaptation to the distributions of probabilistic cues in speech perception.",
        "At the level of syntactic processing, belief update/adaptation has only recently been addressed (Wells et al., 2009; Snider and Jaeger, in prep).",
        "In this study, we examine adaptation at the level of syntactic comprehension.",
        "We provide a computational model of short-to medium-term adaptation to local shifts in the statistics of the input.",
        "While the Bayesian model presented can account for the behavioral data, the quality of the model depends on how control variables are treated.",
        "We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of this result.",
        "Section 2 describes the behavioral experiment, a slight modification of the classic reading experiment reported in Garnsey et al.",
        "(1997).",
        "The study reported in section 3 replicates the basic findings of (Garnsey et al., 1997).",
        "In sections 4 and 5 we outline a Bayesian model of syntactic adaptation, in which distributions over syntactic structures are updated at each trial based on the evidence in that trial, and discuss the relationship between the model results and control variables.",

        "As a result, the posterior probability varies from trial to trial, not only because the verb used in each stimulus is different, but also because the belief about the probability of a sentence complement is being updated based on the evidence in each trial.",
        "We employ the beta-binomial model to simulate this updating process, as described next.",
        "We adopt an online training paradigm involving an ideal observer learning from observations.",
        "After observing a sentence containing a DO/SC verb, we predict that subjects will update both the likelihood p(vi\\SC) for that verb, as well as the probability p(SC).",
        "Because each verb occurs only once for a given subject, the effect of updating the first quantity is impossible to measure in the current experimental paradigm.",
        "We therefore focus on modeling how subjects update their belief of p(SC) from trial to trial.",
        "We make the simplifying assumption that the only possible argument that DO/SC verbs can take is either a direct object or a sentence complement clause.",
        "Further, subjects are assumed to have an initial belief about how probable a sentence complement is, on a scale of 0 to 1.",
        "Let 6 denote this probability estimate, and p(6) the strength of this estimate.",
        "From the perspective of an ideal observer, p(6) will go up for 6 > 0.5 when a DO/SC verb is presented with a sentence complement as its argument.",
        "This framework assumes that subjects do not compute 6 by merely relying on frequency (otherwise, 6 will be simply the ratio between SC and DO structures in a block of trials), but they have a distribution P(6), where each possible estimate of 6 is associated with a probability indicating the confidence on that estimate.",
        "In order to make our results comparable to existing models, however, we use the expected value of P(6) in each iteration of training as point estimates.",

        "Because none of the filler items included DO/SC verbs, we assume that filler trials have no effect on subjects' estimates of P(6).",
        "Since all stimuli in our experiment have the SC structure, the general expectation is the distribution P (6) will shift towards the end where 6 = 1.",
        "Our belief update model tries to capture the shape of this shift during the course of the experiment.",
        "Using Bayesian inference, we can describe the updating process as the following, where 6i represents a particular belief of the value 6.",
        "This posterior probability is hypothesized to reflect how likely a subject would consider the probability of SC to be 6i after being exposed to one experimental item.",
        "We discretized 6 to 100 evenly spaced 6i values, ranging from 0 to 1.",
        "Thus, the denominator can be calculated by marginalizing over the 100 6i values.",
        "The two terms in the numerator in Equation (2) are estimated in the following manner.",
        "Likelihood function p(obs.\\6 = 6i) is modeled by a binomial distribution, where the parameters are 6i (the probability of observing a SC clause) and 1 – 6i (the probability of observing a direct object), and where the outcome is the experimental item presented to the subject.",
        "Therefore:",
        "In the current experiment, ndo is always 0 since all stimuli contain the SC argument.",

        "In the context of our research, this model assumes that subjects' beliefs about p(SC) and p(DO) are based on a – 1 observations of SC and – 1 observations of DO prior to the experiment.",
        "The values of the parameters of the beta distribution were obtained by searching through the parameter space with an objective function based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score of a regression model containing the log of the posterior computed using the updated prior p(SC), complementizer presence, and the two-way interaction.",
        "The BIC (Schwarz, 1978) is a measure of model quality that weighs the models empirical coverage against its parsimony (BIC = 2ln(L) + k * ln(n), where k is the number of parameters in the model, n the number of data points, and L is the models data likelihood).",
        "Smaller BIC indicate better models.",

        "We can visualize this relationship in Figure 2, which shows the values given by the model of p(SC\\vi) for four particular different verbs, depending on the point in the experiment at which the verb is seen.",
