        "Grammatical accounts of gradience rely on intrinsic discourse differences between phrases that allow for SUVs and those that do not.",
        "In this work, which-N phrases are examples of the former, and so-called bare wh-phrases (including who and what) the latter.",
        "Rizzi (1990) incorporates ideas from Pesetsky's D-Linking, or discourse-linking, hypothesis (1987) into a grammatical account of SUV gradience, Relativized Minimality.",
        "He argues that referential phrases like which-N refer to a pre-established set in the discourse and are not subject to the same constraints on attachment as non-referential phrases, like what.",
        "Which book delimits a set of possible discourse entities, books, and is more restrictive than what, which could instead delimit sets of books, cats, or abstract entities.",
        "The Relativized Minimality hypothesis accounts for SUV gradience on the basis of this categorical separation on wh-phrases in the discourse.",
        "Many grammatical accounts, particularly those that are grounded in cognitive factors, incorporate some element of processing or memory in their explanations (Phillips, Submitted).",
        "Reductionist accounts are different; their proponents do not believe that superiority requires a grammatical explanation.",
        "Rather, SUVs that appear ungrammatical, such as Example (1), are the result of severe processing difficulty alone.",
        "These accounts attribute processing difficulty to memory: severe memory resource limitations account for ungrammatical sentences in SUVs, and increased memory resources allow for more acceptable sentences.",
        "This is the central idea behind Hofmeister's Memory Facilitation Hypothesis (2007):",
        "Memory Facilitation Hypothesis",
        "Linguistic elements that encode more information (lexical, semantic, syntactic, etc.)",
        "facilitate their own subsequent retrieval from memory (Hofmeister, 2007, p.4).",
        "This memory explanation is central to activation-based memory hypotheses previously proposed in the psycholinguistic literature, such as CC-READER (Just and Carpenter, 1992), ACT-R (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), and 4CAPS (Just and Varma, 2007).",
        "This work considers activation, and manipulates memory resources by varying the number of analyses the parser considers at each parse step.",

        "They are sensitive to the memory resources available during syntactic parsing, but account for memory differently.",
        "Below I describe these variations.",
        "Distance, as measured by the number of words between, for example, a wh-word and its verb, has been argued to affect sentence comprehension (Wanner and Maratsos, 1978; Rambow and Joshi, 1994; Gibson, 1998).",
        "Experimental evidence supports this claim, but there exist a number of anomalous results that resist explanation in terms of distance alone (Gibson, 1998; Hawkins, 1999; Gibson, 2000).",

        "However, it is possible that SUV gradience could be affected by this simple metric.",
        "The Dependency Locality Theory (DLT) (Gibson, 2000) is a more linguistically-informed measure of distance.",
        "The DLT argues that an accurate model of sentence processing difficulty is sensitive to the number and discourse-status (given or new) of nominal intervenors that occur across a particular distance.",
        "The DLT's sensitivity to discourse-newness integrates aspects of D-linking: which book, for example, requires that books already be a part of the discourse, though what does not (Gun-del et al., 1993; Warren and Gibson, 2002).",
        "The DLT has been demonstrated to model difficulty in ways that simple distance alone can not (Grodner and Gibson, 2005).",
        "This study also considers a stronger version of the DLT, Intervenors.",
        "Intervenors considers both the number and part-of-speech (POS) of nominal intervenors between a wh-word and its head.",

        "Distance can also be measured in terms of the parser's internal resources.",
        "The computational model described here incorporates a stack memory.",
        "Although stacks are not accurate models of human memory (McElree, 2000), this architectural property may provide insight into how memory affects SUV gradience.",
        "Sentence processing difficulty has been attributed to the amount of time it takes to retrieve a word from memory.",
        "Lewis & Vasishth (2005) find support for this argument by applying equations from a general cognitive model, ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) (Anderson, 2005), to a sentence processsing model.",
        "Their calculation of retrieval time, henceforth retrieval, is sensitive to a word's activation and its similarity-based interference with other words in memory (Gordon et al., 2002; Van Dyke and McElree, 2006).",

        "The results also suggest that it is the type, and not just the number of intervenors as suggested by the DLT, that is important.",
        "Further, the Intervenors feature does not pattern with the DLT hypothesis.",
        "DLT assumes that increasing the number of nominal inter-venors causes sentence processing difficulty (Gibson, 2000; Warren and Gibson, 2002).",
        "Here, the number of intervenors is increased, but sentence processing is relatively easier.",
        "This effect is explained by the intrinsic difference between the DLT and Intervenors features: Intervenors provides more information to the parser, in the form of the POS of all intervenors.",
        "This indicates that certain intervenors help, rather than hinder, the retrieval process.",
        "The negative results demonstrate that other representations of memory do not model SUV gra-dience.",
        "If we consider this along the continuum from (4), those features that take into account less information than Intervenors (Distance and D LT) are too restrictive.",
        "Of those features that are more complex than Intervenors, many are too permissive, or permit the wrong attachments.",
        "This pattern is also visible in the StackNext features: Stack 1Next is too restrictive, while Stack3Next too permissive.",
        "Stack2Next unfortunately permits the wrong attachments.",
        "This pattern in the continuum indicates that an intermediate amount of memory information is required to adequately model these results.",
        "Interference, which also considers competitors in the intervening string, would seem likely to pattern with the Intervenors results.",
        "In fact, similarity-based interference and retrieval have previously been argued to account for these gradience patterns (Hofmeister et al., Submitted).",
        "However, the only words considered as competitors with which for both features in this model are other wh-words.",
        "For the which.which condition, for example, Interference would only consider the second which a competitor.",
        "In-tervenors, on the other hand, considers book, which, and student as possible intervenors.",
        "This suggests that the INTERFERENCE measure in retrieval would be more accurate if it considered more competitors, a consideration for future work.",

        "Hofmeister (2007) suggests that it is not a single memory factor, but a number of factors, that contribute to SUV gradience.",
        "Some features, such as INTERFERENCE or DLT, may be more accurate when they are considered in addition to other features.",

        "Although this may indicate a problem with the feature itself, it is also possible that a more gradient evaluation technique is needed.",
        "As suggested in Section 4, determining accuracy on the basis of attachment alone may be insufficient to correctly model the full experimental evidence in terms of reading times.",
        "This is an empirical question that can be tested with this computational model.",
        "In future work, I consider the role ofparser difficulty, via linking hypotheses such as surprisal, in modeling the experimental data.",
        "The interpretation of Relativized Minimality used here as a grammatical constraint could not derive the experimental results.",
        "LeftArc is not preferred when the parser is in a SUV context (RELMlN=Yes)-an expected result as attachments should not occur in SUV contexts.",
        "However, the which.which, which.bare, and the bare.which conditions are not violations because they include non-referential NPs.",
        "Even with the RELMIN=NO feature, the parser does not select LeftArc attachments, suggesting grammatical gradience is not useful in modeling the SUV gradience results.",
        "This model does not attempt to capture experimental evidence that SUVs and similar phenomena, like islands, are better modeled by grammatical constraints (Phillips, 2006; Sprouse et al., Submitted).",
        "Not only does this work only focus on one kind of grammatical constraint for SUV gradience, but the results reported here do not reveal whether the intervention effect itself is better modeled by grammatical or reductionist factors.",
        "Rather, the results demonstrate that the gradience in the intervention effect is better modeled by memory than by the gradient grammatical feature.",
        "Future work with this computational model will allow for an examination of those memory factors and grammatical factors most useful in exploring the source of the intervention effect itself."
