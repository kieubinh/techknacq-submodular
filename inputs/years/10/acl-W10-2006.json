        "In this paper, we present a study on the effect of context relevance decay on the entropy of linguistic signals in natural discourses.",
        "Context relevance decay refers to the phenomenon that contextual cues that are distant from an upcoming event (e.g. production of a new linguistic signal) are less likely to be relevant to the event, as discourse contents that are close to one another are likely to be semantically related.",
        "One can also view the words and sentences in a discourse as time steps, where distant context becomes less relevant simply due to normal forgetting over time (e.g. activation decay in memory).",
        "The present study investigates how this decaying property of discourse context might affect the development of entropy of linguistic signals in discourses.",
        "We first introduce the background on efficient language production and then propose our hypothesis.",
        "The metaphor \"communication channel\", borrowed from Shannon's information theory (Shannon, 1948), can be conceived of as an abstract entity that defines the constraints of language communication (e.g. ambient noise, distortions in articulation).",
        "For error free communication to occur, the ensemble of messages that a speaker may utter must be encoded in a system of signals whose entropy is under the capacity of the communication channel.",
        "Entropy of these signals, in this context, correlates with the average number of upcoming messages that the speaker can choose from for a particular signal (e.g. a word to be spoken) given preceding discourse context.",
        "In other words, if the average number of choices given any linguistic signal exceeds the channel capacity, it cannot be guaranteed that the receiver can correctly infer the originally intended message.",
        "Such transmission errors will reduce the efficiency of language communication.",
        "Keeping the entropy of linguistic signals below the channel capacity alone is not efficient, for one can devise a code where each signal corresponds to a distinct message.",
        "With a unique choice per signal, this encoding achieves an entropy of zero at the cost of requiring a lookup table that is too large to be possible (cf. Zipf (1935), who makes a similar argument for meaning and form).",
        "In fact, the most efficient code requires language users to encode messages into signals of the entropy bounded by the capacity of the channel.",
        "One implication of this efficient encoding is that over time, the entropy of the signals is constant.",
        "One of the first studies to investigate such constancy is Genzel and Charniak (2002), in which the authors proposed the Constant Entropy Rate (CER) hypothesis: in written text, the entropy per signal symbol is constant across sentence positions in discourses.",
        "That is, if we view sentence positions as a measure of time steps, then the entropy per word at each step should be the same in order to achieve efficient communication (word is selected as the unit of signal, although it does not have to be case; cf. Qian and Jaeger (2009)).",
        "The difficulty in testing this direct prediction is computationally specifying the code used by human speakers to obtain a context-sensitive estimate of the entropy per word.",
        "An ngram model overestimates the entropy of upcoming messages by relying on only the preceding n-1 words within a sentence, while in reality the upcoming message is also constrained by extra-sentential context that accumulates within a discourse.",
        "The more extra-sentential context that the ngram model ignores, the higher estimate for entropy will be.",
        "Hence, the CER hypothesis indirectly predicts that the entropy of signals, as estimated by ngrams, will increase across sentence positions.",
        "While some studies have found the predicted positive correlation between sentence position and the per-word entropy of signals estimated by ngrams, most of them assumed the correlation to be linear (Genzel and Charniak, 2002; Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Keller, 2004; Piantadosi and Gibson, 2008).",
        "However, in previous work, we found that a log-linear regression model was a better fit for empirical data than a simple linear regression model based on data of 12 languages (Qian and Jaeger, under review).",
        "Why this would be case remained a puzzle.",
        "Our research question is closely related to this indirect prediction of the Constant Entropy Rate hypothesis.",
        "Intuitively, the number of possible messages that a speaker can choose from for an upcoming signal in a discourse is often restricted by the presence of discourse context.",
        "Contextual cues in the preceding discourse can make the upcoming content more predictable and thus effectively reduces signal entropy.",
        "As previously mentioned, however, different contextual cues, depending on how long ago they were provided, have various degrees of effectiveness in reducing signal entropy.",
        "Thus we ask the question whether the decay of context relevance could explain the sublinear relation between entropy and discourse progress that has been observed in previous studies.",
        "We formally derive two nonlinear models for testing our Relevance Decay Hypothesis (introduced next).",
        "In addition to the constant entropy assumption in CER, our model assumed that the relevance of early sentences in the discourse systematically decays as a function of discourse progress.",
        "Our models provide the best fit to the distribution of entropy of signals, suggesting the availability of discourse context can affect the planning of the rest of a discourse.",
        "We hypothesize the sublinear relation between the entropy of signals, when estimated out of discourse context (hereafter, out-of-context entropy of signals) using an ngram model, and sentence position (Piantadosi and Gibson, 2008; Qian and Jaeger, under review) is due to the role of discourse context (hereafter, context).",
        "Consider the following example.",
        "Assume that context at the kth sentence position comes from the 1 ...k – 1 sentences in the past.",
        "If k is large enough, context from the early sentences 1... i (i <C k) is essentially no longer relevant.",
        "Rather, the nearby k – i sentences are contributing most of the discourse context.",
        "As a result, the constraint on the entropy of signals at sentence position k is mostly due to the nearby window of k – i sentences.",
        "Then if we look ahead to the (k + 1)th sentence position and follow the same steps of reasoning, context at that point also mostly comes from the nearby window of k – i sentences (i.e. (k + 1) – (i + 1) = k – i).",
        "Hence, for later sentence positions, the difference in available context is minimal.",
        "Consequently, their out-of-context entropy of signals increases at a very small rate.",
        "On the other hand, when k is fairly small, to the extent that the k – i window covers the entire preceding discourse, all of the 1 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "k – 1 sentences are contributing relevant context.",
        "As k increases, the number of preceding sentences increases, which results in a more significant change in relevant context, but the relevance of each individual sentence decreases with its distance to k, which results in a sublinear pattern of relevant context with respect to sentence position overall.",
        "As we will show, the relation of out-of-context entropy of signals to sentence position follows from the relation of relevant context to sentence position, exhibiting a sublinear form as well.",
        "The problem of interest here is to specify how quickly the relevance of a preceding sentence decays as a function of its distance to a target sentence position k. We experimented with two forms of decay functions - power law decay and exponential decay.",
        "It has been established that many types of human behaviors can be well described by the power function (Wixted and Ebbesen, 1991), so we mainly focus on building a model under the",
        "Table 1: Number of words and sentences in the training and test data for each of the twelve languages.",
        "The last column gives the number of sentences at each sentence position (which is identical to the number of documents contained in the corpora).",
        "power law, and examine if the model under the exponential law yields any difference.",
        "Under the assumptions of true entropy rate is constant across sentences, we predict that our models will better characterize the changes in estimated entropy of signals than general regression models that are blind to the role of context."

        "Therefore, the variation in estimates of A seems reasonable.",
        "Correlation between r0 and A. Interestingly, r0 and A are highly correlated (r = 0.39, p < 0.05 in the power model, Figure 5; r = 0.47, p < 0.01 in the exponential model, Figure 6): a high relevance decay rate tends to be coupled with high within-context entropy of signals.",
        "This unanticipated observation is in fact compatible with the account of efficient language production: a high within-context entropy of signals indicates the base relevance of a contextual cue (i.e. r0) is high.",
        "It is then useful for its relevance to decay more quickly to allow the speaker to integrate context from other cues.",
        "Otherwise, the total amount of relevant context may presumably overload working memory.",
        "However, our current results come from only cross-linguistic samples.",
        "Cross-validation in within-language samples is needed for confirming this hypothesis.",
        "Having obtained the estimates for r0 and A, we are now in a position to examine how out-of-context entropy of signals increases as a function of sentence positions, given the estimates of these two parameters.",
        "As shown in Figure 7, the predictions from both models are qualitative similar except that 1) when the decay rate in the power-law model is low, out-of-context entropy of signals converges more slowly than in the exponential model (Figure 7, right panel); 2) when the decay rate in the power model is high, it almost converges as quickly as the exponential model, and only minor differences exist in their predictions (Figure 7, left panel).",
