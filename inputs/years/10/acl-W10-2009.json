        "Language comprehension is incremental in that meaning is continuously assigned to utterances as they are encountered word-by-word (Altmann and Kamide, 1999).",
        "Not all words, however, are equally easy to process.",
        "A word's processing difficulty is affected by, for instance, its frequency or its effect on the syntactic and semantic interpretation of a sentence.",
        "A recent theory of sentence processing, surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), combines several of these aspects into one single concept, namely the surprisal of a word.",
        "A word's surprisal is proportional to its expectancy, i.e., the extent to which that word is expected (or predicted).",
        "The processing difficulty a word causes during comprehension is argued to be related linearly to its surprisal; the higher the surprisal value of a word, the more difficult it is to process.",
        "In this paper we investigate whether surprisal theory can account for the processing difficulty involved in sentences containing the noun phrase (NP) versus sentence (S) coordination ambiguity.",
        "The sentences in (1), from a self-paced reading experiment by Frazier (1987), exemplify this ambiguity:",
        "(1) a. Pietkuste Marie en / haar zusje / ook Piet kissed Marie and / her sister / too [1,222ms; NP-coordination]",
        "b. Piet kuste Marie en / haar zusje / lachte Piet kissed Marie and / her sister / laughed [1,596ms; S-coordination]",
        "Both sentences are temporarily ambiguous in the boldface region.",
        "Sentence (1-a) is disambiguated as an NP-coordination by the sentence-final adverb ook.",
        "Sentence (1-b), on the other hand, is disambiguated as an S-coordination by the sentence-final verb lachte.",
        "Frazier found that the verb lachte in sentence (1-b) takes longer to process (1,596 ms) than the adverb ook (1,222 ms) in (1-a).",
        "Frazier (1987) explained these findings by assuming that the human language processor adheres to the so-called minimal attachment principle.",
        "According to this principle, the sentence processor projects the simplest syntactic structure which is compatible with the material read at any point in time.",
        "NP-coordination is syntactically simpler than S-coordination in that it requires less phrasal nodes to be projected.",
        "Hence, the processor is biased towards NP-over S-coor-dination.",
        "Processing costs are incurred when this initial preference has to be revised in the disambiguating region, as in sentence (1-b), resulting in longer reading times.",
        "Hoeks et al.",
        "(2006) have shown that the NP-coordination preference can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated, when poor thematic fit between the verb and a potential object make an NP-coordination less likely (e.g., Jasper sanded the board and the carpenter laughed).",
        "We argue here that this residual preference for NP-coordination can be explained in terms of syntactic and lexical expectation within the framework of surprisal theory.",
        "In contrast to the minimal attachment principle, surprisal theory does not postulate specific kinds of syntactic representations or rely on a metric of syntactic complexity to predict processing behavior.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2 below, we briefly sketch basic surprisal theory.",

        "As was mentioned in the introduction, language processing is highly incremental, and proceeds on a more or less word-by-word basis.",
        "This suggests that a person's difficulty with processing a sentence can be modeled on a word level as proposed by Attneave (1959).",
        "Furthermore, it has recently been suggested that one of the characteristics of the comprehension system that makes it so fast, is its ability to anticipate what a speaker will say next.",
        "In other words, the language comprehension system works predictively (Otten et al., 2007; van Berkum et al., 2005).",
        "Surprisal theory is a model of differential processing difficulty which accommodates both these properties of the comprehension system, incremental processing and word prediction (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008).",
        "In this theory, the processing difficulty of a sentence is a function of word processing difficulty.",
        "A word's difficulty is inversely proportional to its expectancy, i.e., the extent to which the word was expected or predicted in the context in which it occurred.",
        "The lower a word's expectancy, the more difficult it is to process.",
        "A word's surprisal is linearly related to its difficulty.",
        "Consequently, words with lower conditional probabilities (expectancy) lead to higher surprisal than words with higher conditional probabilities.",
        "Surprisal theory is, to some extent, independent of the language model that generates conditional word probabilities.",
        "Different models can be used to estimate these probabilities.",
        "For all such models, however, a clear distinction can be made between lexicalized and unlexicalized sur-prisal.",
        "In lexicalized surprisal, the input to the language model is a sequence of words (i.e., a sentence).",
        "In unlexicalized surprisal, the input is a sequence of word categories (i.e., part-of-speech tags).",
        "While previous studies have used unlexical-ized surprisal to predict reading times, evidence for lexicalized surprisal is rather sparse.",
        "Smith and Levy (2008) investigated the relation between lexicalized surprisal and reading time data for naturalistic texts.",
        "Using a trigram language model, they showed that there was a linear relationship between the two measures.",
        "Demberg and Keller (2008) examined whether this relation extended beyond transitional probabilities and found no significant effects.",
        "This state of affairs is somewhat unfortunate for surprisal theory since input to the human language processor consists of sequences of words, not part-of-speech tags.",
        "In our study we therefore used lexicalized surprisal to investigate whether it can account for reading time data from the NP-/S-coordination ambiguity in Dutch.",
        "Lex-icalized surprisal furthermore allows us to study how syntactic expectations might be modulated or even reversed by lexical expectations in temporarily ambiguous sentences.",
        "Both Hale (2001) and Levy (2008) used a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) as a language model in their implementations of surprisal theory.",
        "A PCFG consists of a set of rewrite rules which are assigned some probability (Charniak,",
        "In this toy grammar, for instance, a noun phrase placeholder can be rewritten to a determiner followed by a noun symbol with probability 0.5.",
        "From such a PCFG, the probability of a sentence can be estimated as the product of the probabilities of all the rules used to derive the sentence.",
        "If a sentence has multiple derivations, its probability is the sum of the probabilities for each derivation.",
        "For our purpose, we also needed to obtain the probability of partial sentences, called prefix probabilities.",
        "The prefix probability P(wi...wi) of a partial sentence w\\...wi is the sum of the probabilities of all sentences generated by the PCFG which share the initial segment wi...wi.",
        "Hale (2001) pointed out that the ratio of the prefix probabilities P (wi... wi ) and P (wi... wi_i ) equals precisely the conditional probability of word wi.",
        "Given a",
        "PCFG, the difficulty of word wi can therefore be defined as:",
        "Am u ( ) ; r P (wi ...wi) difficulty(wi) oc – log^ – -- .",
        "Surprisal theory requires a probabilistic language model that generates some form of word expectancy.",
        "The theory itself, however, is largely neutral with respect to which model is employed.",
        "Models other than PCFGs can be used to estimate surprisal.",
        "Nederhof et al.",
        "(1998), for instance, show that prefix probabilities, and therefore surprisal, can be estimated from Tree Adjoining Grammars.",
        "This approach was taken in Dem-berg and Keller (2009).",
        "Other approaches have used trigram models (Smith and Levy, 2008), Simple Recurrent Networks of the Elman type (Frank, 2009), Markov models and Echo-state Networks (Frank and Bod, 2010).",
        "This illustrates that surprisal theory is not committed to specific claims about the structural representations that language takes in the human mind.",
        "It rather functions as a \"causal bottleneck\" between the representations of a language model, and expectation-based comprehension difficulty (Levy, 2008).",
        "In other words, comprehension difficulty does not critically depend on the structural representations postulated by the language model which is harnessed to generate word expectancy.",
        "The use of PCFGs raises some important questions on parallelism in language processing.",
        "A prefix probability can be interpreted as a probability distribution over all analyses compatible with a partial sentence.",
        "Since partial sentences can sometimes be completed in an indefinite number of ways, it seems both practically and psychologically implausible to implement this distribution as an enumeration over complete structures.",
        "Instead, prefix probabilities should be estimated as a by-product of incremental processing, as in Stolcke's (1995) parser (see section 3.2).",
        "This approach, however, still leaves open how many analyses are considered in parallel; does the human sentence processor employ full or limited parallelism?",
        "Jurafsky (1996) showed that full parallelism becomes more and more unmanageable when the amount of information used for disambiguation increases.",
        "Levy, on the other hand, argued that studies of probabilistic parsing reveal that typically a small number of analyses are assigned the majority of probability mass (Roark, 2001).",
        "Thus, even when assuming full parallelism, only a small number of 'relevant' analyses would be considered in parallel."

        "Individual NP-coordination rules might have lower probability than individual S-coordination rules, so the overall preference for NP-coordination in the grammar therefore does not have to be reflected in every test item.",

        "If the sentence was disambiguated as an NP-coordination by a highly improbable lexical item, and disambiguated as an S-coordination by a highly probable lexical item, surprisal for the NP-coordination might turn out higher than sur-prisal for the S-coordination.",
        "In this way, lexical factors could override the NP-coordination bias in the grammar, leading to a preference for S-coordi-nation in some items.",

        "Consequently, the model's preference for one structural type can vary across sentence tokens and even be reversed on occasion.",
        "We argued that our grammar showed an overall preference for NP-coordination but this preference was not necessarily reflected on each and every rule that dealt with coordinations.",
        "Some S-coordination rules could have higher probability than NP-coordination rules.",
        "In addition, syntactic expectations were modified by lexical expectations.",
        "Thus, even when NP-coordination was structurally favored over S-coordination, highly unexpected lexical material could lead to more processing difficulty for NP-coordination than for",
        "S-coordination.",
        "Surprisal theory allows us to build a formally precise computational model of reading time data which generates testable, quantitative predictions about the differential processing of individual test items.",
        "These predictions (Figure 5) indicate that mean reading times for a set of NP-/S-coordination sentences may not be adequate to tap the origin of differential processing difficulty.",
        "Our results are consistent with the findings of Hoeks et al.",
        "(2002), who also found evidence for an NP-coordination preference in a self-paced reading experiment as well as in an eye-tracking experiment.",
        "They suggested that NP-coordination might be easier to process because it has a simpler topic structure than S-coordination.",
        "The former only has one topic, whereas the latter has two.",
        "Hoeks et al.",
        "(2002) argue that having more than one topic is unexpected.",
        "Sentences with more than one topic will therefore cause more processing difficulty.",
        "This preference for simple topic-structure that was evident in language comprehension may also be present in language production, and hence in language corpora.",
        "Thus, it may very well be the case that the NP-coordination preference that was present in our training corpus may have had a pragmatic origin related to topic-structure.",
        "The outcome of our surprisal model is also compatible with the results of Hoeks et al.",
        "(2006) who found that thematic information can strongly reduce but not completely eliminate the NP-coordi-nation preference.",
        "Surprisal theory is explicitly built on the assumption that multiple sources of information can interact in parallel at any point in time during sentence processing.",
        "Accordingly, we suggest here that the residual preference for NP-coordination found in the study of Hoeks et al.",
        "(2006) might be explained in terms of syntactic and lexical expectation.",
        "And finally, our approach is consistent with a large body of evidence indicating that language comprehension is incremental and makes use of expectation-driven word prediction (Pickering and Garrod, 2007).",
        "It remains to be tested whether our model can explain behavioral data from the processing of ambiguities other than the Dutch NP-versus S-coordination case."
