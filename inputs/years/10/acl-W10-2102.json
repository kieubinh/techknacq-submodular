        "With the exponential increase in web sites and documents, the amount of information is no longer a main concern for automatic knowledge acquisition.",
        "This trend raises, however, at least two new issues.",
        "The first is how to locate the information which exactly meets our needs among the vast web content.",
        "Efforts to address this issue can be exemplified by advanced research in information retrieval, information extraction, etc.",
        "The second is how to judge the validity of the acquired information, that is, the trustworthiness of information.",
        "This issue has attracted considerable interest in some related research areas recently.",
        "Taking the specific information retrieval task, question answering (QA) as an example, a QA system attempts to retrieve the most appropriate answers to questions from web resources.",
        "To determine the trustworthiness of the extracted candidate answers, a common approach is to exploit the cooccurrence frequency of questions and candidate answers.",
        "That is, if a candidate answer co-occurs more frequently with the question than other candidates, the QA system may judge it as the best answer (Magnini, 2002).",
        "This approach presupposes and relies crucially on information redundancy.",
        "Although this heuristic method is simple and straightforward, it is not applicable to all cases.",
        "For the applications which don't involve much information redundancy, the heuristic could cease to be effective.",
        "The task of collaborative question answering (CQA) which we will address in this paper is just one of such examples.",
        "For a user posted question, there are usually only few answers provided.",
        "So, the heuristic is not useful in providing the best answer.",
        "In addition, since the spread of unsubstantiated rumors on the Internet is so pervasive, the high-frequency information on the Web sometimes may mislead the judgment of trustworthiness.",
        "In terms of the above consideration, it is essential to look for other approaches which allow directly modeling of the trustworthiness of a text.",
        "Given that non-textual features (such as user's Web behavior) used in text trustworthiness detection are often manipulated by information providers, as well as no directly related textual features for the task has been proposed up to date, we need a more felicitous model for detecting the trustworthiness of statements.",
        "Noting that evidentiality is often linguistically encoded and hence provides inherent information on trustworthiness for a statement, we propose to incorporate the linguistic model of evidentiality in our study.",
        "Specifically, we incorporate evi-dentiality into a machine learning based text classification framework, and attempt to verify the validity of evidentiality in trustworthiness prediction of text information in the context of collaborative question answering.",
        "The experimental results show that evidentials are important clues in predicting the trustworthiness of text.",
        "Since none of the task-specific heuristics has been incorporated, the current approach could also be easily adapted to fit other natural language processing applications.",
        "The paper proceeds as follows.",
        "In section 2 we discuss related work on text trustworthiness detection.",
        "The section is divided into two parts: the current methodology and the textual features for analysis in the task.",
        "Section 3 introduces the linguistic researches on evidentiality and our taxonomy of evidentials based on the trustworthiness indication.",
        "Section 4 presents the experiment settings and results.",
        "Finally, in section 5 we discuss the experiment results and conclude the current research."

        "The research of text trustworthiness is very helpful for many other natural language processing applications.",
        "For example, in their research on question answering, Banerjee and Han (2009) modulate answer grade by using a weighted combination of the original score and answer credibility evaluation.",
        "Also, Weerkamp and Ri-jke (2008) incorporate textual credibility indicators in the retrieval process to improve topical blog posts retrieval.",
        "Gyongyi et al. (2004) propose a TrustRank algorithm for semi-automatically separating reputable, good Web pages from spams.",
        "In past research, the judgment for the trustworthiness or credibility of a given text content is usually tackled from two aspects: entity oriented and content oriented (Rubin and Liddy, 2005).",
        "The former approach takes into consideration the information providers' individual profiles, such as their identity, reputation, authority and past web behavior; whereas the latter approach considers the actual content of texts.",
        "Metzger (2007) reviews several cognitive models of credibility assessment and points out that credibility is a multifaceted concept with two primary dimensions: expertise and trustworthiness.",
        "Following Matzger' s framework, Rubin and Liddy (2005) compile a list of factors that users may take into account in assessing credibility of blog sites.",
        "This list could also be summarized as the above mentioned two-folds: the bloggers' profiles and the information posted in the entries.",
        "Comparing these two aspects, most existing research on text trustworthiness focuses on the user oriented features.",
        "Lots of user oriented features have been proposed in the research of credibility detection.",
        "To score the user oriented features such as user's authority, a common approach is based on a graph-based ranking algorithm such as HITS and PageRank (Zhang et al., 2007; Bouguessa et al., 2008).",
        "In the research of text trustworthiness detection, the overwhelmingly adaption of nontextual features such as entity profiles over text content based features reflect some researchers' belief that superficial textual features cannot meet the need of text credibility identification (Jeon et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we examine the lexical semantic feature of evidential and argue that evidentiality, as a linguistically instantiated representation of quality of information content, offers a robust processing model for text trustworthiness detection.",
        "The detection of information trustworthiness also has promising application values.",
        "Google News is just such an application that ranks search results according to the credibility of the news.",
        "Other online news aggregation service, such as NewTrust , also focuses on providing users with credible and high quality news and stories.",
        "The existed applications, however, rely on either the quality of web sites or user voting.",
        "So, it is anticipated that the improvement on the technology of text trustworthiness detection by incorporating lexical semantic cues such as evi-dentiality may shed light on these applications.",
        "Although non-textual features have been popular in text credibility detection, there has been a few research focusing on textual features so far.",
        "Gil and Artz (2006) argue that the degree of trust in an entity is only one ingredient in deciding whether or not to trust the information it provides.",
        "They further point out that entity-centered issues are made with respect to publicly available data and services, and thus will not be possible in many cases.",
        "In their research of topical blog posts retrieval, Weerkamp and Rijke (2008) also consider only textual credibility indicators since they mentioned that additional resources (such as bloggers' profiles) is hard to obtain for technical or legal reasons.",
        "However, most research which utilizes textual features in text trustworthiness detection usually equates writing quality of document with its trustworthiness.",
        "Therefore, some secondary features which may not directly related to trustworthiness are proposed, including spelling errors, the lack of leading capitals, the large number of exclamation markers, personal pronouns and text length (Weerkamp and Rijke, 2008).",
        "There has not been attempted to directly evaluate inherent linguistic cues for trustworthiness of a statement."

        "Evidentiality, as an explicit linguistic system to encode quality of information, offers obvious and straightforward evidence for text trustworthiness detection.",
        "Yet it has not attracted the attention which it deserves in most of the natural language processing studies.",
        "In this paper, we aim to explore how we can incorporate the linguistic model of evidentiality into a robust and efficient machine learning based text classification framework.",
        "Aikhenvald (2003) observes that every language has some way of making reference to the source of information.",
        "Once the language is being used, it always imprinted with the subjective relationship from the speakers towards the information.",
        "Evidentiality is information providers' specifications for the information sources and their attitudes toward the information.",
        "As a common linguistic phenomenon to all the languages, it has attracted linguists' attention since the beginning of 20th century.",
        "In any language, evidentiality is a semantic category which could be expressed on both grammatical level (as in some American Indian language) and lexical level (as in English, Chinese and many other languages).",
        "The linguistic expressions of eviden-tiality are named as evidentials or evidential markers.",
        "Mushin (2000) defines evidential as a marker which qualifies the reliability of information.",
        "It is an explicit expression of the speaker's attitudes toward the trustworthiness of information source.",
        "For instance, a) .",
        "It's probably raining.",
        "b) .",
        "It must be raining.",
        "c) .",

        "I can hear/see/feel/smell it raining.",
        "It is obvious that the information provided in the above examples is subjective.",
        "The information expresses the personal experience or attitudes, while at the same time reflects the speakers' estimation for the trustworthiness of the statement by information providers.",
        "There are two dimensions of the linguistic definition for evidentiality.",
        "The term evidentiality is originally introduced by Jakobson (1957) as a label for the verbal category indicating the alleged source of information about the narrated events.",
        "In line with Jakobson's definition, the narrow definition of evidentiality proposed by other researchers focuses mainly on the specification of the information sources, that is, the evidence through which information is acquired (DeLancey, 2001).",
        "Comparing with the narrow definition, the board definition explains eviden-tiality in a much wider sense, and characterizes evidentiality as expressions of speaker's attitude toward information, typically expressed by modalities (Chafe, 1986; Mushin, 2000).",
        "Ifantidou (2001) also holds that evidential has two main functions: 1) indicating the source of knowledge; 2) indicating the speaker's degree of certainty about the proposition expressed.",
        "He further divides them in details as follows.",
        "a) Information can be acquired in various ways, including observation (e.g. see), hearsay (e.g. hear, reportedly), inference (e.g. must, deduce), memory (e.g. recall).",
        "b) Evidentiality can indicate the speaker's degree of certainty, including certain propositional attitude (e.g. think, guess) and adverbials (e.g. certainly, surely), also epistemic models (e.g. may, ought to).",
        "Evidentiality has its hierarchy which forms a continuum that marks from the highest to the least trustworthiness.",
        "Up to now, there are many hierarchical schemes proposed by researchers.",
        "Oswalt (1986) suggests a priority hierarchy of evidentials as:",
        "Performative > Factual > Visual > Auditory > Inferential > Quotative",
        "In this evidential hierarchy, performative carries the highest degree of trustworthiness since Oswalt considers that the speaker is speaking of the act he himself is performing.",
        "It is the most reliable source of evidence for the knowledge of that event.",
        "Whereas Barners (1984) proposes the following hierarchy:",
        "Visual > Non-visual > Apparent > Secondhand > Assumed",
        "He points out that visual evidence takes precedence over the auditory evidence and is more reliable.",
        "The above two hierarchies are based on the narrow definition of evidentiality mentioned above.",
        "There are also some hierarchies involving the board definition of evidentiality, such as Chafe (1986)'s categories of evidentiality.",
        "In this paper, we adopt a broad definition of evidentiality and focus on a trustworthiness categorization.",
        "This categorization follows the model of four-dimensional certainty categorization by Rubin et al. (2005).",
        "In this model, it is suggested that the division of the certainty level dimension into four categories - Absolute, High, Moderate and Low.",

        "In this section, we apply evidentiality in an actual implement of text trustworthiness detection.",
        "It is based on a specific web application service, collaborative question answering (CQA), in which the trustworthiness of text content is very helpful for finding the best answers in the service.",
        "With the development of Web2.0, the services of CQA in community media have largely attracted people's attention.",
        "Comparing with the general ad hoc information searching, question answering could help in finding the most accurate answers extracted from the vast web content.",
        "Whereas in the collaborative question answering, the CQA community media just provide a web space in which users can freely post their questions, and at the same time other users may answer these questions based on their knowledge and interests.",
        "Due to the advantage of interactivity, CQA usually could settle some questions which cannot be dealt with by ad hoc information retrieval.",
        "However, since the platform is open to anyone, the quality of the answers provided by users is hard to identify.",
        "People may present answers of various qualities due to the limitation of their knowledge, attitude and purpose of answering the questions.",
        "As a result, the issue of how to identify the most trustworthy answers from the user-provided content turns out to be the most challenging part to the system.",
        "As mentioned previously, the trustworthiness of text content could be identified from two dimensions.",

        "In this paper, we propose to incorporate the linguistic knowledge of evidentiality in the NLP task of trustworthiness prediction.",
        "As evidential-ity is an integral and inherent part of any statement and explicitly expresses information about the trustworthiness of this statement, it should provide the most robust and direct model for trustworthiness detection.",
        "We first set up the taxonomy of lexical evidentials.",
        "By incorporating evidentiality into a machine learning based text classification framework, we conduct experiments for a specific application, CQA.",
        "The evidentials in the dataset are extracted to form different text representation schemes.",
        "Our experimental results using evidentials show improvements up to 14.85% over the baselines.",
        "However, not all types of evidential features contributed to the improvement of detection.",
        "We also compared the effect of different types of evidential based feature representation schemes on the classification performance.",
        "The way to model evidentiality for trustworthiness detection which we adopted in our initial experiment design actually could also be explained by Grice's Maxim of Quality: be truthful.",
        "As the Maxim of Quality requires one \"not to say that for which one lacks adequate evidence\", we hypothesize that evidential constructions mark the adequacy of evidence and should indicate reliable answers.",
        "However, the results from our experiments only partially supported this hypothesis.",
        "The results showed a satisfactory performance was achieved when all evidential markers were treated as negative evidence for reliability.",
        "This result could then be accounted by invoking another Gricean maxim: Quantity.",
        "The Maxim of Quantity requires that \"one makes his/her contribution as informative as is required, and at the same time does not make the contribution more informative than is required.\"",
        "As evidentiality is not grammaticalized in English, the use of evidentiality is not a required grammatical element.",
        "An answer marked by evi-dentials would violate Maxim of Quantity if it is correct.",
        "The Maxim of Quantity predicts that good answers are plain statements without evidential markers.",
        "On the frequent use of evidential markers for less reliable answers can be accounted for by speakers' attempt to follow both Maxims of Quality and Quantity.",
        "The evidential marks are used to compensate for the fact that speakers are not very confident about the answer, yet would like to adhere to the Maxim of Quality.",
        "In other words, evidentials are not likely to be used in reliable answers because of the Maxim of Quality, but it is likely used in less reliable answers because the speakers may try to provide proof of adequate evidence by a grammatical device instead of providing true answer.",
        "Therefore, this model elaborated above takes into account not only the grammatical function of evidential constructions but also how this linguistic structure is used as a pragmatic/discourse device.",
        "In other words, this study suggests that modeling linguistic theory in NLP needs to take a more comprehensive approach than the simple modular approach where only one module (based on evidentiality) is used.",
        "Linguistic modeling needs to consider both how linguistic structure/knowledge is represented and processed, we also need to model how a particular linguistic device in use.",
        "In the further works, we plan to continue developing and elaborate on a multi-modular linguistic model of evidentiality for knowledge acquisition.",
        "We will also explore the possibility of incorporating other features, both textual and non-textual, to further improve performances in the tasks of text trustworthiness detection."
