Thus, F^^ needs to be ^-ranked above Mi in order to ensure OT-compatibility with the corresponding row of the block A in (24).",

        "The chain of inequalities in (31) entails that d < (I – k)n, which contradicts the choice (21) of the number d of ballast constraints.",
        "The preceding considerations show that given an arbitrary instance (A, P, k) of the MOpbm (18), the corresponding instance (A, T, K) of the PTAPpbm (17) defined in (21)-(26) admits a positive solution iff the original instance (A, P, k) of the MOpbm does.",
