        "Dialectometry is a multidisciplinary field that uses quantitative methods in the analysis of dialect data.",
        "From the very beginning, most of the research in dialectometry has been focused on the identification of dialect groups and development of methods that would tell us how similar (or different) one variety is when compared to the neighboring varieties.",
        "Dialect data is usually analyzed on the aggregate level by summing up the differences between various language varieties into a single number.",
        "The main drawback of aggregate analyses is that it does not expose the underlying linguistic structure, i.e. the specific linguistic elements that contributed to the differences between the dialects.",
        "In recent years there have been several attempts to automatically extract linguistic basis from the aggregate analysis, i.e. to determine which linguistic features are responsible for which dialect divisions.",
        "Although interesting for dialectology itself, this kind of research is very important in the investigation of sound variation and change, both on the synchronic and diachronic level.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In the next section, we discuss a number of earlier approaches to the problem of identifying underlying linguistic structure in dialect divisions.",
        "In section 3, we give a description of the dialect data used in this research.",

        "In section 5, the results of our method are discussed, examining the values that come out of our factorization method in a number of ways.",

        "Factor analysis has shown that 3 factors are most important, explaining 35% of the total amount of variation.",

        "Based on the relative frequency of each of these correspondences each site in the data set was assigned a correspondence index.",
        "Higher value of this index indicates sites where the presence of a certain sound is dominant with respect to some sound alternation.",

        "We note that the main drawback of this approach is the subjectivity of the feature selection and segment quantification.",
        "Wieling and Nerbonne (2009) used a bipartite spectral graph partitioning method to simultaneously cluster dialect varieties and sound correspondences.",
        "Although promising, this method compares the pronunciation of every site only to the reference site, rather than comparing it to all other sites.",
        "Another drawback of this method is that it does not use any information on the frequencies of sound correspondences, but instead employs binary features to represent whether a certain correspondence is present at a certain site or not.",
        "In this paper we present an approach that tries to overcome some of the problems described in the previous approaches.",
        "It proceeds from automatically aligned phonetic transcriptions, where pronunciations of every site are compared to the corresponding pronunciations for all other sites.",

        "The final model fits 44% of the original data.",
        "The contribution of the first extracted dimension (diml) to the final fit of the model is the largest - 23.81 per cent - while the next four dimensions contribute to the final fit with similar percentages: dim2 with 10.63 per cent, dim3 with 9.50 per cent, dim4 with 9.26 per cent, and dim5 with 9.09 per cent.",
        "Dimensions six to ten contribute in the range from 8.66 per cent to 6.98 per cent.",
        "For every dimension we extracted the twenty sound correspondences with the highest scores.",
        "In the first dimension we find 11 pairs involving vowels and 9 involving consonant variation.",
        "The three sound correspondences with the highest scores are the [a]-[a], [o]-[u], and [e]-[i] alternations.",
        "This finding corresponds well with the traditional scholarly views on Bulgarian phonetics (Wood and Pettersson, 1988; Barnes, 2006) where we find that in unstressed syllables mid vowels [e] and [o] raise to neutralize with the high vowels [i] and [u].",
        "The low vowel [a] raises to merge with [a].",
        "For every sound alternation we also check their geographical distribution.",
        "We do so by applying the following procedure.",
        "From the aligned pairs of transcriptions we extract corresponding pairs of sounds for every alternation.",
        "We count how many times each of the two sounds appears in the transcriptions for every village.",
        "Thus, for every pair of sound correspondences, we can create two maps that show the distribution of each of the sounds separately.",
        "On the map of Bulgaria these values are represented using a gradual color, which enables us to see not only the geographic distribution of a certain sound but also how regular it is in a given sound alternation.",
        "The highest scoring sites are coloured black and the lowest scoring sites are coloured white.",
        "In Figure 5 we see the geographical distribution of the first three extracted correspondences.",
        "The first two alternations [a]-[a] and [o]-[u] have almost the same geographical distribution and divide the country into west and east.",
        "While in the west there is a clear presence of vowels [a] and [o], in the east those vowels would be pronounced as [a] and [u].",
        "The division into east and west corresponds well with the so-called jat line, which is, according to traditional dialectologists (Stojkov, 2002) the main dialect border in Bulgaria.",
        "On the maps in Figure 5 we represent it with the black line that roughly divides Bulgaria into east and west.",
        "The third correspondence follows a slightly different pattern: mid vowel [e] is present not only west of the jat line, but also in the southern part of the country, in the region of Rodopi mountains.",
        "In the central and northeastern areas this sound is pronounced as high vowel [i].",
        "For all three sound correspondences we see a clear two-way division of the country, with almost all sites being characterized by one of the two pronunciations, which, as we shall see later, is not always the case due to multiple reflections of some sounds at certain positions.",
        "We also note that the distribution of the sound correspondences that involve soft consonants and their counterparts have the same east-west distribution (see Figure 6).",
        "In the first dimension we find the following consonants and their palatal counterparts [n], [d], [1], [v] and [r], but because of space limitations we show maps only for three correspondences.",
        "The east-west division also emerges with respect to the distribution of the [a]-[r] and ['e]-['a] sounds.",
        "Unlike the correspondences mentioned before, the [f]-[p], [tfj-[j^], and [3Hz] pairs are defining the south part of the country as a separate zone.",
        "As shown on the maps in Figure 7, the southern part of the country (the region of Rodopi mountains) is characterized by a soft pronunciation of [J], m and [3]- In traditonal literature on Bul-garain dialectology (Stojkov, 2002), we also find that soft pronunciation of [f], [tf] and [3] is one of the most important phonetic features of the varieties in the Rodopi zone.",
        "Based on the correspondences extracted in the first dimension, this area is also defined by the presence of the vowel [ e] in stressed syllables (['e]-['e] and ['a]-['e] correspondences).",
        "In some extracted correspondences, only one of the sounds has a geographically coherent distribution, like in the case of the [r]-[e] pair where [e] is found in the west and south, while the [r] sound is only sporadically present in the central region.",
        "This kind of asymmetrical distribution is also found with respect to the pair [a]-[r].",
        "Most of the sound correspondences in the first dimension either divide the country along the jat line or separate the Rodopi area from the rest of the varieties.",
        "The only two exceptions are the [-]-[j] and ['r]-['a] pairs.",
        "They both define the southwest area as a separate zone, while the northwest shares its pronunciation of the sound in question with the eastern part of the country.",

        "In this paper we have applied parafac in the task of detecting the linguistic basis of dialect phonetic variation.",
        "The distances between varieties were expressed as a numerical vector that records information on all sound correspondences found in the data set.",
        "Using parafac we were able to extract the most important sound correspondences.",
        "Based on the 20 most important sound correspondences we performed clustering of all sites in the data set and were able to detect three groups of sites.",
        "As found in traditional literature on Bulgarian dialects, these three dialects are the main dialect groups in Bulgaria.",
        "Using the aggregate approach on the same data set, the same three dialects were the only groups in the data that could be asserted with high confidence.",
        "We conclude that this approach is successful in extracting underlying linguistic structure in dialect variation, while at the same time overcoming some of the problems found in the earlier approaches to this problem.",
        "In future work sounds in the data set could be defined in a more sophisticated way, using some kind of feature representation.",
        "Also, the role of stress should be examined in more depth, since there are different patterns of change in stressed in unstressed syllables.",
        "We would also like to extend the method and examine more than just two sound correspondences at a time."
