        "This is done by constructing models linking syllable parses to patterns of coordination between articulatory events.",
        "Data simulated from different syllabic parses are evaluated against experimental data from American English and Moroccan Arabic, two languages claimed to parse similar strings of segments into different syllabic structures.",

        "Languages are claimed to differ in how word-initial consonant clusters are parsed into higher level phonological structures.",
        "For example, English (Kahn, 1976) and Georgian (Vogt, 1971) are claimed to parse initial clusters into complex syllable onsets.",
        "In contrast, Berber and Moroccan Arabic are claimed to parse initial clusters hete-rosyllabically, [#C.CV-], because the syllable structure of these languages allows at most one consonant (simplex onset) per syllable onset (Dell & Elmedlaoui, 2002).",
        "Of direct relevance to these claims are patterns of temporal stability in the production of initial clusters.",
        "In those cases where speech production data are available, languages that allow complex onsets exhibit patterns of temporal stability that differ from languages that allow only syllables with simplex syllable onsets.",
        "These observed temporal differences have been quantified in terms of the relative stability of intervals as calculated across words beginning with one, two and three initial consonants (Browman & Goldstein, 1988; Byrd, 1995; Honorof & Browman, 1995; Shaw, Gafos, Hoole, & Zeroual, 2009).",
        "Figure 1 schematizes temporal differences between simplex and complex onsets.",
        "The figure shows three temporal intervals left-delimited by landmarks in the consonant cluster, the left edge of the cluster, the center of the cluster and the right edge of the cluster, and right-delimited by a common anchor point.",
        "Simplex onset alignment Complex onset alignment A A right edge to anchor, delineated by points in an initial single consonant or consonant cluster and a common anchor (A).",
        "The alignment schema on the left/right represents experimentally observed temporal manifestations of the simplex/complex onset parse.",
        "Such patterns have been used as phonetic heuristics in diagnosing syllable structure in experimental data.",
        "When clusters are parsed into simplex syllable onsets (Figure 1: left), the duration of the right edge to anchor interval is unperturbed by the addition of consonants to the word.",
        "Consequently, this interval remains stable across #CVX and #CCVX words.",
        "In contrast, when clusters are parsed into a complex onset (Figure 1 : right), the duration of the right edge to anchor interval shrinks to make room for the addition of a consonant to the syllable.",
        "Under this temporal alignment schema, the center to anchor interval remains more stable across #CVX and #CCVX words than both the right edge to anchor interval and the left edge to anchor interval.",
        "Experimental results showing temporal patterns consistent with the schema on the right side of Figure 1 include Browman and Goldstein (1988), Honorof and Browman (1995), and Marin and Pouplier (2008) on American English, Goldstein, Chitoran, & Selkirk (2007) on Georgian and Hermes, Grice, Muecke and Niemann (2008) on Italian.",
        "Results showing the temporal pattern on the left side of Figure 1 include Goldstein et al.",
        "(2007) on Berber, Shaw et al.",
        "(2009) on Moroccan Arabic and Hermes et al.",
        "(2008) on Italian.",
        "We briefly review representative quantitative results illustrating the different temporal organizations in Figure 1.",
        "For a language with complex onsets, Browman and Goldstein (1988) show that the standard deviation calculated across English word sets such as pot~sot~spot~lot~plot~splot is smaller for the center to anchor interval, 15.8 ms, than for the left edge to anchor interval, 37.7 ms, and the right edge to anchor interval, 33.6 ms.",
        "In contrast, for a simplex onset language, Shaw et al.",
        "(2009) show that across similar Moroccan Arabic word sets, e.g., bati~sbati, the right edge to anchor interval has a lower standard deviation, 14 ms, than the center to anchor interval, 27 ms, and the left edge to anchor interval, 77 ms.",
        "Although the experimental work reviewed above shows that stability comparisons among the right edge to anchor, center to anchor and left edge to anchor intervals can provide good heuristics for testing syllabification hypotheses in experimental data, such heuristics stated in terms of inequalities are known to break down under some conditions.",
        "For example, simulations with a model reported in Shaw et al.",
        "(2009) demonstrated that when the overall variability in the intervals is high, the simplex onset parse can generate intervals exhibiting stability reversals whereby the center to anchor interval is more stable than the right/left edge to anchor interval (contra the heuristic which states that the right edge to anchor interval should be the most stable; again, see Figure 1: left).",
        "This result indicates the frailty of phonetic heuristics in the form of inequalities, e.g. a simplex onset parse implies that the right edge to anchor interval is more stable than the center to anchor interval and the left edge to anchor interval.",
        "Such heuristics may be too coarse or even in some cases misleading in distinguishing competing syllabic parses using experimental data.",
        "This paper advances a quantitative method for evaluating competing syllable parses that aims to improve on previously proposed phonetic heuristics and, by doing so, sharpen the interpretation of temporal stability patterns in terms of syllabic structure.",
        "In mediating between phonological theory and experimental data, the computational model makes it possible to discover syllabification rules from phonetic patterns.",
        "The model provides a new understanding of languages with known syllable structure and the analytical tools to deduce syllabification rules in less-studied languages."

        "The general plan is to simulate data from models encoding competing syllabic parses, to quantify in the simulated data the pattern of stability in the intervals shown in Figure 1, and to evaluate the goodness of fit between the pattern of stability in the simulated data and the pattern of stability in experimental data.",
        "Our modeling paradigm capitalizes on structurally revealing temporal patterns in experimental data but improves on past work by modeling competing syllabic structures (both simplex and complex onset parses of initial clusters) and replacing hypotheses stated in the form of inequalities with quantitative indices of goodness of fit between syllable parses and experimental data.",
        "Given a string of consonants and vowels, e.g. CCV, the models map the simplex and complex onset parse of that string to distinct coordination topologies.",
        "The coordination topologies reflect the temporal relations underlying the segmental sequence (Gafos, 2002: p. 316).",
        "Differences in temporal structure at this level yield the distinct temporal alignment patterns schematized in Figure 1.",
        "Figure 2 shows how the syllable parse, simplex or complex, determines the relative temporal alignment of the segments involved.",
        "The boxes at the bottom of the figure (V rectangles) represent the temporal extent of the syllable nucleus, the vowel, which depends on the syllable parse.",
        "On a simplex onset parse (Figure 2a) the vowel is aligned to the midpoint of the immediately prevocalic consonant regardless of the number of preceding consonants.",
        "On a complex onset parse (Figure 2b) the vowel is aligned to the midpoint of the entire cluster of prevocalic consonants.",
        "These temporal alignment schemas have been proposed to underlie the experimental results we reviewed in Section 1.",
        "The model simulates the temporal organization of words with one, two, and sometimes three initial consonant clusters on the basis of a probabilistic interpretation of the temporal structure encoded in the syllable parse (simplex or complex).",
        "In addition, the model has three phonetic parameters, F, kipi, and V, which determine, respectively, consonant plateau duration, the duration between consonant plateaus, and vowel duration.",
        "These latter parameters can be set using estimates from the phonetic record.",
        "As summarized in Figure 2, word simulation proceeds from the immediately prevocalic consonant, Cn .",
        "The timestamp of the release of this consonant, CIRd , is drawn from a Gaussian distribution.",
        "The timestamp of the achievement of target of this consonant, CTar, is determined by subtracting consonant plateau duration, kp, from Cn eland adding an error term.",
        "Additional prevocalic consonants, e.g. C1 in #C1C2V, are determined with reference to the immediately preceding consonant.",
        "For example, the timestamp of the release of Cn_1 , CR_X , is determined by subtracting the inter-plateau interval, kpi, from CTar and adding a noise term.",
        "As noted above, the alignment of the vowel relative to the prevocalic consonant(s) is dictated by the syllable parse.",
        "Once the temporal structure of the input segmental strings was generated, the stability of each target interval, the left edge to anchor, center to anchor and right edge to anchor interval was calculated across words in the simulated data.",
        "For these intervals, the offset of the vowel was used as the anchor point.",
        "In light of past work indicating that phonetic heuristics for syllable structure may change as the level of variability in the data increases (Shaw et al., 2009), we also manipulated the variability of the simulated intervals.",
        "We did this by varying the standard deviation of the vowel offset (from 0 to 70 ms in 15 discrete 5 ms increments such that anchors 1, 2, 3...15 have a standard deviation of 0 ms, 5 ms, 10 ms...70 ms, respectively).",
        "Since the vowel offset serves as an anchor in right-delimiting all of the measured intervals, increasing the standard deviation of this point is one way to increase the level of variability in all of the simulated intervals uniformly.",
        "This effectively allows the level of variability in simulated data to match the level of variability in experimental data.",
        "Figure 2: Summary of word simulation in the model.",
        "Consonant landmarks are generated from the release of the immediately prevocalic consonant.",
        "The alignment of the vowel is determined by the syllable parse (simplex or complex).",
        "To sum up the central idea, the task of evaluating syllable parses with experimental data has been formulated here as the task of fitting abstract coordination topologies to the experimental data.",
        "This fitting can be expressed using two types of variables, coordination topologies and anchor variability.",
        "In the study of biological coordination and complex systems more generally, these two variables correspond respectively to the so-called essential and non-essential variables describing the behavior of complex systems (Kugler, Kelso, & Turvey, 1980: p. 13).",
        "Essential variables specify the qualitative form of the system under study.",
        "For us, this corresponds to the syllabic parse of the phonological string.",
        "The fundamental hypothesis entailed in positing an abstract phonological organization isomorphic to syllable structure is that a syllable parse is a macroscopic organization uniform across a variegated set of segmental identities, lexical statistics and rate conditions, e.g. 'plea', 'tree', 'glee' are single syllables independent of speech rate, frequency or phonotactic probability (see Catford 1977: p. 13 on 'phonological form').",
        "All of the above factors, however, have left imprints on the articulatory patterns registered in the experimental data.",
        "Crucially, we do not know and it may not be possible to predict for any given stimulus how each such factor or combination of factors has affected the intervals quantified.",
        "Taken together, then, these and other yet unknown factors have introduced noise in the intervals that will be measured.",
        "Therefore, in formulating the modeling problem of diagnosing syllable structure in experimental data, we let variability be one of the non-essential variables manipulated in the fitting process.",
        "The anchor offers a convenient location for introducing this variability into the intervals.",
        "In the discussion that follows, the non-essential variable of anchor index will be used to refer to the amount of variability introduced into the intervals through the anchor."

        "Our models allow syllabic parses of the same string to be compared directly and evaluated quantitatively by determining which parse results in a better fit to the data.",
        "As an index of interval stability, we employ the relative standard deviation of the three intervals shown in Figure 1, calculated across sets of words with one, two, and sometimes three initial consonants.",
        "Relative standard deviation, henceforth RSD, is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of an interval by its mean duration.",
        "Substantive reasons for using RSD as a dependent variable and not the standard deviation or mean duration of the intervals are described, respectively, in Shaw et al.",
        "(2009: p. 203) and Shaw (2010: p. 111-112).",
        "Model performance was evaluated on the basis of two test statistics: the R statistic and the F statistic.",
        "The R statistic provides a measure of goodness of fit capable of detecting gradient improvement (or degradation) in model performance as a function of parameter values.",
        "The F statistic, on the other hand, is used to evaluate model performance in the following way.",
        "Hits or misses for each pairing of simulated RSDs and data RSDs will be determined based upon p values generated from the F statistic.",
        "The criterion of p < .01 will be interpreted as successful rejection of the null hypothesis (that the RSD of all intervals is equal) and constitute a hit while failure to reject the null hypothesis constitutes a miss.",
        "This method of interpreting the F statistic provides a direct way to evaluate model performance for each run of the simulation.",
        "Across multiple runs of the simulation, the ratio of hits to total runs (hits + misses) provides a hit rate which summarizes the performance of a syllable parse in matching the experimental data.",
        "This method of model evaluation has a conceptual antecedent in other work in probabilistic grammar.",
        "The hit rate as described above plays a similar role in model evaluation as the confidence scores employed in Albright and Hayes (2003).",

        "The raw confidence score of a rule is the likelihood that the rule applies when its environment is met.",
        "The score is the ratio of the number of times that a particular rule applies, hits, by the number of times in which the environment for the rule is present in the data, the rule's scope.",
        "For example, the rule for the English past tense [i] -> [a]/ {l,r}_rj correctly derives forms such as sprung from spring and flung from fling, but makes the wrong prediction, brung and not brought, for bring.",
        "Of the 4253 verbs employed in the Albright and Hayes (2003) learning set, the environment of the spring-sprung rule occurs 9 times and the rule applies correctly in 6 of those cases yielding a raw confidence score of .667.",
        "In contrast, the most general rule for the English past tense 0 d / X_has a scope identical to the size of the data set, 4253, and applies in 4034 cases yielding a raw confidence score of .949.",
        "In the case at hand, that of syllable structure, the hit rate proposed above plays a similar role to that of the confidence score.",
        "It provides a simple statistic summarizing the fit of a syllable parse to data.",
        "The value of the non-essential variable (anchor index) that maximizes the R statistic is also informative in evaluating syllable structure.",
        "When the syllable parse is correct, then large amounts of noise added to the intervals may be harmful, pushing the model output away from patterns dictated by the essential variable.",
        "On the other hand, when the syllable parse is wrong, then increases in noise may improve model performance by pushing the intervals in the direction of the correct syllable parse on some trials.",
        "Since noise is inserted into the intervals through the anchor, comparing the anchor indices that maximize R may be informative in evaluating syllable parses.",
        "A lower anchor index indicates a better-fitting syllable parse.",
        "The F and R statistics used to provide quantitative evaluation of syllabic structure as described above are obtained by plotting RSDs measured in the data (x-axis) against corresponding RSDs simulated by the model (y-axis), and fitting a regression line to these coordinates using the least squares method.",

        "Figure 3 shows that R is highest when the simplex onset parse is paired with anchor 7.",

        "Each of the data sets evaluated thus far were contributed by a single speaker.",
        "In these data the patterns of interval stability clearly reveal temporal organization in terms of syllables.",
        "To evaluate whether the model continues to distinguish syllabic parses when phonetic heuristics break down, we now turn to a corpus of less controlled stimuli from multiple speakers with a high degree of inter-speaker variability.",
        "Under some conditions, stability-based phonetic heuristics break down as reliable indicators of syllable structure.",
        "This is known to occur, for example, when the level of overall variability in the intervals is high (Shaw et al., 2009).",
        "In controlled experimental studies, as can be seen in Figure 1, neither of the two syllabic parses, simplex or complex, has been observed to show the left edge to anchor interval as more stable than the center to anchor and right edge to anchor intervals.",
        "At high levels of variability, however, the probabilistic model developed in our work can produce patterns whereby the left edge to anchor interval is more stable than the other two intervals.",
        "This occurs regardless of the syllable parse when the anchor index is high (e.g. 15), which represents a high degree of variability in the intervals (the reason why high interval variability results in this pattern is explained in Shaw et al.",
        "2009).",
        "Under these conditions of high variability, both values of the essential variable (simplex and complex onset parses) generate a pattern whereby the left edge to anchor interval has a lower RSD than the center to anchor interval and the right edge to anchor interval.",
        "Thus, at this level of variability, stability-based phonetic heuristics, i.e., center to anchor stability implies a complex onset parse, are rendered ineffective in distinguishing syllabic parses.",
        "When variability leads competing syllable parses to the same predictions in terms of inequalities (both models show left edge to anchor stability), is our modeling paradigm still capable of distinguishing syllabic parses?",
        "To address this question, we need a corpus with the requisite level of variability.",
        "The Wisconsin X-ray Microbeam Speech Production Database provides recordings of a variety of tasks including production of sentences, passages and word lists from fifty-seven speakers of American English (Westbury, 1994).",
        "Although not all speakers completed all tasks and some tokens have missing data which make them unusable for this analysis, it remains an archive of articulatory data that is extremely impressive in size.",
        "Within this archive there are various near-minimal pairs that can be used to evaluate syllable structure using the methods employed above.",
        "Here we report on thirty-three speakers' productions of the dyad row~grows.",
        "Calculating interval stability across multiple speaker samples of this word dyad is one way to introduce variability into the intervals and, by doing so, provide an interesting test case for our proposed methods.",
        "The target word row was produced in the sentence Things in a row provide a sense of order.",
        "This sentence is one of several unrelated sentences included in Task #60 within the X-ray microbeam corpus.",
        "The word grows was produced in the sentence That noise problem grows more annoying each day, which is included in Task #56.",
        "Although these target words were produced in different syntactic frames and occur in different phrasal positions, we assume, following standard phonological assumptions, that all instances of /gr/ and /r/ were syllabified identically, namely, that they are parsed into complex syllable onsets.",
        "To test this assumption, we ask whether the models converge on the same result.",
        "In all respects except for the determination of the anchor point, the quantification of the X-ray microbeam data followed the same procedure described for Electromagnetic Articulometry data in Shaw et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "To determine the anchor point, we followed past work on English (Brow-man and Goldstein 1988, Honorof and Browman 1995) by using an acoustic landmark, the offset of voicing in the vowel, as the anchor point right-delimiting the intervals of interest.",
        "This was done for the following reason.",
        "The target words in this case are not matched at the right edge of the syllable (grows ends in s while row ends in a vowel) and this makes it difficult to determine a common articulatory anchor across words.",
        "The articulatory landmarks that left-delimit the intervals of interest were the same as for the English and Arabic data discussed above.",
        "The duration of the three intervals, left edge to anchor, center to anchor and right edge to anchor, were measured for one repetition of each word, row and grows, for thirty-three speakers.",
        "The variation across speakers in the duration of these intervals was substantial.",
        "As an example, the left edge to anchor interval of row ranges from 193 ms (Subject 44) to 518 ms (Subject 53).",
        "The mean, standard deviation and relative standard deviation of the intervals calculated across row and grows are provided in Table 4.",
        "In this data the RSD of the left edge to anchor interval is lower than the RSD of both the center to anchor and right edge to anchor intervals.",
        "From the perspective of phonetic heuristics of syllable structure, this fact by itself is not particularly revealing.",
        "Both syllabic parses predict-this should be the case at very high levels of variability.",
        "This data set therefore provides a challenge to phonetic heuristics stated in the form of directional inequalities and an appropriate test of the quantitative methods developed here.",
        "Table 4.",
        "Mean, standard deviation, and relative standard deviation of three intervals, left edge to anchor (LE-A), center to anchor (CC-A), right edge to anchor (RE-A), calculated across productions of row and grows by thirty-three speakers of American English",
        "Simulations with the simplex and complex onset models generated RSD values that were fitted to the RSD values of the three intervals of interest in the English row~grows data.",
        "On each run, the model simulated 10 repetitions of words beginning with one and two consonants.",
        "The same values of the constants used for the other English simulations were employed here as well, and the same range of anchor variability was produced for each parse.",
        "Anchor 1 has a standard deviation of zero and the standard deviation of each subsequent anchor increases by 5 ms so that anchor 15 has a standard deviation of 70 ms. Table 5 reports the results of 1000 runs of the simulation.",
        "Table 5: Hit rate for each syllable parse when evaluated against the English dyad row~grows.",
        "The anchor index that maximized R for each syllable parse is given in parenthesis.",
        "The results of the model fitting reveal that the complex onset parse provides a superior fit to the data.",
        "The complex onset parse achieves a higher anchor (anchor 6 vs. anchor 11) than the simplex onset parse.",
        "This result demonstrates that the model can distinguish syllabic parses even in noisy data contributed by multiple speakers.",
        "Since the target words, row and grows, were produced in different environments, there are potentially a number of interacting factors influencing the pattern of temporal stability in the data.",
        "A model incorporating, for example, prosodic structure above the level of the syllable may identify interactions between syllable and higher levels of prosodic structure.",
        "We plan to explore models of this sort in future work.",
        "It remains an important result of the current model that competing parses of a given string can be distinguished in the data even at levels of variability that obscure phonetic heuristics for syllable structure."

        "There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the temporal dimension provides a rich source of information revealing phonological structure.",
        "In the domain syllables, the relation between temporal patterns in experimental data and qualitative aspects of phonological structure has often taken the form of statements expressing inequalities, e.g., a complex onset parse implies that the center to anchor interval is more stable than the right/left edge to anchor intervals.",
        "Phonetic heuristics of this sort are valid only under certain conditions.",
        "The models developed in this paper generate finer-grained quantitative predictions of syllabic structure based on a probabilistic interpretation of temporal organization.",
        "Our models make predictions not just about stability inequalities but also about the permissible degree to which interval stabilities may differ from one another under a given syllable parse.",
        "Crucially, these predictions allow for evaluation of competing syllable parses even when statements in the form of inequalities do not.",
        "As the phonological literature is replete with debates regarding the syllabification of consonant clusters, the tools developed here have immediate application.",
        "They allow rigorous evaluation of syllable structure on the basis of experimental data."
