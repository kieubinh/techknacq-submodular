        "Morphological analysis is required in many natural language processing problems.",
        "Especially, in agglutinative and compounding languages, where each word form consists of a combination of stems and affixes, the number of unique word forms in a corpus is very large.",
        "This leads to problems in word-based statistical language modeling: Even with a large training corpus, many of the words encountered when applying the model did not occur in the training corpus, and thus there is no information available on how to process them.",
        "Using morphological units, such as stems and affixes, instead of complete word forms alleviates this problem.",
        "Unfortunately, for many languages morphological analysis tools either do not exist or they are not freely available.",
        "In many cases, the problems of availability also apply to morphologically annotated corpora, making supervised learning in-feasible.",
        "In consequence, there has been a need for approaches for morphological processing that would require little language-dependent resources.",
        "Due to this need, as well as the general interest in language acquisition and unsupervised language learning, the research on unsupervised learning of morphology has been active during the past ten years.",
        "Especially, methods that perform morphological segmentation have been studied extensively (Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Monson et al., 2004; Bernhard, 2006; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008b; Poon et al., 2009).",
        "These methods have shown to produce results that improve performance in several applications, such as speech recognition and information retrieval (Creutz et al., 2007; Kurimo et al., 2008).",
        "While unsupervised methods often work quite well across different languages, it is difficult to avoid biases toward certain kinds of languages and analyses.",
        "For example, in isolating languages, the average amount of morphemes per word is low, whereas in synthetic languages the amount may be very high.",
        "Also, different applications may need a particular bias, for example, not analyzing frequent compound words as consisting of smaller parts could be beneficial in information retrieval.",
        "In many cases, even a small amount of labeled data can be used to adapt a method to a particular language and task.",
        "Methodologically, this is referred to as semi-supervised learning.",
        "In semi-supervised learning, the learning system has access to both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "Typically, the labeled data set is too small for supervised methods to be effective, but there is a large amount of unlabeled data available.",
        "There are many different approaches to this class of problems, as presented by Zhu (2005).",
        "One approach is to use generative models, which specify a join distribution over all variables in the model.",
        "They can be utilized both in unsupervised and supervised learning.",
        "In contrast, discriminative models only specify the conditional distribution between input data and labels, and therefore require labeled data.",
        "Both, however, can be extended to the semi-supervised case.",
        "For generative models, it is, in principle, very easy to use both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "For unsupervised learning one can consider the labels as missing data and estimate their values using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "In the semi-supervised case, some labels are available, and the rest are considered missing and estimated with EM.",
        "In this paper, we extend the Morfessor Baseline method for the semi-supervised case.",
        "Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz and Lagus, 2005; Creutz and Lagus, 2007, etc.)",
        "is one of the well-established methods for morphological segmentation.",
        "It applies a simple generative model.",
        "The basic idea, inspired by the Minimum Description Length principle (Rissanen, 1989), is to encode the words in the training data with a lexicon of morphs, that are segments of the words.",
        "The number of bits needed to encode both the morph lexicon and the data using the lexicon should be minimized.",
        "Morfessor does not limit the number of morphemes per word form, making it suitable for modeling a large variety of agglutinative languages irrespective of them being more isolating or synthetic.",
        "We show that the model can be trained in a similar fashion in the semi-supervised case as in the unsupervised case.",
        "However, with a large set of unlabeled data, the effect of the supervision on the results tends to be small.",
        "Thus, we add a discriminative weighting scheme, where a small set of word forms with gold standard analyzes are used for tuning the respective weights of the labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: First, we discuss related work on semi-supervised learning.",
        "Then we describe the Morfessor Baseline model and the unsupervised algorithm, followed by our semi-supervised extension.",
        "Finally, we present experimental results for English and Finnish using the Morpho Challenge data sets (Kurimo et al., 2009).",
        "There is surprisingly little work that consider improving the unsupervised models of morphology with small amounts of annotated data.",
        "In the related tasks that deal with sequential labeling (word segmentation, POS tagging, shallow parsing, named-entity recognition), semi-supervised learning is more common.",
        "Snyder and Barzilay (2008a; 2008b) consider learning morphological segmentation with non-parametric Bayesian model from multilingual data.",
        "For multilingual settings, they extract 6 139 parallel short phrases from the Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic and English bible.",
        "Using the aligned phrase pairs, the model can learn the segmentations for two languages at the same time.",
        "In one of the papers (2008a), they consider also semi-supervised scenarios, where annotated data is available either in only one language or both of the languages.",
        "However, the amount of annotated data is fixed to the half of the full data.",
        "This differs from our experimental setting, where the amount of unlabeled data is very large and the amount of labeled data relatively small.",
        "Poon et al.",
        "(2009) apply a log-linear, undirected generative model for learning the morphology of Arabic and Hebrew.",
        "They report results for the same small data set as Snyder and Barzilay (2008a) in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.",
        "For the latter, they use somewhat smaller proportions of annotated data, varying from 25% to 100% of the total data, but the amount of unla-beled data is still very small.",
        "Results are reported also for a larger 120 000 word Arabic data set, but only for unsupervised learning.",
        "A problem similar to morphological segmentation is word segmentation for the languages where orthography does not specify word boundaries.",
        "However, the amount of labeled data is usually large, and unlabeled data is just an additional source of information.",

        "The model parameters 9 encode a morph lexicon, which includes the properties of the morphs, such as their string representations.",
        "Each morph m in the lexicon has a probability of occurring in a word, P(M = m\\6).",
        "The probabilities are assumed to be independent.",
        "The model uses a prior P(0), derived using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, that controls the complexity of the model.",
        "Intuitively, the prior assigns higher probability to models that store fewer morphs, where a morph is considered stored if P(M = m\\0) > 0.",
        "During model learning, 0 is optimized to maximize the posterior probability:",
        "where Dw includes the words in the training data.",
        "In this section, we first consider separately the likelihood P{Dw\\0) and the prior P{0) used in Morfessor Baseline.",
        "Then we describe the algorithms, first unsupervised and then semi-supervised, for finding optimal model parameters.",
        "Last, we shortly discuss the algorithm for segmenting new words after the model training.",
        "The latent variable of the model, Z = (Zi,..., Z\\Dw\\), contains the analyses of the words in the training data Dw- An instance of a single analysis for the j:th word is a sequence of morphs, Zj = (rriji,..., m,j\\z \\).",
        "During training, each word Wj is assumed to have only one possible analysis.",
        "Thus, instead of using the joint distribution P(Dw, Z I 0), we need to use the likelihood function only conditioned on the analyses of the observed words, P{Dw \\ Z,0).",
        "The conditional likelihood is where rriij is the i:th morph in word Wj.",
        "'We denote variables with uppercase letters and their instances with lowercase letters.",
        "Morfessor applies Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, so priors for the model parameters need to be defined.",
        "The parameters 6 of the model are:",
        "• Morph type count, or the size of the morph lexicon, ß G Z_|_",
        "• Morph token count, or the number of morphs tokens in the observed data, v G Z_|_",
        "• Morph counts (n,..., Tß), n G {1,..., u}, J2i Ti = v-Normalized with v, these give the probabilities of the morphs.",
        "MDL-inspired and non-informative priors have been preferred.",
        "When using such priors, morph type count and morph token counts can be neglected when optimizing the model.",
        "The morph string prior is based on length distribution P(L) and distribution P(C) of characters over the character set £, both assumed to be known:",
        "We use the implicit length prior (Creutz and Lagus, 2005), which is obtained by removing P(L) and using end-of-word mark as an additional character in P(C).",
        "For morph counts, the non-informative prior gives equal probability to each possible combination of the counts when ß and v are known, as there are (UZ\\) possible ways to choose ß positive integers that sum up to v.",
        "In principle, unsupervised learning can be performed by looking for the MAP estimate with the EM-algorithm.",
        "In the case of Morfessor Baseline, this is problematic, because the prior only assigns higher probability to lexicons where fewer morphs have nonzero probabilities.",
        "The EM-algorithm has the property that it will not assign a zero probability to any morph, that has a nonzero likelihood in the previous step, and this will hold for all morphs that initially have a nonzero probability.",
        "In consequence, Morfessor Baseline instead uses a local search algorithm, which will assign zero probability to a large part of the potential morphs.",
        "This is memory-efficient, since only the morphs with nonzero probabilities need to be stored in memory.",
        "The training algorithm of Morfessor Baseline, described by Creutz and Lagus (2005), tries to minimize the cost function by testing local changes to z, modifying the parameters according to each change, and selecting the best one.",
        "More specifically, one word is processed at a time, and the segmentation that minimizes the cost function with the optimal model parameters is selected:",
        "Next, the parameters are updated:",
        "As neither of the steps can increase the cost function, this will converge to a local optimum.",
        "The initial parameters are obtained by adding all the words into the morph lexicon.",
        "Due to the context independence of the morphs within a word, the optimal analysis for a segment does not depend on in which context the segment appears.",
        "Thus, it is possible to encode z as a binary treelike graph, where the words are the top nodes and morphs the leaf nodes.",
        "For each word, every possible split into two morphs is tested in addition to no split.",
        "If the word is split, the same test is applied recursively to its parts.",
        "See, e.g., Creutz and Lagus (2005) for more details and pseudo-code.",
        "A straightforward way to do semi-supervised learning is to fix the analyses z for the labeled examples.",
        "Early experiments indicated that this has little effect on the results.",
        "The Morfessor Baseline model only contains local parameters for morphs, and relies on the bias given by its prior to guide the amount of segmentation.",
        "Therefore, it may not be well suited for semi-supervised learning.",
        "The labeled data affects only the morphs that are found in the labeled data, and even their analyses can be overwhelmed by a large amount of unsupervised data and the bias of the prior.",
        "We suggest a fairly simple solution to this by introducing extra parameters that guide the more general behavior of the model.",
        "The amount of segmentation is mostly affected by the balance between the prior and the model.",
        "The Morfessor Baseline model has been developed to ensure this balance is sensible.",
        "However, the labeled data gives a strong source of information regarding the amount of segmentation preferred by the gold standard.",
        "We can utilize this information by introducing the weight a on the likelihood.",
        "To address the problem of labeled data being overwhelmed by the large amount of unlabeled data we introduce a second weight ß on the likelihood for the labeled data.",
        "These weights are optimized on a separate held-out set.",
        "Thus, instead of optimizing the MAP estimate, we minimize the following function:",
        "The labeled training set Dw^a may include alternative analyses for some of the words.",
        "Let A(wj) = {dji,..., cijk} be the set of known analyses for word Wj.",
        "Assuming the training samples are independent, and giving equal weight for each analysis, the likelihood of the labeled data would be j=l ajkeA(wj) i=l",
        "However, when the analyses of the words are fixed, the product over alternative analyses in A is problematic, because the model cannot select several of them at the same time.",
        "A sum over A(wj):s would avoid this problem, but then the logarithm of the likelihood function becomes non-trivial (i.e., logarithm of sum of products) and too slow to calculate during the training.",
        "Instead, we use the hidden variable Z to select only one analysis also for the labeled samples, but now with the restriction that Zj G A(wj).",
        "The likelihood function for Dw^a is then equivalent to Equation 2.",
        "Because the recursive algorithm search assumes that a string is segmented in the same way irrespective of its context, the labeled data can still get zero probabilities.",
        "In practice, zero probabilities in the labeled data likelihood are treated as very large, but not infinite, costs.",
        "After training the model, a Viterbi-like algorithm can be applied to find the optimal segmentation of each word.",
        "As proposed by Virpioja and Kohonen (2009), also new morph types can be allowed by utilizing an approximate cost of adding them to the lexicon.",
        "As this enables reasonable results also when the training data is small, we use a similar technique.",
        "The cost is calculated from the decrease in the probabilities given in Equations 3 and 4 when a new morph is assumed to be in the lexicon."

        "Especially the modeling of allomorphy might benefit from even small amounts of labeled data, because those allomorphs that are hardest to find (affixes, stems with irregular orthographic changes) are often more common than the easy cases, and thus likely to be found even from a small labeled data set.",
