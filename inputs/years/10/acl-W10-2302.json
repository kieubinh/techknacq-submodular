        "In order perform tasks where understanding the information conveyed by natural language is critical, today's applications demand better access to semantic knowledge.",
        "Knowledge about words and their meanings is typically structured in lexical ontologies, such as Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), but this kind of resources is most of the times handcrafted, which implies much time-consuming human effort.",
        "So, the automatic construction of such resources arises as an alternative, providing less intensive labour, easier maintenance and allowing for higher coverage, as a tradeoff for lower, but still acceptable, precision.",
        "This paper is written in the scope of a project where several textual resources are being exploited for the construction of a lexical ontology for Portuguese.",
        "We have already made a first approach on the extraction of relational triples from text, where, likewise Hearst (1992), we take advantage of textual patterns indicating semantic relations.",
        "However, the extracted triples are held between two terms, which is not enough to build a lexical ontology capable of dealing with ambiguity.",
        "Therefore, we present our current approach towards the automatic integration of lexico-semantic knowledge into a single independent lexical ontology, which will be structured on concepts and",

        "The task of establishing synsets and mapping term-based triples to them is closely related to word sense disambiguation, where the only available context consists of the connections in the term-base network.",
        "After contextualising this work, our approach is described.",
        "It involves (i) a clustering procedure for obtaining a thesaurus from a synonymy network, (ii) the augmentation of the later with manually created thesaurus, and (iii) mapping term-based relational triples to the thesaurus, to obtain a wordnet.",
        "Then, our experimentation results, as well as their validation, are presented.",
        "Briefly, we have tested the proposed approach on a term-based lexical network, extracted automatically from a dictionary.",
        "Synsets were validated manually while the attached triples were validated with the help of a web search engine."

      "heading": "2. Context",
      "text": [
        "Our ultimate goal is the automatic construction of a broad-coverage structure of words according to their meanings, also known as a lexical ontology, the first subject of this section.",
        "We proceed with a brief overview on work concerned with moving from term-based knowledge to synset-based knowledge, often called ontologising.",
        "Despite some terminological issues, lexical ontologies can be seen both as a lexicon and as an ontology (Hirst, 2004) and are significantly different from classic ontologies (Gruber, 1993).",
        "They are not based on a specific domain and are intended to provide knowledge structured on lexical items (words) of a language by relating them according to their meaning.",
        "Moreover, the main goal of a lexical ontology is to assemble lexical and semantic information, instead of storing common-sense knowledge (Wandmacher et al., 2007).",
        "Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is the most representative lexico-semantic resource for English and also the most accepted model of a lexical ontology.",
        "It is structured around groups of synonymous words (synsets), which describe concepts, and connections, denoting semantic relations between those groups.",
        "The success of WordNet led to the adoption of its model by lexical resources in different languages, such as the ones in the EuroWordNet project (Vossen, 1997), or WordNet.PT (Marrafa, 2002), for Portuguese.",
        "However, the creation of a wordnet, as well as the creation of most ontologies, is typically manual and involves much human effort.",
        "Some authors (de Melo and Weikum, 2008) propose translating Princeton WordNet to wordnets in other languages, but if this might be suitable for several applications, a problem arises because different languages represent different sociocultural realities, do not cover exactly the same part of the lexicon and, even where they seem to be common, several concepts are lexicalised differently (Hirst, 2004).",
        "Another popular alternative is to extract lexico-semantic knowledge and learn lexical ontologies from text.",
        "Research on this field is not new and varied methods have been proposed to achieve different steps of this task including the extraction of semantic relations (e.g. (Hearst, 1992) (Girju et al., 2006)) or sets of similar words (e.g. (Lin and",
        "Pantel, 2002) (Turney, 2001)).",
        "Whereas the aforementioned works are based on unstructured text, dictionaries started earlier (Calzolari et al., 1973) to be seen as an attractive target for the automatic acquisition of lexico-semantic knowledge.",
        "MindNet (Richardson et al., 1998) is both an extraction methodology and a lexical ontology different from a wordnet, since it was created automatically from a dictionary and its structure is based on such resources.",
        "Nevertheless, it still connects sense records with semantic relations (e.g. hyponymy, cause, manner).",
        "For Portuguese, PAPEL (Goncalo Oliveira et al., 2009) is a lexical network consisting of triples denoting semantic relations between words found in a dictionary.",
        "Other Portuguese lexical ontologies, created by different means, are reviewed and compared in (Santos et al., 2009) and (Teixeira et al., 2010).",
        "Besides corpora and dictionary processing, in the later years, semi-structured collaborative resources, such as Wikipedia or Wiktionary, have proved to be important sources of lexico-semantic knowledge and have thus been receiving more and more attention by the community (see for instance (Zesch et al., 2008) (Navarro et al., 2009)).",
        "Most of the methods proposed to extract relations from text have term-based triples as output.",
        "Such a triple, terml RELATION term2, indicates that a possible meaning of terml is related to a possible meaning of term2 by means of a RELATION.",
        "Although it is possible to create a lexical network from the latter, this kind of networks is often impractical for computational applications, such as the ones that deal with inference.",
        "For instance, applying a simple transitive rule, a SYNONYMLOF b A b SYNONYMLOF c – a SYNONYMLOF c over a set of term-based triples can lead to serious inconsistencies.",
        "A curious example in Portuguese, where synonymy between two completely opposite words is inferred, is reported in (Goncalo Oliveira et al., 2009): queda SYNONYMLOF ruina A queda SYNONYMLOF habilidade – ruina SYNONYMLOF habilidade.",
        "This happens because natural language is ambiguous, especially when dealing with broad-coverage knowledge.",
        "In the given example, queda can either mean downfall or aptitude, while ruina means ruin, destruction, downfall.",
        "A possible way to deal with ambiguity is to adopt a wordnet-like structure, where concepts are described by synsets and ambiguous words are included in a synset for each of their meanings.",
        "Semantic relations can thereby be unambiguously established between two synsets, and concepts, even though described by groups of words, bring together natural language and knowledge engineering in a suitable representation, for instance, for the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al., 2001).",
        "Of course that, from a linguistic point of view, word senses are complex and overlapping structures (Kilgarriff, 1997) (Hirst, 2004).",
        "So, despite word sense divisions in dictionaries and ontologies being most of the times artificial, this trade-off is needed in order to increase the usability of broad-coverage computational lexical resources.",
        "In order to move from term-based triples to an ontology, Soderland and Mandhani (2007) describe a procedure where, besides other stages, terms in triples are assigned to WordNet synsets.",
        "Starting with all the synsets containing a term in a triple, the term is assigned to the synset with higher similarity to the contexts from where the triple was extracted, computed based on the terms in the synset, sibling synsets and direct hyponym synsets.",
        "Two other methods for ontologising term-based triples are presented by Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008).",
        "One assumes that terms with the same relation to a fixed term are more plausible to describe the correct sense, so, to select the correct synset, it exploits triples of the same type sharing one argument.",
        "The other method, which seems to perform better, selects suitable synsets using generalisation through hypernymy links in WordNet.",
        "There are other works where WordNet is enriched, for instance with information in its glosses, domain knowledge extracted from text (e.g. (Harabagiu and Moldovan, 2000) (Navigli et al., 2004)) or wikipedia entries (e.g. (Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005)), thus requiring a disambiguation phase where terms are assigned to synsets.",
        "In the construction of a lexical ontology, synonymy plays an important role because it defines the conceptual base of the knowledge to be represented.",
        "One of the reasons for using WordNet synsets as a starting point for its representation is that, while it is quite straightforward to define a set of textual patterns indicative of several semantic relations between words (e.g. hyponymy, part-of, cause) with relatively good quality, the same does not apply for synonymy.",
        "In opposition to other kinds of relation, synonymous words, despite typically sharing similar neighbourhoods, may not co-occur frequently in unstructured text, especially in the same sentence (Dorow, 2006), leading to few indicative textual patterns.",
        "Therefore, most of the works on synonymy extraction from corpora rely on statistics or graph-based methods (e.g. (Lin and Pantel, 2002) (Turney, 2001) (Dorow, 2006)).",
        "Nevertheless, methods for synonymy identification based on co-occurrences (e.g. (Turney, 2001)) are more prone to identify similar words or near synonyms than real synonyms.",
        "On the other hand, synonymy instances can be quite easily extracted from resources structured on words and meanings, such as dictionaries, by taking advantage not only of textual patterns, more frequent in those resources (e.g. tambem con-hecido por/como, o mesmo que, for Portuguese), but also of definitions consisting of only one word or a enumeration, which typically contain synonyms of the defined word.",
        "So, as it is possible to create a lexical network from a set of relational triples (a R b), a synonymy network can be created out of synonymy instances (a SYNONYMLOF b).",
        "Since these networks tend to have a clustered structure, Gfeller et al.",
        "(2005) propose a clustering procedure to improve their utility."

        "The research presented here is in the scope of a project whose final goal is to create a lexical ontology for Portuguese by automatic means.",
        "Although there are clear advantages of using resources already structured on words and meanings, dictionaries are static resources which contain limited knowledge and are not always available for this kind of research.",
        "On the other hand, there is much text available on the most different subjects, but free text has few boundaries, leading to more ambiguity and parsing issues.",
        "Therefore, it seems natural to create a lexical ontology with knowledge from several textual sources, from (i) high precision structured resources, such as manually created thesaurus, to (ii) semi-structured resources such as dictionaries or collaborative encyclopedias, as well as (iii) unstructured textual corpora.",
        "Likewise Wandmacher et al.",
        "(2007) propose for creating a lexical ontology for German, these are the general lines we will follow in our research, but for Portuguese.",
        "Considering each resource specificities, including its organisation or the vocabulary used, the extraction procedures might be significantly different, but they should all have one common output: a set of term-based relational triples that will be integrated in a single lexical ontology.",
        "Whereas the lexical network established by the triples could be used, these networks are not suitable for several tasks, as discussed in Section 2.2.",
        "A fragment of a synonymy network extracted from a Portuguese dictionary can be seen in Figure 1.",
        "Since all the connections imply synonymy, the network suggests that all the words are synonymous, which is not true.",
        "For example, the word copista may have two very distinct meanings: (a) a person who writes copies of written documents or (b) someone who drinks a lot of wine.",
        "On the other hand, other words which may refer to the same concept as, for instance, meaning (a) of copista, such as escrevente, escriväo or transcritor.",
        "So, in order to deal with ambiguity in natural language, we will adopt a wordnet-like structure which enables the establishment of unambiguous semantic relations between synsets."

      "heading": "4. Approach",
      "text": [
        "Considering our goal, a set of term-based triples goes through the following stages: (i) clustering over the synonymy network for the establishment of synsets, to obtain a thesaurus; (ii) augmentation of the thesaurus by merging it with synsets from other resources; (iii) assignment of each argument of a term-based triple (except synonymy) to a synset in the thesaurus, to obtain a wordnet.",
        "Note that stages (i) and (ii) are not both mandatory, but at least one must be performed to obtain the synsets.",
        "Looking at some of the works referred in Section 2.2, ours is different because it does not require a conceptual base such as WordNet.",
        "Also, it integrates knowledge from different sources and tries to disambiguate each word using only knowledge already extracted and not the context where the word occurs.",
        "This stage was originally defined after looking at disconnected pieces of a synonymy network extracted from a dictionary, which had a clustered structure apparently suitable for identifying synsets.",
        "This is also noticed by Gfeller et al.",
        "(2005) who have used the Markov Clustering algorithm (MCL) (van Dongen, 2000) to find clusters in a synonymy network.",
        "Therefore, since MCL had already been applied to problems very close to ours (e.g. (Gfeller et al., 2005), (Dorow, 2006)), it seemed to suit our purpose - it would not only organise a term-based network into a thesaurus, but, if a network extracted from several resources is used, clustering would homogenise the synonymy representation.",
        "MCL finds clusters by simulating random walks within a graph by alternately computing random walks of higher length, and increasing the probabilities of intra-cluster walks.",
        "It can be briefly described in five steps: (i) take the adjacency matrix A of the graph; (ii) normalise each column of A to 1 in order to obtain a stochastic matrix S; (iii) compute S ; (iv) take the 7th power of every element of S and normalise each column to 1; (v) go back to (ii) util MCL converges to a matrix idempotent under steps (ii) and (iii).",
        "Since MCL is a hard-clustering algorithm, it assigns each term to only one cluster thus removing ambiguities.",
        "To deal with this, Gfeller et al.",
        "(2005) propose an extension to MCL for finding unstable nodes in the graph, which frequently denote ambiguous words.",
        "This is done by adding random stochastic noise, 6, to the non-zero entries of the adjacency matrix and then running MCL with noise several times.",
        "Looking at the clusters obtained by each run, a new matrix can be filled based on the probability of each pair of words belonging to the same cluster.",
        "We have adopted this procedure, with slight differences.",
        "First, we observed that, for the network we used, the obtained clusters were closer to the desired results if – 0.5 < 6 < 0.5.",
        "Additionally, in the first step of MCL, we use frequency-weighted adjacency matrixes F, where each element Fy corresponds to the number of existing synonymy instances between i and j.",
        "Although using only one dictionary each synonymy instance will be extracted at most two times (a SYNONYMLOF b and b SYNONYMLOF a), if more resources are used, it will strengthen the probability that two words appearing frequently as synonyms belong to the same cluster.",
        "Therefore, the clustering stage has the following steps: (i) split the original network into subnetworks, such that there is no path between two elements in different sub-networks, and calculate the frequency-weighted adjacency matrix F of each sub-network; (ii) add stochastic noise to each entry of F, Fy = Fy- + Fy- * 6; (iii) run MCL, with 7 = 1.6, over F for 30 times; (iv) use the (hard) clustering obtained by each one of the 30 runs to create a new matrix P with the probabilities of each pair of words in F belonging to the same cluster; (v) create the clusters based on P and on a given threshold 6 = 0.2.",
        "If Pij > 6, i and j belong to the same cluster; (vi) in order to clean the results, remove: (a) big clusters, B, if there is a group of clusters C = C\\,C2, ...Cn such that B = Ci UC2 U... UCn;(b) clusters completely included in other clusters.",
        "Applying this procedure to the network in Figure 1 results in the four represented clusters.",
        "There, ambiguous words escriväo and escriba are included in two different clusters.",
        "In this stage, other resources with synsets, such as manually created thesaurus, are merged together and then merged with the thesaurus obtained in the previous stage, by the following procedure: (i) define one thesaurus as the basis B and the other as T ; (ii) create a new empty thesaurus M and copy all the synsets in B to M ; (iii) for each synset T G T, find the synsets Bi G B with higher Jac-card coefficient c, and add them to a set of synsets J C B.",
        "(iv) considering c and J, do one of the following: (a) if c = 1, it means that the synset is already in M, so nothing is done; (b) if c = 0, Ti is copied to M ; (c) if | J | = 1, the synset in J is copied to M ; (d) if | J | > 1, a new set, n = Ti U J' where J' = ui=0 Ji, Ji G J, is created, and all elements of J are removed from M.",
        "The synsets of the resulting thesaurus will be used as the conceptual base in which the term-based triples are going to be mapped.",
        "After the previous stages, the following are available: (i) a thesaurus T and (ii) a term-based semantic network, N , where each edge has a type, R, and denotes a semantic relation held between the meaning of the terms in the two nodes it connects.",
        "Using T and N , this stage tries to map term-based triples to synset-based triples, or, in other words, assign each term, a and b, in each triple, (a R b) G N , to suitable synsets.",
        "The result is a knowledge base organised as a wordnet.",
        "In order to assign a to a synset A, b is fixed and all the synsets containing a, Sa C T, are collected.",
        "If a is not in the thesaurus, it is assigned to a new synset A = (a).",
        "Otherwise, for each synset Sai G Sa, nai is the number of terms t G Sai such that (t R b) holds.",
        "Then, pai = is calculated.",
        "Finally, all the synsets with the highest paiare added to C and (i) if | C| = 1 , a is assigned to the only synset in C; (ii) if | C | > 1, C' is the set of elements of C with the highest na and, if |C'| = 1, a is assigned the synset in C', unless pai < 6 ; (iii) if it is not possible to assign a synset to a, it remains unassigned.",

        "Note that, for experimentation purposes, we have only used the parts of these resources concerning nouns.",

        "Evaluation of a new broad-coverage ontology is most of the times performed by one of two means: (i) manual evaluation of a representative subset of the results; (ii) automatic comparison with a gold standard.",
        "However, while for English most researchers use Princeton WordNet as a gold standard, for other languages it is difficult to find suitable and freely available consensual resources.",
        "Considering Portuguese, as we have said earlier, TeP and OT are effectively two manually created thesaurus but, since they are more complementary than overlapping to PAPEL, we thought it would be better to use them to enrich our resource.",
        "There is actually a report (Raman and Bhat-tacharyya, 2008) with an automatic evaluation of synsets, but we decided no to follow it because this evaluation is heavily based on a dictionary and we do not have unrestricted access to a full and updated dictionary of Portuguese and also, indirectly by PAPEL, a dictionary was one of our main sources of information.",
        "Therefore, our choice relied on manual validation of the synsets of CLIP and TOP.",
        "Furthermore, synset-based triples were validated in an alternative automatic way using a web search engine.",
        "Ten reviewers took part in the validation of ten random samples with approximately 50 synsets from each thesaurus.",
        "We made sure that each synset was not in more than one sample and synsets with more than 50 terms were not validated.",
        "Also, in order to measure the reviewer agreement, each sample was analysed by two different reviewers.",
        "Given a sample, each reviewer had to classify each synset as: correct (1), if, in some context, all the terms of the synset could have the same meaning, or incorrect (0), if at least one term of the synset could never mean the same as the others.",
        "The reviewers were advised to look for the possible meanings of each word in different dictionaries.",
        "Still, if they could not find them, or if they did not know how to classify the synset, they had a third option, N/A (2).",
        "In the end, 519 synsets of CLIP and 480 of TOP were validated.",
        "When organising the validation results we noticed that the biggest synsets were the ones with more problems.",
        "So, besides the complete validation results, Table 3 also contains the results considering only synsets of ten or less words, when a ' is after the name of the thesaurus.",
        "The presented numbers are the average between the classifications given by the two reviewers and the agreement rate corresponds to the number of times both reviewers agreed on the classification.",
        "Even though these results might be subjective, since they are based on the reviewers criteria and on the dictionaries they used, they can give an insight on the quality of the synsets.",
        "The precision results are acceptable and are improved if the automatically created thesaurus is merged with the ones created manually, and also when bigger synsets are ignored.",
        "Most of the times, big synsets are confusing because they bring together more than one concept that share at least one term.",
        "For instance, take the synset: insobriedade, desmedida, imoderaçâo, excesso, nimiedade, desmando, desbragamento, troco, descontrolo, superabundancia, desbunda, desregramento, demasia, incontinencia, imodici-dade, superaçcâo, intemperancca, descomedimento, superfluidade, sobejidao, acrasia, where there is a mix of the concepts: (a) insobriety, not following all the rules, heedless of the consequences and, (b) surplus.",
        "Both of these concepts can be referred to as an excess (excesso).",
        "The automatic validation of the triples attached to our wordnet consisted of using Google web search engine to look for evidence on their truth.",
        "This procedure started by removing terms whose occurrences in Google were less than 5,000.",
        "Synsets that became empty were not considered and, from the rest, a sample was selected for each one of the three types of relation.",
        "Following the idea in (Goncalo Oliveira et al., 2009), a set of natural language generic patterns, indicative of each relation, was defined having in mind their input to Google .",
        "Then, for each triple (A R B), the patterns were used to search for evidence on each combination of terms a G A and b G B connected by a pattern indicative of R. The triple validation score was then calculated by expression 1, where found(A, B, R) = 1 if evidence is found for the triple or 0 otherwise.",
        "Table 4 shows the results obtained for each validated sample.",
        "Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008) perform a similar task and present precision results 45%) relations.",
        "It is however not possible to make a straight comparison.",
        "For their experimentation, they selected only correct term-based triples extracted from text and their results were manually validated by human judges.",
        "On the other hand, we have used term-based triples extracted automatically from a dictionary, with high but not 100% precision, from where we did not choose only the correct ones, and we have used synsets obtained from our clustering procedure which, once again, have lower precision.",
        "Moreover, we validated our results with Google where, despite its huge dimension, there are plenty of ways to denote a semantic relation, when we had just a small set textual patterns.",
        "Also, despite occurring more than 5,000 times in Google, some terms correctly included in a synset were conveying less common meanings.",
        "Nevertheless, we could not agree more with Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008) who state that attaching term-based triples to an ontology is not an easy task.",
        "Therefore, we believe our results to be promising and, if more refined rules are added to our set, which is still very simple, they will surely be improved."
