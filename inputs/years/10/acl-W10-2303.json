        "The cognitive influence of frequency has been proven strong in the learning process of both sense and nonsense words (Howes and Solomon, 1951; Solomon and Postman, 1952).",
        "Frequency has also been shown to highly correlate with semantic factors, endorsing its importance, through the so called \"light verbs\" (Goldberg, 1999).",
        "In this study, we investigate whether words that are more frequent have a higher chance of earlier acquisition.",
        "For this purpose, we compare data from children and adults, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, on an action naming task, looking at lexical evolution, using statistical and topological analysis of the data modeled as graphs.",
        "Our approach innovates in the sense that it directly simulates the influence of a linguistic factor over the process of lexical evolution.",

        "(2008).",
        "The adult group is unrelated to the children, and aged between 17;0 and 34;0 (average 21;8).",
        "Participants were shown 17 actions of destruction or division (Tonietto et al., 2008) and asked to describe it.",
        "Data processing and justification of the chosen domain are described in Germann et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "The answers given by each participant were collected and annotated with two frequency scores, each calculated from a different source.",
        "The first, Fscore, is the number of occurrences of the verb in the \"Florianopolis\" corpus (Scliar-Cabral, 1993; MacWhinney, 2000).",
        "The second, Yscore, is the number of given results searching for the infinitive form of the verb in the 'Yahoo!\"",

        "Linguistic production of each group was expressed in terms of graphs, whose nodes represent the mentioned verbs.",
        "All verbs uttered for the same video were assumed share semantic information, and then linked together, forming a (clique) subgraph.",
        "The subgraphs were then connected in a merging step, through the words uttered for more than one video.",
        "To investigate the influence of frequency on the language acquisition process, we used it to change the network over time.",
        "Network involution, the strategy adopted, works in the opposite way than network growth (Albert and Barabâsi, 2002).",
        "Instead of adding nodes, it takes an older group graph as the source and decides on the nodes to iteratively remove (taking the younger group graph only as a reference for comparison).",
        "Verbs were ranked in increasing order of frequency.",
        "At each step of graph involution, the less frequent verb was selected to be removed, and the resulting graph was measured.",
        "Results are reported in terms of the averages of 10-fold cross-validation (because ties imply in random selection).",
        "Graph theory metrics were used to measure structural similarity: average minimal path length (L), density (D), average node connectivity (k) and average clustering coefficient (CA).",
        "In the involution, k and D, measure semantic share, since that is what relations among nodes are supposed to mean (see above).",
        "L and C/s are intended to measure vocabulary uniformity, since greater distances and lower clusterization are related to the presence of subcenters of meaning.",
        "In order to compare the contents of each graph as well, we employed a measure of set similarity: Jaccard's similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901).",
        "Given two sets A and B, the Jaccard's coefficient J can be calculated as follows :",
        "where \"x\" is the number of elements in both A and B, \"y\" is the number of elements only in A, and \"z\" is the number of elements only in B.",
        "Simulation Results",
        "As we remove the verbs with lower frequency from the graph of an older group, the overall structure should approximate to that of a younger group, and both should get more similar concerning content.",
        "Therefore, the most relevant part of each chart is the begging: the first removed verbs are expected to be those that differentiate graphs.",
        "The graph theory metrics are shown in Figures 1 and 2 in terms of 2 lines: network involution (a) by using the selected criterion, and (b) by using random selection (10-fold cross validation).",

        "In Figure 1, columns represent a graph theory metric, and rows represent the use of a different score.",
        "Each legend refers to all charts.",
        "The results for the simulations from G2 to G1, (Figure 1) show that the four metrics are clearly distinct from random elimination from the beginning, indicating that frequency plays a role in the process.",
        "C/s is particularly distinct from random: while the former remains constant almost to the end, indicating a highly structured (clustered) graph, the later shows effects of graph partitioning.",
        "The remaining metrics presented their greatest approximations to the reference line before the middle of the chart, suggesting that the initial verbs were actually the ones differentiating both graphs.",
        "These results suggest an initial increase in semantic share, as k and D increase, and in uniformity, as nodes get closer to one another (L) and remain clustered (C/s).",
        "In Figure 2, the same tendencies are maintained, although not as clearly as the previous results.",
        "The greatest approximations of k and D happen in the first half of the chart, but in a smoother way.",
        "C/s still behaves steadily, remaining stable during most of the simulation.",
