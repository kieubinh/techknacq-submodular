        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) investigates methods to automatically determine the intended sense of a word in a given context according to a predefined set of sense definitions, provided by a semantic lexicon.",
        "Intuitively, WSD can be usefully exploited in a variety of NLP (e.g. Machine Translation (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007)) and Information Retrieval tasks such as ad hoc retrieval (Krovetz, 1997; Kim et al., 2004) or Question Answering (Beale et al., 2004).",
        "However controversial results have been often obtained, as for example the study on text classification reported in (Moschitti and Basili, open issue and large scale assessment is needed.",
        "For this reason, unsupervised approaches to inductive WSD are appealing.",
        "In contrast with supervised methods that strongly rely on manually labeled data sets, those methods do not require annotated examples for all words and can thus support realistic (large scale) benchmarks, as needed in IR research.",
        "In recent years different approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation task have been evaluated through comparative campaigns, such as the earlier Senseval evaluation exercises.",
        "(Palmer et al., 2001; Snyder and Palmer, 2004) or the most recent (Pradhan et al., 2007).",
        "The best accuracy is reached by WSD based on supervised methods that exploit large amounts of hand-tagged data to train discriminative or generative disambiguation models.",
        "The common alternative to supervised systems are knowledge-based WSD systems that try to exploit information made available by large Lexical Knowledge Bases (LKB).",
        "They enable the definition of several metrics to estimate semantic similarity (e.g. (Lesk, 1986) or (Agirre and Rigau, 1996), (Basili et al., 2004) methods) and then use it to rank the alternative senses according to the incoming context.",
        "Moreover they make available large relationship sets between pairs of lexical meaning units, such as synonymy, hyponymy or meronymy.",
        "The resulting networks represent at various grains and degrees of approximation models of the mental lexicons.",
        "It is not by chance that early research on WSD based on semantic dictionaries were applying models of network activation processes (in particular simulated annealing as in (Cowie et al., 1992)) for precise and fast disambiguation.",
        "It has been more recently that graph-based methods for knowledge-based WSD have gained much attention in the NLP community ((Sinha (Agirre and Soroa, 2008), (Agirre and Soroa, 2009)).",
        "In these methods a graph representation for senses (nodes) and relation (edges) is first built.",
        "Then graph-based techniques that are sensible to the structural properties of the graph are used to find the best senses for words in the incoming contexts.",
        "The relation employed by the different methods are of several types such as synonymy, antonymy but also co-occurrence based lexical similarity computed externally over a corpus.",
        "These give rise to real-valued weights that determine large weighted directed graphs.",
        "Usually, the employed disambiguation is carried out by ranking the graph nodes.",
        "Thus the concepts with highest ranks are assigned to the corresponding words.",
        "In (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), a comparative analysis of different graph-based models over two well known WSD benchmarks is reported.",
        "In the paper two variants of the random surfer model as defined by PageRank model (Brin and Page, 1998) are analyzed.",
        "A special emphasis for the resulting computational efficiency is also posed there.",
        "In particular, a variant called Personalized PageRank (PPR) is proposed (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) that tries to trade-off between the amount of the employed lexical information and the overall efficiency.",
        "In synthesis, along the ideas of the Topic sensitive PageRank (Haveli-wala, 2002), PPR suggests that a proper initialization of the teleporting vector p suitably captures the context information useful to drive the random surfer PageRank model over the graph to converge towards the proper senses in fewer steps.",
        "The basic idea behind the adoption of PPR is to impose a personalized vector that expresses the contexts of all words targeted by the disambiguation.",
        "This method improves on the complexity of the previously presented methods (e.g. (Agirre and Soroa, 2008)) as it allows to contextualize the behaviors of PageRank over a sentence, without asking for a different graph: in this way the WordNet graph is always adopted, in a word or sentence oriented fashion.",
        "Moreover, it is possible to avoid to rebuild a graph for each target word, as the entire sentence can be coded into the personalization vector.",
        "In (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), a possible, and more accurate alternative, is also presented called PPR word2word (PPRw2w) where a different personalization vector is used for each word in a sentence.",
        "Although clearly less efficient in terms of time complexity, this approach guarantees the best accuracy, so that it can be considered the state-of-the art in unsupervised WSD.",
        "In this paper a different approach to personalization of the PageRank is presented, aiming at preserving the suitable efficiency of the sentence oriented PPR algorithm for WSD but achieving an accuracy at least as high as the PPRw2w one.",
        "We propose to use distributional evidence that can be automatically acquired from a corpus to define the topical information encoded by the personalization vector, in order to amplify the bias on the resulting PPR and improve the performance of the sentence oriented version.",
        "The intuition is that distributional evidence is able to cover the gap between word oriented usages of the PPR as for the PPRw2w defined in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), and its sentence oriented counterpart.",
        "In this way we can preserve higher accuracy levels while limiting the number of PageRank runs, i.e. increasing efficiency.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first give a more detailed overview of the PageRank and Personalized PageRank algorithms in Section 2.",
        "In Section, 3 a description of our distributional approach to the personalized PageRank is provided.",
        "A comparative evaluation with respect to previous works is then reported in Section 4 while section 5 is left for conclusions."

      "text": [
        "Word sense disambiguation algorithms in the class of graph-based method are unsupervised approaches to WSD that rely almost exclusively on the lexical KB graph structure for inferring the relevance of word senses for a given context.",
        "Much current work in WSD assume that meaning distinctions are provided by a reference lexicon (the LKB), which encodes a discrete set of senses for each individual word.",
        "Although the largely adopted reference resource is WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), the graph-based algorithms are not limited to this particular lexicon.",
        "In these methods, nodes are derived from the sense units, i.e. the synsets, and edges are derived from semantic relations established between synsets.",
        "We will hereafter use WordNet to discuss the details of the different steps.",
        "Every algorithm can be decomposed in a set of general steps:",
        "Building the graph.",
        "The first step proceeds to the definition of the graph structure.",
        "As introduced before, WordNet is mapped into a graph whose nodes are concepts (represented by synsets (i.e., synonym sets)) and whose edges are semantic relations between concepts (e.g., hyperonymy, meronymy).",
        "For each sentence, a graph G = (V, E) is built, which is derived from the entire graph of the reference lexicon.",
        "More formally, given a sentence a = w1,w2,wn, where wiis a word, the following steps are executed to build G: (1) the sense vocabulary Va is derived as Va := Un=i Senses(wi), where Senses(wi) is the set of senses of any of the wi of the sentence.",
        "(2) For each node v G Va, a visit of the WordNet graph is performed: every time a node v' G Va (v' = v) is encountered along a path v – v1 – ... – vk – v all intermediate nodes and edges on the palh from v to v' are added to the graph: V := V\\J{v1,... ,vk} and E := E\\J{(v,v1),..., (vk,v')}.",
        "The constructed graph is the subgraph covering the nodes and relations of all the relevant vocabulary in the sentence.",
        "Sense Ranking.",
        "The derived graph is then used with different ranking models to find the correct senses of words into the sentence a.",
        "A suitable interpretation of the source sentence can be in fact obtained by ranking each vertex in the graph G according its centrality.",
        "In (Navigli and Lapata, 2007) different ranking models are described.",
        "The specific algorithm presented in (Agirre and Soroa, 2008) is the major inspiration of the present paper, and makes use of PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) to rank edges in the graph G. PageRank tries to separate these nodes from the other candidate synsets of words in a, which are expected to activate less relations on average and remain isolated.",
        "Let the vector Rank express the probability to reach any of the vertices Va, and let M represent the edge information.",
        "The expected rank between senses satisfies:",
        "whereas 0 < a < 1. a is called the damping factor.",
        "It models the amount of likelihood that a generic Web surfer, standing at a vertex, randomly follows a link from this vertex toward any other vertex in the graph: the uniform probability pi = N Vi, is assigned to each one of the N vertices in G. While it guarantees the convergence of the algorithm, it expresses the trade-off between the probability of following links provided by the Web graph and the freedom to violate them.",
        "An interesting aspect of the ranking process is the initial state.",
        "Many algorithms (as well as the one proposed by (Agirre and Soroa, 2009)) initialize the ranks of the vertex at a uniform value (usually 1/N for a graph with N vertices).",
        "Then Equation 1 is iterated until convergence is achieved or a maximum fix number of iterations has been reached.",
        "Disambiguation.",
        "Finally, the disambiguation step is performed by assigning to each word wi in the source sentence a, the associated j-th concept senseij (i.e. the j-th valid interpretation for wi) associated to the maximum resulting rank.",
        "In case of ties all the concepts with maximum rank are assigned to wi G a.",
        "The above process has several sources of complexity, but the major burden is related to the Sense ranking step.",
        "While complex methods have been proposed (as discussed in (Navigli and Lapata, 2007) ), sentence oriented algorithms, that build the graph G once per each sentence a, whatever the number of wi G a is, are much more efficient.",
        "The problem is twofold:",
        "• How different sentences can be targeted without major changes in the graph G?",
        "How the matrix M can be made as much reusable as possible?",
        "• How to encode in Eq.",
        "1 the incoming context in order to properly address the different words in the sentence a?",
        "In order to address the above problems, in line with the notion of topic-sensitive PageRank, a personalized PageRank approach has been recently devised (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) as discussed in the next section.",
        "In (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), a novel use of PageRank for word sense disambiguation is presented.",
        "It aims to present an optimized version of the algorithm previously discussed in (Agirre and Soroa, 2008) .",
        "The main difference concerns the method used to initialize and use the graph G for disambiguating a sentence with respect to the overall graph (hereafter GKB) that represents the complete lexicon.",
        "Previous methods (such as (Agirre and Soroa, 2008) ) derive G as the subgraph of GKB whose vertices and edges are particularly relevant for the given input sentence a.",
        "Such a subgraph is often called the disambiguation subgraph a, GD(a).",
        "GD is a subgraph of the original GKB, obtained by computing the shortest paths between the concepts of the words co-occurring in the context.",
        "These are expected to capture most of the information relevant to the disambiguation (i.e. sense ranking) step.",
        "The alternative proposed in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) allows a more static use of the full LKB.",
        "Context words are newly introduced into the graph G as nodes, and linked with directed edges (i.e. the lexical relations) to their respective concepts (i.e. synsets).",
        "Topic-sensitive PageRank over the graph G (Haveliwala, 2002) is then applied: the initial probability mass is concentrated uniformly over the newly introduced word nodes through the setting of the personalization vector p in Eq.",
        "1 (Haveliwala, 2002).",
        "Words are linked to the concepts by directed edges that act as sources to propagate probability into the GKB concepts they are associated with.",
        "A personalized PageRank vector is finally produced that defines a measure of the (topological) relevance of the GKB nodes (concepts) activated by the input context.",
        "The overall time complexity is limited by the above sketched Personalized PageRank approach (PPR) as a single initialization of the graph GKB is requested for an entire target sentence.",
        "This sentence oriented method reuses the GKB of the entire lexicon, while the second step runs the sense ranking once for all the words.",
        "This method reduces the number of invocations of PageRank thus lowering the average disambiguation time.",
        "A word oriented version of the algorithm is also proposed in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009).",
        "It defines different initializations for the different words wi G a: these are obtained by setting the initial probability mass in pp to 0 for all the senses Sense(wi) of the targeted wi.",
        "In this way, only the context words and not the target are used for the personalization step.",
        "This approach to the personalized PageRank is termed word-by-word or PPRw2w version in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009).",
        "PPRw2w is run on the same graph but with n different initializations where n is the number of words in a.",
        "Although less efficient, PPRw2w is shown to outperform the sentence oriented PPR model."

        "They can be acquired through large scale corpus analysis in the so called distributional approaches to language modeling.",
        "While contexts can be defined in different ways (e.g as the set of words surrounding a target word), their analysis over large corpora has been shown to effectively capture topical and paradigmatic relations (Sahlgren, 2006).",
        "We propose to use the topical information about a sentence a, acquired through Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), as a source information for the initialization of the vector pp in the PPR (or PPRw2w) disambiguation methods.",

        "Third, similarities are computed in a lower dimensional space, thus speeding up the computation.",
        "For the above reasons by mapping a word, or a sentence, in the corresponding Latent Semantic Space, we can estimate the set of its similar words according to implicit semantic relations acquired in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "This can be profitably used as a personalization model for PPR.",
        "For the WSD task, our aim is to exploit an externally acquired semantic space to expand the incoming sentence a into a set of novel terms, different but semantically related with the words in a.",
        "In analogy with topic-driven PageRank, the use of these words as a seed for the iterative algorithm is expected to amplify the effect of local information (i.e. a) onto the recursive propagation across the lexical network: the interplay of the global information provided by the whole lexical network with the local information characterizing the initialization lexicon is expected to maximize their independent effect.",
        "More formally, let the matrix Wk := UkSk be the matrix that represents the lexicon in the k-dimensional LSA space.",
        "Given an input sentence a, a vector representation w – – i for each term wi in a is made available.",

        "Every row pair compares the LSA model with the original corresponding UKB version over a given graph (from WN1.7 to WN30g).",
        "For each model the accuracy corresponding to two iterations (5 and 15) is reported to analyze also the overall trend during PageRank.",
        "The best F1 scores between any pair are emphasized in bold, to comparatively asses the results.",
        "As a confirmation of the outcome in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), different lexical resources achieve different results.",
        "In general by adopting the graph lower performance can be achieved.",
        "Moreover, the word-by-word model (last three columns for the w2w side of the Table) is evidently superior.",
        "Interestingly, almost on every type of graph and for every approach (sentence or word oriented) the LSA-based method outperforms the original UKB PPR.",
        "This confirms that the impact of the topical information provided by the LSA expansion of the sentence is beneficial for a better use of the lexical graph.",
        "An even more interesting outcome is that the improvement implied by the proposed LSA method on the sentence oriented model (i.e. the standard PPR method of (Agirre and Soroa, 2009)) is higher, so that the difference between the performances of the PPRw2w model are no longer strikingly better than the PPR one.",
        "For example, on the simple WN1.7 hyponymy network the PPR - LSA100 method abolishes the gap of about 4% previously observed for the PPR-UKB model.",
        "When LSA is used, it seems that the word-by-word approach is no longer required.",
        "On the contrary, in the WN17x case the best figure after 5 iterations is obtained by the PPR-LSA100 method instead of the w2w-LSA100 one (71.5% vs. 71.1%).",
        "The good accuracy reachable by the sentence oriented strategy (i.e. LSA100 and w2w) is also very interesting as for the higher efficiency of the PPR approach with respect to the word-byword PPRw2w one.",
        "In the attempt to validate the hypothesis that LSA is helpful to improve time complexity of the WSD, we analyzed the processing times of the different data sets, in order to cross compare methods and resources.",
        "The aim of the evaluation is to study the contribution of the sentence expansion using Latent Semantic Analysis and the Page Rank algorithm.",
        "Tests were performed comparing different parameter values (e.g. cardinality t of the sentence expansion, different values for the acceptability threshold) as well as several settings of the damping factor for the personalized PageRank algorithm (Eq 1) and the number of iterations over the KB Graph.",
        "In figure 1, the processing speed, measured as seconds per sentence, has been plot for different graphs and configurations.",
        "Notice that one sentence is equivalent on average to 9,6 target words.",
        "As clearly shown in the figure, the processing times for the word-by-word method over the extended WN 1.7 (i.e. WN17x) are not acceptable for IR tasks such as query processing, or document indexing.",
        "For an entire document of about 20 sentences the overall amount of processing required by the w2w_17x_UKB method is about 45 minutes.",
        "Word-by-word methods are just slightly more efficient whenever applied to graphs with lower connectivity (e.g. WN17 vs. WN17x as in Fig. 1 left plot).",
        "The same tasks with PPR methods are solved in a quite faster way, with a general ratio of 1:14 with the extended versions and 1:6 with the hyponymy graphs.",
        "The processing time of the proposed LSA method is thus at least 6 times faster than the UKB method with the comparable accuracy level.",
        "Moreover, as accuracy between PPR and w2w is comparable when LSA is adopted, this efficiency can be guaranteed at no loss in accuracy.",
        "By integrating the evidence of Figure 1 with the ones of Table 1, we observe that accuracy reachable by LSA-UKB is independent by the standard or word-by-word configuration so that the overall process can be made about 10 times faster.",
        "Notice that the representation in the LSA space that is projected for a target sentence can be easily obtained also for longer text fragments.",
        "Moreover, as for the one sense per discourse hypothesis it is possible that every word can be processed once in an entire text.",
        "This suggests that a document oriented usage of the personalized PageRank based on LSA can be designed achieving the maximal efficiency.",
        "In order to evaluate the corresponding impact on accuracy a dedicated dataset has been defined and more tests have been run, as discussed hereafter.",
        "Figure 1: Processing Times for the PPR, w2w and LSA methods as applied on the WN 1.7 (left plot) and WN 3.0 (right plot) resources, respectively: 17x and 30g refer to test over the extended resources.",
        "While the LSA model has been actually applied to determine an expansion for the entire target sentence, nothing prevents to apply it to larger text units, in order to bias the PageRank for all words in a document.",
        "In order to verify if such a process disambiguation could preserve the same accuracy, we measured the accuracy reachable over the same Semeval'07 data organized in documents.",
        "The sentences have been grouped in 5 documents, made of about about 250 sentences: during the tagging process, the system generates a lexical expansion for an entire document, about 450 target words on average.",
        "Then PageRank is carried out and the resulting ranking is projected to the senses of all the targeted words in the document.",
        "Due to the much wider locality managed in this process, a larger cardinality for the expansion is used and the most similar 400 words are collected as a bias for the PageRank.",
        "The accuracy reachable is reported in Table 4.3.",
        "As expected, the same trends as for the sentence based approach are observed: the best resource is still the WN17x for which the best results is obtained.",
        "However, the crucial result here is that no drop in performance is also observed.",
        "This implies that the much more efficient document oriented strategy can be always applied through LSA without major changes in accuracy.",
        "Also results related to the processing time follow the trends of the sentence based method.",
        "Accordingly 28 seconds required to process a document in the worst case is an impressive achievement because the same accuracy was obtained, without LSA, in 2 orders of magnitude more time."
