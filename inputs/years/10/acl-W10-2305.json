        "An important advantage of this clustering method over other dialec-tometric methods is that the linguistic basis is simultaneously determined, bridging the gap between traditional and quantitative dialectology.",
        "Besides showing that the results of the hierarchical clustering improve over the flat spectral clustering method used in an earlier study (Wieling and Nerbonne, 2009), the values of the second singular vector used to generate the two-way clustering can be used to identify the most important sound correspondences for each cluster.",

        "For almost forty years quantitative methods have been applied to the analysis of dialect variation (Seguy, 1973; Goebl, 1982; Nerbonne et al., 1999).",
        "Until recently, these methods focused mostly on identifying the most important dialectal groups using an aggregate analysis of the linguistic data.",
        "One of these quantitative methods, clustering, has been applied frequently to dialect data, especially in an effort to compare computational analyses to traditional views on dialect areas (Davis and Houck, 1995; Clopper and Pisoni, 2004; Heeringa, 2004; Moisl and Jones, 2005; Mucha and Haimerl, 2005; Prokic and Nerbonne, 2009).",
        "While viewing dialect differences at an aggregate level certainly gives a more comprehen-",
        "John Nerbonne",
        "sive view than the analysis of a single subjectively selected feature, the aggregate approach has never fully convinced traditional linguists of its use as it fails to identify the linguistic distinctions among the identified groups.",
        "Recently, however, Wieling and Nerbonne (2009; 2010) answered this criticism by applying a promising graph-theoretic method, the spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs, to cluster varieties and simultaneously determine the linguistic basis of the clusters.",
        "The spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs has been a popular method for the task of co-clustering since its introduction by Dhillon in 2001.",
        "Besides being used in the field of information retrieval for co-clustering words and documents (Dhillon, 2001), this method has also proven useful in the field of bioinformatics, successfully co-clustering genes and conditions (Kluger et al., 2003).",
        "Wieling and Nerbonne (2009) used spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs to co-cluster dialect varieties and sound correspondences with respect to a set of reference pronunciations.",
        "They reported a fair geographical clustering of the varieties in addition to sensible sound correspondences.",
        "In a follow-up study, Wieling and Nerbonne (2010) developed an external method to rank the sound correspondences for each geographic cluster, which also conformed largely to the subjectively selected \"interesting\" sound correspondences in their earlier study (Wieling and Nerbonne, 2009).",
        "In all the aforementioned studies, the spectral graph partitioning method was used to generate a flat clustering.",
        "However, Shi and Malik (2000) indicated that a hierarchical clustering obtained by repeatedly grouping in two clusters should be preferred over the flat clustering approach as approximation errors are reduced.",
        "More importantly, genealogical relationships between languages (or dialects) are generally expected to have a hierarchical structure due to the dynamics of language change in which early changes result in separate varieties which then undergo subsequent changes independently (Jeffers and Lehiste, 1979).",
        "In this study, we will apply the hierarchical spectral graph partitioning method to a Dutch dialect dataset.",
        "Besides comparing the results to the flat clustering obtained by Wieling and Ner-bonne (2009), we will also show that identifying the most important sound correspondences is inherent to the method, alleviating the need for an external ranking method (e.g., see Wieling and",
        "Nerbonne, 2010).",
        "While the current study applies the hierarchical clustering and (novel) ranking method to pronunciation data, we would also like to point out that these methods are not restricted to this type of data and can readily be applied to other domains such as information retrieval and bioinformatics where other spectral methods (e.g., principal component analysis) have already been applied successfully (e.g., see Furnas et al., 1988 and Jolicoeur and Mosimann, 1960)."

        "The spectral graph partitioning method we apply requires as input an undirected bipartite graph.",
        "A bipartite graph is a graph consisting of two sets of vertices where each edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex in the other set.",
        "Vertices within a set are not connected.",
        "An example of a bipartite graph is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The vertices on the left side represent the varieties, while the vertices on the right side represent the sound correspondences (each individual sound is surrounded by a set of square brackets).",
        "An edge between a variety and a sound correspondence indicates that the sound correspondence occurs in that variety with respect to a specific reference variety.",
        "As we are interested in clustering dialect varieties and detecting their underlying linguistic basis, our bipartite graph consists of dialect varieties and for each variety the presence of sound correspondences compared to a reference variety (indicated by an edge; see Figure 2).",
        "Because we do not have pronunciations of standard (or historical) Dutch, we use the pronunciations of the city Delft as our reference, since they are close to standard",
        "Dutch (Wieling and Nerbonne, 2009) and allow a more straightforward interpretation of the sound correspondences than those of other varieties.",
        "We obtain the sound correspondences by aligning the pronunciations of Delft against the pronunciations of all other dialect varieties using the Leven-shtein algorithm (Levenshtein, 1965).",
        "The Leven-shtein algorithm generates an alignment by minimizing the number of edit operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions) needed to transform one string into the other.",
        "For example, the Lev-enshtein distance between [bindan] and [beinda], two Dutch dialect pronunciations of the word 'to bind', is 3:",
        "bindan insert e 1 beindan subst.",
        "i/i 1 beindan delete n 1 beinda",
        "The corresponding alignment is:",
        "When all edit operations have the same cost, it is clear that the vowel [i] in the alignment above can be aligned with either the vowel [e] or the vowel [i].",
        "To improve the initial alignments, we use an empirically derived segment distance table obtained by using the pointwise mutual information (PMI) procedure as introduced by Wieling et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "They showed that applying the PMI procedure resulted in much better alignments than using several other alignment procedures.",
        "The initial step of the PMI procedure consists of obtaining a starting set of alignments.",
        "In our case we obtain these by using the Levenshtein algorithm with a syllabicity constraint: vowels may only align with (semi-)vowels, and consonants only with consonants, except for syllabic consonants which may also be aligned with vowels.",
        "Subsequently, the substitution cost of every segment pair (a segment can also be a gap, representing an insertion or a deletion) can be calculated according to a pointwise mutual information procedure assessing the statistical dependence between the two segments:",
        "• p(x, y) is estimated by calculating the number of times x and y occur at the same position in two aligned strings X and Y, divided by the total number of aligned segments (i.e. the relative occurrence of the aligned segments x and y in the whole data set).",
        "Note that either x or y can be a gap in the case of insertion or deletion.",
        "• p(x) and p(y) are estimated as the number of times x (or y) occurs, divided by the total number of segment occurrences (i.e. the relative occurrence of x or y in the whole data set).",
        "Dividing by this term normalizes the cooccurrence frequency with respect to the frequency expected if x and y are statistically independent.",
        "In short, this procedure adapts the distance between two sound segments based on how likely it is that they are paired in the alignments.",
        "If two sounds are seen more (less) often together than we would expect based on their relative frequency in the dataset, their PMI score will be positive (negative).",
        "Higher scores indicate that segments tend to co-occur in correspondences more often, while lower scores indicate the opposite.",
        "New segment distances (i.e. segment substitution costs) are obtained by subtracting the PMI score from 0 and adding the maximum PMI score (to enforce that the minimum distance is 0).",
        "Based on the adapted segment distances we generate new alignments and we repeat this procedure until the alignments remain constant.",
        "We extract the sound correspondences from the final alignments and represent the bipartite graph by a matrix A having 423 rows (all varieties, except Delft) and 957 columns (all occurring sound correspondences).",
        "We do not include frequency information in this matrix, but use binary values to indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a sound correspondence with respect to the reference pronunciation.",
        "To reduce the effect of noise, we only regard a sound correspondence as present in a variety when it occurs in at least three aligned pronunciations.",
        "Consequently, we reduce the number of sound correspondences (columns of A) by more than half to 477.",
        "Spectral graph theory is used to find the principal properties and structure of a graph from its graph spectrum (Chung, 1997).",
        "Wieling and Ner-bonne (2009) used spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs as introduced by Dhillon (2001) to co-cluster varieties and sound correspondences, enabling them to obtain a geographical clustering with a simultaneously derived linguistic basis (i.e. the clustered sound correspondences).",

        "Since the spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs appears to be identifying significant (representative and distinctive) correspondences well - both in the flat clustering design and in the (present) hierarchical scheme, several further opportunities become worthy of exploration.",
        "First, we might ask if we can automatically identify a threshold of significance for such correspondences, as to-date we have only sought to verify significance, not to exclude marginally significant elements.",
        "Second, while we have applied the technique exclusively to data for which the correspondence consists of a comparison of dialect data to (near) standard data, the analysis of historical data, in which varieties are compared to an earlier form, is within reach.",
        "As the first step, we should wish to compare data to a well-established historical predecessor as further steps might require genuine reconstruction, still beyond anyone's reach (as far as we know).",
        "Third, the technique would be more generally applicable if it did not require agreeing on a standard, or pole of comparison.",
        "This sounds difficult, but multi-alignment techniques might bring it within reach (Prokic et al., 2009).",
        "It is intriguing to note that Nerbonne (in press) found only sporadic correspondences using factor analysis on data which incorporated frequency of correspondence, and we have likewise found frequency-weighted data less successful as a basis for spectral bipartite clustering.",
        "Shackleton (2007), Wieling and Nerbonne (2010) and the current paper are more successful using data which lacks information about the frequency of occurrence of sounds and/or sound correspondences.",
        "The question arises as to whether this is general and why this is so.",
        "Is it due to the skewness of frequency distributions, in which a suitable normalization might be attempted?",
        "Or is it simply more straightforward to focus on the absolute presence or absence of a sound or sound correspondence?",
        "While sound correspondences function well as a linguistic basis, it might also be interesting to investigate morphological distinctions present in the GTRP corpus.",
        "This would enable us to compare the similarity of the geographic distributions of pronunciation variation and morphological variation.",
        "Finally, while we only tested this method on a single dataset, it would be interesting to see if our results and conclusions also hold when applied to more and different datasets.",
        "We also realize that the evaluation in this study is rather qualitative, but we intend to develop more quantitative evaluation methods for future studies."
