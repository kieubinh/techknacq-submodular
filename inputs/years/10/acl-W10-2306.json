        "A linguistic phylogenetic tree is a tree describing the evolution of some set of languages.",
        "Usually, we build such a tree using information given by a set of characters associated with those languages.",
        "We say that a character back-mutated if after evolving from 0 state to 1 state, it subsequently is lost and switches back on the tree from 1 state to 0 state.",
        "We say that a character has parallel evolution if it evolves twice on the tree from state 0 to state 1 independently.",
        "We say that a character is borrowed if, on the true evolutionary tree, it has been transfered from one branch to another by contact between linguistic groups.",
        "Loanwords are an example of this.",
        "Given a set of binary characters C = [c\\...Cj}, we say that a rooted tree T = (r, VT, ET) with languages L = l\\as the leaf nodes of T is a perfect phylogeny if there is a binary labeling of each character at each node such that the root node is labeled with a zero for each character, and for each character both the subtree induced by the nodes labeled 1 at that character, and the subtree induced by the nodes labeled 0 at that character are connected.",
        "This means that each character evolves exactly once, and that there is no back-mutation or borrowing.",
        "We can recognize whether a set of characters admits a perfect phylogeny in polynomial time (Felsenstein, 2004).",
        "Unfortunately, often character data does not admit a perfect phylogeny.",
        "Usually the question given character data is: How far away is this data from admitting a perfect phylogeny?",
        "What is the minimum level of borrowing, back mutation or parallel evolution that we must allow to produce a tree that describes this data?",
        "Answering this question is NP-Hard (Day et al., 1986).",

        "A perfect phylogeny network is a graph that is not required to be a tree such that every character exhibits a perfect phylogeny on at least one of the subtrees of that graph.",
        "Unfortunately, even given a phylogenetic tree and character data, determining the minimum number of edges one must add to produce a perfect phylogeny network is NP-Hard (Day et al., 1986).",
        "Nakhleh et al.",
        "(2005a) mention that applying the perfect phylogeny network approach to their Indo-European language dataset is tractable only because one need only add very few edges to their tree to produce a perfect phylogeny network.",
        "In contrast to a perfect phylogeny, a Dollo phylogeny allows an arbitrary number of back mutations.",

        "languages L = lias the leaf nodes of T is a Dollo phylogeny if there is a binary labeling of each character at each node such that the root node is labeled with a zero for each character, and for each character the subtree induced by the nodes labeled 1 is connected.",
        "This means that each character evolves exactly once but an arbitrary number of back-mutations are allowed.",
        "Unfortunately, every set of character data admits a Dollo phylogeny.",
        "Clearly Dollo phylogeny is too permissive to be a useful notion in linguistic phylogenetics.",

        "(2006) discussed the idea of a conservative Dollo phylogeny.",
        "Given a set of binary characters C = {ci ...Cj}, we say that a rooted tree T = (r,VT, ET) with languages L = as the leaf nodes of T is a conservative Dollo phylogeny (CDP) if there is a binary labeling of each character at each node such that the root node is labeled with a zero for each character, for each character the subtree induced by the nodes labeled 1 is connected, and if two characters appear together in their 1 states in the tree at an internal node, they also occur together in their 1 states in the tree at a leaf node.",
        "Recall that the leaves in this tree are the languages for which we have data.",
        "For an example, see Figure 1.",
        "If two characters existed together in some ancestral language, they must also exist together in at least one leaf language.",
        "That is, if they have ever existed together in the same language, we have evidence of it in the form of a known language that possessed both of those characters.",
        "Is this a reasonable assumption?",
        "We have no evidence that it is.",
        "However, it's certainly a more reasonable assumption than that required for a perfect phylogeny.",
        "We expect that often, data sets will not admit a CDP, and that, like for perfect phylogeny, the question will be: How far away are the data from admitting a CDP?",
        "Przytycka et al.",
        "(2006) prove that a set of characters admit a CDP if and only if their intersection graph is chordal.",
        "Chordal graphs are graphs with no induced cycles longer than three vertices.",

        "(1976) provide a linear-time recognition algorithm for chordal graphs.",
        "Graph G = (V, E) is an intersection graph of a family of sets S if there is a bijection F between V and S such that for every two sets s, t G S F (s) is adjacent to F (t) if and only if s intersects t. Set s intersects set t if they share at least one element.",

        "We implemented an algorithm to, given a character dataset, compute the intersection graphofthose characters, and determine whether the resulting graph is chordal as given by Rose et al.",
        "(1976).",
        "This tells us whether or not the dataset admits a CDP.",
        "We also implemented an exhaustive search that computes the minimum number of characters that must be borrowed to otherwise admit a CDP.",
        "We ran our program on the Indo-European character dataset used by Nakhleh et al.",
        "(2005a), and available online at http://www.cs.rice.edu/ nakhleh/CPHL/.",
        "Nakhleh et al.",
        "(2005a) combined established language groups into a single language during computation to decrease computation time.",
        "We use the same families as they do, and do the same in two of our experiments.",
        "For example, we consider the Tocharian language family, consisting of Tocharian A and Tocharian B to be a single language when building our intersection graph.",
        "This language grouping is done as a preprocessing step to the construction of the intersection graph of the characters.",
        "We expect this transformation to be particularly useful in the CDP setting, beyond just decreasing computation time.",
        "We expect it will make our data closer to admitting a CDP in a way consistent with true evolutionary history.",
        "Consider the difference between the intersection graph of a set of characters with family grouping and without.",
        "Let s and t be two characters that, are considered to intersect with family grouping, but not without.",
        "Then s and t are not present in any of the same languages, but there are two languages lj, lj such that lj has character s but not t and language lj has character t but not s, and lj and lj are in the same family L.",
        "We use the language family definitions given by Nakhleh et al.",
        "(2005a), where these language families are identified as consistent with all characters, and it is argued that it is very unlikely there is any borrowing between a portion of the tree inside the family, and a portion of the tree outside the family.",
        "Therefore, if s and t are both present within leaves in the language family L, and neither is borrowed from outside the family, then each of s, t is either present only within language family L, or is present in at least one internal node ancestral to language family L. If s and t are only present within the language family, they are not informative when language family grouping is used.",
        "However, if both s and t are present at an internal node ancestral to language family L, then this is important information that we have derived by applying family language grouping, and will make the data closer to admitting a CDP in terms of number of borrowings required.",
        "We made the data binary by separating states of a given character as best indicated by notes provided by Nakhleh et al.",
        "(2005a) on their coding of the characters.",
        "In making the data binary, we have likely lost some constraining information.",
        "When a language (or language family, when that grouping was used) has a unique state at a character, we coded this as having all possible non-ancestral states.",
        "The basis for this is that some of these codes indicate that there is no data for that character at that language, or that if that language actually does have a unique state at that character, it is uninformative, but could have evolved from any other state.",
        "Data processing by someone more highly trained in linguistics would either confirm this decision or provide an alternative approach.",
