        "The use of statistical methods is well established for a number of natural language processing tasks (Manning and Schuetze, 2007), in some cases combined with a deep linguistic treatment in hybrid approaches.",
        "Representing text as graphs (Antiqueira et al., 2007), in particular, has become popular with the advent of complex networks (CN) (Newman, 2003; Albert and Barabasi, 2002), especially after it was shown that large pieces of text generate scale-free networks (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole, 2001; Barabasi, 2009).",
        "This scale-free nature of such networks is probably the main reason why complex networks concepts are capable of capturing features of text, even in the absence of any linguistic treatment.",
        "Significantly, the scale-free property has also allowed CN to be applied in diverse fields (Costa et al., 2008), from neuroscience (Sporns, 2002) to physics (Gfeller, 2007), from linguistics (Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2001) to computer science (Moura et al., 2003), to mention a few areas.",
        "Other frequently observed unifying principles that natural networks exhibit are short paths between any two nodes and high clustering coefficients (i.e. the so-called small-world property), correlations in node degrees, and a large number of cycles or specific motifs.",
        "The topology and the dynamics of CN can be exploited in natural language processing, which has led to several contributions in the literature.",
        "For instance, metrics of CN have been used to assess the quality of written essays by high school students (Antiqueira et al., 2007).",
        "Furthermore, degrees, shortest paths and other metrics of CN were used to produce strategies for automatic summarization (Antiqueira et al., 2009), whose results are among the best for methods that only employ statistics.",
        "The quality of machine translation systems can be examined using local mappings of local measures (Amancio et al., 2008).",
        "Other related applications include lexical resources analysis (Sigman and Cecchi, 2002), human-induced words association (Costa, 2004), language evolution (Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2002), and authorship recognition (Antiqueira et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we model texts as complex networks with each word being represented by a node and co-occurrences of words defining the edges (see next section).",
        "Unlike traditional methods of text mining and sentiment detection of reviews (Tang et al., 2009; Pennebaker et al., 2003), the method described here only takes into account the relationships between concepts, regardless of the semantics related to each word.",
        "Specifically, we analyze the topology of the networks in order to distinguish between texts with positive and negative opinions.",

        "Texts are modeled as complex networks here by considering each word (concept) as a node and establishing links by co-occurrence of words, disregarding the punctuation.",
        "In selecting the nodes, the stopwords were removed and the remaining words were lemmatized to combine words with the same canonical form but different inflections into a single node.",
        "Additionally, the texts were labeled using the MXPost part-of-speech Tagger based on the Ratnaparki's model (Ratnaparki, 1996), which helps to resolve problems of ambiguity.",
        "This is useful because the words with the same canonical form and same meaning are grouped into a single node, while words that have the same canonical form but distinct meanings generate distinct nodes.",
        "This preprocessing is done by accessing a computational lexicon, where each word has an associated rule for the generation of the canonical form.",
        "For illustrative means, Table 1 shows the preprocessed form of the sentence \"The projection of the network data into two dimensions is crucial for big networks\" and Figure 1 shows the network obtained for the same sentence.",
        "Several CN metrics have been used to analyze textual characteristics, the most common of which are out-degree (kout), in-degree (kin), cluster coefficient (C) and shortest paths (l).",
        "Here we also use the betweenness (q) and the global efficiency (n).",
        "The out-degree corresponds to the number of edges emanating from a given node, where the weight of each link between any two nodes may also be considered, being referred to as out-strength.",
        "Analogously, the node's in-degree is defined as the number of edges arriving at a given",
        "Figure 1: Network obtained from the sentence \"The projection ofthe network data into two dimensions is crucial for big networks\".",
        "node.",
        "The network's kout and kin are evaluated by calculating the average among all the nodes, note that such global measures kout and kin are always equal.",
        "Regarding the adjacency matrix to represent the network, for a given node i, its koutand kin are calculated by eqs 1 and 2, where N represents the number of distinct words in the preprocessed text:",
        "The cluster coefficient (C) is defined as follows.",
        "Let S be the set formed by nodes receiving edges of a given node i, and Nc is the cardinality of this set.",
        "If the nodes of this set form a completely connected set, then there are Nc(Nc-1) edges in this sub graph.",
        "However, if there are only B edges, then the coefficient is given by eq.",
        "(3):",
        "If Nc is less than 1, then C is defined as zero.",
        "Note that this measure quantifies how the nodes connected to a specific node are linked to each other, with its value varying between zero and one.",
        "The shortest paths are calculated from all pairs of nodes within the network.",
        "Let be the minimum distance between any two words i and j in the network.",
        "The shortest path length l of a node i is given in equation 4.",

        "After pre-processing",
        "The projection of the network data into two dimensions is crucial for big networks",
        "projection network data two dimension be crucial big network",
        "Another measure often used in network analysis is the global efficiency (n), which is defined in equation 5, and may be interpreted as the speed with which information is exchanged between any two nodes, since a short distance dij contributes more significantly than a long distance.",
        "Note that the formula below prevents divergence; therefore, it is especially useful for networks with two or more components.",
        "The inverse of n, named harmonic mean ofgeodesic distances, has also been used to characterize complex networks.",
        "While l and n use the length of shortest paths, the betweenness uses the numberofshortestpaths.",
        "Formally, the betweenness centrality for a given vertex v is given in equation 6, where the numerator represents the number of shortest paths passing through the vertices i, v and j and the denominator represents the number of shortest paths passing through the vertices i and j.",
        "In other words, if there are many shortest paths passing through a given node, this node will receive a high betweenness centrality.",
        "The corpus used in the experiments was obtained from the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, from which we selected 290 articles over a 10-year period from a special section where a positive opinion is confronted with a negative opinion about a given topic.",
        "For this study, we selected the 145 longest texts with positive opinion and the 145 longest text with negative opinions, in order to have meaningful statistical data for the CN analysis.",
        "In order to discriminate the topological features from distinct networks we first applied a technique for reducing the dimension of the dataset, the canonical variable analysis (McLachlan, 2004).",
        "The projection of network data into a lower dimension is crucial for visualization, in addition to avoids the so-called \"curse of dimensionality\" (Bishop, 2006).",
        "To calculate the axes points for projecting the data, a criterion must be established with which the distances between data points are defined.",
        "Let S be the overall dispersion of the measurements, as shown in equation 7, where ( is the number of instances (( = 290), 0% is the set of metrics for a particular instance and (lX) is the average of all .",
        "Considering that two classes (C1 = positive opinions and C2 = negative opinions) are used, the scatter matrix Si is obtained for each class Ci, according to equation 8, where (1Ê)i is the analogous of (~äX) when only the instances belonging to class Ci is taken into account.",
        "The intraclass matrix, i.e. the matrix that gives the dispersion inside C1 and C2, is defined as in equation 9.",
        "Additionally, we define the interclass matrix, i.e. the matrix that provides the dispersion between C1 and C2, as shown in equation 10.",
        "The principal axes for the projection are then obtained by computing the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalues of the matrix A (McLachlan, 2004) defined in equation 11.",
        "Since the data were projected in a two-dimensional space, the two principal axes were selected, corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues.",
        "A – SirüraSinter",
        "Finally, to quantify the efficiency of separation with the projection using canonical variable analysis, we implemented three machine learning algorithms (decision tree, using the C4.5 algorithm (Quinlan, 1993); rules of decision, using the",
        "RIP algorithm (Cohen, 1995), and Naive Bayes algorithm (John and Langley, 1995)) and evaluated the accuracy rate using the 10-fold-cross-validation (Kohavi, 1995)."
