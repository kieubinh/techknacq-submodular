        "To eliminate redundancy, we used spectral clustering and classified each sentence into groups, each of which consists of semantically related sentences.",
        "Then, we applied link analysis, the Markov Random Walk (MRW) Model to deciding the importance of a sentence within documents.",

        "With the exponential growth of information on the Internet, it is becoming increasingly difficult for a user to read and understand all the materials from a series of large-scale document streams that is potentially of interest.",
        "Multi-document summarization is an issue to attack the problem.",
        "It differs from single document summarization in that it is important to identify differences and similarities across documents.",
        "Graph-based ranking methods, such as PageRank (Page et al., 1998) and HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) have recently applied and been successfully used for multi-document summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005).",
        "Given a set of documents, the model constructs graph consisting vertices and edges where vertices are sentences and edges reflect the relationships between sentences.",
        "The model then applies a graph-based ranking method to obtain the rank scores for the sentences.",
        "Finally, the sentences with large rank scores are chosen into the summary.",
        "However, when they are strung together, the resulting summary still contains much overlapping information.",
        "Because all the sentences are ranked based on a sentence as unit of information.",
        "Therefore, for example, semantically related two sentences with \"high recommendation\" are ranked with high score, and thus are regarded as a summary sentence.",
        "To attack the problem, Wan et al.",
        "proposed two models, i.e., the Cluster-based conditional Markov Random Walk model and the Cluster-based HITS model, both make use of the theme clusters in the document set (Wan and Yang, 2008).",
        "Their model first groups documents into theme clusters by using a simple clustering method, k-means.",
        "Next, the model constructs a directed or undirected graph to reflect the relationships between sentences and clusters by using link analysis.",
        "They reported that the results on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets showed the effectiveness of their models.",
        "However, one of the problems using multivariate clustering such as k-means is that it is something of a black art when applied to high-dimensional data.",
        "The available techniques for searching this large space do not offer guarantees of global optimality, thus the resulting summary still contains much overlapping information, especially for a large amount of documents.",
        "This paper focuses extractive summarization, and present a method for detecting key sentences from documents that discuss the same event.",
        "Like Wan et al.",
        "'s approach, we applied link analysis, the Markov Random Walk (MRW) model (Bre-maud, 1999) to a graph consisting sentences and clusters.",
        "To attack the problem dealing with the high dimensional spaces, we applied spectral clustering technique (Ng et al., 2002) to the sentences from a document set.",
        "Spectral clustering is a transformation of the original sentences into a set ofor-thogonal eigenvectors.",

        "All documents were tagged by a morphological analysis, ChaSen (Matsumoto et al., 1997) and noun words are extracted.",
        "We used FormalRun consisting of 30 topics as a test data.",
