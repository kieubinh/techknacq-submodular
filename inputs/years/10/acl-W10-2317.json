        "His method is called Semantic mirroring and the approach utilizes the way that different languages encode lexical meaning by mirroring source words and target words back and forth, in order to establish semantic relations like synonymy and hy-ponymy.",
        "Work in this area is strongly related to work within Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and the observation that translations are a good source for detecting such distinctions (Resnik & Yarowsky 1999, Ide 2000, Diab & Resnik 2002).",
