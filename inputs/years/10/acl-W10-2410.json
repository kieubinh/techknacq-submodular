        "Romanization of Thai words is based on sound transcription.",
        "Thai consonant and vowel alphabets are defined to map to roman alphabets.",
        "Similarly, English-to-Thai transliteration is defined based on the phonetic transcription of English words.",

        "For example, the sound /k/ could be mapped to either \"n \", \"21 \", \"fl\", or Moreover, the guideline reserves for transliterations generally used in the current writing and also transliterations appeared in the official Royal Institute dictionaries, even such transliterations do not comply with the guideline.",
        "Since the guidelines are quite flexible and it is also common that lots of Thai people may not strictly follow the guidelines, ones can see many ways of transliteration in daily used text.",
        "To solve this ambiguity, both the official guidelines and statistics of usage must be incorporated in the machine transliteration system.",
        "The Thai-English part of NEWS 2010 corpus developed by the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) composes of word pairs collected mainly from 3 sources; press from the Thai Royal Institute, press from other sources, and the NEWS 2009 corpus.",

        "There are still some problematic issues regarding the transliteration format including hyphenation and case sensitivity in the test data.",
        "Ignoring both problems leads to 0.5% and 8.3% improvement on the English-to-Thai and Thai-to-English tests respectively.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of test words and error words with respect to the word length in the unit of syllables.",
        "More than 80% of test words are either 2 or 3 syllables.",
        "It can be roughly seen that the ratio of error words over test words increases with respect to the length of words.",
        "This is by the fact that the whole word will be considered incorrect even if only a syllable in the word is wrongly transliterated.",
        "Out of 3,860 syllable units extracted from all error words, over 57% are correctly transliterated.",
        "Another issue largely affecting the system performance is as mentioned in the Section 2 that the Thai Royal Institute's guideline is somewhat flexible for multiple ways of transliteration.",
        "However, the corpus used to train and test currently provides only one way of transliteration.",
        "Improving the corpus to cope with such transliteration flexibility is needed.",
        "In developing the Thai-English NEWS 2010 transliteration corpus, some foreign names are difficult to pronounce even by linguists.",
        "Errors in the corpus are then unavoidable and required further improvement.",
        "Many algorithms could be conducted to help improve the system accuracy.",
        "First, the current system uses only syllable n-gram probabilities to determine the best result without considering how likely the target syllable is close to the source syllable.",
        "For example, the source syllables \"BIKE\" and \"BYTE\" are transliterated to Thai as",
        "\"lueTand \"lutf\" respectively.",
        "Both Thai transliterated syllables are pronounced in the same way as /b-ai/.",
        "It can be seen that both syllables",
        "\"BIKE\" and \"BYTE\" can be linked to both",
        "\"l u el \" and \"l u tf \".",
        "Selecting the best syllable takes only the syllable n-gram into account without considering its right transliteration.",
        "Direct mapping between source and target syllables could solve this problem but leads to another problem of unseen syllables.",
        "A better way is to incorporate in the search space another score representing the closeness of source and target syllables.",
        "As the example, the syllable \"BIKE\" is closer to \"lue\" than to \"lutf\" as the letter \"K\" is normally pronounced like \"el \" /k/, not \"w \" /th/.",
        "We have tried incorporating such knowledge by introducing a syllable similarity score in the search space.",
        "Given a pair of source and target syllables, the syllable similarity score is the number of consonants having the same sound like \"K\" and \"el\" divided by the total number of consonants in the syllable.",
        "Unfortunately, this approach could not yield any improvement currently as many syllable pairs happened to have the same similarity score.",
        "A better definition of the score will be conducted in the future work.",
        "Conclusion",
        "The Thai-English part of NEWS 2010 transliteration corpus was briefly described and its use in building a Thai-English machine transliteration system was reported.",
        "The system is based on transliteration of syllable units extracted from the whole input word.",
        "Within the space of candidate transliterated syllables, the best output was determined by using the statistical syllable n-gram model.",
        "There are many issues left for further improvement.",
        "First, possible transliterations of each word should be added to the corpus.",
        "Second, the system itself could be improved by e.g. incorporating better syllabification approaches, defining a better syllable similarity score, and comparing with other potential algorithms.",
        "Finally, as the Thai-to-English part of the transliteration corpus is actually back-transliteration of English-to-Thai, it is interesting to extend the corpus to cope with real-use Thai-to-English word pairs."
