        "The three edit operations that we consider for use in transliteration similarity estimation include: substitution, insertion, and deletion.",
        "These edit operations are represented as hidden states of a pair HMM.",
        "Depending on the source and target language alphabets, it is possible to design or use a specific pair HMM algorithm for estimating paired character emission parameters in the edit operation states, and transition parameters for a given design of transitions between the pair HMM's states.",
        "Before applying the pair HMM method, we use external datasets to identify a pair HMM variant that we consider as suitable for application to transliteration similarity estimation.",

        "Across languages, Wikipedia topics are written in different ways and all words in a topic could be important for mining transliterations.",
        "One main step in the transliteration mining task is to identify a set of words in each topic for consideration as candidate transliterations.",
        "As seen in Table 1, it is very likely that some words will not be selected as candidate transliterations depending on the criteria for selection.",
        "For example, if a criterion is such that we consider only words starting with uppercase characters for English and Russian datasets, then the Russian word 'aTOJijf in the topic pair 1 in Table 1 will not be used as a candidate transliteration and that in turn makes the system loose the likely pair of 'Atoll, aTOJiJi'.",
        "After extracting candidate transliterations, the approach we use in this paper takes each candidate word on the source language side and determines a transliteration estimate with each candidate word on the target language side.",

        "To simplify the analysis of the source and target strings, the pair HMM system requires unique whole number representations for each character in the source and target language data.",
        "This is not suitable for all the different types of writing systems.",
        "In this paper, we look at only the English and Russian languages where many characters are associated with a phonemic alphabet and where numbered representations are hardly expected to contribute to errors from loss of information inherent in the original orthography.",
        "A preliminary run on Chinese-English datasets from the previous shared task on machine transliteration (NEWS 2009) resulted in an accuracy of 0.213 and MRR of 0.327 using the pair HMM variant in Figure 1.",

        "The English-Russian Wikipedia dataset that was provided for the transliteration mining task is very noisy meaning that it has various types of other entities in addition to words for each language's orthography.",
        "A first step in simplifying the transliteration mining process was to remove any unnecessary entities.",
        "We observed the overlap of writing systems in both the English and Russian Wikipedia datasets.",
        "We therefore made sure that there is no topic where the same writing system is used in both the English and Russian data.",
        "Any strings that contain characters that are not associated with the writing systems for English and Russian were also removed.",
        "We also observed the presence of many temporal and numerical expressions that are not necessary on both the English and Russian Wikipedia datasets.",
        "We applied different sets of rules to remove such expressions while leaving any necessary words.",
        "Using knowledge about the initial formatting of strings in both the English and Russian data, a set of rules was applied to split most of the strings based on different characters.",
        "For example almost all strings in the English side had the underscore '_' character as a string separator.",
        "We also removed characters such as: colons, semi-colons, commas, question marks, exclamation marks, dashes, hyphens, forward and back slashes, mathematical operator symbols, currency symbols, etc.",
        "Some strings were also split based on string patterns, for example where different words are joined into one string and it was easy to identify that the uppercase character for each word still remained in the combined string just like when it is alone.",
        "We also removed many abbreviations and titles in the datasets that were not necessary for analysis during the transliteration mining process.",
        "After selecting candidate words based on most of the criteria above, we determine all characters in our extracted candidate transliteration data and compare against those in the shared task's seed data (Kumaran et al., 2010) with the aim of finding all characters that are missing in the seed data.",
        "Matching transliteration pairs with the the missing characters are then hand picked from the candidate words dataset and added to the seed data before training the pair HMM variant that is selected from the previous section.",
        "The process for identifying missing characters and words that have them is carried out seperately for each language.",
        "However, a matching word in the other language is identified to constitute a transliteration pair that can be added to the seed dataset.",
        "For the English-Russian dataset, we use 142 transliteration pairs in addition to the 1000 transliteration pairs in the initial seed data.",
        "We hence apply the Baum-Welch algorithm for the selected pair HMM specification from section 2 on a total of 1142 transliteration pairs.",
