        "Named entities (NE), technical words, borrowed words and loan words constitute the majority of the unknown words.",
        "So, transliteration can also be termed as the process of obtaining the phonetic translation of names across various languages (Shishtla et al., 2009).",
        "Transcribing the words from one language to another without the help of bilingual dictionary is a challenging task.",
        "Previous work in transliteration include (Surana and Singh, 2009) who propose a transliteration system using two different approaches of transliterating the named entities based on their origin.",

        "It is easy to develop a MT system for a new pair of language using an existing SMT system and a parallel corpora.",

        "The second decoder generated the target from last to first.",
