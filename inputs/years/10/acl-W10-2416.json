        "Each reference of the entity is called a mention.",
        "NER indeed requires the systems to identify these entity mentions from plain texts.",
        "The task can be decomposed into two sub-tasks, i.e., the identification of the entities in the text and the classification of the entities into a set of predefined categories.",
        "In the study of this paper, we focus on the second subtask and assume that the boundaries of all the entity mentions to be categorized are already correctly identified.",
        "In early times, NER systems are mainly based on handcrafted rule-based approaches.",

        "First, they require exhausted handcraft work to construct a proper and complete rule set, which partially expressing the meaning of entity.",
        "Moreover, once the interest of task is transferred to a different domain or language, rules have to be revised or even rewritten.",
        "The discovered rules are indeed heavily dependent on the task interests and the particular corpus.",
        "Finally, the manually-formatted rules are usually incomplete and their qualities are not guaranteed.",
        "Recently, more attentions are switched to the applications of machine learning models with statistic information.",
        "In this camp, entity categorization is typically cast as a multi-class classification process, where the named entities are represented by feature vectors.",
        "Usually, the vectors are abstracted by some lexical and syntactic features instead of semantic feature.",
        "Many learning models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN), are then used to classify the entities by their feature vectors.",
        "Entity categorization in Chinese attracted less attention when compared to English or other western languages.",
        "This is mainly because the unique characteristics of Chinese.",
        "One of the most common problems is the lack of boundary information in Chinese texts.",
        "For this problem, character-based methods are reported to be a possible substitution of word-based methods.",

        "Another important result in Table 3 is that the DBN with One RBM and one BP performs much better than the neutral network with only BP in Table 1.",
        "This clearly showed the effectiveness of feature combination by the RBM layer again.",
        "As to the amount of units in each RBM layer, it is manually fixed in upper experiments.",
        "This number certainly affects the representation power of an RBM layer, consequently the representation power of the whole DBN.",
        "In this set of experiment, we intend to study the effectiveness of the unit size to the performance of DBN.",

        "But the numbers that are closer to the original feature size seem to be some better.",
        "This could suggest that we should not decrease or increase the dimension of the vector feature too much when casting the vector transformation by RBM layers.",

        "It is demonstrated that DBN is very suitable for character-level mention categorization approaches due to its strong representation power and the ability on discovering complicated feature combinations.",
        "We conducted a series of experiments to prove the benefits of DBN.",
        "Experimental results clearly showed the advantages of DBN that it obtained better performance than existing approaches such as SVM and traditional BP neutral network.",
