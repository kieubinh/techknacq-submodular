        "Model adaptation is a central problem in learning-based natural language processing.",
        "In the typical setting a model is trained on annotated in domain, or source, data, and is used on out of domain, or target, data.",
        "The main difference with respect to similar problems such as semi-supervised learning is that source and target data are not assumed to be drawn from the same distribution, which might actually differ in relevant distributional properties: topic, domain, genre, style, etc.",
        "In some formulations of the problem a few target labeled data is assumed to be available (Daumé III, 2007).",
        "However, we are interested in the case in which no labeled data is available from the target domain except for evaluation purposes and fine tuning of hyperparameters.",
        "Most of the work in adaptation has focused so far on the input side; e.g, proposing solutions based on generating shared source-target representations (Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "Here we focus instead on the output aspect.",
        "We hypothesize that",
        "This work was carried out while the first author was working at Yahoo!",
        "Research Barcelona.",
        "part of the loss incurred in using a model out of domain is due to its built-in class priors which do not match the class distribution in the target data.",
        "Thus we attempt to explicitly correct the prediction of a pre-trained model for a given label by taking into account a noisy estimate of the label frequency in the target data.",
        "The correction is carried out by means of adaptive parameters, estimated from unlabelled target data and background \"world knowledge\" in the form of gazetteers, and taken in consideration in the decoding phase.",
        "We built a suitable dataset for experimenting with different adaptation approaches for named entity recognition (NER).",
        "The main findings from our experiments are as follows.",
        "First, the problem is challenging and only marginal improvements are possible under all evaluated frameworks.",
        "Second, we found that our method compares well with current state-of-the-art approaches such as self training and structural correspondence learning (McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006) and taps on an interesting aspect which seems worth of further research.",
        "Although we concentrate on a segmentation task within a specific framework, the perceptron HMM introduced by Collins (2002), we speculate that the same intuition could be straightforwardly applied in other learning frameworks (e.g., Support Vector Machines) and different tasks (e.g., standard classification)."

        "The adaptive perceptron HMM (BGg, 70.3%) improves by 2.7%, as much as model BG over B, again with a slightly larger variance.",
        "It is not clear why other methods do not improve as much.",
        "Speculatively, although we implemented several variants, SCL might benefit from further tuning as it involves several preprocessing steps.",
        "As for self training, the base tagger might be too inaccurate to support this technique.",
        "It is fair to assume that the additional hyperparameters available to our model, e.g., t, provided some additional flexibility.",
        "We also experimented with a few variants of estimating 6 on the development set; i.e., different splits of the unlabeled source/target data and different sampling modes: with and without replacement, number of trials.",
        "All of these aspects can have a significant impact on the quality of the model.",
        "This point brings up a more general issue with the type of approach explored here: while adapting the class priors seems easier than adapting the full model it is not trivial to encode noisy world knowledge into meaningful priors.",
        "Alternatively, in the presence of some labeled data one could optimize 6 directly.",
        "This information could be also elicited from domain experts.",
        "Another interesting alternative is the unsupervised estimation via EM as in (Chan and Ng, 2006).",
        "Overall, adaptation from BBN-4 to CoNLL is harder than from CoNLL to BBN-4.",
        "A possible explanation is that adapting from specific to general is harder then in the opposite direction: the specific corpus is more heavily biased towards a domain (finance).",
        "This intuition is compatible with the baselines performing better in the CoNLL to BBN-4 direction.",
        "However, the opposite argument, that adapting from specific to general should be easier, has some appeal as well; e.g., if more general means higher entropy it seems easier to make a distribution more uniform than finding the right peak.",
        "In general, all adaptive techniques we evaluated provided only marginal improvements over the baseline (BG) model.",
        "To put things in context, it is useful to recall that when evaluated in domain the CoNLL and BBN-4 taggers (model BG) achieve, respectively, 92.7% and 91.6% average F-scores on the test data.",
        "As the results illustrate there is a considerable drop in out domain accuracy, significantly alleviated by adding features from gazetteers and to some extent by other methods.",
        "Following Dredze et al.",
        "(2007) we hypothesize that a significant fraction of the loss is due to labeling inconsistencies between datasets.",
        "Although we did our best to optimize the benchmark methods it is possible that even better results could be achieved with self-training and SCL.",
        "However we stress that different methods get at different aspects of the problem: self-training targets data sparseness, SCL methods aims at generating better shared input representations, while our approach focuses on generating output distribution more compatible with the target data.",
        "It seems reasonable to expect that better adaptation performance would result from composite approaches, aiming at both better machine learning and task-specific aspects for the named entity recognition problem.",

        "We investigated the model adaptation problem for named entity recognition where the base model is a discriminatively trained HMM (Collins, 2002).",
        "We hypothesized that part of the loss incurred in using a pre-trained model out of domain is due to its built-in class priors which do not match the class distribution of the out of domain data.",
        "To test this hypothesis, and attempt a solution, we propose to explicitly correct the prediction of the model for a given label by taking into account a noisy estimate of the label frequency in the target data.",
        "We found encouraging results from preliminary experiments.",
