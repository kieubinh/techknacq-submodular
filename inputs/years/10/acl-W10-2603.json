        "On a given day, many people engage in conversations via several modalities, including face-to-face speech, telephone, email, SMS, chat, and blogs.",
        "Being able to produce automatic summaries of multi-party conversations occurring in one or several of these modalities would enable the parties involved to keep track of and make sense of this diverse data.",
        "However, summarizing spoken dialogue is more challenging than summarizing written monologues such as books and articles, as speech tends to be more fragmented and disfluent.",
        "We are interested in using both fully and semi-supervised techniques to produce extractive summaries for conversations, where each sentence of a text is labeled with its informativeness, and a subset of sentences are concatenated into an extractive summary of the text.",
        "In previous work (Murray and Carenini, 2008), it has been shown that conversations in different modalities can be effectively characterized by a set of \"conversational\" features that are useful in detecting informativeness for the task of extractive summarization.",
        "However, because of privacy concerns, annotated corpora are rarely publicly available for conversational data, including for the email domain.",
        "One promising solution to this problem is domain adaptation, which aims to use labeled data in a well-studied source domain and a limited amount of labeled data from a different target domain to train a model that performs well in that target domain.",
        "In this work, we investigate using domain adaptation that leverages labeled data in the domain of meetings along with labeled and unlabeled email data for summarizing email threads.",
        "We evaluate several domain adaptation algorithms, using both a small set of conversational features and a large set of simple lexical features to determine what settings will yield the best results for summarizing email conversations.",
        "In our experiments, we do not get a significant improvement from using out-of-domain data in addition to in-domain data in supervised domain adaptation, though in the setting where only unlabeled in-domain data is available, we gain from using it through structural correspondence learning.",
        "We also observe that conversational features are more useful in supervised methods, whereas lexical features are better leveraged in semi-supervised adaptation.",
        "The next section surveys past research in domain adaptation and in summarizing conversational data.",
        "In section 3 we present the corpora and feature sets we used, and we describe our experimental setting in section 4.",
        "We then compare the performance of different methods in section 5 and draw conclusions in section 6."

        "We give an overview first of work on supervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation, then of research on summarization of conversations.",
        "Many domain adaptation methods have been proposed for the supervised case, where a small amount of labeled data in the target domain is used along with a larger amount of labeled source data.",
        "Two baseline approaches are to train only on the source data or only on target training data.",
        "One way of using information from both domains is merging the source and target labeled data sets and training a model on the combination.",
        "A method inspired by boosting is to take a linear combination of the predictions of two classifiers, one trained on the source and one trained on the target training data.",
        "Another simple method is to train a predictor on the source data, run it on the target data, and then use its predictions on each instance as additional features for a target-trained model.",
        "This was first introduced by Florian et al.",
        "(2004), who applied it to multilingual named entity recognition.",
        "The prior method of domain adaptation by Chelba and Acero (2006) involves using the source data to find optimal parameter values of a maximum entropy model on that data, and then setting these as a prior on the values of a model trained on the target data.",
        "They find improvement in a capitalizer that adapts using out-of-domain and a small amount of in-domain data versus only training on out-of-domain WSJ data.",
        "Similar to the prior method, Daume's MEGA model also trains a MEMM.",
        "It achieves domain adaptation through hyperparameters that indicate whether an instance is generated by a source, target, or general distribution, and finds the optimal values of the parameters through conditional EM (Daumé and Marcu, 2006).",
        "A simpler method of domain adaptation, that achieves a performance similar to prior and MEGA, was proposed by Daumé (2007) and successfully applied to a variety of NPL sequence labeling problems, such as named entity recognition, shallow parsing, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.",
        "Furthermore, this approach is straightforward to apply by copying feature values so there is a source version, a target version, and a general version of the feature, and was found to be faster to train than MEGA and prior.",
        "For all these reasons, we use Daume's method and not the other two in our experiments.",
        "Because unlabeled data is usually much easier to collect than labeled data in a new domain, semi-supervised domain adaptation methods that exploit unlabeled data are potentially very useful.",
        "In self-training, a training set is used that is originally composed of labeled data, and repeatedly augmented with the highest confidence predictions on unlabeled data.",
        "McClosky et al.",
        "(2006) apply this in a domain adaptation setting for parsing: with only unlabeled data in the target Brown domain, and labeled and unlabeled datasets in the news domain (WSJ and NANC respectively), a self-trained reranking parser performs almost as well as a parser trained only on Brown labeled data.",
        "However, McClosky concludes that self-training alone is not beneficial, and most of the improvements they get over previous work on domain adaptation for parsing are due to using the reranker to select the candidate instances produced in each iteration of self-training.",
        "Thus, one of the issues addressed in this paper is to asses whether self-training is useful for domain adaptation.",
        "A more sophisticated semi-supervised domain adaptation method is structural correspondence learning (SCL).",
        "SCL uses unlabeled data to determine correspondences between features in the two domains by correlating them with so-called pivot features, which are features exhibiting similar behaviors in the source and target domains.",
        "Blitzer applied this algorithm successfully to POS tagging (Blitzer et al., 2006) and sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "SCL seems promising for other tasks as well, for example parse disambiguation (Plank, 2009).",
        "We would like to use domain adaptation to aid in summarizing multi-party conversations hailing from different modalities.",
        "This contrasts with much of previous work on summarization of conversations, which has focused on domain-specific features (e.g., Rambow et al., 2004).",
        "We will treat summarization as a supervised binary classification problem where the sentences of a conversation are rated by their informativeness and a subset is selected to form an extractive summary.",
        "Research in meeting summarization relevant to our task has investigated the utility of employing a large feature set including prosodic information, speaker status, lexical and structural discourse features (Murray et al., 2006; Galley, 2006).",
        "For email summarization, we view an email thread as a conversation.",
        "For summarizing email threads, Rambow (2004) used lexical features such as tf.idf, features that considered the thread to be a sequence of turns, and email-specific features such as number of recipients and the subject line.",
        "Asynchronous multi-party conversations were successfully represented for summarization through a small number of conversational features by Murray and Carenini (2008).",
        "This paved the way to cross-domain conversation summarization by representing both email threads and meetings with a set of common conversational features.",
        "The work we present here investigates using data from both emails and meetings in summarizing emails, and compares using conversational versus lexical features."

        "For word pairs, we extract the ordered pairs of words that occur in the same sentence, and similarly for POS pairs.",

        "This paper is a comparative study of the performance of several domain adaptation methods on the task of summarizing conversational data when a large amount of annotated data is available in the domain of meetings and a smaller (or no) amount of annotation exists in the target domain of email threads.",
        "One surprising finding of our experiments is that of the methods we implemented, the best performance is achieved by training on indomain data using conversational features.",
        "Hence, it seems that when sufficient labeled indomain data is available, supervised domain adaptation is not useful for summarization of emails with the features and amounts of labeled data we used.",
        "However, semi-supervised methods using unla-beled data and labeled out-of-domain data are useful in the absence of these labels, with the SCLSMALL method greatly outperforming the baseline.",
        "This is a promising result for using annotated corpora in well-studied domains or conversational modalities to summarize data in new domains.",
        "In our experiments, we have explored the effectiveness of conversational and lexical features separately.",
        "The two sets of features differ in their impact on domain adaptation: with conversational features, no method improves significantly over the baseline, whereas with lexical features, the semi-supervised methods given no labeled target data perform better than the supervised baseline of training in-domain.",
        "One hypothesis to explain this is that lexical features behave similarly in the two domains, so training on the larger amount of labeled target data is beneficial, while conversational features are more domain specific, likely because emails and meetings are structured differently.",
        "As the next step in our work, we intend to combine the two sets of features.",
        "In doing this, we will have to ensure that the conversational features are not washed out by a very large number of lexical features.",
        "A scenario of practical interest in domain adaptation for new domains is when the target domain has a considerable amount of unlabeled data and a subset of this data can easily be annotated by hand, for example five threads in the email domain.",
        "We are currently exploring injecting a small amount of labeled target data into the semi-supervised methods we have implemented to account for differences that cannot be observed in the unlabeled data.",
        "Blitzer (2008) did such an adjustment to SCL using a small amount of labeled target data to correct misaligned features and thus improve accuracy.",
        "Finally, it may be worth investigating how to combine several of the methods, for example by adding the feature of PRED based on training a classifier on the source, alongside augmented features using more unlabeled data through SCL, and adding the highest-confidence labels from SELFTRAIN to the training set."
