        "Past research in a variety of NLP tasks, like parsing (Gildea, 2001) and chunking (Huang and Yates, 2009), has shown that systems suffer from a drop-off in performance on out-of-domain tests.",
        "Two separate experiments with part-of-speech (POS) taggers trained on Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text show that they can reach accuracies of 97-98% on WSJ test sets, but achieve accuracies of at most 90% on biomedical text (R.Codena et al., 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "The major cause for poor performance on out-of-domain texts is the traditional representation used by supervised NLP systems.",
        "Most systems depend to varying degrees on lexical features, which tie predictions to the words observed in each example.",
        "While such features have been used in a variety of tasks for better in-domain performance, they are pitfalls for out-of-domain tests for two reasons: first, the vocabulary can differ greatly between domains, so that important words in the test data may never be seen in the training data.",
        "And second, the connection between words and labels may also change across domains.",
        "For instance, \"signaling\" appears only as a present participle (VBG) in WSJ text (as in, \"signaling that ...\"), but predominantly as a noun (as in \"signaling pathway\") in biomedical text.",

        "This framework is attractive for several reasons: experimentally, learned features can yield significant improvements over standard supervised models on out-of-domain tests.",
        "Since the representation learning techniques are unsupervised, they can be applied to arbitrary new domains to yield the best set of features for learning on WSJ text and predicting on the new domain.",
        "There is no need to supply additional labeled examples for each new domain.",
        "This reduces the effort for domain adaptation, and makes it possible to apply systems to open-domain text collections like the Web, where it is prohibitively expensive to collect a labeled sample that is truly representative of all domains.",
        "Here we explore two novel directions in the representation-learning framework for domain adaptation.",
        "Specifically, we investigate empirically the effects of representation learning techniques on POS tagging to answer the following:",
        "1.",
        "Can we produce multidimensional representations for domain adaptation?",
        "Our previous efforts have provided only a single new feature in the learned representations.",
        "We now show how we can perform a multidimensional clustering of words such that each dimension of the clustering forms a new feature in our representation; such multidimensional representations dramatically reduce the out-of-domain error rate of our POS tagger from 9.5% to 6.7%.",
        "2.",
        "Can maximum-entropy models be used to produce representations for domain adaptation?",
        "Recent work on contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005) has shown that maximum-entropy-based latent variable models can yield more accurate clusterings for POS tagging than more traditional generative models trained with Expectation-Maximization.",
        "Our preliminary results show that such models can be used effectively as representations for domain adaptation as well, matching state-of-the-art results while using far less data.",

        "Our techniques use only raw text from the target domain.",
        "This reduces the cost of domain adaptation and makes the techniques more widely applicable to new domains like web processing, where the domain and vocabulary is highly variable, and it is extremely difficult to obtain labeled data that is representative of the test distribution.",
        "When labeled target-domain data is available, instance weighting and similar techniques can potentially be used in combination with our techniques to improve our results further.",
        "Several researchers have previously studied methods for using unlabeled data for sequence labeling, either alone or as a supplement to labeled data.",
        "Ando and Zhang develop a semi-supervised chunker that outperforms purely supervised approaches on the CoNLL 2000 dataset (Ando and Zhang, 2005).",
        "Recent projects in semi-supervised (Toutanova and Johnson, 2007) and unsupervised (Biemann et al., 2007; Smith and Eisner, 2005) tagging also show significant progress.",
        "HMMs have been used many times for POS tagging in supervised, semi-supervised, and in unsupervised settings (Banko and Moore, 2004; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007).",
        "The Realm system for sparse information extraction has also used unsupervised HMMs to help determine whether the arguments of a candidate relation are of the appropriate type (Downey et al., 2007).",
        "Schütze (1994) has presented an algorithm that categorizes word tokens in context instead of word types for tagging words.",
        "We take a novel perspective on the use of unsupervised latent-variable models by using them to compute features of each token that represent the distribution over that token s contexts.",
        "These features prove to be highly useful for supervised sequence labelers in out-of-domain tests.",
        "In the deep learning (Bengio, 2009) paradigm, researchers have investigated multilayer latentvariable models for language modeling, among other tasks.",
        "While n-gram models have traditionally dominated in language modeling, two recent efforts develop latent-variable probabilistic models that rival and even surpass n-gram models in accuracy (Blitzer et al., 2005; Mnih and Hinton, 2007).",
        "Several authors investigate neural network models that learn a vector of latent variables to represent each word (Bengio et al., 2003; Emami et al., 2003; Morin and Bengio, 2005).",
        "And factorial Hidden Markov Models (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997) are a multilayer variant of the HMM that has been used in speech recognition, among other things.",
        "We use simpler mixtures of single-layer models for the sake of memory-efficiency, and we use our models as representations in a supervised task, rather than as language models."

        "Our representation learning approach to domain adaptation yields state-of-the-art results in POS tagging experiments.",
        "Our best models use multidimensional clustering to find several latent categories for each word; the latent categories serve as useful and domain-independent features for our supervised learner.",
        "Our exploration has yielded significant progress already, but it has only scratched the surface of possible models for this task.",
        "The current representation learning techniques we use are unsupervised, meaning that they provide the same set of categories, regardless of what task they are to be used for.",
        "Semi-supervised learning approaches could be developed to guide the representation learning process towards features that are best-suited for a particular task, but are still useful across domains.",
        "Our current approach also requires retraining of a CRF for every new domain; incremental retraining techniques for new domains would speed up the process and make domain adaptation much more accessible.",
        "Finally, there are cases where small amounts ofla-beled data are available for new domains; models that combine our representation learning approach with instance weighting and other forms of supervised domain adaptation may take better advantage of these cases."
