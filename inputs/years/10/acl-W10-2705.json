        "The SERA project, funded under FP7-ICT call 3, was initially intended to take established technology and put it in people's homes so we could record what happens.",
        "The core idea was to provide data in order to compare alternate methodologies for moving from raw data to the next generation of synthetic companion.",
        "Our primary motivation for the proposal was the realisation that the semantics of language is just one part of language in use.",
        "Even in apparently task based dialogs, effective repair strategies are essential and, what is more, highly dependent on social skills.",
        "Although there are many ways of looking at language, do any of them provide the kind of information, and level of detail, required to build better conversational agents?",
        "The focus has turned out to be on robots rather than embodied conversational agents and the robot of choice was a Nabaztag.",
        "The Nabaztag is a commercially produced talking head from Violet in the",
        "Figure 1: Making an omelette.",
        "In the real world, people ignore our handiwork!",
        "(note Nabaztag ears in the foreground) style of Kismet and the Philips iCat.",
        "It is a stylized rabbit with expressive ears, a set of multi colour LEDs and is marketed as the world's first internet enabled talking rabbit.",
        "The rabbit connects to the Violet server via a wireless router and can run several applications including receiving SMS messages, weather reports, tai chi, and streaming selected radio or blog sites.",
        "The target participant group for the SERA experiments was older people with little experience of the limitations of computers.",
        "As it turns out, our subjects to date all have personal computers at home, but the lack of a keyboard or screen, and the rabbit being the only visible \"beige-ware\" means the set-up has been seen as sufficiently novel to provide classic discourse behaviour in spite of its limitations.",
        "The original scenario was to have the rabbit provide classic internet services but our connection with the National Health Service (UK) through one of the participants provided impetus for us to use a health related theme and enabled us to recruit some interesting people through Help the",
        "Aged (Hel, 2010), Aged Concern (Age, 2010) and similar organisations.",
        "The primary result so far is that the established technology is seriously wanting.",
        "Our initial intention was to put a Nabaztag in people's homes pretty much as it comes out of the box.",
        "The problem is that these robots are intended to be entertaining rather than useful and the novelty soon wears off.",
        "As Mival et al. point out (Mival et al., 2004) it is quite a challenge to design something that doesn't \"end up in the back of the cupboard with the batteries out.\"",
        "Indeed these machines are expected to be on a desk, and to be poked and prodded to make them do things.",
        "For instance, the messaging function of the Nabaztag is certainly fun and useful, but there are two modes in its standard format: in the first the rabbit gives the message and assumes you are there.",
        "There is no sensing of the environment; the rabbit simply blurts it out.",
        "In the second mode it acts more like a classic answering machine and the user is expected to press a button to prompt a conversation about messages.",
        "Although this might be useful, it is acting exactly like a classic answering machine and we thought we could do significantly better by adding a PIR sensor - a standard home security passive infra red sensor that detects movement.",
        "We thus skipped the first version of our set-up and moved straight to a slightly more proactive version that incorporated a PIR sensor to detect if the user was present.",
        "This is where the trouble starts, and is the primary point addressed in this paper.",
        "The second piece of wanting technology is ASR â€“ the automatic speech recognition.",
        "We initially considered a range of possibilities for the ASR and settled on Dragon Naturally Speaking, version 10 (DNS).",
        "In part this was driven by the fact that other projects were using it, and in part because of the DNS reputation.",
        "If we had gone for something else and it didn't work, well, people would have asked why we didn't use DNS.",
        "As it turned out, we could not get DNS to work with our set-up and for the first pass we resorted to yes/no buttons.",
        "Despite failing to get it working, using DNS was probably the right decision for exactly the reason given above.",
        "For the effort to have any impact however, other researchers need to know what happened and to this end the next section details our woes."

      "heading": "2. Speech Recognition",
      "text": [
        "Speech recognition has been seen as \"almost there\" for twenty years and, from Furbys to interactive voice response phone systems, there are instances where the technology is useful.",
        "What is more, there is a body of work that points to the word recognition rates being less critical than one might assume (Wallis et al., 2001; Skantze, 2007).",
        "We allocated three months of a speech post-doc to get something working and expected it to take a week.",
        "We considered several options including DNS, Loquendo's VoxNauta which has a garbage model (see below) the Sphinx-4 system from CMU which is open source and in Java, the Juicer system (Moore et al., 2006) for which we have local expertise, and the ubiquitous HTK ToolKit which would certainly have the flexibility to do what we thought needed doing but would, no doubt, result in something cobbled together and unreliable.",
        "On the plus side we did have a single user that we could train but on the minus, we felt a headset microphone was out of the question for the type of casual interaction we were expecting.",
        "From the outset the intention was to use word spotting in continuous speech rather than attempting to parse the user's input.",
        "This was primarily motivated by the observation that successful NLP technologies such as chatbots and information extraction work that way.",
        "What is more, unlike dictating a letter or capturing an academic talk, we expected our subjects would not talk in full sentences, and utterances to be quite short.",
        "A command based system was considered but we did not want to restrict it to \"Say yes, or no, now\" style dialogs.",
        "The approach we took was to use DNS as a large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer and then run regex style phrase spotting over the result - a classic pipeline model.",
        "The architecture was, and remains, an event driven model in which the dialog manager unloads and loads sets of \"words of interest\" into the recognizer at pretty well each turn.",
        "These sets are of phrases rather than words, and ideally would include the regex equivalent of \".+\" and \"~\" - that is \"anything said\" and \"nothing said\".",
        "The recognizer then reports back whenever something of interest occurs in the input, and does it in a timely manner.",
        "The motivation for integrating speech and language this closely is the belief that the dialog manager can have a quite concise view of what the subject will say next.",
        "What is more, getting it wrong is not critical if (and only if) the dialog manager has a decent repair strategy.",
        "The first of these beliefs is discussed further below, and the second is based on the results such as those in Wallis and in Skantze mentioned above.",
        "The result was that we failed to get speech recognition working for the first iteration - despite the world leading expertise in the group.",
        "To quote from the 12 month project review:",
        "The COTS speech recognition did not prove as effective as supposed in the unstructured domestic environment, partly because of poor accuracy but also because of unacceptable latency imposed by the language model.",
        "Effective ASR deployment was further complicated by lack of access to the workings of the underlying proprietary recognition engine.",
        "... and there is now a wider realisation and acceptance among partners that ASR is not a solved problem.",
        "[sera m12 review, 25/03/2010]",
        "It turns out that a significant part of the performance delivered from dictation systems comes from the language model, not from the sound itself.",
        "The result was firstly that the system would wait for more input when the user didn't produce a grammatical sentence.",
        "This latency was often well beyond the point at which the resulting silence is treated by the user as information bearing.",
        "Secondly, when we did grab the available parts of the decision lattice in order to fix the latency issue, the hypotheses were very poor.",
        "Presumably this is because the language model was providing evidence based on the false assumption that the user would speak in proper sentences.",
        "Trials are under way to test this.",
        "The take away message is that dictation systems are not necessarily suited to interactive dialog.",
        "We have since heard that there are \"secret switches\" that those in the know can adjust (Hieronymus, 2009) on DNS but, in retrospect, if one is forced to use a COTS product one might be better off using a system such as Vox-Nauta that acknowledges the needs of interactive systems by including a garbage model.",
        "At least Loquendo have thought about the problems of interactive speech even if there is an apparent performance difference as measured in terms of word error rates.",
        "The extent to which ASR relies on the language model encourages us further to believe that a tightly coupled dialog manager and speech recognition system will prove significantly better than simply piping data from one module to another."

        "As an example the system might have finished its (system initiated) conversation about the day ahead and wait to see if the human wants to talk about their day before moving back to the Alert state in which the subject would need to go through the process of initiating a discussion.",
        "These four states, Sleeping, Alert, Talking, or Listening (Engaged) are controlled by external events and timers.",
        "The GUI for editing dialog action frames provides 4 timing values as follows:",
        "Pause 1 indicates the end of a turn by the user - it is an opportunity for the system to say something.",
        "Pause 2 indicates the system ought to say something, and with nothing to say, it does an encouragement.",
        "Pause 3 is the time after which the system drops the context of the conversation.",
        "Pause 4 is the time at which the system goes to Sleep after the last PIR event.",
        "Mapping these pauses into action, at pause 1 the system may move from Listening to Talking; pause 2 is the same but with a conversational \"filler\".",
        "At pause 3 it moves from Engaged to Alert, and pause 4 from Alert to Sleeping.",
        "The PIR sensor is the primary means by which the system is moved from Sleeping to Alert, and Alert to Engaged (actually Listening) can be human initiated by calling the system by name -\"Hey Furby!\"",
        "being used on that classic toy, and \"Computer\" being used on the bridge of the Star Ship Enterprise.",
        "Alternatively the system may initiate a conversation (Alert to Listening again) based on sensor information (for example, in our case the house keys being taken off the hook) an incoming message, or a diary event.",
        "The SALT(E) interaction manager relates to the dialog manager in that the interaction manager handles the timing and determines when to say things while it is left to the dialog manager to decide what to say.",
        "The interface can again be described with a class diagram in which a DialogManager extends the InteractionManager implementing the following abstract methods: heardThis(wrdEvent) getWhatToSay():String nextEncouragement():String It is of course trivial to implement an Eliza style conversation based on heardThis/getWhatToSay with nextEncouragement taking the role of \"nothing matched\" patterns.",
        "In the case of SERA, the dialog manager is a conventional state based system with states clustered into topics.",
        "The interaction manager also provides two other methods:",
        "wakeup()",
        "systemInit(WrdEvent1,wrdEvent2) The first moves the system from Sleeping to Alert and initiates the pause 4 timer.",
        "The method sys-temInit(... ) calls heardThis() immediately with wrdEvent1 - note the interaction manager still needs to call getWhatToSay() before anything is said.",
        "The second argument is past to heardThis() the next time the system becomes Alert.",
        "That is, the next time the user appears and the system moves from Sleeping to Alert, or the next time the system moves from Engaged to Alert.",
        "wrdEvent1 is an urgent message - in our case the message that the video recording is on - and wrdEvent2 represents something that can join the queue."
