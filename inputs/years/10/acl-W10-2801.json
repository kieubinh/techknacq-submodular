        "Many of the dimensionality reduction algorithms assume that the unreduced word space is linear.",
        "However, word similarities have been shown to exhibit many non-metric properties: asymmetry, e.g North Korea is more similar to Red China than Red China is to North Korea, and non-transitivity, e.g. Cuba is similar the former USSR, Jamaica is similar to Cuba, but Jamaica is not similar to the USSR (Tversky, 1977).",
        "We hypothesize that a non-linear word space model might more accurately preserve these non-metric relationships.",
        "To test our hypothesis, we capture the nonlinear structure with dimensionality reduction by using Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) (He and Niyogi, 2003), an efficient, linear approximation of Eigenmaps (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002).",

        "The first is the Vector Space Model (VSM) (Salton et al., 1975).",
        "Words are represented as vectors where each dimension corresponds to a document in the corpus and the dimension's value is the number of times the word occurred in the document.",
        "We label the second model the Word Co-occurrence (WC) model: each dimension correspond to a unique word, with the dimension's value indicating the number of times that dimension's word co-occurred.",
        "Dimensionality reduction has been applied to both models for three kinds of benefits: to improve computational efficiency, to capture higher order relationships between words, and to reduce noise by smoothing or eliminating noisy features.",
        "We consider three of the most popular reduction techniques and the general word space models to which they have been applied: linear projections, feature elimination and random approximations.",
        "The most frequently applied linear projection technique is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",
        "The SVD factors a matrix A, which represents a word space, into three matrices UXVTsuch that X is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values ofA, ordered descending based on their effect on the variance in the values of A.",
        "The original matrix can be approximated by using only the top k singular values, setting all others to 0.",
        "The approximation matrix, A = Uk Xk VfcT, is the least squares best-fit rank-k approximation of A.",
        "The SVD has been used with great success on both models.",

        "WC models have also utilized the SVD to improve performance (Schütze, 1992; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Baroni and Lenci, 2008).",
        "Feature elimination reduces the dimensionality by removing those with low information content.",
        "This approach has been successfully applied to WC models such as HAL (Lund and Burgess, 1996) by dropping those with low entropy.",
        "This technique effectively removes the feature dimensions of high frequency words, which provide little discriminatory content.",
        "Randomized projections have also been successfully applied to VSM models, e.g. (Kanerva et al., 2000) and WC models, e.g. (Sahlgren et al., 2008).",
        "This reduction statistically approximates the original space in a much lower dimensional space.",
