        "Bayesian non-parametric mixture models have the attractive property that the number of components used to model the data is not fixed in advance but is determined by the model and the data.",
        "This property is particularly interesting for NLP where many tasks are aimed at discovering novel information.",
        "Recent work has applied such models to various tasks with promising results, e.g. Teh (2006) and Cohn et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Vlachos et al.",
        "(2009) applied the basic model of this class, the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), to lexical-semantic verb clustering with encouraging results.",
        "The task involves discovering classes of verbs similar in terms of their syntactic-semantic properties (e.g. MOTION class for travel, walk, run, etc.).",
        "Such classes can provide important support for other tasks, such as word sense disambiguation, parsing and semantic role labeling.",
        "(Dang, 2004; Swier and Stevenson, 2004) Although some fixed classifications are available these are not comprehensive and are inadequate for specific domains.",
        "Furthermore, Vlachos et al.",
        "(2009) used a constrained version of the DPMM in order to guide clustering towards some prior intuition or considerations relevant to the specific task at hand.",
        "This supervision was modelled as pairwise constraints between instances and it informs the model of relations between them that cannot be recovered by the model on the basis of the feature representation used.",
        "Like other forms of supervision, these constraints require manual annotation and it is important to maximize the benefits obtained from it.",
        "Therefore it is natural to consider active learning (Settles, 2009) in order to focus the supervision on clusterings on which the model is uncertain.",
        "In this work, we propose a simple yet effective active learning method employing uncertainty based sampling.",
        "The effectiveness of the AL method is demonstrated on two datasets, one of which has multiple gold standards."

        "In DPMMs, the parameters of each component are generated by a Dirichlet Process (DP) which can be seen as a distribution over distributions.",
        "Each instance, represented by its features, is generated by the component it is assigned to.",
        "The components discovered correspond to the clusters.",
        "The prior probability of assigning an instance to a particular component is proportionate to the number of instances already assigned to it, in other words, the DPMM exhibits the \"rich get richer\" property.",

        "Customers (instances) arrive at a Chinese restaurant which has an infinite number of tables (components).",
        "Each customer sits at one of the tables that is either occupied or vacant with popular tables attracting more customers.",

        "In Eq.",
        "1 p(zi = z\\z-i) is the CRP prior and P(xi\\zi = z,X-i) is the distribution that generates instance xi given it has been assigned to component z.",
        "This sampling scheme is possible because the assignments in the model are exchangeable, i.e. their order is not relevant.",
        "The constrained version of the DPMM uses pairwise constraints over instances in order to adapt the clustering discovered.",
        "Following Wagstaff & Cardie (2000), a pair of instances is either linked together (must-link) or not (cannot-link).",

        "All links are assumed to be consistent with each other.",
        "In order to incorporate the constraints in the DPMM, the Gibbs sampling scheme is modified so that must-linked instances are generated by the same component and cannot-linked instances always by different ones.",

        "(2009), for each instance that does not belong to a linked-group, the sampler is restricted to choose components that do not contain instances cannot-linked with it.",
        "For instances in a linked-group, their assignment is sampled jointly, again taking into account their cannot-links.",
        "This is performed by adding each instance of the linked-group successively to the same component.",

        "In the context of the DPMMs, the model chooses a pair of instances for which a must-link or a cannot-link must be provided.",
        "To select the pair, we employ the simple but effective idea of uncertainty based sampling.",
        "We consider the most informative link as that on which the model is most uncertain, more formally the link between instances 1j that maximizes the following entropy:",
        "If we consider clustering as binary classification of links into must-links and cannot-links, it is equivalent to selecting the pair with the highest label entropy.",
        "During the sampling process used for parameter inference, component assignments vary between samples and the components themselves are not identifiable, i.e. one cannot match the components of one sample with those of another.",
        "Furthermore, the conditional assignments estimated during Gibbs sampling (Eq.",
        "1) they do not capture the uncertainty of the assignments z-i on which they condition.",
        "Therefore, we resort to generating a set of samples from the (possibly constrained) DPMM and pick the link on which these samples maximally disagree, i.e. we approximate the distribution in Eq.",
        "2 with the probability that instances i, j are in the same cluster or not.",
        "Thus, in a given set of samples the most uncertain link would be the one between two instances which are in the same cluster in exactly half of these samples.",
        "Using multiple samples allows us to take into account the uncertainty in the assignments of the other instances, as well as the varying number of components.",
        "Compared to standard pool-based AL, when clustering with constraints the possible links between two instances (ignoring transitivity) are C(N, 2) = N(N - 1)/2 (N is the size of the dataset) and there is an equal number of candidate queries to be considered, as opposed to N queries in a supervised classification task.",
        "Another interesting difference is that the the AL process can be initiated without any supervision, since the DPMM is unsupervised.",
        "On the other hand, in the standard AL scenario a (usually small) labelled seed set is used.",
        "Therefore, we rely exclusively on the model and the features to guide the constraint selection process.",
        "If the model combined with the features is not appropriate for the task then the constraints chosen are unlikely to be useful."

        "In both datasets the features for each verb are its subcategorization frames (SCFs) which capture the syntactic context in which it occurs.",
        "They were acquired automatically using a domain-independent statistical parsing toolkit, RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002), and a classifier which identifies verbal SCFs.",
        "As a consequence, they include some noise due to standard text processing and parsing errors and due to the subtlety of the argument-adjunct distinction.",
        "The general English dataset contains 204 verbs belonging to 17 fine-grained classes in Levin's (Levin, 1993) taxonomy so that each class contains 12 verbs.",
        "The biomedical dataset consists of 193 medium to high frequency verbs from a corpus of 2230 full-text articles from 3 biomedical journals.",
        "A team of linguists and biologists created a three-level gold standard with 16, 34 and 50 classes.",
        "Both datasets were preprocessed using non-negative matrix factorization (Lin, 2007) which decomposes a large sparse matrix into two dense matrices (of lower dimensionality) with non-negative values.",
        "In all experiments 35 dimensions were kept.",
        "Preliminary experiments with different number of dimensions kept did not affect the performance substantially.",
        "We evaluate our results using three information theoretic measures: Variation of Information (Meila, 2007), V-measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) and V-beta (Vlachos et al., 2009).",
        "All three assess the two desirable properties that a clustering should have with respect to a gold standard, homogeneity and completeness.",
        "Homogeneity reflects the degree to which each cluster contains instances from a single class and is defined as the conditional entropy of the class distribution of the gold standard given the clustering.",
        "Completeness reflects the degree to which each class is contained in a single cluster and is defined as the conditional entropy of clustering given the class distribution in the gold standard.",
        "V-beta balances these properties explicitly by taking into account the ratio of the number of cluster discovered over the number of classes in the gold standard.",
        "While an ideal clustering should have both properties, naively improving one of them can be harmful for the other.",
        "Compared to the more commonly used F-measure (Fung et al., 2003), these measures have the advantage that they do not assume a mapping between clusters and classes."

        "AL performance levels out in later stages with performance superior to the one achieved using random selection with the same number of constraints.",
        "The poor performance of random selection is expected, since the unsupervised DPMM predicts more than 90% of the binary links correctly.",
        "Another interesting observation is that, during AL, homogeneity increased faster than completeness (graphs 1(g) and 1(h)).",
        "This suggests that the features used lead the model towards finer-grained clusters, which is further confirmed by the fact that the highest scores on the biomedical dataset are achieved when comparing against the finest-grained version of the gold standard.",
        "While it is possible to choose constraints to the model that would increase completeness with respect to the gold standard, we argue that this would not allow us to obtain obtain insights on the model and the features used.",

        "This phenomenon occurs in varying degrees in many applications of AL.",
        "Manual inspection of the links chosen at each round revealed that batches often contained links involving the same instances.",
        "This is expected due to transitivity: if the link between instances A and B is uncertain but the link between instances B and C is certain, then the link between A and C will be uncertain too.",
        "While reducing the batch size leads to better learning rates, it requires estimating the model more often.",
        "In order to ameliorate this issue, after obtaining the label of the most uncertain link, we remove the samples that disagreed with it and recalculate the uncertainty of the remaining links given the remaining samples.",

        "A consideration that arises is that by reducing the number of samples used for uncertainty estimation, progressively we are left with fewer samples to rank the remaining links.",
        "Each labeled link reduces the number of samples approximately by half since the most uncertain link is likely to be a must-link in half the samples and a cannot-lnk in the remaining half.",
        "As a result, for a batch with size \\ B \\ the uncertainty of the last link will be estimated using \\S\\/2'BI-1samples.",
        "A crude solution would be to generate enough samples for the desired batch size.",
        "However, obtaining a very large number of samples can be computationally expensive.",
        "Therefore, we set a threshold for the minimum number of samples to be used to estimate the link uncertainty and when it is reached, more samples are generated using the constraints selected.",
