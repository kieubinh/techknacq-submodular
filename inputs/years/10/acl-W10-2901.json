        "It has been shown in (Hanig et al., 2008) that statistical methods like calculating significant cooccurrences and context clustering are applicable to grammar induction from raw text.",
        "The underlying assumption states that each word prefers a certain position within a phrase.",
        "Two particular cases are of special interest: a word's occurrence at the beginning ofa sentence and a word's occurrence at the end of a sentence.",
        "Those positions obviously are constituent borders and can be easily used to extract syntactic knowledge.",
        "One possibility is to discover constituents employing constituency tests (see (Adger, 2003)), whereby these two cases can be used to express and use one of them in a formal way: the movement test.",
        "Three neighbourhood co-occurrences express the aforementioned observations:",
        "Value a denotes the significance of word A standing at the last position of a sentence (where $ is an imaginary word to mark a sentences' end).",
        "• Contrary, variable b denotes the significance of a word B being observed at the beginning of a sentence (where \" is an imaginary word to mark the beginning of a sentence).",
        "• Additionally, a third value is necessary to represent the statistical significance of the neighbourhood co-occurrence containing word A",
        "and B.",
        "To compute those significance values for a corpus, the log-likelihood measure (see (Dunning, 1993)) is applied using corpus size n, term frequencies ua and nB (for the words A and B) and frequency nab of the co-occurrence of A and B.",
        "To detect constituent borders between two words, a separation value sepab can be defined",
        "If word A occurs more significantly at the end of a sentence as in front of B, then a > 1.",
        "Additionally, b is larger than c if B is observed more significantly at the beginning of a sentence as after A and C will be > 1.",
        "In this case sepAB is > 1 and obviously, a constituent border would be situated between A and B.",
        "The basic approach to create parse trees from separation values between two adjacent words is to consecutively merge the two subtrees containing the words with the smallest separation value between them – starting with each word in a separate subtree.",
        "In order to avoid data sparseness problems, co-occurrences and separation values are primarily calculated on part-of-speech tags.",
        "However, word co-occurrences will be used to preserve word form specific dependencies.",
        "In this paper, we want to present unsuParse+ – an extension of this co-occurrence based approach.",
        "The first extension is the distinction between endocentric and exocentric elements which introduces the detection of heads along with their modifiers (see section 2.2).",
        "Furthermore, learning of recursive constructions is facilitated.",
        "Secondly, we will consider discontiguous dependencies and present a possibility to detect rare constructions like complex noun phrases (see section 2.3).",
        "As third enhancement, we employ a simple clustering algorithm to induced phrases in order to detect constituents holding identical syntactic functions.",
        "Those phrases will be labeled the same way instead of by different phrase numbers (see section 2.4).",
        "First, we will start with the detection of constituent candidates.",
        "Instead of using sepAB to detect constituent borders we use neighbourhood co-occurrence significances on account of an experiment in (Hanig et al., 2008) showing that the pure significance value c is sufficient.",
        "Furthermore, we do not restrict the detection of phrases to bigrams and allow the detection of arbitrary n-grams.",
        "The motivation behind this is basically caused by coordinating conjunctions for which discussions on the correct structure are raised.",
        "While Chomsky (1965) argues in favor of symmetric multiple-branching coordinating constructions (see Figure 1), recent discussions in the context of unification grammars (especially head-driven phrase structure grammar (see (Pollard and Sag, 1994)) prefer asymmetric endocentric constructions (see (Kayne, 1995) and (Sag, 2002)).",
        "The corresponding structure can be seen in Figure 2.",
        "Nevertheless, a symmetric construction containing two heads seems to be more appropriate for some languages (e. g. German, see (Lang, 2002)).",
        "NNS CC NNS cats and dogs cats CC NNS",
        "Thus, the presented algorithm is able to deal with phrases containing any number of compounds.",
        "As in (Hanig et al., 2008), phrases will be learned in an iterative manner (see details in section 2.5).",
        "Within each iteration, the n-gram P yielding the highest significance is considered to be the best candidate for being a valid constituent.",
        "The preferred position of part-of-speech tags is maintained as we define pref (A) for every POS tag A.",

        "6:",
        "Analogous to sepAB (see section 2) pref (A) is > 1 if POS tag A prefers the first position within a phrase and vice versa.",
        "Before a phrase candidate is used to create a new grammar rule, its validity has to be checked.",
        "Using the assumption that every word prefers a certain position within a constituent leads us to check the first word of a phrase candidate for preferring the first position and the last word for favoring the last one.",
        "But there are at least two exceptions: coordinating conjunctions and compound nouns.",
        "Those constructions (e. g. cats/NNS and/CC dogs/NNS, dog/NN house/NN) usually start and end with the same phrase respectively POS tag.",
        "This would lead to wrong validation results, because NNS or NN do prefer the last position within a constituent and should not occur at the beginning.",
        "As both constructions are endocentric, they prefer the head's position within the superordinating phrase and thus, their existence does not stand in contrast to the assumption made about preferred positions.",
        "Formally, we get the following proposition:",
        "An uncertainty factor is introduced by p, as some parts-of-speech tend to not appear at the borders of a sentence although they prefer a certain position within constituents.",
        "Some examples (given in Table 1) of the 5 most frequent English and German parts-of-speech will demonstrate this effect.",
        "In both languages proper nouns (NNP resp.",
        "Ni?)",
        "occur slightly more often at the beginning ofa sentence than at its end, although proper nouns prefer – like normal nouns – the last position of a phrase.",
        "To account for this effect, pref (A) will be iteratively adapted to the observations of learned grammar rules as given in Equ.",
        "8:",
        "Due to iterative learning of rules, we can use knowledge obtained during a previous iteration.",
        "Every rule contains reinforcing information about the preferred position of a part-of-speech.",
        "pref (A) is adapted by a factor ö (with 0 < ö < 1) for the corresponding parts-of-speech and it will converge to its preferred position.",
        "In later iterations, significances of phrase candidates do not differ considerably from each other and thus, the order of phrase candidates is not very reliable anymore.",
        "Consequently, parts-of-speech occur at non-preferred positions more often and trustworthy knowledge (in form of pref (A)) about the preferred positions of parts-of-speech is very helpful to avoid those phrase candidates from being validated.",
        "We want to give one example for English: adjectives (JJ).",
        "Before the first iteration, pref ( JJ) is initialized with 1.046 which means that JJ has no preferred position.",
