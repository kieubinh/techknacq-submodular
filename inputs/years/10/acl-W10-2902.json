        "In our case, the model already makes strong simplifying assumptions and the objective is also incorrect.",
        "It makes sense that Viterbi EM sometimes works, since an approximate wrong \"solution\" could, by chance, be better than one that is exactly wrong.",
        "One reason why Viterbi EM may work well is that its score is used in selecting actual output parse trees.",
        "Wainwright (2006) provided strong theoretical and empirical arguments for using the same approximate inference method in training as in performing predictions for a learned model.",
        "He showed that if inference involves an approximation, then using the same approximate method to train the model gives even better performance guarantees than exact training methods.",
        "If our task were not parsing but language modeling, where the relevant score is the sum of the probabilities over individual derivations, perhaps classic EM would not be doing as badly, compared to Viterbi.",
        "Viterbi training is not only faster and more accurate but also free of inside-outside's recursion constraints.",
        "It therefore invites more flexible modeling techniques, including discriminative, feature-rich approaches that target conditional likelihoods, essentially via (unsupervised) self-training (Clark et al., 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2003; McClosky et al., 2006a; McClosky et al., 2006b, inter alia).",
        "Such \"learning by doing\" approaches may be relevant to understanding human language acquisition, as children frequently find themselves forced to interpret a sentence in order to interact with the world.",
        "Since most models of human probabilistic parsing are massively pruned (Juraf-sky, 1996; Chater et al., 1998; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005, inter alia), the serial nature of Viterbi EM – or the very limited parallelism of k-best Viterbi – may be more appropriate in modeling this task than the fully-integrated inside-outside solution."
