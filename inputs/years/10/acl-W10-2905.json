        "Most works dealing with Grammar Induction (GI) are focused on Supervised Grammar Induction, using a corpus of syntactically annotated sentences, or treebank, as a reference to extract the grammar.",
        "The existence of a treebank for the language and for a particular type of texts from which we want to extract the grammar is a great help to GI, even taking into account the theoretical limitations of GI, such as the fact that grammars cannot be correctly identified from positive examples alone (Gold, 1967).",
        "But the manual annotation of thousands of sentences is a very expensive task and thus there are many languages for which there are not treebanks available.",
        "Even in languages for which there is a treebank, it is usually composed of a particular kind of texts (newspaper articles, for example) and may not be appropriate for other kind of texts, such as tales or poetry.",
        "These reasons have led to the appearance of several works focused on unsupervised GI.",
        "Thanks to our knowledge of the language we know that some classes of words are particularly influential to determine the structure of a sentence.",
        "For example, let us consider the tree in Figure 1, for which the meaning of the POS tags appears in Table 1.",
        "We can observe that the tag MD (Modal) breaks the sentence into two parts.",
        "Analogously, in the tree appearing in Figure 2 the POS tag VBZ breaks the sentence.",
        "In both cases, we can see that after the breaking tag, a new level appears in the parse tree.",
        "A similar effect is observed for other POS tags, such as VB in the tree of Figure 1 and IN in the tree of Figure 2.",
        "We call these kind of POS tags separators.",
        "There are also other POS tags which are frequently the beginning or the end of a constituent.",
        "For example in the tree in Figure 1 we can find the sequences (DT NN) and (DT JJ NN), which according to the parse tree are constituents.",
        "In the tree in Figure 2 we find the sequence (DT NNP VBG NN).",
        "In both trees we can also find sequences beginning with the tag NNP: (NNP NNP) and (NNP CD) in the tree in Figure 1 and (NNP NNP), which appears twice, in the tree in Figure 2.",
        "This suggests that there are classes of words with a trend to be the beginning or the end of constituents without giving rise to new levels in the parse tree.",
        "We call these POS tags sub-separators.",
        "These observations reflect some of our intuitions, such as the fact that most sentences are composed of a noun phrase and a verb phrase, being frequently the verb the beginning of the verbal phrase, which usually leads to a new level of the parse tree.",
        "We also know that determiners (DT) are frequently the beginning of the noun phrases.",
        "Figure 1 : Parse tree for the sentence Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29. from the Penn Treebank",
        "Figure 2: Parse tree for the sentence Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group.",
        "from the Penn Treebank",
        "At this point we could either try to figure out what is the set of tags which work as separators, or to compute them from a parsed corpus for the considered language, provided it is available.",
        "However, because we do not want to rely on the existence of a treebank for the corresponding language and type of texts we have done something different: we have devised a statistical procedure to automatically capture the word classes which function as separators.",
        "In this way our approach can be applied to most languages, and apart from providing a tool for extracting grammars and parsing sentences, it can be useful to study the different classes of words that work as separators in different languages.",
        "Our statistical mechanism to detect separators is applied to a corpus of sentences annotated with POS tags.",
        "This is not a strong requirement since there are very accurate POS taggers (about 97%) for many languages.",
        "The grammar that we obtain does not specify the left-hand-side ofthe rules, but only sequences of POS tags that are constituents.",
        "Table 1: Alphabetical list of part-of-speech tags used in the Penn Treebank, the corpus used in our experiments",
        "At this point we have followed the Klein and Manning (2005) setting for the problem, which allows us to compare our results to theirs.",
        "As far as we know these are the best results obtained so far for unsupervised GI using a monolingual corpus.",
        "As they do, we have used the Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) for our experiments, employing the syntactic annotations that it provides for evaluation purposes only.",
        "Specifically, we have used WSJ10, composed of 6842 sentences, which is the subset of the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, containing only those sentences of 10 words or less after removing punctuation and null elements, such as $, \", etc.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 reviews some related works; section 3 describes the details of the proposal to automatically extract the separators from a POS tagged corpus; section 4 is devoted to describe the procedure to find a parse tree using the separators; section 5 presents and discusses the experimental results, and section 6 draws the main conclusions of this work.",

        "A growing interest in unsupervised GI has been observed recently with the appearance of several works in the topic.",
        "Some ofthese works have focused on finding patterns of words (Solan et al., 2005) more than syntactic structures.",
        "It has been noted that the rules produced by GI can also be interpreted semantically (David et al., 2003), where a non-terminal describes interchangeable elements which are instances ofthe same concepts.",
        "Distributional approaches to unsupervised GI exploit the principle of substitutability: constituents of the same type may be exchanged with one another without affecting the syntax of the surrounding context.",
        "Distributional approaches to grammar induction fall into two categories, depending on their treatment ofnested structure.",
        "The first category covers Expectation-Maximization (EM) systems (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "These systems propose constituents based on analysis ofthe text, and then select a non-contradictory combination of constituents for each sentence that maximizes a given metric, usually parsing probability.",
        "One of the most successful proposals in this area is the one by Klein and Manning (2005), which, as mentioned before, starts from a corpus labelled only with POS tags.",
        "The key idea of the model proposed in this work is that constituents appear in constituent contexts.",
        "However, the EM algorithm presents some serious problems: it is very slow (Lari and Young, 1990), and is easily trapped in local maxima (Carroll and Charniak, 1992).",
        "Alignment Based Learning (ABL) (van Zaanen and Leeds, 2000) is the only EM system applied directly to raw text.",
        "However, ABL is relatively inefficient and has only been applied to small corpora.",
        "Brooks (Brooks, 2006) reverses the notion of distributional approaches: if we can identify \"surrounding context\" by observation, we can hypothesize that word sequences occurring in that context will be constituents of the same type.",
        "He describes a simplified model of distributional analysis (for raw test) which uses heuristics to reduce the number of candidate constituents under consideration.",
        "This is an interesting idea in spite that Brook showed that the system was only capable of learning a small subset of constituent structures in a large test corpus.",
        "The second category is that of incremental learning systems.",
        "An incremental system analyzes a corpus in a bottom-up fashion: each time a new constituent type is found it is inserted into the corpus to provide data for later learning.",
        "The EMILE systems are examples for this category, not yet evaluated on large corpora.",
        "Bilingual experiments have been also conducted with the aim to exploit information from one language to disambiguate another.",
        "Usually such a setting requires a parallel corpus or another annotated data that ties the two languages.",
        "Cohen and Smith (2009) use the English and Chinese treebanks, which are not parallel corpora, to train parsers for both languages jointly.",
        "Their results shown that the performance on English improved in the bilingual setting.",
        "Another related work (Snyder et al., 2009) uses three corpora of parallel text.",
        "Their approach is closer to the unsupervised bilingual parsing model developed by Kuhn (2004), which aims to improve monolingual performance.",
        "The approach considered in this work follows a different direction, trying to identify certain patterns that can determine the structure of the parse trees."

        "We can observe that we have obtained more balanced values of recall and precision, as well as a better value for the F-measure.",
        "Thus the method proposed in this work, that we expect to refine by assigning different probabilities to separators and sub-separators, depending on the context they appear in, provides a very promising approach.",
        "Figure 5 shows the results of unlabeled recall, precision and F-measure obtained per constituent size.",
        "We can observe that recall and precision, and thus the corresponding F-measure, are quite similar for every constituent size.",
        "This is important, because obtaining a high F-measure thanks to a very high recall but with a poor precision, is not so useful.",
        "We can also observe that the best results are obtained for short and long constituents, with lower values for middle lengths, such as 5 and 6.",
        "We believe that this is because intermediate size constituents present more variability.",
        "Moreover, for intermediate sizes, the composition ofthe constituents is more dependent on sub-separators, for which the statistical differences are less significant than for separators.",
