        "In all of these cases, multilingual models yield increased accuracy because different languages present different ambiguities and therefore offer complementary constraints on the shared underlying labels.",
        "In the present work, we consider a setting where we already possess supervised monolingual models, and wish to improve these models using unannotated bilingual parallel text (bitext).",
        "We cast this problem in the multiple-view (multiview) learning framework (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Balcan and Blum, 2005; Ganchev et al., 2008).",

        "We show that by introducing weakened monolingual models into the bilingual view, we can optimize the parameters of the bilingual model to improve monolingual models.",
        "At prediction time, we automatically account for the between-view dependence introduced by the weakened monolingual models with a simple but effective view-combination heuristic.",
        "We demonstrate the performance of this method on two problems.",
        "The first is named entity recognition (NER).",
        "For this problem, our method automatically learns (a variation on) earlier hand-designed rule-based bilingual NER predictors (Huang and Vogel, 2002; Moore, 2003), resulting in absolute performance gains of up to 16.1% Fi.",
        "The second task we consider is statistical parsing.",
        "For this task, we follow the setup of Burkett and Klein (2008), who improved Chinese and English monolingual parsers using parallel, hand-parsed text.",
        "We achieve nearly identical improvements using a purely unlabeled bitext.",
        "These results carry over to machine translation, where we can achieve slightly better BLEU improvements than the supervised model of Bur-kett and Klein (2008) since we are able to train our model directly on the parallel data where we perform rule extraction.",
