        "Consequently, the methodology of clustering evaluation is of great importance.",
        "In this paper we focus on external clustering evaluation, i.e., evaluation against manually annotated gold standards, which exist for almost all such NLP tasks.",
        "External evaluation is the dominant form of clustering evaluation in NLP, although other methods have been proposed (see e.g. (Frank et al., 2009)).",
        "In this paper we discuss type level evaluation, which evaluates the set membership structure created by the clustering, independently of the token statistics of the gold standard corpus.",
        "Many clustering algorithms are evaluated by their success in tagging corpus tokens (Clark, 2003; Nicolae and Nicolae, 2006; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008; Elsner et al., 2009).",
        "However, in many cases a type level evaluation is the natural one.",
        "This is the case, for example, when a POS induction algorithm is used to compute a tag dictionary (the set of tags that each word can take), or when a lexical acquisition algorithm is used for constructing a lexicon containing the set of frames that a verb can participate in, or when a sense induction algorithm computes the set ofpos-sible senses of each word.",
        "In addition, even when the goal is corpus tagging, a type level evaluation is highly valuable, since it may cast light on the relative or absolute merits of different algorithms (as we show in this paper).",
        "Clustering evaluation has been extensively investigated (Section 3).",
        "However, the discussion centers around the monosemous case, where each item belongs to exactly one cluster, although polysemy is the common case in NLP.",
        "The contribution of the present paper is as follows.",
        "First, we discuss the issue oftype level evaluation and explain why even in the monosemous case a token level evaluation presents a skewed picture (Section 2).",
        "Second, we show for the common polysemous case why adapting existing information-theoretic measures to type level evaluation is not natural (Section 3).",

        "Some algorithms directly compute a clustering, while some others produce a tagging of corpus tokens from which a clustering can be easily derived.",
        "A clustering is monosemous if each item is allowed to belong to a single cluster only, andpolysemous otherwise.",
        "An external evaluation is one which is based on a comparison ofan algorithm's result to a gold standard.",
        "In this paper we focus solely on external evaluation, which is the most common evaluation approach in NLP.",
        "Token and type level evaluations reflect different aspects of a clustering.",
        "External token level evaluation assesses clustering quality according to the clustering's accuracy on a given manually annotated corpus.",
        "This is certainly a useful evaluation measure, e.g. when the purpose of the clustering algorithm is to annotate a corpus to serve as input to another application.",
        "External type level evaluation views the computed clustering as a set membership structure and evalutes it independently of the token statistics in the gold standard corpus.",
        "There are two main cases in which this is useful.",
        "First, a type level evaluation can be the natural one in light of the problem itself.",
        "For example, if the purpose of the clustering algorithm is to automatically build a lexicon (e.g., VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000)), then the lexicon structure itself should be evaluated.",
        "Second, it may be valuable to decouple corpus statistics from the induced clustering when the latter is to be used for annotating corpora that exhibit different statistics.",
        "In other words, ifwe evaluate an algorithm that will be invoked on a diverse set of corpora having different token statistics, a type level evaluation might provide a better picture (or at least a complementary one) on the quality of the clustering algorithm.",
        "To motivate type level evaluation, consider POS induction, which exemplifies both cases above.",
        "Clearly, a word form may belong to several parts of speech (e.g., 'contrast' is both a noun and a verb, 'fast' is both an adjective and an adverb, 'that' can be a determiner, conjunction and adverb, etc.).",
        "As an evaluation of a POS induction algorithm, it is natural to evaluate the lexicon it generates, even if the main goal is to annotate a corpus.",
        "The lexicon lists the possible POS tags for each word, and thus its evaluation is a polysemous type level one.",
        "Even if we ignore polysemy, type level evaluation is useful for a POS induction algorithm used to tag a corpus.",
        "There are POS classes whose members are very frequent, e.g., determiners and prepositions.",
        "Here, a very small number of word types usually accounts for a large portion ofcorpus tokens.",
        "For example, in the WSJ Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), there are 43,740 word types and over 1M word tokens.",
        "Of the types, 88 are tagged as prepositions.",
        "These types account for only 0.2% of the types, but for as many as 11.9% ofthe tokens.",
        "An algorithm which is accurate only on prepositions would do much better in a token level evaluation than in a type level one.",
        "This phenomenon is not restricted to prepositions or English.",
        "In the WSJ corpus, determiners account for 0.05% of the types but for 9.8% of the tokens.",
        "In the German NEGRA corpus (Brants, 1997), the article class (both definite and indefinite) accounts for 0.04% of the word types and for 12.5% of the word tokens, and the coordinating conjunctions class accounts for 0.05% ofthe word types but for 3% of the tokens.",
        "The type and token behavior differences result from the Zipfian distribution of word tokens to word types (Mitzenmacher, 2004).",
        "Since the word frequency distribution is Zipfian, any clustering algorithm that is accurate only on a small number of frequent words (not necessarily members of a particular class) would perform well in a token level evaluation but not in a type one.",
        "For example, the most frequent 100 word types (regardless of POS class) in WSJ (NEGRA) account for 43.9% (41.3%) of the tokens in the corpus.",
        "These words appear in 32 out of the 34 non-punctuation POS classes in WSJ and in 38 out of the 51 classes in",
        "NEGRA.",
        "Other natural language entities also demonstrate Zipfian distribution of tokens to types.",
        "For example, the distribution of syntactic categories in parse tree constituents is Zipfian, as shown in (Reichart and Rappoport, 2008) for English, German and Chinese corpora.",
        "Thus, the distinction between token and type level evaluation is important also for grammar induction algorithms.",
        "It may be argued that a token level evaluation is sufficient since it already reflects type information.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate that this is not the case, by showing that they correlate weakly or even negatively in an important NLP task."

        "Mapping based measures are based on a postprocessing step in which each induced cluster is mapped to a gold class (or vice versa).",
        "The standard mappings are greedy many-to-one (M-1) and greedy one-to-one (1-1).",
        "Several measures which rely on these mappings were proposed.",
        "The most common and perhaps the simplest one is accuracy, which computes the fraction of items correctly clustered under the mapping.",
        "Other measures include: L (Larsen, 1999), D (Van Dongen, 2000), misclassification index (MI) (Zeng et al., 2002), H (Meila and Heckerman, 2001), clustering F-measure (Fung et al., 2003) and micro-averaged precision and recall (Dhillon et al., 2003).",
        "In Section 4 we show why existing mapping-based measures cannot be applied to the polysemous type case and present new mapping-based measures for this case.",
        "Counting pairs measures are based on a combinatorial approach which examines the number of data element pairs that are clustered similarly in the reference and proposed clustering.",
        "Among these are Rand Index (Rand, 1971), Adjusted Rand Index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985), r statistic (Hubert and Schultz, 1976), Jaccard (Milligan et al., 1983), Fowlkes-Mallows (Fowlkes and Mallows, 1983) and Mirkin (Mirkin, 1996).",
        "Schulte im Walde (2006) used such a measure for type level evaluation of monosemous verb type clustering.",
        "Meila (2007) described a few problems with such measures.",
        "A serious one is that their values are unbounded, making it hard to interpret their results.",
        "This can be solved by adjusting their values to lie in [0,1], but even adjusted measures suffer from severe distributional problems, limiting their usability in practice.",

        "The appealing properties of these measures have been extensively discussed in these references; see also (Pfitzner et al., 2008).",
        "V and NVI are defined as follows:",
        "In the monosemous case (type or token), the application of the measures described in this section to type level evaluation is straightforward.",
        "In the polysemous case, however, they suffer from serious shortcomings.",
        "Consider a case in which each item is assigned exactly r gold clusters and each gold cluster has the exact same number of items (i.e., each has a size of , where l is the number of items).",

        "In this case, the random variables defined by the induced and gold clustering assignments are independent (this easily follows from the definition of independent events, since the joint probability is the multiplication of the marginals).",
        "Hence, H (K |C ) = H (K ) and H (C K ) = H (C ), and both V and NVI obtain their worst possible values.",

        "The problem can in theory be solved by providing the number of clusters per item as an input to the algorithm.",
        "However, in NLP this is unrealistic (even if the total number of clusters can be provided) and the number should be determined by the algorithm.",

        "Cluster-based measures are a direct generalization of existing mapping based measures to the polysemous case.",
        "The difficulty in designing item-based and cluster-based measures is that the number of clusters assigned to each item is determined by the clustering algorithm.",

        "In the example in Section 3 showing an unreasonable behavior of IT-based measures, the score depends on r for both MacroI and MicroI.",
        "With our new measures, recall is always 1, but precision is n. This is true both for 1-1 and M-1 mappings.",

        "Clark03 and ARR10 are monosemous algorithms, allowing a single cluster for each word type.",
        "The other algorithms are polysemous.",
        "They perform sequence labeling where each token is tagged in its context, and different tokens (instances) of the same type (word form) may receive different tags.",
        "Data Set.",
        "All models were tested on sections sentences, 950028 tokens and 39546 unique types.",
        "Of the tokens, 832629 (87.6%) are not punctuation marks.",
        "Evaluation Measures.",
        "Type level evaluation used the measures MacroI (which is equal to MacroC), MicroI and MicroC both with greedy 1-1 and M-1 mappings as described in Section 4.",
        "The type level gold (induced) entry is defined to be the set of all gold (induced) clusters with which it appears.",
        "For the token level evaluation, six measures are used (see Section 3): accuracy with M-1 and 1-1 mappings, NVI, V, H(C|K) and H(K|C), using e as the logarithm's base.",
        "We use the full WSJ POS tags set excluding punctuation.",
        "Punctuation.",
        "Punctuation marks occupy a large volume of the corpus tokens (12.4% in our experimental corpus), and are easy to cluster.",
        "Clustering punctuation marks thus greatly inflates token level results.",
        "To study the relationship between type and token level evaluations in a focused manner, we excluded punctuation from the evaluation (they are still used during training, so algorithms that rely on them are not harmed).",
        "Number of Induced Clusters.",
        "The number of gold POS tags in WSJ is 45, of which 11 are punctuation marks.",
        "Therefore, for the ARR10 and Clark03 models, 34 clusters were induced.",
        "For GJ08 we received the output with 45 clusters.",
        "The iHMM models of GVG09 determine the number of clusters automatically (resulting in 47, 91 and 192 clusters, see below).",
        "For GG07, our computing resources did not enable us to induce 45 clusters and we therefore used 17.",
        "Our focus in this paper is to study the type vs. token distinction rather than to provide a full scope comparison between algorithms, for which more clustering sizes would need to be examined.",
        "Configurations.",
        "We ran the ARR10 tagger with the configuration detailed in (Abend et al., 2010).",
        "For Clark03, we ran his neyessenmorph model 10 times (using an unknown words threshold of 5) and report the average score for each measure.",
        "The models of GVG09 were run in the three configurations reported in their paper: one with a Dirichlet process prior and fixed parameters, another with a Pittman-Yore prior with fixed parameters, and a third with a Dirichlet process prior with parameters learnt from the data.",
        "All five models were run in an optimal configuration.",
        "We obtained the code of Goldwater and Griffiths' BHMM model and ran it for 10K iterations with an annealing technique for parameter estimation.",
        "That was the best parameter estimation technique available to us.",
        "This is the first time that this model is evaluated on such a large experimental corpus, and it performed well under these conditions.",
        "The output of the model of GJ08 was sent to us by the authors.",
        "The model was run on sections 2-21 of the WSJ-PTB using significantly inferior computing resources compared to those used for producing the results reported in their paper.",
        "While this model cannot be compared to the aforementioned six models due to the suboptimal configuration, we evaluate its output using our measures to get a broader variety of experimental results.",
        "Table 1 presents the scores of the compared models under all evaluation measures (six token level, six type level).",
        "What is important here to note are the differences between type and token level evaluations for the algorithms.",
        "We are mainly interested in two things: (1) seeing how relative rankings change in the two evaluation types, thus showing that the two types are not highly correlated and are both useful; and (2) insights gained by using a type level evaluation in addition to the usual token level one.",
        "Note that the table should not be used to deduce which algorithm is the 'best' for the task, even according to a single evaluation type.",
        "This is because, as explained above, the algorithms do not induce the same number ofclusters and this affects their results.",
        "Results indicate that type level evaluation reveals aspects of the clustering quality that are not expressed in the token level.",
        "For the Clark03 model the disparity is most apparent.",
        "While in the token level it performs very well (better than the polysemous algorithms for the 1-1, V and NVI token level measures), in the type level it is the second worst in the item-based 1-1 scores and the worst in the M-1 scores.",
        "Here we have a clear demonstration of the value of type level evaluation.",
        "The Clark03 algorithm is assessed as excellent using token level evaluation (second only to ARR10 in M-1, 1-1, V and NVI), and only a type level one shows its relatively poor type performance.",
        "Although readers may think that this is natural due to the algorithm's monosemous nature, this is not the case, since the monosemous ARR10 generally ranked first in the type level measures (more on this below).",
        "The disparity is also observed for polysemous algorithms.",
        "The GG07 model's token level scores are mediocre, while in the type level MicroC 1-1 measure this model is the best and in the type level MicroI and MacroI 1-1 measures it is the second best.",
        "Monosemous vs. polysemous algorithms.",
        "The table shows that the ARR10 model achieves the best results in most type and token level evaluation measures.",
        "The fact that this monosemous algorithm outperforms the polysemous ones, even in a type level evaluation, may seem strange at first sight but can be explained as follows.",
        "Pol-ysemous tokens account for almost 60% of the corpus (565K out of 950K), so we could expect that a monosemous algorithm should do badly in a token-level evaluation.",
        "However, for most of the polysemous tokens the polysemy is only weakly present in the corpus, so it is hard to detect even for polysemous algorithms.",
        "Regarding types, pol-ysemous types constitute only 16.6% of the corpus types, so a monosemous algorithm which is quite good in assigning types to clusters has a good chance of beating polysemous algorithms in a type level evaluation.",
        "Hence, monosemous POS induction algorithms are not at such a great disadvantage relative to pol-ysemous ones.",
        "This observation, which was fully motivated by our type level case study, might be used to guide future work on POS induction, and it thus serves as another demonstration for the utility of type level evaluation.",
        "Hill climbing algorithm.",
        "For the type level measures with greedy M-1 mapping, we used the hill-climbing algorithm described in Section 4.",
        "Recall that the mapping to which our algorithm converges depends on its random initialization.",
        "We therefore ran the algorithm with 10 different random initializations and report the obtained maximum for MacroI, MicroI and MicroC in Table 1.",
        "The different initializations caused very little fluctuation: not more than 1% in the 9 (7) best runs for the item-based (MicroC) measures.",
        "We take this result as an indication that the obtained maximum is a good approximation of the global maximum.",
        "We tried to improve the algorithm by selecting an intelligent initialization heuristic.",
        "We used the M-1 mapping obtained by mapping each induced cluster to the gold class with which it has the high-",
        "Table 1: Token level (left columns) and type level (right columns) results for seven POS induction algorithms (rows) (see text for details).",
        "Token and type level performance are weakly correlated and complement each other as evaluation measures.",
        "ARR10, a monosemous algorithm, yields the best results in most measures.",
        "(GJ08* results are different from those reported in the original paper because it was run with weaker computing resources than those used there.)",
        "est weight edge in the bipartite graph.",
        "Recall from Section 4.1 that this is a reasonable approximation of the greedy M-1 mapping.",
        "Again, we ran it for the three type level measures for 10 times with a random update order on the induced clusters.",
        "This had only a minor effect on the final scores.",
        "Number of clusters.",
        "Previous work (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009) demonstrated that in data sets where a relatively small fraction of the gold classes covers most of the items, it is reasonable to choose this number to be the number of induced clusters.",
        "In our experimental data set, this number (the 'prominent cluster number') is around 17 (see Section 5.1).",
        "Up to this number, increasing the number of clusters is likely to have a positive effect on token level M-1, 1-1, H(C|K), and H(K|C) scores.",
        "Inducing a larger number ofclusters, however, is likely to positively affect M-1 and H(C| K) but to have a negative effect on 1-1 and H(K| C).",
        "This tendency is reflected in Table 1.",
        "For the GG07 model the number of induced clusters, 17, approximates the number of prominent clusters and is lower than the number of induced clusters of the other models.",
        "This is reflected by its low token level M-1 and H(C| K) performance and its high quality H(K| C) and NVI token level scores.",
        "The GVG (1)-(3) models induced 47, 91 and 192 clusters respectively.",
        "This might explain the high token level M-1 and H(C| K) performance of GVG(3), as well as its high M-1 type level performance, compared to its mediocre scores in other measures.",
        "The item based measures.",
        "The table indicates that there is no substantial difference between the two item based type level scores with 1-1 mapping.",
        "The definitions of MacroI and MicroI imply that if | Ai | +1 h(Bi) | (which equals | Ai | +1Bi | under a 1-1 mapping) is constant for all word types, then a clustering will score equally on both 1-1 type measures.",
        "Indeed, in our experimental corpus 83.4% of the word types have one POS tag, 12.5% have 2, 3.1% have 3 and only 1% of the words have more.",
        "Therefore, | Ai| is roughly constant.",
        "The ARR10 and Clark03 models assign a word type to a single cluster.",
        "For the other models, the number of clusters per word type is generally similar to that of the gold standard.",
        "Consequently, | Bi| is roughly constant as well, which explains the similar behavior ofthe two measures.",
        "Note that for other clustering tasks | Ai| may not necessarily be constant, so the MacroI and MicroI scores are not likely to be as similar under the 1-1 mapping."
