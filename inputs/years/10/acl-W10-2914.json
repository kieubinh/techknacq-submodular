        "Sarcasm (also known as verbal irony) is a sophisticated form of speech act in which the speakers convey their message in an implicit way.",
        "One inherent characteristic of the sarcastic speech act is that it is sometimes hard to recognize.",
        "The difficulty in recognition of sarcasm causes misunderstanding in everyday communication and poses problems to many NLP systems such as online review summarization systems, dialogue systems or brand monitoring systems due to the failure of state of the art sentiment analysis systems to detect sarcastic comments.",
        "In this paper we experiment with a semi-supervised framework for automatic identification of sarcastic sentences.",
        "One definition for sarcasm is: the activity of saying or writing the opposite of what you mean, or of speaking in a way intended to make someone else feel stupid or show them that you are angry (Macmillan English Dictionary (2007)).",
        "Using the former definition, sarcastic utterances appear in many forms (Brown, 1980; Gibbs and O'Brien, 1991).",
        "It is best to present a number of examples which show different facets of the phenomenon, followed by a brief review of different aspects of the sarcastic use.",

        "Example (1) refers to the supposedly lame music performance in super bowl 2010 and attributes it to the aftermath of the scandalous performance of Janet Jackson in the previous year.",
        "Note that the previous year is not mentioned and the reader has to guess the context (use universal knowledge).",
        "The words yet and another might hint at sarcasm.",
        "Example (2) is composed of three short sentences, each of them sarcastic on its own.",
        "However, combining them in one tweet brings the sarcasm to its extreme.",
        "Example (3) is a factual statement without explicit opinion.",
        "However, having a fast connection is a positive thing.",
        "A possible sarcasm emerges from the over exaggeration ('wow', 'blazing-fast').",
        "Example (4) from Amazon, might be a genuine compliment if it appears in the body of the review.",
        "However, recalling the expression 'don't judge a book by its cover', choosing it as the title of the review reveals its sarcastic nature.",
        "Although the negative sentiment is very explicit in the iPod review (5), the sarcastic effect emerges from the pun that assumes the knowledge that the design is one of the most celebrated features of Apple's products.",
        "(None of the above reasoning was directly introduced to our algorithm.)",
        "Modeling the underlying patterns of sarcastic utterances is interesting from the psychological and cognitive perspectives and can benefit various NLP systems such as review summarization (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wiebe et al., 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004) and dialogue systems.",
        "Following the 'brilliant-but-cruel' hypothesis (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2009), it can help improve ranking and recommendation systems (Tsur and Rappoport, 2009).",
        "All systems currently fail to correctly classify the sentiment of sarcastic sentences.",
        "In this paper we utilize the semi-supervised sarcasm identification algorithm (SASI) of (Tsur et al., 2010).",
        "The algorithm employs two modules: semi supervised pattern acquisition for identifying sarcastic patterns that serve as features for a classifier, and a classification stage that classifies each sentence to a sarcastic class.",
        "We experiment with two radically different datasets: 5.9 million tweets collected from Twitter, and 66000 Amazon product reviews.",
        "Although for the Amazon dataset the algorithm utilizes structured information, results for the Twitter dataset are higher.",
        "We discuss the possible reasons for this, and also the utility of Twitter #sarcasm hashtags for the task.",
        "Our algorithm performed well in both domains, substantially outperforming a strong baseline based on semantic gap and user annotations.",
        "To further test its robustness we also trained the algorithm in a cross domain manner, achieving good results.",
        "The datasets we used are interesting in their own right for many applications.",
        "In addition, our algorithm utilizes some aspects that are unique to these datasets.",
        "Hence, before describing the algorithm, we describe the datasets in detail.",
        "Twitter Dataset.",
        "Since Twitter is a relatively new service, a somewhat lengthy description of the medium and the data is appropriate.",
        "Twitter is a very popular microblogging service.",
        "It allows users to publish and read short messages called tweets (also used as a verb: to tweet: the act of publishing on Twitter).",
        "The tweet length is restricted to 140 characters.",
        "A user who publishes a tweet is referred to as a tweeter and the readers are casual readers or followers if they are registered to get all tweets by this tweeter.",
        "Apart from simple text, tweets may contain references to url addresses, references to other Twitter users (these appear as @<user>) or a content tag (called hashtags) assigned by the tweeter (#<tag>).",
        "An example of a tweet is: \"listening to Andrew Ridgley by Black Box Recorder on @Grooveshark: http://tinysong.com/cO6i #good-music\" , where 'grooveshark' is a Twitter user name and #goodmusic is a tag that allows to search for tweets with the same tag.",
        "Though frequently used, these types of meta tags are optional.",
        "In order to ignore specific references we substituted such occurrences with special tags: [LINK], [USER] and [HASHTAG] thus we have \"listening to Andrew Ridgley by Black Box Recorder on [USER]: [LINK] [HASHTAG]\".",
        "It is important to mention that hashtags are not formal and each tweeter can define and use new tags as s/he likes.",
        "The number of special tags in a tweet is only subject to the 140 characters constraint.",
        "There is no specific grammar that enforces the location of special tags within a tweet.",
        "The informal nature of the medium and the 140 characters length constraint encourages massive use of slang, shortened lingo, ascii emoticons and other tokens absent from formal lexicons.",
        "These characteristics make Twitter a fascinating domain for NLP applications, although posing great challenges due to the length constraint, the complete freedom of style and the out of discourse nature of tweets.",
        "We used 5.9 million unique tweets in our dataset: the average number of words is 14.2 words per tweet, 18.7% contain aurl, 35.3% contain reference to another tweeter and 6.9% contain at least one hashtag.",
        "The #sarcasm hashtag One of the hashtags used by Twitter users is dedicated to indicate sarcastic tweets.",
        "An example of the use of the tag is: 'I guess you should expect a WONDERFUL video tomorrow.",
        "#sarcasm'.",
        "The sarcastic hashtag is added by the tweeter.",
        "This hashtag is used infrequently as most users are not aware of it, hence, the majority of sarcastic tweets are not explicitly tagged by the tweeters.",
        "We use tagged tweets as a secondary gold standard.",
        "We discuss the use of this tag in Section 5.",
        "Amazon dataset.",
        "We used the same dataset used by (Tsur et al., 2010), containing 66000 reviews for 120 products from Amazon.com.",
        "The corpus contained reviews for books from different genres and various electronic products.",
        "Amazon reviews are much longer than tweets (some reach 2000 words, average length is 953 characters), they are more structured and grammatical (good reviews are very structured) and they come in a known context of a specific product.",
        "Reviews are semi-structured as besides the body of the review they all have the following fields: writer, date, star rating (the overall satisfaction of the review writer) and a one line summary.",
        "Reviews refer to a specific product and rarely address each other.",
        "Each review sentence is, therefore, part of a context - the specific product, the star rating, the summary and other sentences in that review.",
        "In that sense, sentences in the Amazon dataset differ radically from the contextless tweets.",

        "Data preprocessing A sarcastic utterance usually has a target.",

        "The Twitter dataset is totally unstructured and lacks textual context, so we did not attempt to identify targets.",
        "Our algorithmic methodology is based on patterns.",

        "However, in order to use less specific patterns, we automatically replace each appearance of a product, author, company, book name (Amazon) and user, url and hashtag (Twitter) with the corresponding generalized meta tags '[PRODUCT]','[COMPANY]','[TITLE]' and '[AUTHOR]' tags and '[USER]','[LINK]' and '[HASHTAG] .",
        "We also removed all HTML tags and special symbols from the review text.",
        "Pattern extraction Our main feature type is based on surface patterns.",
        "In order to extract such patterns automatically, we followed the algorithm given in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).",
        "We classified words into high-frequency words (HFWs) and content words (CWs).",
        "A word whose corpus frequency is more (less) than FH (Fc) is considered to be a HFW (CW).",

        "The patterns allow 2-6 HFWs and 1-6 slots for CWs.",
        "For each sentence it is possible to generate dozens of patterns that may overlap.",

        "In order to reduce the feature space, we have used two criteria to select useful patterns.",
        "First, we removed all patterns which appear only in sentences originating from a single product/book (Amazon).",
