        "However, due to the limited amount of labeled data, the performance of \"pure\" supervised learning, which only used labeled data, is limited.",
        "As a result, many existing methods employ features learnt from a large amount of unla-beled data to assist the task.",
        "In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised ensemble method to better incorporate both labeled and unlabeled data during learning.",
        "Firstly, we employ an ensemble learning framework, which effectively uses alignment results from different unsupervised alignment models.",

        "Word alignment is the process of learning bilingual word correspondences.",
        "Conventional word alignment process is treated as an unsupervised learning task, which automatically learns the correspondences between bilingual words using an EM style algorithm (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Recently, supervised learning methods have been used to improve the performance.",
        "They firstly re-formalize word alignment as some kind of classification task.",
        "Then the labeled data is used to train the classification model, which is finally used to classify unseen test data (Liu et al., 2005; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2006; Haghighi et al., 2009).",
        "It is well understood that the performance of supervised learning relies heavily on the feature set.",
        "As more and more features are added into the model, more data is needed for training.",
        "However, due to the expensive cost of labeling, we usually cannot get as much labeled word alignment data as we want.",
        "This may limit the performance of supervised methods (Wu et al., 2006).",
        "One possible alternative is to use features learnt in some unsupervised manner to help the task.",
        "For example, Moore (2005) uses statistics like log-likelihood-ratio and conditional-likelihood-probability to measure word associations; Liu et al.",
        "(2005) and Taskar et al.",
        "(2005) use results from IBM Model 3 and Model 4, respectively.",
        "Ayan and Dorr (2006) propose another way of incorporating unlabeled data.",
        "They first train some existing alignment models, e.g. IBM Model4 and Hidden Markov Model, using unlabeled data.",
        "The results of these models are then combined using a maximum entropy classifier, which is trained using labeled data.",
        "This method is highly efficient in training because it only makes decisions on alignment links from existing models and avoids searching the entire alignment space.",
        "In this paper, we follow Ayan and Dorr (2006)'s idea of combining multiple alignment results.",
        "And we use more features, such as bi-lexical features, which help capture more information from unla-beled data.",
        "To further improve the decision making during combination, we propose to use a semi-supervised strategy, namely Tri-training (Zhou and Li, 2005), which ensembles three classifiers using both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "More specifically, Tri-training iteratively trains three classifiers and labels all the unlabeled instances.",
        "It then uses some instances among the unlabeled ones to expand the labeled training set of each individual classifier.",
        "As word alignment task usually faces a huge parallel corpus, which contains millions of unlabeled instances, we develop specific algorithms to adapt Tri-training for this large scale task.",
        "The next section introduces the supervised alignment combination framework; Section 3 presents our semi-supervised learning algorithm.",

        "Word alignment is to learn the correct alignment A between e and f, which is a set of such alignment links.",
        "As the number of possible alignment links grows exponentially with the length of e and f, we restrict the candidate set using results from several existing alignment models.",
        "Note that, all the models we employ are unsupervised models.",
        "We will refer to them as sub-models in the rest of this paper.",
        "Let A = {A1,A2,..., An} be a set of alignment results from sub-models; Aj and Au be the intersection and union of these results, respectively.",

        "While Ayan and Dorr (Ayan and Dorr, 2006) make decisions on each alignment link in Au, we take a different strategy by assuming that all the alignment links in Aj are correct, which means alignment links in Aj are always included in the combination result.",
        "One reason for using this strategy is that it makes no sense to exclude an alignment link, which all the sub-models vote for including.",
        "Also, links in Aj usually have a good quality (In our experiment, Aj can always achieve an accuracy higher than 96%).",
        "On the other hand, because Aj is decided before the supervised learning starts, it will be able to provide evidence for making decisions on candidate links.",
        "Also note that, Formula 1 is based on the assumption that given Aj, the decision on each y is independent of each other.",
        "This is the crucial point that saves us from searching the whole alignment space.",

        "Semi-supervised methods aim at using unlabeled instances to assist the supervised learning.",
        "One of the prominent achievements in this area is the Co-training paradigm proposed by Blum and Mitchell (1998).",
        "Co-training applies when the features of an instance can be naturally divided into two sufficient and redundant subsets.",
        "Two weak classifiers can be trained using each subset of features and strengthened using unlabeled data.",
        "Blum and Mitchell (1998) prove the effectiveness of this algorithm, under the assumption that features in one set is conditionally independent of features in the other set.",
        "Intuitively speaking, if this conditional independence assumption holds, the most confident instance of one classifier will act as a random instance for the other classifier.",
        "Thus it can be safely used to expand the training set of the other classifier.",
        "The standard Co-training algorithm requires a naturally splitting in the feature set, which is hard to meet in most scenarios, including the task of word alignment.",
        "Variations include using random split feature sets or two different classification algorithms.",
        "In this paper, we use the other Co-training style algorithm called Tri-training, which requires neither sufficient and redundant views nor different classification algorithms.",
        "Similar with Co-training, the basic idea of Tri-training (Zhou and Li, 2005) is to iteratively expand the labeled training set for the next-round training based on the decisions of the current classifiers.",
        "However, Tri-training employs three classifiers instead of two.",
        "To get diverse initial classifiers, the training set of each classifier is initially generated via bootstrap sampling from the original labeled training set and updated separately.",
        "In each round, these three classifiers are used to classify all the unlabeled instances.",
        "An unlabeled instance is added to the training set of any classifier if the other two classifiers agree on the labeling of this example.",
        "So there is no need to explicitly measure the confidence of any individual classifier, which might be a problem for some learning algorithms.",
        "Zhou and Li (2005) also give a terminate criterion derived from PAC analysis.",
        "As the algorithm goes, the number of labeled instances increases, which may bring in more bi-lexical features and alleviate the problem of data sparseness.",
        "One crucial problem for word alignment is the huge amount of unlabeled instances.",
        "Typical parallel corpus for word alignment contains at least hundreds of thousands of sentence pairs, with each sentence pair containing tens of instances.",
        "That makes a large set of millions of instances.",
        "Therefore, we develop a modified version of Tri-training algorithm using sampling techniques, which can work well with such large scale data.",

        "A sub-sampling is performed before the labeled training set is used for training (line 21), which means all the instances in L\\ are accepted as correct, but only part of them are added into the training set.",
        "The sampling rate is controlled by a parameter r, which we empirically set to 0.01 in all our experiments.",
        "The classifier is then retrained using the augmented training set L\\ (line 22).",
        "The algorithm iterates until all instances in the candidate sets get labeled or the candidate sets do not change since the last iteration (line 25).",
        "The resulting classifiers can be used to label new instances via majority voting.",
        "Our algorithm differs from Zhou and Li (2005) in the following three aspects.",
        "First of all, comparing to the original bootstrap sampling initialization, we use a more aggressive strategy, which actually divides the original labeled set into three parts.",
        "This strategy ensures that initial classifiers are trained using different sets of instances and maximizes the diversity between classifiers.",
        "We will compare these two initializations in the experiments section.",
        "Secondly, we introduce sampling techniques for the huge number of unlabeled instances.",
        "Sampling is essential for maintaining a reasonable growing speed of training data and keeping the computation physically feasible.",
        "Thirdly, because the original terminate criterion requires an error estimation process in each iteration, we adapt the much simpler terminate criterion of standard Co-training into our algorithm, which iterates until all the unlabeled data are finally labeled or the candidate sets do not change since the last iteration.",
        "In other words, our algorithm inherits both the benefits of using three classifiers and the simplicity of using Co-training style termination criterion.",

        "The original un-labeled corpus contains about 288 thousand sentence pairs.",
        "We create 12 sub-corpus of it with different sizes by selecting certain amounts of sentences from the beginning.",
        "Our smallest subcorpus consists of the first 5,000 sentence pairs of the original corpus; while the largest sub-corpus contains the first 275 thousand sentence pairs.",
        "The alignment results on these different sub-corpus are evaluated (See Figure 2b).",
        "The result shows that as the size of unlabeled data grows, the Fi score of Tri-Divide increases from around 0.74 to 0.772.",
        "The F1 score of Tri-Bootstrap also gets a similar increase.",
        "This proves that adding unlabeled data does help the learning process.",
        "The result also suggests that when the size of unlabeled data is small, both Tri-Bootstrap and Tri-Divide get lower scores than the supervised model.",
        "This is because the Tri-training models only use part of the labeled data for the training of each individual classifier, while the supervised model use the whole set.",
        "We can see that when there are more than 50 thousand unlabeled sentence pairs, both Tri-training models outperform the supervised model significantly.",
        "Note that, both experiments on data size show some unsteadiness during the learning process.",
        "We attribute this mainly to the random sampling we use in the algorithm.",
        "As there are, in all, about 8.8 million instances , it is highly possible that some of these instances are redundant or noisy.",
        "And because our random sampling does not distinguish different instances, the quality of resulting model may get affected if these redundant or noisy instances are selected and added to the training set.",
        "We compare the machine translation results of each sub-models, supervised models and semi-supervised models in Table 4.",
        "Among sub-models, BerkeleyAligner gets better BLEU4 scores in almost all the data sets except TEST06, which agrees with its highest F1 score among all submodels.",
        "The supervised method gets the highest BLEU score of 27.07 on the dev set.",
        "However, its performance on the test sets is a bit lower than that of BerkeleyAligner.",
        "As we expect, our two semi-supervised models achieve highest scores on almost all the data sets, which are also higher than the commonly used grow-diag-final-and symmetrization of IBM Model 4.",
        "More specifically, Tri-Divide is the best of all systems.",
        "It gets a dev score of 27.04, which is comparable with the highest one (27.07).",
        "Tri-Divide also gets the highest BLEU scores on Test05 and Test06 (20.96 and 20.79, respectively), which are nearly 1 point higher than all sub-models.",
        "The other Tri-training model, Tri-Bootstrap, gets the highest score on Test08, which is also significantly better than those sub-models.",
        "Despite the large improvement in F1 score, our two Tri-training models only get slightly better score than the well-known Model4GDF.",
        "This kind of inconsistence between AER or F1 scores and",
        "BLEU scores is a known issue in machine translation community (Fraser and Marcu, 2007).",
        "One possible explanation is that both AER or F1 are 0-1 loss functions, which means missing one link and adding one redundant link will get the same penalty.",
        "And more importantly, every wrong link receives the same penalty under these metrics.",
        "However, these different errors may have different effects on the machine translation quality.",
        "Thus, improving alignment quality according to AER or F1 may not directly lead to an increase of BLEU scores.",
        "The relationship among these metrics are still under investigation."
