        "Sentiment analysis has gained much attention from the research community in recent years.",
        "It is concerned with the problem of discovering emotional meanings in text, and most common tasks usually include emotion labeling (assigning a text its main emotion), polarity recognition (classifying a statement into positive or negative) and subjectivity identification (determining whether a text is subjective or objective).",
        "The growing research interest is mainly due to the practical applications of sentiment analysis.",
        "Companies and organizations are interested in finding out costumer sentiments and opinions, while individuals are interested in others' opinions when purchasing a product or deciding whether or not watching a movie.",
        "Many approaches have dealt with sentiment analysis as the problem of classifying product or service reviews (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), while others have attempted to classify news items (Devitt and Ahmad, 2007).",
        "The task is usually addressed as a 2-classes classification problem (positive vs. negative).",
        "Recent works have included the neutral class, trying to detect not only the polarity but also the absence of emotional meaning (Wilson et al., 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).",
        "However, few approaches try to face a more fine-grained prediction of the intensity (e.g. classifying the polarity into strongly negative, weakly negative, neutral, weakly positive and strongly positive).",
        "Another important problem of most of these approximations is that they usually work with terms, and so disregard the contextual meaning of those terms in the sentence (Martineau and Finin, 2009; Moilanen and Pulman, 2007).",
        "The use of word disambiguation is not usual in this task, due to the fact that most approaches use lexical resources created to work with terms.",
        "However, it is essential to correctly capture the meaning of these terms within the text.",
        "In this paper, we present a hybrid approach based on machine learning techniques and lexical rules to classify sentences according to their polarity and intensity.",
        "Thus, given an input text, the method is able to determine the polarity of each sentence (i.e. if it is negative or positive), as well as its intensity.",
        "The system tackles the effect of negations and quantifiers in sentiment analysis, and addresses the problem of word ambiguity, taken into account the contextual meaning of the terms in the text by using a word sense disambiguation algorithm.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 exposes some background and related work on sentiment analysis.",
        "Section 3 presents the lexical resources and corpora used by the system.",
        "Section 4 describes the method proposed for polarity and intensity classification.",

        "Focusing on polarity recognition, the aim of this task is the classification of texts into positive or negative according to their emotional meaning.",

        "During the past few years, the problem of polarity recognition has been usually faced as a step beyond the identification of the subjectivity or objectivity of texts (Wiebe et al., 1999).",
        "Different approximations have been proposed to deal with this problem.",
        "Pang and Lee (2004) propose a graph-based method which finds minimum cuts in a document graph to classify the sentences into subjective or objective.",

        "Kim and Hovy (2004) also introduce a previous step to identify the subjectivity of sentences regarding a certain topic, and later classify these sentences into positives or negatives.",
        "Most recent approaches do not only deal with the 2-classes classification problem, but also introduce a new class representing neutrality.",
        "Thus, the aim of these works is to classify the text into positive, negative or neutral.",
        "Wilson et al.",
        "(2005) present a double subjectivity classifier based on features such as syntactic classes and sentence position, and more semantic features such as adjective graduation.",
        "The first classifier determines the subjectivity or neutrality of the phrases in the text, while the second determines its polarity (including neutrality).",
        "Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral.",
        "The method proposed yields good results in the 2-classes polarity classification, while the results decrease when dealing with 3-classes.",
        "A more ambitious classification task is proposed by Brooke (2009), where the goal is to measure the intensity of polarity.",
        "To this aim, the author classifies the input into 3-classes (strongly-negative, ambivalent, and strongly-positive), 4 classes (strongly-negative, weakly-negative, weakly-positive and strongly-positive) and 5-classes (strongly-negative, weakly-negative, ambivalent, weakly-positive and strongly-positive).",
        "The results decrease considerably with the number of classes, from 62% of accuracy for 3-classes to 38% of accuracy for 5-classes."

        "The evaluation of the system has been carried out using two corpora from two very distinct domains: the Sentence Polarity Movie Review Dataset and the one used in the SemEval 2007 Affective Text task .",
        "The first one consists of 10.662 sentences selected from different movie review websites.",
        "These sentences are labeled as positive or negative depending on whether they express a positive or negative opinion within the movie review.",
        "The second one consists of a training set and a test set of 250 and 1000 news headlines respectively, extracted from different news sites.",
        "Each sentence is labeled with a value between -100 and 100, where -100 means highly negative emotional intensity, 100 means highly positive and 0 means neutral.",
        "To the purpose of this work, the test set from the SemEval corpus and 1000 sentences randomly extracted from the Sentence Polarity Movie Review corpus (500 positive and 500 negative) were used as evaluation datasets.",
        "In order to identify the emotional categories associated to the concepts in the sentences, an affective lexical database based on semantic senses, instead of terms, is needed.",
        "To this aim, the authors have tested different resources and finally selected the WordNet Affect affective database (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004).",
        "This affective lexicon has the particularity of assigning emotional categories to synsets of the WordNet lexical database (Miller et al., 1990), allowing the system to correctly disambiguate the terms using one of the many WordNet-based word sense disambiguation algorithms.",
        "The emotional categories in WordNet Affect are organized hierarchically, and its first level distinguishes between positive-emotion, negative-emotion, neutral-emotion and ambiguous-emotion.",
        "The second level encloses the emotional categories themselves, and consists of a set of 32 categories.",
        "For this work, a subset of 16 emotional categories from this level has been selected, since the hierarchy proposed in WordNet Affect is considerably broader than those commonly used in sentiment analysis.",
        "On the other hand, the first level of emotional categories may be useful to predict the polarity, but it is clearly not enough to predict the intensity of this polarity.",
        "To be precise, the subset of emotional categories used in this work is: {joy, love, liking, calmness, positive-expectation, hope, fear, sadness, dislike, shame, compassion, despair, anxiety, surprise, ambiguous-agitation and ambiguous-expectation}.",
        "The authors consider this subset to be a good representation of the human feeling.",
        "Since the WordNet Affect hierarchy does not provide an antonym relationship, the authors has created that relation for the previous set of emotional categories.",
        "Only relationships between emotional categories with a strongly opposite meaning are created, such as liking-disliking and joy-sadness.",
        "The purpose of this antonym relationship is twofold: first, it contributes to handle negation forms; and second, it can be used to automatically expand the affective lexicon.",
        "Both issues are discussed in detail later in the document.",
        "On the other hand, since a good amount of words with a highly emotional meaning, such as dead, cancer and violent, are not labeled in WordNet Affect, these words have been manually labeled by the authors and have been later extended with their synonyms, antonyms and derived adjectives using the corresponding semantic and lexical relations in WordNet.",
        "This process has been done in two steps in order to measure the effect of the number of synsets labeled on the classification accuracy, as described in section 5.",
        "The WordNet Affect 1.1 lexicon consists of a set of 911 synsets.",
        "However, the authors have detected that a good number of these synsets have been labeled more than once, and with different emotional categories (e.g. the synset \"a#00117872 {angered, enraged, furious, infuriated, maddened}\" is labeled with three different categories: anger, fury and infuriation).",
        "Thus, after removing these synsets and those labeled with an emotional category not included in the 16-categories subset used in this work, the affective lexicon presents 798 synsets.",
        "After the first step of semi-automatic labeling, the affective lexicon increased the number of synsets in 372, of which 100 synsets were manually labeled, and 272 were automatically derived throughout the WordNet relations.",
        "The second and last step of semi-automatic labeling added 603 synsets to the lexicon, of which 200 synsets were manually labeled, and 403 were automatically derived.",
        "The final lexicon presents 1773 synsets and 4521 words labeled with an emotional category.",

        "To this aim, the system analyzes the text, splits it into sentences and tags the tokens with their part of speech.",
        "The Gate architectureand the Stanford Parser were selected to carry out this process.",
        "In particular the Annie English Tokeniser, Hash Gazetter, RegEx Sentence Splitter and the Stanford Parser modules in Gate are used to analyze the input.",
        "In this step also the syntax tree and dependencies are retrieved from the Stanford Parser.",
        "These features will be used in the post-processing step in order to identify the negations and the quantifiers, as well as their scope.",
        "Once the sentences have been split and tagged, the method maps each word of each sentence into its sense in WordNet according to its context.",
        "To this end, the lesk WSD algorithm implemented in the WordNet Sense-Relate perl package is used (Patwardhan et al., 2005).",
        "The disambiguation is carried out only over the words belonging to the grammatical categories noun, verb, adjective and adverb, as only these categories can present an emotional meaning.",
        "As a result, we get the stem and sense in WordNet of each word, and this information is used to retrieve its synset.",
        "A good example of the importance of performing word disambiguation can be shown in the sentence \"Test to predict breast cancer relapse is approved\" from the SemEval news corpus.",
        "The noun cancer has five possible entries in WordNet and only one refers to a \"malignant growth or tumor \", while the others are related with \"astrology\" and the \"cancer zodiacal constellation\".",
        "Obviously, without a WSD algorithm, the wrong synset will be considered, and a wrong emotion will be assigned to the concept.",
        "Besides, to enrich the emotion identification step, the hypernyms of each concept are also retrieved from WordNet.",
        "The aim of the emotion identification step is to map the WordNet concepts previously identified to those present in the affective lexicon, as well ' http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml as to retrieve from this lexicon the corresponding emotional category of each concept.",
        "We hypothesize that the hypernyms of a concept entail the same emotions than the concept itself, but the intensity of such emotions decreases as we move up the hierarchy (i.e. the more general the hypernym becomes, the less its emotional intensity is).",
        "Following this hypothesis, when no entry is found in the affective lexicon for a given concept, the emotional category associated to its nearest hypernym, if any, is used to label the concept.",
        "However, only a certain level of hypernymy is accepted, since an excessive generalization introduces some noise in the emotion identification.",
        "This parameter has been empirically set to 3 (Carrillo de Albornoz et al., 2010).",
        "Previous experiments have shown that, upper this level, the working hypothesis becomes unreliable.",
        "The sentence \"Siesta cuts risk of heart disease death study finds\" clearly illustrates the process described above.",
        "In this sentence, the concepts risk, death and disease are labeled with an emotional category: in particular, the categories assigned to them are fear, fear and dislike respectively.",
        "However, while the two firsts are retrieved from the affective lexicon by their own synsets, the last one is labeled through its hyper-nym: since no matching is found for disease in the lexicon, the analysis over its hypernyms detects the category dislike assigned to the synset of its first hypernym, which contains words such as illness and sickness, and the same emotion (dislike) is assigned to disease.",
        "It must be noted that, to perform this analysis, a previous mapping between 2.1 and 1.6 WordNet versions was needed, since the method and the affective lexicon work on different versions of the database.",
        "Once the concepts of the sentence have been labeled with their emotional categories, the next step aims to detect and solve the effect of the negations and the quantifiers on the emotional categories identified in the previous step.",
        "The effect of negation has been broadly studied in NLP (Morante and Daelemans, 2009) and sentiment analysis (Jia et al., 2009).",
        "Two main considerations must be taken into account when dealing with negation.",
        "First, the negation scope may affect only a word (no reason), a proposition (Beckham does not want to play again for Real) or even a subject (No one would like to do this).",
        "Different approximations have been proposed to delimit the scope of negation.",
        "Some assume the scope to be those words between the negation token and the first punctuation mark (Pang et al., 2002), others consider a fixed number of words after the negation token (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "Second, the impact of negation is usually neutralized by reversing the polarity of the sentence (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006) or using contextual valence shifters which increase or dismiss the final value of negativity or positivity of the sentence (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006).",
        "In this work, the negation scope is detected using the syntax tree and dependencies generated by the Stanford Parser.",
        "The dependency neg allows us to easily determine the presence of several simple types of negation, such as those preceded by don't, didn't, not, never, etc.",
        "Other words not identified with this dependency, but also with a negation meaning, such as no, nonesnor or nobody, are identified using a negation token list.",
        "To determine the negation scope, we find in the syntax tree the first common ancestor that encloses the negation token and the word immediately after it, and assume all descendant leaf nodes to be affected by the negation.",
        "For each concept in the sentence that falls into the scope of a negation, the system retrieves its antonym emotional category, if any, and assigns this category to the concept.",
        "If no antonym emotion is obtained, the concept is labeled with no emotion, according to the premise that the negation may change or neutralize the emotional polarity.",
        "An example of this process can be shown in the sentence \"Children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed\".",
        "In this sentence, the Stanford Parser discovers a negation and the system, through the syntax tree, determines that the scope of the negation encloses the words \"won't be disappointed\".",
        "As the synset of \"disappointed\" has been labeled with the emotional category despair, its antonym is retrieved, and the emotional category of the antonym, hope, is used to label the concept.",
        "On the other hand, the quantifiers are words considered in sentiment analysis as amplifiers or downtoners (Quirk et al., 1985).",
        "That is to say, the word very in the sentence \"That is a very good idea\" amplifies the intensity of the emotional meaning and the positivity of the sentence, while the word less in the sentence \"It is less handsome than I was expecting\" dismisses its intensity and polarity.",
        "The most common approach to identify quantifiers is the use of lists of words which play specific grammatical roles in the sentence.",
        "These lists normally contain a fixed value for all positive words and another value for all negative words (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006).",
        "By contrast, Brooke (2009) proposes a novel approach where each quantifier is assigned its own polarity and weight.",
        "The quantifiers are usually represented as sentence modifiers, assuming their scope to be the whole sentence and modifying its overall polarity.",
        "However, when dealing with sentences like \"The house is really nice and the neighborhood is not bad\", these approaches assume that the quantifier really amplifies the intensity of both conjunctives, when it only should amplify the intensity of the first one.",
        "By contrast, our approach determines the scope of the quantifiers by the syntax tree and the dependencies over them.",
        "Thus, when a quantifier is detected in a sentence, the dependencies are checked and only those that play certain roles, such as adverbial or adjectival modifiers, are considered.",
        "All concepts affected by a quantifier are marked with the weight corresponding to that quantifier, which will serve to amplify/dismiss the emotions of these concepts in the classification step.",
        "The quantifier list used here is the one proposed in Brooke (2009).",
        "The sentence \"Stale first act, scrooge story, blatant product placement, some very good comedic songs\"\" illustrates the analysis of the quantifiers.",
        "The system detects two tokens which are in the quantifier list and play the appropriate grammatical roles.",
        "The first quantifier some affects to the words \"very good comedic songs\", while the second quantifier very only affects to \"good\".",
        "So these concepts are marked with the specific weight of each quantifier.",
        "Note that the concept \"good\" is marked twice.",
        "Up to this point, the sentence has been labeled with a set of emotional categories, negations and their scope have been detected and the quantifiers and the concepts affected by them have been identified.",
        "In this step, this information is used to translate the sentence into a Vector of Emotional Occurrences (VEO), which will be the input to the machine learning classification algorithm.",
        "Thus, each sentence is represented as a vector of 16 values, each of one representing an emotional category.",
        "The VEO vector is generated as follows:",
        "• If the concept has been labeled with an emotional category, the position of the vector for this category is increased in 1.",
        "If no emotional category has been found for the concept, then the category of its first hypernym labeled is used.",
        "As the hypernym generalizes the meaning of the concept, the value assigned to the position of the emotional category in the VEO is weighted as follows:",
        "Hyper.Depth +1",
        "• If a negation scope encloses the concept, then the antonym emotion is used, as described in the previous step.",
        "The emotional category position of this antonym in the VEO is increased in 0.9.",
        "Different tests have been carried out to set this parameter, and the 0.9 value got the best results.",
        "The reason for using a lower value for the emotional categories derived from negations is that the authors consider that a negation changes the emotional meaning of a concept but usually in a lower percentage.",
        "For example, the sentence \"The neighborhood is not bad\" does not necessarily mean that it is a good neighborhood, but it is a quite acceptable one.",
        "• If a concept is affected by a quantifier, then the weight of that quantifier is added to the position in the VEO of the emotional category assigned to the concept.",
        "Thus, a sentence like \"This movie.... isn't worth the energy it takes to describe how really bad it is\" will be represented by the VEO [1.0, 0, 0.0, 0, 0, 0.0, 0, 0, 2.95, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].",
        "In this sentence, the concept movie is labeled with the emotional category joy, the concept worth is labeled with positive-expectation, the concept energy is labeled with liking, and the concept bad is labeled with dislike.",
        "Since the concepts worth and energy fall into the negation scope, they both change their emotional category to dislike.",
        "Besides, since the concept bad is amplified by the quantifier really, the weight of this concept in the VEO is increased in 0.15."

        "We have observed that, especially in the news dataset, an important number of sentences that are labeled with a low positive or negative emotional intensity could be perfectly considered as neutral.",
        "The intensity of these sentences highly depends on the previous knowledge and particular interpretation of the reader.",
        "For instance, the sentence \"Looking beyond the iPhone\" does not express any emotion itself, unless you are fan or detractor of Apple.",
        "However, this sentence is labeled in the corpus with a 15 intensity value.",
        "It is likely that these kinds of sentences introduce noise into the dataset.",
        "In order to estimate the influence of such sentences in the experimental results, we conducted a test removing from the news dataset those instances with an intensity value in the range [-25, 25].",
        "As expected, the accuracy of the method increases substantially, i.e. from 72.4% to 76.3% for logistic regression.",
        "The second group of experiments is directed to evaluate if dealing with negations and quantifiers improves the performance of the method.",
        "To this end, the approach described in Section 4.3 was applied to both datasets.",
        "Table 3 shows that processing negations consistently improves the accuracy of all algorithms in both datasets; while the effect of the quantifiers is not straightforward.",
        "Even if we expected that using quantifiers would lead to better results, the performance in both datasets decreases in 2 out of the 3 ML algorithms.",
        "However, combining both features improves the results in both datasets.",
        "The reason seems to be that, when no previous negation detection is performed, if the emotional category assigned to certain concepts are wrong (because these concepts are affected by negations), the quantifiers will be weighting the wrong emotions.",
        "The comparison with related work is difficult due to the different datasets and methods used in the evaluations.",
        "For instance, Pang et al.",
        "(2002) use the Movie Review Polarity Dataset, achieving an accuracy of 82.9% training a SVM over a bag of words.",
        "However, their aim was to determine the polarity of documents (i.e. the whole movie reviews) instead of sentences.",
        "When working at the sentence level, the information from the context is missed, and the results are expected to be considerably lower.",
        "As a matter of fact, it happens that many sentences in the Sentence Polarity Movie Review Dataset are labeled as positive or negative, but do not express any polarity when taken out of the context of the overall movie review.",
        "This conclusion is also drawn by Meena and Prabhakar (2007), who achieve an accuracy of 39% over a movie review corpus (not specified) working at the sentence level, using a rule based method to analyze the effect of conjuncts.",
        "This accuracy is well below that of our method (62.6%).",
        "Molianen and Pulman (2007) present a sentiment composition model where the polarity of a sentence is calculated as a complex function of the polarity of its parts.",
        "They evaluate their system over the SemEval 2007 news corpus, and achieve an accuracy of 65.6%, under our same experimental conditions, which is also significantly lower than the accuracy obtained by our method.",
        "Apart from identifying of polarity, we also want to examine the ability of our system to determine the emotional intensity in the sentences.",
        "To this aim, we define two intensity distributions: the 3-classes and the 5-classes distribution.",
        "For the first distribution, we map the news dataset to 3-classes: negative [-100, -50), neutral [-50, 50) and positive [50, 100].",
        "For the second distribution, we map the dataset to 5-classes: strongly negative [-100, -60), negative [-60, -20), neutral [-20, 20), positive [20, 60) and strongly positive number of intensity classes increases, the results are progressively worse, since the task is progressively more difficult.",

        "It can be observed that, even though the use of word disambiguation improves the classification precision and accuracy, the improvement with respect to the first sense heuristic is less than expected.",
        "This may be due to the fact that the senses of the words in WordNet are ranked according to their frequency, and so the first sense of a word is also the most frequent one.",
        "Besides, the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) heuristic in WSD is usually regarded as a difficult competitor.",
        "On the contrary, the improvement with respect to the random sense heuristic is quite remarkable."

        "In this paper, a novel approach to sentence level sentiment analysis has been described.",

        "The results obtained outperform those achieved by other systems which aim to solve the same task.",
        "Nonetheless, some considerations must be noted.",
        "Even with the extended affective lexicon, around 1 in 4 sentences of each corpus has not been assigned any emotional category, sometimes because their concepts are not labeled in the lexicon, but mostly because their concepts do not have any emotional meaning per se.",
        "A test on the news corpus removing those sentences not labeled with any emotional meaning has been performed for the 2-classes classification problem, allowing the method to obtain an accuracy of 81.7%.",
        "However, to correctly classify these sentences, it would be necessary to have additional information about their contexts (i.e. the body of the news item, its section in the newspaper, etc.",
        ").",
        "Finally, the authors plan to extend the method to deal with modal and conditional operators, which will allow us to distinguish among situations that have happened, situations that are happening, situations that could, might or possibly happen or will happen, situations that are wished to happen, etc."
