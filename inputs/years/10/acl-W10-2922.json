        "Psycholinguistic studies suggest that early on children acquire robust knowledge of the abstract lexical categories such as nouns, verbs and determiners (e.g., Gelman & Taylor, 1984; Kemp et al., 2005).",
        "Children's grouping of words into categories might be based on various cues, including phonological and morphological properties of a word, the distributional information about its surrounding context, and its semantic features.",
        "Among these, the distributional properties of the local context of a word have been thoroughly studied.",
        "It has been shown that child-directed speech provides informative co-occurrence cues, which can be reliably used to form lexical categories (Redington et al., 1998; Mintz, 2003).",
        "The process of learning lexical categories by children is necessarily incremental.",
        "Human language acquisition is bounded by memory and processing limitations, and it is implausible that humans process large volumes of text at once and induce an optimum set of categories.",
        "Efficient online computational models are needed to investigate whether distributional information is equally useful in an online process of word categorization.",
        "However, the few incremental models of category acquisition which have been proposed so far are generally inefficient and over-sensitive to the properties of the input data (Cartwright & Brent, 1997; Parisien et al., 2008).",
        "Moreover, the unsupervised nature of these models makes their assessment a challenge, and the evaluation techniques proposed in the literature are limited.",
        "The main contributions of our research are twofold.",
        "First, we propose an incremental entropy model for efficiently clustering words into categories given their local context.",
        "We train our model on a corpus of child-directed speech from CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000) and show that the model learns a fine-grained set of intuitive word categories.",
        "Second, we propose a novel evaluation approach by comparing the efficiency of our induced categories against other category sets, including the traditional part of speech tags, in a variety of language tasks.",
        "We evaluate our model on word prediction (where a missing word is guessed based on its sentential context), semantic inference (where the semantic properties of a novel word are predicted based on the context), and grammaticality judgment (where the syntactic well-formedness of a sentence is assessed based on the category labels assigned to its words).",
        "The results show that the categories induced by our model can be successfully used in a variety of tasks and typically perform better than other category sets.",
        "Several computational models have used distributional information for categorizing words (e.g. Brown et al., 1992; Redington et al., 1998; Clark, 2000; Mintz, 2002).",
        "The majority of these models partition the vocabulary into a set of optimum clusters (e.g., Brown et al., 1992; Clark, 2000).",
        "The generated clusters are intuitive, and can be used in different tasks such as word prediction and parsing.",
        "Moreover, these models confirm the learnability of abstract word categories, and show that distributional cues are a useful source of information for this purpose.",
        "However, (i) they categorize word types rather than word tokens, and as such provide no account of words belonging to more than one category, and (ii) the batch algorithms used by these systems make them implausible for modeling human category induction.",
        "Unsupervised models of PoS tagging such as Gold-water & Griffiths (2007) do assign labels to word-tokens, but they still typically use batch processing, and what is even more problematic, they hardwire important aspects of the model, such as the final number of categories.",
        "Only few previously proposed models process data incrementally, categorize word-tokens and do not pre-specify a fixed category set.",
        "The model of Cartwright & Brent (1997) uses an algorithm which incrementally merges word clusters so that a Minimum Description Length criterion for a template grammar is optimized.",
        "The model treats whole sentences as contextual units, which sacrifices a degree of incrementality, as well as making it less robust to noise in the input.",
        "Parisien et al.",
        "(2008) propose a Bayesian clustering model which copes with ambiguity and exhibits the developmental trends observed in children (e.g. the order of acquisition of different categories).",
        "However, their model is overly sensitive to context variability, which results in the creation of sparse categories.",
        "To remedy this issue they introduce a \"bootstrapping\" component where the categories assigned to context words are use to determine the category of the current target word.",
        "They also perform periodical cluster reorganization.",
        "These mechanisms improve the overall performance of the model when trained on large amounts of training data, but they complicate the model with ad-hoc extensions and add to the (already considerable) computational load.",
        "What is lacking is an incremental model of lexical category which can efficiently process naturalistic input data and gradually build robust categories with little training data.",
        "There is no standard and straightforward method for evaluating the unsupervised models of category learning (see Clark, 2003, for discussion).",
        "Many unsupervised models of lexical category acquisition treat the traditional part of speech (PoS) tags as the gold standard, and measure the accuracy and completeness of their induced categories based on how closely they resemble the PoS categories (e.g. Redington et al., 1998; Mintz, 2003; Parisien et al., 2008).",
        "However, it is not at all clear whether humans form the same types ofcate-gories.",
        "In fact, many language tasks might benefit from finer-grained categories than the traditional PoS tags used for corpus annotation.",
        "Frank et al.",
        "(2009) propose a different, automatically generated set of gold standard categories for evaluating an unsupervised categorization model.",
        "The gold-standard categories are formed according to \"substitutability\": if one word can be replaced by another and the resulting sentence is still grammatical, then there is a good chance that the two words belong to the same category.",
        "They extract 3-word frames from the training data, and form the gold standard categories based on the words that appear in the same frame.",
        "They emphasize that in order to provide some degree of generalization, different data sets must be used for forming the gold-standard categories and performing the evaluation.",
        "However, the resulting categories are bound to be incomplete, and using them as gold standard inevitably favors categorization models which use a similar frame-based principle.",
        "All in all, using any set of gold standard categories for evaluating an unsupervised categorization model has the disadvantage of favoring one set of principles and intuitions over another; that is, assuming that there is a correct set of categories which the model should converge to.",
        "Alternatively, automatically induced categories can be evaluated based on how useful they are in performing different tasks.",
        "This approach is taken by Clark (2000), where the perplexity of a finite-state model is used to compare different category sets.",
        "We build on this idea and propose a more general usage-based approach to evaluating the automatically induced categories from a data set, emphasizing that the ultimate goal of a category induction model is to form categories that can be efficiently used in a variety of language tasks.",
        "We argue that for such tasks, a finer-grained set of categories might be more appropriate than the coarsegrained PoS categories.",
        "Therefore, we propose a number of tasks for which we compare the performance based on various category sets, including those induced by our model."

        "The semantic features of words are not used in the formation of lexical categories.",
        "However, at each point of time in learning, we can associate a semantic profile to a category as the aggregated set of the semantic features of its members: each feature in the set is assigned a count that indicates the number of the category members which have that semantic property.",
        "This is done for each of the category sets described in Section 3.2.",
        "As in the word-prediction task, we use different category sets to label each word usage in a test set based only on the context features of the word.",
        "When the model encounters a novel word, it can use the semantic profile of the word's labeled category as a prediction of the semantic properties of that word.",
        "We can evaluate the quality of this prediction by comparing the true meaning representation of the target word (i.e., its set of semantic features according to the lexicon) against the semantic profile of the selected category.",
        "We use the Mean Average Precision (MAP) (Manning et al., 2008) for comparing the ranked list of semantic features predicted by the model with the flat set of semantic features extracted from WordNet and VerbNet.",
        "Average Precision for a ranked list F with respect to a set R of correct features is:",

        "As can be seen, the categories induced by our model (AH) outperform all the other category sets.",
        "The word-type categories are particularly unsuitable for this task, since they provide the least degree of generalization over the semantic properties of a group of words.",
        "The categories of Parisien et al.",
        "(2008) result in a better performance than word types, but they are still too sparse for this task.",
        "However, the average score gained by part of speech tags is also lower than the one by our categories.",
        "This suggests that too broad categories are also unsuitable for this task, since they can only provide predictions about the most general semantic properties, such as ENTITY for nouns, and ACTION for verbs.",
        "These findings again confirm our hypothesis that a finer-grained set of categories that are extracted directly from the input data provide the highest predictive power in a naturalistic language task such as semantic inference."

        "Speakers of a natural language have a general agreement on the grammaticality of different sentences.",
        "Grammaticality judgment has been viewed as one of the main criteria for measuring how well a language is learned by a human learner.",
        "Experimental studies have shown that children as young as five years old can judge the grammaticality of the sentences that they hear, and that both children's and adults' grammaticality judgments are influenced by the distributional properties of words and their context (e.g., Theakston, 2004).",
        "Several methods have been proposed for automatically distinguishing between grammatical and ungrammatical usages (e.g., Wagner et al., 2007).",
        "The 'shallow' methods are mainly based on n-gram frequencies of words or categories in a corpus, whereas the 'deep' methods treat a parsing failure as an indication of a grammatical error.",
        "Since our focus is on evaluating our category set, we use trigram probabilities as a measure ofgram-maticality, using Equation 9 with n = 3.",
        "As before, we label each test sentence using different category sets, and calculate the probability for each trigram in that sentence.",
        "We define the overall grammaticality score of a sentence as the minimum of the probabilities of all the trigrams in that sentence.",
        "Note that, unlike the previous tasks, here we do use the content word as a feature in labeling a test word usage.",
        "The actual word form affects the grammaticality of its usage, and this information is available to the human subjects who evaluate the grammaticality of a sentence.",
        "Since we know of no publicly available corpus of ungrammatical sentences, we artificially construct one: for each sentence in our test data set, we randomly move one word to another position.We define the accuracy of this task as the proportion of the test usages for which the model calculates a higher grammaticality score for the original sentence than for its ungrammatical version.",
        "The last row of Table 4 shows the accuracy of the grammaticality judgment task across different category sets.",
        "As can be seen, the highest accuracy in choosing the grammatical sentence over the ungrammatical one is achieved by using the PoS categories (0.728), followed by the categories induced by our model (0.715).",
        "These levels of accuracy are rather good considering that some of the automatically generated errors are also grammatical (e.g., there you are vs. you are there, or can you reach it vs. you can reach it).",
        "The results by the other two category sets are lower and very close to each other.",
        "These results suggest that, unlike the semantic inference task, the grammaticality judgment task might require a coarser-grained set of categories which provide a higher level of abstraction.",
        "However, taking into account that the PoS categories are manually assigned to the test usages, the difference in their performance might be due to lack of noise in the labeling procedure.",
        "We plan to investigate this matter in future by improving our categorization model (as discussed in Section 7).",
        "Also, we intend to implement more accurate ways of estimating grammaticality, using an approach similar to that described for word prediction task in Section 4."

        "We have proposed an incremental model of lexical category acquisition based on the distributional properties of words.",

        "The model can efficiently process the training data, and induce an intuitive set of categories from child-directed speech.",
        "However, due to the incremental nature of the clustering algorithm, it does not revise its previous decisions according to the data that it later receives.",
        "A potential remedy would be to consider merging the clusters that have recently been updated, in order to allow for recovery from early mistakes the model has made.",
        "We used the categories induced by our model in word prediction, inferring the semantic properties of novel words, and grammaticality judgment.",
        "Our experimental results show that the performance in these tasks using our categories is comparable or better than the performance based on the manually assigned part of speech tags in our experimental data.",
        "Furthermore, in all these tasks the performance using our categories improves over a previous incremental categorization model (Parisien et al., 2008).",
        "However, the model of Parisien employs a number of cluster reorganization techniques which improve the overall quality of the clusters after processing a substantial amount of input data.",

        "The promising results of our experiments suggest that an information-theoretic approach is a plausible one for modeling the induction of lexical categories from distributional data.",
        "Our results imply that in many language tasks, a fine-grained set of categories which are formed in response to the properties of the input are more appropriate than the coarser-grained part of speech categories.",
        "Therefore, the ubiquitous approach of using PoS categories as the gold standard in evaluating unsupervised category induction models needs to be reevaluated.",
        "To further investigate this claim, in future we plan to collect experimental data from human subjects performing our suggested tasks, and measure the correlation between their performance and that of our model."
