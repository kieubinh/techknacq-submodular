        "As a baseline they used an algorithm based on finding speculative sentences by simply checking whether any cue (from a given list of 14 cues) occurs in the sentence to be classified.",
        "Medlock and Briscoe (2007) also used single words as input features in order to classify sentences from scientific articles in biomedical domain as speculative or non-speculative.",
        "In a first step they employed a weakly supervised Bayesian learning model in order to derive the probability of each word to represent a hedge cue.",
        "In the next step, they perform feature selection based on these probabilities.",

        "However Medlock and Briscoe (2007) note that their model is unsuccessful in identifying assertive statements of knowledge paucity which are generally marked rather syntactically than lexically.",
        "Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) proposed a semiautomatic approach incorporating syntactic and some semantic information in order to enrich or refine a list of lexical hedging cues that are used as input features for automatic detection of uncertain sentences in the biomedical domain.",
        "They also used lexical cues and syntactic patterns that strongly suggest non-speculative contexts (\"unhedges\").",

        "Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) did experiments on the same dataset as Medlock and Briscoe (2007) and their experimental results proved that the classification accuracy can be improved by approximately 9% (from an F-score of 76% to an F-score of 85%) if syntactic and semantic information are incorporated.",
        "The experiments run by Medlock (2008) on the same dataset as Medlock and Briscoe (2007) show that adding features based on part-of-speech tags to a bag-of-words input representation can slightly improve the accuracy, but the \"improvements are marginal and not statistically significant\".",
