        "In this paper we describe the machine learning systems that CLiPS submitted to the closed track of the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task on Learning to Detect Hedges and Their Scope in Natural Language Text (Farkas et al., 2010).",
        "The task consists of two subtasks: detecting whether a sentence contains uncertain information (Task 1), and resolving in-sentence scopes of hedge cues (Task 2).",
        "To solve Task 1, systems are required to classify sentences into two classes, \"Certain\" or \"Uncertain\", depending on whether the sentence contains factual or uncertain information.",
        "Three annotated training sets are provided: Wikipedia paragraphs (WIKI), biological abstracts (BIO-ABS) and biological full articles (BIO-ART).",
        "The two test sets consist of WIKI and BIO-ART data.",
        "Task 2 requires identifying hedge cues and finding their scope in biomedical texts.",
        "Finding the scope of a hedge cue means determining at sentence level which words in the sentence are affected by the hedge cue.",
        "For a sentence like the one in (1) extracted from the BIO-ART training corpus, systems have to identify likely and suggested as hedge cues, and they have to find that likely scopes over the full sentence, and that suggested scopes over by the role of murine MIB in TNFa signaling.",
        "A scope will be correctly resolved only if both the cue and the scope are correctly identified.",
        "(1) <xcope id=2> The conservation from Drosophila to mammals of these two structurally distinct but functionally similar E3 ubiquitin ligases is <cue ref=2>likely</cue> to reflect a combination of evolutionary advantages associated with: (i) specialized expression pattern, as evidenced by the cell-specific expression of the neur gene in sensory organ precursor cells [52] ; (ii) specialized function, as <xcopeid=1> <cue ref=1>suggested</cue> by the role of murine MIB in TNFa signaling</xcope> [32]; (iii) regulation of protein stability, localization, and/or activity< /xcope> .",
        "Systems are to be trained on BIO-ABS and",
        "BIO-ART and tested on BIO-ART.",
        "Example (1) shows that sentences in the BIO-ART dataset can be quite complex because of their length, because of their structure - very often they contain enumerations, and because they contain bibliographic references and references to tables and figures.",
        "Handling these phenomena is necessary to detect scopes correctly in the setting of this task.",
        "Note that the scope of suggested above does not include the bibliographic reference [32], whereas the scope of likely includes all the bibliographic references, and that the scope of likely does not include the final punctuation mark.",
        "In the case of the BIO data, we approach Task 1 as a prerequisite for Task 2.",
        "Therefore we treat them as two consecutive classification tasks: a first one that consists of classifying the tokens of a sentence as being at the beginning of a hedge signal, inside or outside.",
        "This allows the system to find multiword hedge cues.",
        "We tag a sentence as uncertain if at least a hedge cue is found in the sentence.",
        "The second classification task consists of classifying the tokens of a sentence as being the first element of the scope, the last, or neither.",
        "This happens as many times as there are hedge cues in the sentence.",
        "The two classification tasks are implemented using memory-based learners.",
        "Memory-based language processing (Daele-mans and van den Bosch, 2005) is based on the idea that NLP problems can be solved by reuse of solved examples of the problem stored in memory.",
        "Given a new problem, the most similar examples are retrieved, and a solution is extrapolated from them.",
        "Section 2 is devoted to related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe how the data have been preprocessed.",
        "In Section 4 and Section 5 we present the systems that perform Task 1 and Task 2.",

        "Both systems approach the task in two steps, identifying the hedge cues and finding their scope.",
        "The main difference between the two systems is that Morante and Daelemans (2009) perform the second phase with a machine learner, whereas Ozgur and Radev (2009) perform the second phase with a rule-based system that exploits syntactic information.",
        "The approach to resolving the scopes of hedge cues that we present in this paper is similar to the approach followed in Morante and Daelemans (2009) in that the task is modelled in the same way.",
