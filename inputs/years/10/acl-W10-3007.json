        "First, a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) classifier is applied to automatically detect cue words.",
        "For Task 1, a given sentence is labeled as uncertain if it contains a word classified as a cue.",
        "For Task 2, we then go on to determine the scope of the identified cues using a set of manually crafted rules operating on dependency representations.",
        "For both Task 1 and Task 2, our system participates in the stricter category of 'closed' or 'indomain' systems.",
        "This means that we do not use any additional uncertainty-annotated material beyond the supplied training data, consisting of 14541 sentences from biomedical abstracts and articles (see Table 2).",

        "To ease integration of annotations across system components, we converted the XML training data to plain-text files, with stand-off annotation linked to the raw data by virtue of character start and end positions (dubbed characterization in the following).",
        "Thus, hedge cues, scope boundaries, tok-enization, Part-of-Speech (PoS) assignments, etc.",
        "are all represented in a uniform fashion: as potentially overlapping annotations on sub-strings of the raw input.",
        "The GENIA tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2005) takes an important role in our preprocessing set-up.",
        "However, maybe somewhat surprisingly, we found that its tokenization rules are not always optimally adapted for the BioScope corpus.",
        "genia unconditionally introduces token boundaries for some punctuation marks that can also occur token-internally.",
        "For example, it wrongly splits tokens like '3, 926.50', 'methlycobamide:CoM', or 'Ca(2+)'.",
        "Conversely, GENIA fails to isolate some kinds of opening single quotes, because the quoting conventions assumed in BioScope differ from those used in the GENIA Corpus; furthermore, it mis-tokenizes LATEX-style n-and m-dashes.",

        "lems.",
        "Our preprocessing approach therefore deploys a home-grown, cascaded finite-state tok-enizer (borrowed and adapted from the open-source English Resource Grammar; Flickinger (2000)), which aims to implement the tokenization decisions made in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) - much like GENIA, in principle - but properly treating corner cases like the ones above.",
        "Synchronized via characterization, this to-kenization is then enriched with the output of no less than two PoS taggers, as detailed in the next section.",
        "For PoS tagging and lemmatization, we combine GENIA (with its built-in, occasionally deviant to-kenizer) and TnT (Brants, 2000), which operates on pre-tokenized inputs but in its default model is trained on financial news from the Penn Treebank.",
        "Our general goal here is to take advantage of the higher PoS accuracy provided by GENIA in the biomedical domain, while using our improved tokenization and producing inputs to the parsing stage (see Section 2.3 below) that as much as possible resemble the conventions used in the original training data for the parser - the Penn Treebank, once again.",
        "To this effect, for the vast majority of tokens we can align the GENIA tokenization with our own, and in these cases we typically use GENIA PoS tags and lemmas (i.e. base forms).",
        "For better normalization, we downcase base forms for all parts of speech except proper nouns.",
        "However, GENIA does not make a PoS distinction between proper and common nouns, as in the Penn Treebank, and hence we give precedence to TnT outputs for tokens tagged as nominal by both taggers.",
        "Finally, for the small number of cases where we cannot establish a one-to-one alignment from an element in our own tokenization to a GENIA token, we rely on TnT annotation only.",
        "In the merging of annotations across components, and also in downstream processing we have found it most convenient to operate predominantly in terms of characterization, i.e. sub-strings of the raw input that need not align perfectly with token boundaries.",
        "For syntactic parsing we employ a data-driven dependency parser which incorporates the predictions from a large-scale LFG grammar.",
        "A technique of parser stacking is employed, which enables a data-driven parser to learn from the output of another parser, in addition to gold standard treebank annotations (Nivre and McDonald, 2008).",
        "This technique has been shown to provide significant improvements in accuracy for both English and German (0vrelid et al., 2009), and a similar approach employing an HPSG grammar has been shown to increase domain independence in data-driven dependency parsing (Zhang and Wang, 2009).",
        "For our purposes, we decide to use a parser which incorporates analyses from two quite different parsing approaches - data-driven dependency parsing and \"deep\" parsing with a handcrafted grammar - providing us with a range of different types of linguistic features which may be used in hedge detection.",
        "We employ the freely available MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006), which is a language-independent system for data-driven dependency parsing.",
        "It is based on a deterministic parsing strategy in combination with treebank-induced classifiers for predicting parse transitions.",

        "While the training data made available for the shared task consisted of both abstracts and full articles from the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008), the test data were pre-announced to consist of biomedical articles only.",

        "The most basic baseline model (Baseline 1) included only unigram features.",
        "The behavior of this classifier is similar to what we would expect from simply compiling a list of cue words from the training data, based on the majority usage of each word as cue or non-cue.",

        "Lexical parser features Other features constructed on the basis of the parser output: subcat - subcategorization frame for verbs (xle), advType - type of adverbial, e.g. sentence, vp (xle), adjType - adjectival function, e.g. attributive vs. predicative (xle)",
        "When added to Baseline 2 in isolation, most of these features resulted in a boost in classifier performance.",
        "For the dependency-based features, the contribution was more pronounced for lexicalized versions of the features.",
        "This also points to the fact that lexical information seems to be the key for the task of cue identification, where the model using only n-grams over surface forms proved a strong baseline.",
        "As more feature types were added to the classifier together, we also saw a clear trend of diminishing returns, in that many of the features seemed to contribute overlapping information.",
        "After several rounds of grid-search over different feature configurations, the best-performing classifier (as used for the shared task) used only the following feature types: n-grams over surface forms (including up to 2 tokens to the right), n-grams over base forms (up to 3 tokens left and right), pos of the target word, 'subcat', 'coord', and 'coordLevel'.",
        "The 'subcat' feature contains information taken from xle regarding the subcategorization requirements of a verb in a specific context, e.g., whether a verb is modal, takes an expletive subject etc., whereas the coordination features signal coordination ('coord') and detail the phrase-structural level of coordination ('coordLevel'), e.g., NP, VP, etc.",
        "This defines the feature set used for the model referred to as final in Table 3.",
        "Recall that for Baseline 2, the F-score is 87.14 for the sentence-level evaluation and 81.97 for the token-level.",

        "At both the sentence-level and the token-level, the differences in classifier performance were found to be statistically significant at p < 0.005, using a two-tailed sign-test.",
        "After also applying the heuristic rules for detecting multi-word cues, the cue-level F-score for our final model is 84.60, compared to 82.83 for Baseline 2.",
        "In order to asses the effect of the size of the training set, we computed learning curves showing how classifier performance changes as more training data is added.",
        "Starting with only 10% of the training data included in the 10-fold cycle, Figure 1 shows the effect on both token level and sentence-level F-scores as we incrementally include larger portions of the available training data.",
        "Unsurprisingly, we see that the performance of the classifier is steadily improving up to the point where 100% of the data is included, and by extrapolating from the curves shown in Figure 1 it seems reasonable to assume that this improvement would continue if more data were available.",
        "We therefore tried to further increase the size of the training set by also using the hedge-annotated clinical reports that form part of the BioScope corpus.",
        "This provided us with an additional 855 hedged sentences.",
        "However, the classifiers did not seem able to benefit from the additional training examples, and across several feature configurations performance was found to be consistently lower (though not significantly so).",
        "The reason is probably that the type of text is quite different - the clinical reports have a high ratio of fragments and also shows other patterns of cue usage, being somewhat more jargon-based.",
