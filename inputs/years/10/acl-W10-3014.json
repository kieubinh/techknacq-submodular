        "This paper presents an approach for extracting the hedge cues and their scopes in BioScope corpus using two CRF models for CoNLL-2010 shared task.",
        "In the first task, the HCDic feature is proposed to improve the system performances, getting better performance (84.1% in F-score) than the baseline.",
        "The HCDic feature is also helpful to make use of cross-domain resources.",
        "The comparison of our methods based on between BioScope and Wikipedia corpus is given, which shows that ours are good at hedge cues detection in BioScope corpus but short at the in Wikipedia corpus.",
        "To detect the scope of hedge cues, we make rules to post process the text.",
        "For future work, we will look forward to constructing regulations for the HCDic to improve our system."
