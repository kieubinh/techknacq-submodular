        "We applied a supervised learning framework for this task, for which We experimented with both",
        "SVMs and CRFs.",

        "All results presented here use this setting.",

        "Experiments are done only with order-0 CRFs.",
        "CRFs proved to marginally improve the prediction accuracy while substantially improving the speed.",
        "For e.g, for a configuration of 10 features with context width of 2, Yamcha took around 5-6 hrs for 9-fold cross validation on the whole training set, where as Mallet took only around 30-40 minutes only.",
        "Our approach was to explore the use of deep syntactic features in this tagging task.",
        "Deep syntactic features had been proven useful in many similar tagging tasks before.",
        "We used the dependency parser MICA (Bangalore et al., 2009) based on Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi et al., 1975) to extract these deep syntactic features.",
        "We classified the features into three classes Lexical (L), Syntactic (S) and Wordlist-based (W).",
        "Lexical features are those which could be found at the token level without using any wordlists or dictionaries and can be extracted without any parsing with relatively high accuracy.",

        "Under this definition, POS tag will be considered as a lexical feature.",

        "Similarly, the feature haveDaughterAux would also be 'Y' because of daughter was, whereas whichAuxIsMyDaughter would get the value was.",
        "Wordlist-based features utilized a list of words which occurred frequently as a cue word in the training corpus.",
        "We used two such lists - one which included adjectives like many, most, some etc.",
        "The other list contained adverbs like probably, possibly etc.",
        "The complete list of words in these wordlists are given in Table 1.",
        "For finding the best performing feature set context width configuration, we did an exhaustive search on the feature space, pruning away features which were proven not useful by results at stages.",
        "The list of features we used in our experiments are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.",
        "Table 1 contains features which were useful and are present in the results presented in section 4.",
        "Out of the syntactic features, parentPOS and is-MyNNSparentGeneric turned out to be the most useful.",
        "It was noticed that in most cases in which a generic adjective (i.e., a quantifier such as many, several ... ) has a parent which is a plural noun, and this noun has only adjectival daughters, then it is part of a cue phrase.",
        "This distinction can be made clear by the below example.",
        "• (ccue) Many people (/ccue) enjoy having professionally made 'family portraits'",
        "• Many departments, especially those in which students have research or teaching responsibilities ...",
        "In the first case, the noun people comes with the adjective Many, but is not qualified further.",
        "This makes it insufficiently defined and hence is tagged as a cue phrase.",
        "However in the second case, the clause which starts with especially is qualifying the noun departments further and hence the phrase is not tagged as a cue word despite the presence of Many.",
        "This scenario occurred often with other adjectives like most, some etc.",
        "This distinction was caught to a good extent by the combination of isMyNNSparentGeneric and isGenericAdj.",
        "Hence, the best performing configuration used features from both W and S categories.",
