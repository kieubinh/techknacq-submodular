      "text": [
        "The CoNLL-2010 Shared Task focused on the identification and localization of uncertain information and its scope in text.",
        "In the first task, a binary classification of sentences had to be performed, based on whether they are uncertain or not.",
        "The second task concentrated on the identification of the source of uncertainty - specifying the keyword/phrase that makes its context uncertain -, and the localization of its scope.",
        "The organizers provided training data from two application domains: biomedical texts and Wikipedia articles.",
        "For more details see the overview paper by the organizers (Farkas et al., 2010).",
        "We focused on task 1 and worked with biomedical texts exclusively.",
        "The biomedical training corpus contains selected abstracts and full text articles from the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008).",
        "The corpus was manually annotated for hedge cues on the phrase level.",
        "Sentences containing at least one cue are considered as uncertain, while sentences with no cues are considered as factual.",
        "Though cue tagging was given in the training data, their marking in the submission was not mandatory.",
        "The evaluation of systems at task 1 was performed on the sentence level with the F-measure of the uncertain class being the official evaluation metric.",
        "For evaluation, corpora also from both domains were provided that allowed for in-domain and cross-domain experiments as well.",
        "Nevertheless, we restricted the scope of our system to the in-domain biomedical subtask."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "Automatic information extraction methods may incorrectly extract facts that are mentioned in a negated or speculative context.",
        "If aiming at high accuracy, it is therefore crucial to be able to classify assertions to avoid such false positives.",
        "The importance of assertion classification has been recently recognized by the text mining community, which yielded several text-mining challenges covering this task.",
        "For example, the main task of Obesity Challenge (Uzuner, 2008) was to identify based on a free text medical record whether a patient is known to, speculated to or known not to have a disease; in the BioNLP '09 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2009), mentions of bio-molecular events had to be classified as either positive or negative statements or speculations.",
        "Approaches to tackle assertion classification can be roughly organized into following classes: rule based models (Chapman et al., 2001), statistical models (Szarvas, 2008), machine learning (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007), though most contributions can be seen as a combination of these (Uzuner et al., 2009).",
        "Even when classifying sentences, the most common approach is to look for cues below the sentence-level (Özgür and Radev, 2009).",
        "The common in these approaches is that they use a text representation richer than bag-of-words, usually tokens from a fixed-width window with additional surface features.",
        "Evaluation of assertion classification is mostly performed at the sentence level, where state-of-the-art systems have been reported to achieve an F-measure of 83-85% for hedge detection in biomedical literature (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007;",
        "Although the problem itself is a binary categorization problem, we approach the problem at the token/phrase level.",
        "We search for hedge cues and used the decision model also applied by the annotators of the training corpus: when a sentence contains at least one uncertainty cue then it is uncertain, otherwise factual.",
        "We applied two different models to identify hedge cues:",
        "• a statistical model that creates a candidate list of cue words/phrases from the training samples, and cuts off the list based on the precision measured on the trial set;",
        "• a sequence tagger CRF model, trained again with hedge cues using various feature sets.",
        "Finally, we combined the outputs of the methods at the sentence level.",
        "Here we applied two very simple ways of combination: the aggressive one assigns a sentence to the uncertain class if any of the models finds a cue phrase therein (OR merger), while the conservative only if both models predict the sentence as uncertain (AND merger).",
        "We submitted the version which produced better result on the trial set.",
        "The overview of our system is depicted on Figure 1.",
        "The biomedical corpus was provided in two train/trial pairs (abstracts and full texts), see also Table 1.",
        "Because the ratio of uncertain sentences is similar in both train and trial sets, we merged the two train sets and the two trial sets, respectively, to obtain a single train/trial pair.",
        "Since the trial set was originally included also in the train set, we removed the elements of the merged trial set from the merged train set.",
        "In the following, we refer to them as train and trial sets.",
        "All data (train, trial, evaluation) were given as separate sentences; therefore no sentence segmentation had to be performed.",
        "Merging train and trial sets was also motivated by the sparsity of data and the massively different train/trial ratio observed for the two types of biomedical texts (Table 1).",
        "Therefore building separate models for abstracts and full texts may",
        "classification",
        "only yield overfitting, particularly because such a distinction is not available for the evaluation set.",
        "The statistical model considers a sentence uncertain, if it contains at least one cue from a validated set of cue phrases.",
        "To determine the set of cue phrases to be used, we first collected all annotated cues from the training data.",
        "From this candidate cue set we retained those ones that had a precision over a predefined threshold.",
        "To this end we measured on the training set the precision of each cue phrase.",
        "We depicted on Figure 2 the precision, recall and F-measure values obtained on the trial set with different cue phrase precision thresholds.",
        "The candidate cue set contains 186 cue phrases, among which 83 has precision 1.0 and 141 has precision greater or equal 0.5.",
        "Best cue phrases include words/phrases like cannot + verb phrase, hypothesis, indicate, may, no(t) + verb/noun, raise the + noun, seem, suggest, whether etc., while low precision cues are, e.g., assume, not fully understood, not, or, prediction, likelihood.",
        "Identifying entities such as speculation cues can be efficiently solved by training conditional random field (CRF) models.",
        "As a general sequence tagger, a CRF can be naturally extended to incorporate token features and features of neighboring tokens.",
        "The trained CRF model is then applied to unseen",

        "In our experiments, we used MALLET (McCal-lum, 2002) to train CRF models using custom to-kenization (Section 3.3.1) and feature sets (Section 3.3.2).",
        "We included features of 2-2 neighboring tokens in each direction, not surpassing the sentence limits.",
        "We split text into tokens using punctuation and white-space tokenization, keeping punctuation symbols as separate tokens.",
        "We experimented with the following binary surface features:",
        "Evaluating all combinations of the above features, we found that the combination of features 2 and 4 produced the best results on the trial set.",
        "For computational efficiency, when selecting the best performing feature subset, we considered lower feature count to overrule a slight increase in performance."
