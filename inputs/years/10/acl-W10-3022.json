        "We have only participated in",
        "Task 1.",
        "We built a basic model for the training data, taking advantage of the fact that the hedge cues were marked explicitly.",
        "We estimated the probability of each training data word appearing in a hedge cue with unigram statistics:",
        "where P(w in cue) is the probability that word w appears in a hedge cue, f (w) is frequency of the word w in the data and f (w in c) is the frequency of the word inside hedge cues.",
        "We performed only little text preprocessing, converting all words to lower case and separating six common punctuation signs from the words.",
        "In the classification stage, we assigned to each word the estimated hedge cue probability according to the training data.",
        "Next, we assigned a score to each sentence that was equal to one minus the highest individual score of its words:",
        "P(s is certain) is the estimated probability that the sentence s is certain, and it is equal to one minus the highest probability of any of its words being part of a hedge cue.",
        "So a sentence containing only words that never appeared as a hedge cue would receive score 1.0.",
        "Meanwhile a sentence with a single word that had appeared in a hedge cue in the training data would receive one minus the probability associated with that word.",
        "This model ignores any relations between the words of the sentence.",

        "Apart from the word probabilities, we needed to obtain a good threshold score for deciding whether to classify a sentence as certain or uncertain.",
        "For this purpose, we performed a 10-fold cross-validation experiment on each of the two training data files (biological and Wikipedia) and measured the effect of different threshold values.",
        "The results can be found in Figure 1.",
        "The model performed well on the biological training data, with F scores above 80 for a large range of threshold values (0.15-0.85).",
        "It performed less well on the Wikipedia training data, with a maximum F score of less than 60 and 50+ scores being limited to the threshold range 0.450.85.",
        "The maximum F scores were reached for threshold values 0.55 and 0.65 for biological data (F=88.8) and Wikipedia data (F=59.4), respectively.",
        "We selected the threshold value 0.55 for our further work because the associated precision and recall values were closer to each other than for value 0.65.",
        "We build domain-specific models with the biological data (14,541 sentences) and the Wikipedia data (11,111 sentences) and applied the models to the related training data.",
        "We obtained an F score of 80.2 on the biological data (13th of 20 participants) and a score of 54.4 on the Wikipedia data (9th of 15 participants).",
        "The balance between precision and recall scores that we strived for when processing the training data, was not visible in the test results.",
        "On the biological test data the system's recall score was 13 points higher than the precision score while on the Wikipedia test data precision outperformed recall by 31 points (see",

        "In both cases the performances were lower than the ones obtained with domain dependent training data: F = 71.8 for biological data and F = 54.2 for Wikipedia data (see Table 1).",
        "As post-deadline work, we added statistics for word bigrams to the model, following up work by Medlock (2008), who showed that considering word bigrams had a positive effect on hedge detection.",
