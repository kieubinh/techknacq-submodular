        "We constructed a consensus annotation out of the three different annotations of the same clinical corpus that is described in Dalianis and Velupillai (2010).",
        "The consensus was constructed with the general idea of choosing, as far as possible, an annotation for which there existed an identical annotation performed by at least two of the annotators, and thus to find a majority annotation.",
        "In the cases where no majority was found, other methods were used.",
        "Other options would be to let the annotators discuss the sentences that were not identically annotated, or to use the method of the BioScope Corpus, where the sentences that were not identically annotated were resolved by a chief annotator (Vincze et al., 2008).",
        "A third solution, which might, however, lead to a very biased corpus, would be to not include the sentences for which there was not a unanimous annotation in the resulting consensus corpus.",
        "The annotation classes that were used for annotation can be divided into two levels.",
        "The first level consisted of the annotation classes for classifying the type of sentence or clause.",
        "This level thus included the annotation classes uncertain, certain and undefined.",
        "The second level consisted of the annotation classes for annotating cue words for negation and speculation, thus the annotation classes negation and speculative words.",
        "The annotation classes on the first level were considered as more important for the consensus, since if there was no agreement on the kind of expression, it could perhaps be said to be less important which cue phrases these expressions contained.",
        "In the following constructed example, the annotation tag Uncertain is thus an annotation on the first level, while the annotation tags Negation and Speculative words are on the second level.",
        "<Sentence> <Uncertain> <Speculative_words> <Negation>Not</Negation> really </Spéculâtive_words> much worse than before </Uncertain> <Sentence>",
        "When constructing the consensus corpus, the annotated sentences from the first rounds of annotation were considered as sentences annotated before the annotators had fully learnt to apply the guidelines.",
        "The first 1 099 of the annotated sentences, which also had a lower inter-annotator agreement, were therefore not included when constructing the consensus.",
        "Thereby, 5 641 sentences were left to compare.",
        "The annotations were compared on a sentence level, where the three versions of each sentence were compared.",
        "First, sentences for which there existed an identical annotation performed by at least two of the annotators were chosen.",
        "This was the case for 5 097 sentences, thus 90 percent of the sentences.",
        "For the remaining 544 sentences, only annotation classes on the first level were compared for a majority.",
        "For the 345 sentences where a majority was found on the first level, a majority on the second level was found for 298 sentences when the scope of these tags was disregarded.",

        "The results in Table 1 show that there are fewer uncertain expressions in the consensus annotation than in the average of the individual annotations.",
        "The reason for this could be that if the annotation is not completeley free of randomness, the class with a higher probability will be more frequent in a majority consensus, than in the individual annotations.",
        "In the cases where the annotators are unsure of how to classify a sentence, it is not unlikely that the sentence has a higher probability of being classified as belonging to the majority class, that is, the class certain.",
        "The class undefined is also less common in the consensus annotation, and the same reasoning holds true for undefined as for uncertain, perhaps to an even greater extent, since undefined is even less common.",
        "Also the speculative words are fewer in the consensus.",
        "Most likely, this follows from the uncertain sentences being less common.",
        "The words annotated as negations, on the other hand, are more common in the consensus annotation than in the individual annotations.",
        "This could be partly explained by the choice of the 47 sentences with an annotation that contained the largest number of annotated instances on the second level, and it is an indication that the consensus contains some annotations for negation cues which have only been annotated by one person.",
        "Table 1 : Comparison of the number of occurrences of each annotation class for the individual annotations and the consensus annotation.",

        "However, since for example some expressions of uncertainty, which do not have to be incorrect, have been removed, it can also be said that some information containing possible interpretations of the text, has also been lost.",

        "The method is, however, described in order to exemplify the more general idea to use a majority decision for selecting the correct annotations.",
        "What is tested when using the majority method described in this article for deciding which annotation is correct, is the idea that a possible alternative to a high annotator agreement would be to ask many annotators to judge what they consider to be certain or uncertain.",
        "This could perhaps be based on a very simplified idea of language, that the use and interpretation of language is nothing more than a majority decision by the speakers of that language.",
        "A similar approach is used in Steidl et al.",
        "(2005), where they study emotion in speech.",
        "Since there are no objective criteria for deciding with what emotion something is said, they use manual classification by five labelers, and a majority voting for deciding which emotion label to use.",
        "If less than three labelers agreed on the classification, it was omitted from the corpus.",
        "It could be argued that this is also true for uncertainty, that if there is no possibility to ask the author of the text, there are no objective criteria for deciding the level of certainty in the text.",
        "It is always dependent on how it is perceived by the reader, and therefore a majority method is suitable.",
        "Even if the majority approach can be used for subjective classifications, it has some problems.",
        "For example, to increase validity more annotators are needed, which complicates the process of annotation.",
        "Also, the same phenomenon that was observed when constructing the consensus would probably also arise, that a very infrequent class such as uncertain, would be less frequent in the majority consensus than in the individual annotations.",
        "Finally, there would probably be many cases where there is no clear majority for either completely certain or uncertain: in these cases, having many annotators will not help to reach a decision and it can only be concluded that it is difficult to classify this part of a text.",
        "Different levels of uncertainty could then be introduced, where the absence of a clear majority could be an indication of weak certainty or uncertainty, and a very weak majority could result in an undefined classification.",
        "However, even though different levels of certainty or uncertainty are interesting when studying how uncertainties are expressed and perceived, they would complicate the process of information extraction.",
        "Thus, if the final aim of the annotation is to create a system that automatically detects what is certain or uncertain, it would of course be more desirable to have an annotation with a higher inter-annotator agreement.",
        "One way of achieving a this would be to provide more detailed annotation guidelines for what to define as certainty and uncertainty.",
        "However, when it comes to such a vague concept as uncertainty, there is always a thin line between having guidelines capturing the general perception of uncertainty in the language and capturing a definition of uncertainty that is specific to the writers of the guidelines.",
        "Also, there might perhaps be a risk that the complex concept of certainty and uncertainty becomes overly simplified when it has to be formulated as a limited set of guidelines.",

        "If diseases or symptoms that are present in a patient are to be extracted, the most relevant concept to annotate is whether a finding is present or not present in the patient, or whether it is uncertain if it is present or not.",

        "One reason why the F-score for negation cues is not even higher, despite the fact that the number of cues for negations is very limited, could be that a negation word inside a tag for speculative words is not counted as a negation cue.",
        "Therefore, the word not in, for example, not really could have been classified as a negation cue by Stanford NER CRF, even though it is a cue for speculation and not for negation.",
        "Another reason could be that the word meaning without in Swedish (atari) also means but, which only sometimes makes it a negation cue.",
        "We can also observe in Table 4, that the results for detection of uncertain expressions are very low (F-score 42 percent).",
        "For undefined expressions, due to scarce training material, it is not possible to interpret the results.",
        "For certain expressions the results are acceptable, but since the instances are in majority, the results are not very useful.",

        "For scope detection, the result is lower but acceptable, with an F-score of 83 percent.",
        "These results indicate that the chosen method is suitable for the learning task.",
        "The main reason for the differences in F-score between the Swedish consensus corpus and the BioScope Corpus, when it comes to the detection of speculation cues, is probably that the variation of words that were annotated as Speculative word is much larger in the constructed consensus than in the BioScope Corpus.",
        "As can be seen in Table 7, there are many more types of speculative words in the Swedish consensus than in the BioScope Corpus.",
        "We believe that one reason for this difference is that the sentences in the constructed consensus are extracted from a very large number of clinics (several hundred), whereas the BioScope Corpus comes from one radiology clinic.",
        "This is supported by the findings of Szarvas (2008), who writes that cues for speculation are domain-specific.",
        "In this case, however, the texts are still within the domain of clinical texts.",
        "Another reason for the larger variety of cues for speculation in the Swedish corpus could be that the guidelines for annotating the BioScope Corpus and the method for creating a consensus were different.",
        "When comparing the results for the individual annotators with the constructed consensus, the figures in Tables 3 and 6 indicate that there are no big differences in generalizability.",
        "When detecting cues for negation, the precision for the consensus is better than the precision for the individual annotations.",
        "However, the results for the recall are only slightly better or equivalent for the consensus than for the individual annotations.",
        "If we analyse the speculative cues we can observe that the consensus and the individual annotations have similar results.",
        "The low results for learning to detect cues for speculation also serve as an indicator that the task should be simplified to be more easily generalizable.",
        "For example, as previously suggested for increasing the inter-annotator agreement, the task could be tailored towards the specific information that is to be extracted, such as the presence of a disease in a patient."

        "It also contained fewer annotations for speculative words, and more annotations for negations.",
        "Of the sentences in the constructed corpus, 92 percent were identically annotated by at least two persons.",
        "In comparison with the BioScope Corpus, the constructed consensus contained both a larger number and a larger variety of speculative cues.",
        "This might be one of the reasons why the results for detecting cues for speculative words using the Stanford NER CRF are much better for the BioScope Corpus than for the constructed consensus corpus; the F-scores are 93 percent versus 46 percent.",
        "Both the BioScope Corpus and the constructed consensus corpus had high values for detection of negation cues, F-scores 97 and 90 percent, respectively.",
        "As is suggested by Velupillai (2010), the guidelines for annotation should include instructions on the focus of the uncertainties.",
        "To focus the decision of uncertainty on, for instance, the disease of a patient, might improve both the inter-annotator agreement and the possibility of automatically learning to detect the concept of uncertainty."
