        "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a large amount of free text documentation which is potentially very useful for Information Retrieval and Text Mining applications.",
        "Clinical documentation is specific in many ways; there are many authors in a document (e.g. physicians, nurses), there are different situations that are documented (e.g. admission, current status).",
        "Moreover, they may often be written under time pressure, resulting in fragmented, brief texts often containing spelling errors and abbreviations.",
        "With access to EHR data, many possibilities to exploit documented clinical knowledge and experience arise.",
        "One of the properties of EHRs is that they contain reasoning about the status and diagnoses of patients.",
        "Gathering such information for the use in e.g. medical research in order to find relationships between diagnoses, treatments etc.",
        "has great potential.",
        "However, in many situations, clinicians might describe uncertain or negated findings, which is crucial to distinguish from positive or asserted findings.",
        "Potential future applications include search engines where medical researchers can search for particular diseases where negated or speculative contexts are separated from asserted contexts, or text mining systems where e.g. diseases that seem to occur often in speculative contexts are presented to the user, indicating that more research is needed.",
        "Moreover, laymen may also benefit from information retrieval systems that distinguish diseases or symptoms that are more or less certain given current medical expertise and knowledge.",
        "We have, in an initial annotation trial, annotated 6 739 sentences randomly extracted from a corpus of Swedish EHRs for sentence level (un)certainty, and token level speculative keywords and negations.",
        "In this paper, a deeper analysis of the resulting annotations is performed.",
        "The aims are to analyze the results split into different clinical practices by means of descriptive statistics and pairwise Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) measured by Fi-score, with the goal of identifying a) whether specific clinical practices contain higher or lower amounts of uncertain expressions, b)",
        "^his research has been carried out after approval from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm (Etikprövningsnämnden i Stockholm), permission number 2009/1742-31/5",
        "whether specific clinical practices result in higher or lower IAA - indicating a less or more difficult clinical practice for judging uncertainties, and c) identifying the characteristics of the entities annotated as speculative words, are they highly lexical or is a deeper syntactic and/or semantic analysis required for modeling?",
        "From this analysis, we plan to conduct a new annotation trial where we will refine and further develop the annotation guidelines and use domain experts for annotations in order to be able to create a useful annotated corpus modeling uncertainties, negations and speculations in Swedish clinical text, which can be used to develop tools for the automatic identification of these phenomena in, for instance, Text Mining applications."

        "In the clinical sub-corpus, 14 percent contained speculative keywords.",

        "We have used Knowtator (Ogren, 2006) for the annotation work.",
        "One senior level student (SLS), one undergraduate computer scientist (UCS), and one undergraduate language consultant (ULC) annotated the sentences into the following classes; on a sentence level: certain, uncertain or undefined, and on a token level: speculative words, negations, and undefined words.",
        "The annotators are to be considered naive coders, as they had no prior knowledge of the task, nor any clinical background.",
        "The annotation guidelines were inspired by those created for the BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008), with some modifications (see Dalianis and Velupillai (2010)).",
        "The annotators were allowed to break a sentence into subclauses if they found that a sentence contained conflicting levels of certainty, and they were allowed to mark question marks as speculative words.",
        "They did not annotate the linguistic scopes of each token level instance.",

        "In order to be able to analyze possible similarities and differences across clinical practices, sentences from clinics belonging to a specific practice type were grouped together.",
        "In Table 1, the resulting groups, along with the total amount of sentences and tokens, are presented.",

        "Clinical documentation is often very brief and fragmented, for most clinical practices (except urology and cardiology) the minimum sentence length (in tokens) was one, e.g. \"basal\", \"terapisvikt\" (therapy failure), \"lymfödem\" (lymphedema), \"viros\" (virosis), \"opanmäles\" (reported to surgery, compound with abbreviation).",
        "We see that the average sentence length is around ten for all practices, where the shortest are found in rheumatology and the longest in infection.",
        "As the annotators were allowed to break up sentences into subclauses, but not required to, this led to a considerable difference in the total amount of annotations per annotator.",
        "In order to be able to analyze similarities and differences between the resulting annotations, all sentence level annotations were converted into one sentence class only, the primary class (defined as the first sentence level annotation class, i.e. if a sentence was broken into two clauses by an annotator, the first being certain and the second being uncertain, the final sentence level annotation class will be certain).",

        "We have presented an analysis of an initial annotation trial for the identification of uncertain sentences as well as for token level cues (speculative words) across different clinical practices.",
        "Our main findings are that IAA results for both sentence level annotations of uncertainty and token level annotations for speculative words are, on average, fairly low, with higher average agreement in geriatrics and rheumatology (see Figures 1 and 2).",
        "Moreover, by analyzing the individual distributions for the classes uncertain and speculative words, we find that neurology has the highest average amount of uncertain sentences, and cardiology the lowest.",
        "On average, the amount of uncertain sentences ranges between 9 and 12 percent, which is in line with previous work on sentence level annotations of uncertainty (see Section 2).",
        "We have also showed that the most common speculative words are unigrams, but that a substantial amount are ra-grams.",
        "The ra-grams are, however, often part of verb phrases, where the head is often the speculation cue.",
        "However, it is evident that speculative words are not always simple lexical units, i.e. syntactic information is potentially very useful.",
        "Question marks are the most common entities annotated as speculative words.",
        "Although these are not interesting indicators in themselves, it is interesting to note that they are very common in clinical documentation.",
        "From the relatively low IAA results we draw the conclusion that this task is difficult and requires more clearly defined guidelines.",
        "Moreover, using naive coders on clinical documentation is possibly not very useful if the resulting annotations are to be used in, e.g. a Text Mining application for medical researchers.",
        "Clinical documentation is highly domain-specific and contains a large amount of internal jargon, which requires judgements from clinicians.",
        "However, we find it interesting to note that we have identified differences between different clinical practices.",
        "A consensus corpus has been created from the resulting annotations, which has been used in an experiment for automatic classification, see Dalianis and Skeppstedt (2010) for initial results and evaluation.",
        "During discussions among the annotators, some specific problems were noted.",
        "For instance, the extracted sentences were not always about the patient or the current status or diagnosis, and in many cases an expression could describe (un)certainty of someone other than the author (e.g. another physician or a family member), introducing aspects of perspective.",
        "The sentences annotated as certain, are difficult to interpret, as they are simply not uncertain.",
        "We believe that it is important to introduce further dimensions, e.g. explicit certainty, and focus (what is (un)certain?",
        "), as well as time (e.g. current or past)."

      "text": [
        "To our knowledge, there is no previous research on annotating Swedish clinical text for sentence and token level uncertainty together with an analysis of the differences between different clinical practices.",
        "Although the initial IAA results are in general relatively low for all clinical practice groups, we have identified indications that neurology is a practice which has an above average amount of uncertain elements, and that geriatrics has a below average amount, as well as higher IAA.",
        "Both these disciplines would be interesting to continue the work on identifying speculative language.",
        "It is evident that clinical language contains a relatively high amount of uncertain elements, but it is also clear that naive coders are not optimal to use for interpreting the contents of EHRs.",
        "Moreover, more care needs to be taken in the extraction of sentences to be annotated, in order to ensure that the sentences actually describe reasoning about the patient status and diagnosis.",
        "For instance, instead of randomly extracting sentences from within a free text entry, it might be better to let the annotators judge all sentences within an entry This would also enable an analysis of whether speculative language is more or less frequent in specific parts of EHRs.",
        "From our findings, we plan to further develop the guidelines and particularly focus on specifying the minimal entities that should be annotated as speculative words (e.g. \"kan\" (could)).",
        "We also plan to introduce further levels of dimensionality in the annotation task, e.g. cues that indicate a high level of certainty, and to use domain experts as annotators.",
        "Although there are problematic issues regarding the use of naive coders for this task, we believe that our analysis has revealed some properties of speculative language in clinical text which enables us to develop a useful resource for further research in the area of speculative language.",
        "Judging an instance as being certain or uncertain is, perhaps, a task which can never exclude subjective interpretations.",
        "One interesting way of exploiting this fact would be to exploit individual annotations similar to the work presented in Reidsma and op den Akker (2008).",
        "Once we have finalized the annotated set, and ensured that no identifiable information is included, we plan to make this resource available for further research."
