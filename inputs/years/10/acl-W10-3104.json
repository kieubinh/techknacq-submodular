        "These narratives contain a variety of useful information that can support syndromic surveillance (Shapiro 2004), decision support (Fiszman et al.",
        "2000), and problem list generation (Sibanda et al.",
        "2006).",
        "Physicians often assert negative or speculative diagnoses in medical reports (Rao et al.",

        "The noun phrases (NP) associated with negative and speculative assertions in medical reports may be confused with positively asserted NPs, thereby adversely affecting automated classification system performance.",
        "In the medical domain, verbs often play a reduced role or are implied in assertions.",
        "We therefore focus our investigation of assertions on NPs.",

        "The NPDP identifies NPs which reference diseases in medical reports.",
        "We select 17 UMLS semantic types whose concepts can assist in the classification of diseases.",
        "First, NPDP maps NPs in the text to UMLS semantic types.",
        "If the mapped semantic type is one of the target semantic types, NPDP then tags the NP.",
        "NPDP uses the pre-UMLS negation phrases of Extended NegEx (Sibanda et al.",
        "2006) to identify adjectives indicating the absence or uncertainty of each tagged NPs.",
        "It differentiates these adjectives from all other adjectives modifying tagged NPs.",
        "For example, possible in possible reflux is excluded from the tagged NP, whereas severe in severe reflux is retained.",
        "We then identify the polarity of the assertion made on each NP.",
        "In order to distinguish the polarity of the assertions from one another, we do not modify the positive assertions, but transform the negative and speculative assertions in the following manner: Sentences containing negative assertions are repeated and modified with the NP pre-pended with \"abs\" (e.g., \"Patient denies fever.\"",
        "is repeated as \"Patient denies absfever.\").",
        "Similarly, sentences containing speculative assertions are repeated and modified with the NP pre-pended with \"poss\".",
