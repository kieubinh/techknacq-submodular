        "Despite ongoing efforts to codify knowledge, it is often communicated in an informal manner.",
        "In our choice of words and expressions, we implicitly or explicitly judge the certainty of the knowledge we wish to convey.",
        "This fact makes it possible to gauge the reliability of knowledge based on the subjective perspective of the author.",
        "As knowledge is often difficult to ascertain, it seems reasonable to regard knowledge on a continuum of varying degrees of certainty, as opposed to a binary (mis)conception.",
        "This corresponds to the notion of epistemic modality: the degree of confidence in, or commitment to, the truth of propositions (Hyland, 1998).",
        "Hedging is a means of affecting epistemic modality by qualifying propositions, realized through tentative words and expressions such as possibly and tends to.",
        "A holistic perspective on certainty – in which not only speculation is considered, but also signs of increased certainty – requires a classification into various levels.",
        "Applying such an approach to knowledge-intensive corpora, it may in due course be possible to evaluate unstructured, informal knowledge.",
        "This would not least be valuable to organizational knowledge management practices, where it could provide a rough indicator of reliability in internal knowledge audits."

        "Based on previous approaches and an extensive literature review, we propose a set of guidelines that (1) incorporates some new features and (2) shifts the perspective to suit knowledge-intensive corpora, e.g. comprising organizational knowledge documents.",
        "Besides categorization into levels of certainty, this approach distinguishes between two types of statement and underscores the need to take into account words and expressions that add certainty to a proposition.",
        "A small corpus of 10 World Bank documents – a publicly available resource known as Viewpoints (The World Bank Group, 2010) – is subsequently annotated in two sets by different annotators.",
        "The corpus is from a slightly different domain to those previously targeted and represents an adequate alternative to knowledge documents internal to an organization by fulfilling the criterion of knowledge intensity.",
        "The process is carried out in a Protégé plugin: Knowtator (Ogren, 2006).",
        "Pair-wise IAA, measured as F\\ -score, is calculated to evaluate the feasibility of the approach.",
        "Statements are annotated at the clause level, as sentences often contain subparts subject to different levels of certainty.",
        "These are not predefined and the span of classes is determined by the annotator.",
        "Furthermore, a distinction is made between different types of statement: statements that give an account of something, typically a report of past events, and statements that express concrete knowledge claims.",
        "The rationale behind this distinction is that text comprises statements that make more or less claims of constituting knowledge.",
        "Thus, knowledge claims – often less prevalent than accounts – should be given more weight in the overall assessment, as the application lies in automatically evaluating the reliability of informal knowledge.",
        "Assuming the view of knowledge and certainty as continuous, it is necessary to dis-cretize that into a number of intervals, albeit more than two.",
        "Hence, accounts and claims are categorized according to four levels of certainty: very certain, quite certain, quite uncertain and very uncertain.",
        "In addition to the statement classes, four indicators make up the total of twelve.",
        "We introduce certainty amplifiers, which have received little attention in previous work.",
        "These are linguistic features that add certainty to a statement, e.g. words like definitely and expressions like without a shadow of a doubt.",
        "Hedging indicators, on the other hand, have gained much attention recently and signify uncertainty.",
        "The source hedge class is applicable to instances where the source of epistemic judgement is stated explicitly, yet only when it provides a hedging function (e.g. some say).",
        "Modality strengtheners are features that strengthen the effect of epistemic modality when used in conjunction with other (un)certainty indicators – but alone do not signify any polarity orientation – and may be in the form of vagueness (e.g. <could be> around that number) or quantity gradations (e.g. very <sure>)."

        "There are likewise significant differences in the proportion between accounts and claims, as had been anticipated.",
        "Despite the problem of discriminating between accounts and claims, they seem to be susceptible to varying levels of certainty.",

        "These are especially interesting, as they have not been studied much before, although Wiebe et al.",

        "For exact matches in a single document, the Fi-score values range from an extremely low 0.09 to a somewhat higher – although still poor – 0.52, yielding an overall average of 0.28.",
        "These results clearly reflect the difficulty of the task, although one has to keep in mind the impact of the discrepancy in the number of annotations.",
        "This is partly reflected in the higher overall average for partial matches: 0.41.",
        "Certainty amplifiers and hedging indicators have Fi-scores that range up to 0.53 and 0.55 respectively (ditto for partial matches) in a single document.",
        "Over the entire corpus, however, the averages come down to 0.27 for certainty amplifiers (0.30 for partial matches) and 0.33 for hedging indicators (0.35 for partial matches).",
        "Given the poor results, we want to find out whether the main difficulty is presented by having to judge certainty according to four levels of certainty, or whether it lies in having to distinguish between types of statement.",
        "We therefore generalize the eight statement-related classes into a single division between accounts and claims.",
        "Naturally, the agreement is higher than for any single class, with 0.44 for the former and 0.41 for the latter.",
        "A substantial increase is seen in partial matches, with 0.70 for accounts and 0.55 for claims.",
        "The results are, however, sufficiently low to conclude that there were real difficulties in distinguishing between the two.",
        "We subsequently generalize the eight classes into four, according to their level of certainty alone.",
        "The results are again low: quite certain yields the highest agreement at 0.47 (0.76 for partial matches), followed by quite uncertain at 0.24 (0.35 for partial matches).",
        "These numbers suggest that this part of the task is likewise difficult.",

        "It is an existing and important phenomenon, although – like hedging indicators – difficult to judge.",

        "It is, of course, also applicable in a more general information extraction sense: information that is extracted from text needs to have a certainty indicator attached to it.",
