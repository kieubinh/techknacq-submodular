        "In line with the rapid accumulation of biological literature and the growing number of large-scale experiments in biomedicine, it is becoming more important to capture essential facts contained in the literature and storing them in form of biological annotations.",
        "Such annotations usually consist in structured database records, where biological entities of relevance, like genes or proteins are associated to controlled vocabularies that are useful to describe the most relevant aspects of these entities (their function, localization, processes or pathways they participate in or implications in diseases).",
        "Also specific types of relations between bio-entities (e.g. physical or regulatory interactions) are manually extracted from the literature.",
        "For biological interpretation and to determine the reliability of annotations it is crucial to capture both negative annotations, whether a given relation has been studied experimentally and does not occur, as well as to determine the experimental method used to study the bio-entity of interest.",
        "For instance, the value of in vitro generated results, or those obtained by large-scale experiments have a different significance compared to those generated in vivo.",
        "The most relevant biological annotations contained in databases and constructed manually by expert curators are linked to experimental qualifiers.",
        "Such experimental qualifiers can range from simple method terms to more sophisticated ontologies or hierarchical terminologies.",
        "Experimental qualifiers used to annotate biological entities are for instance provided by the Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interaction (PSI-MI) ontology, (Orchard S, Kerrien S., 2010) the Evidence Codes of Gene Ontology (GO) (Rogers MF, Ben-Hur A, 2010) or the Open REGulatory ANNOtation (ORegAnno) database Evidence Types."

        "There is an increasing interest to extract from the literature negative associations.",
        "For instance, one of the most popular biological annotation efforts, Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA), also supports the annotation of 'NOT' relations (associa-tion.is_not) to be able to represent these types of relations in their annotation data.",
        "In GO, such relations are labeled using 'NOT' in the qualifier column for a particular annotation.",
        "This negation qualifier is applied to provide an explicit note that the bio-entity is not associated with a given GO term.",
        "This is important when a GO term might otherwise be expected to apply to a bio-entity, but an experiment proves otherwise.",
        "Negative associations are also used when a cited reference explicitly states a negation event, e.g. in the form of: bio-entity X is not found in the location Y.",
        "In addition to annotation efforts there are a range of scenarios where extraction of negative events are of practical importance, these are described in the following subsections.",
        "A common setting in experimental biology is to use controls to avoid alternative explanations of results and to minimize experimental artifacts.",
        "Negative controls corroborate that the experimental outcome is not due to some sort of unrelated effect; it serves to minimize false positives and can serve as a background observation.",
        "The underlying assumption of negative controls is that one assumes in advance that the result should be negative, i.e. no significant effect should be obtained.",
        "Such negative controls are mainly expressed in the literature using negations.",
        "For instance in case of protein-protein interaction experiments, a negative control could be to demonstrate that a signal is only obtained when the two interactor proteins are present, and not when the label (tag-protein) alone is given to each interactor individually.",
        "To illustrate this aspect consider the example sentences provided below:",
        "• Our results show that, when AGG1 is present in the matrix, it shows a strong ability to bind 35S-labeledAGBl, whereas GST alone is not able to bind any detectable AGB1.",
        "• GST alone did not interact with FKHR even in the presence of E2 (Fig.",
        "2B, lane 5), indicating the specific interaction between ER and FKHR.",
        "• 35S-labeled in vitrotranslated FBXOll bound to immobilized GST-p53 (lane 3) but not GST alone (lane 2).",
        "• PRC bound to GST-RINCK1 (lane 2) but not to GST alone (lane 1), revealing that PRC binds to RINCK directly.",
        "In those example cases, GST (alone) would represent the negative control.",
        "Only in presence of the interactor proteins a signal should be observed, if GST alone is present the assumption is that no signal should be obtained.",
        "Negative controls are crucial for interpretation of the actual experimental outcome.",
        "A considerable effort is being made to detect genes and mutations in genes that have implications in the susceptibility of complex disorders.",
        "Naturally occurring variations in the sequence of genes, often called polymorphisms might have a deleterious, protective or no associations at all to a pathologic condition.",
        "Not only to capture deleterious and protective mutations, but also those that do not have any effect is important to aid in the interpretation of mutations observed in patients.",
        "This is especially true taking into account the increasing use of molecular screening technologies and personalized medicine in the clinical domain.",
        "Example cases of negative associations between genes and mutations to disease conditions derived from PubMed abstracts can be seen below:",
        "• CC16 gene may be not a susceptibility gene of asthmatic patients of Han population in southwest China.",
        "• The FZD3 gene might not play a role in conferring susceptibility to major psychosis in our sample.",
        "• Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism is not a strong risk factor for diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Type I diabetes: case-control study.",
        "• In view of this evidence, it is likely that the SIGMAR1 gene does not confer susceptibility to schizophrenia.",
        "• Thus, this SNP in the PGIS gene is not associated with EH.",
        "• The gene encoding GABBR1 is not associated with childhood absence epilepsy in the Chinese Han population.",
        "• We did not find an association between OCD, family history for OCD, and the COMT gene polymorphism.",
        "Such negative associations can be useful for the interpretation of relevance of genes for certain conditions, enabling filtering un-relevant genes and improving target selection for more detailed molecular examinations.",
        "A simplified view of toxicology experiments is to distinguish, given the administration of different amounts of a specific compound or drug (e.g. low, medium and high dosage) during predefined time spans, between toxic and non-toxic effects.",
        "Such effects can be examined in animal models like rats or mini-pigs by examining a series of aspects, such as hematological parameters, organ histological properties (tissue alterations and size of organs), biochemical parameters, and changes in food/water consumption or fertility.",
        "Usually animals to which specific amounts of the compound has been administered are compared to control cases.",
        "Here it is important to determine also three kinds of negative associations: (1) under which conditions a given parameter or tissue has not been negatively affected (save dosage, non-toxic), (2) which compound did not show the desired beneficial effect (e.g. was not effective in treating the pathologic condition) and (3) under which administration conditions a compound was not save.",
        "Example sentences illustrating these negative associations are:",
        "• Morphological evaluation showed that 1-BP did not cause morphological changes in seminiferous epithelium, but 2-BP treatment resulted in the disappearance of spermatogonia, atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and degeneration of germ cells..",
        "• This is an indication that the extracts may not be completely safe in male rats when continuously administered for 14days.",
        "• Histopathologic analysis of the vital organs revealed no significant lesions in the brain, liver, kidney, heart, spleen, ovary, and testis.",
        "• The extract did not produce any significant (P>0.05) changes in the mean concentrations of urea, creatinine, Na+, K+, and Gliom of rats in the extract treated groups compared to that of control.",
        "In order to characterize certain biological associations, it is a common practice to alter the bio-entity of interest, with the assumption that a given observation should change upon alteration.",
        "This is the case of mutations or deletions experimentally introduced to gene or protein sequences, with the underlying assumption that the mutated or truncated protein/gene should loose it ability to bind or regulate another bio-entity, or even be nonfunctional.",
        "Such mutations are useful to pin down the actual biologically relevant functional parts of bio-entities, which are usually of great therapeutic importance (as target sites to inhibit certain bio-entities or interactions).",
        "Such cases can be seen in the example sentences provided below:",
        "• Accordingly, this p73 N-terminal deletion was unable to activate transcription or to induce apoptosis.",
        "• The G62D mutant did not bind AMP at all.",
        "• The resulting mutant SOS3 protein was not able to interact with the SOS2 protein kinase and was less capable of activating it.",
        "• MYB4 did not localize to the nucleus in the sad2 mutant, suggesting that SAD2 is required for MYB4 nuclear trafficking.",
        "In these example cases, altered bio-entities did not display the biological function of their wild type (unaltered) counterparts."

        "Biological annotation efforts are primarily concerned about experimentally confirmed events.",
        "Despite the importance of experimental qualifiers, only limited effort has been made to construct comprehensive resources to retrieve assertions that have experimental support and to construct useful lexical resources and thesauri of experimental evidence techniques.",
        "To detect novel protein interactions that have been experimentally characterized in the biomedical literature was one of the tasks posed in the BioCreative challenge, a community effort to assess text-mining tools developed for the biomedical domain (Krallinger M, et al., 2008).",

        "• was cue by METHOD",
        "• cue (in|by|here by|using\\via\\with) METHOD",
        "Applying such patterns can be useful to construct automatically an experimental technique dictionary that can be handcrafted to enrich existing evidential qualifier resources.",
        "Nevertheless, linking automatically extracted experiment terms to controlled vocabularies used for annotation in biology is still a challenging task that need more manually labeled textual data.",
        "Some example sentences illustrating the usefulness of experimental evidence cues can be seen below:",
