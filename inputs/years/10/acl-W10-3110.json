        "The automatic detection of the scope of linguistic negation is a problem encountered in wide variety of document understanding tasks, including but not limited to medical data mining, general fact or relation extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis.",
        "This paper describes an approach to negation scope detection in the context of sentiment analysis, particularly with respect to sentiment expressed in online reviews.",
        "The canonical need for proper negation detection in sentiment analysis can be expressed as the fundamental difference in semantics inherent in the phrases, \"this is great,\" versus, \"this is not great.\"",
        "Unfortunately, expressions of negation are not always so syntactically simple.",
        "Linguistic negation is a complex topic: there are many forms of negation, ranging from the use of explicit cues such as \"no\" or \"not\" to much more subtle linguistic patterns.",
        "At the highest structural level, negations may occur in two forms (Givön, 1993): morphological negations, where word roots are modified with a negating prefix (e.g., \"dis-\", \"non-\", or \"un-\") or suffix (e.g., \"-less\"), and syntactic negation, where clauses are negated using explicitly negating words or other syntactic patterns that imply negative semantics.",
        "For the purposes of negation scope detection, only syntactic negations are of interest, since the scope of any morphological negation is restricted to an individual word.",
        "Morphological negations are very important when constructing lexicons, which is a separate but related research topic.",
        "Tottie (1991) presents a comprehensive taxonomy of clausal English negations, where each form represents unique challenges for a negation scope detection system.",
        "The top-level negation categories - denials, rejections, imperatives, questions, supports, and repetitions - can be described as follows:",
        "• Denials are the most common form and are typically unambiguous negations of a particular clause, such as, \"There is no question that the service at this restaurant is excellent,\" or, \"The audio system on this television is not very good, but the picture is amazing.\"",
        "• Rejections often occur in discourse, where one participant rejects an offer or suggestion of another, e.g., \"Can I get you anything else?",
        "No.\"",
        "However, rejections may appear in expository text where a writer explicitly rejects a previous supposition or expectation, for instance, \"Given the poor reputation of the manufacturer, I expected to be disappointed with the device.",
        "This was not the case.\"",
        "• Imperatives involve directing an audience",
        "away from a particular action, e.g., \"Do not neglect to order their delicious garlic bread.\"",
        "• Questions, rhetorical or otherwise, can indicate negations often in the context of surprise or bewilderment.",
        "For example, a reviewer of a desk phone may write, \"Why couldn't they include a decent speaker in this phone?",
        "\", implying that the phone being reviewed does not have a decent speaker.",
        "• Supports and Repetitions are used to express agreement and add emphasis or clarity, respectively, and each involve multiple expressions of negation.",
        "For the purpose of negation scope detection, each instance of negation in a support or repetition can be isolated and treated as an independent denial or imperative.",
        "Tottie also distinguishes between intersenten-tial and sentential negation.",
        "In the case of inter-sentential negation, the language used in one sentence may explicitly negate a proposition or implication found in another sentence.",
        "Rejections and supports are common examples of intersentential negation.",
        "Sentential negation, or negations within the scope of a single sentence, are much more frequent; thus sentential denials, imperatives, and questions are the primary focus of the work presented here.",
        "The goal of the present work is to develop a system that is robust to differences in the intended scope of negation introduced by the syntactic and lexical features in each negation category.",
        "In particular, as the larger context of this research involves sentiment analysis, it is desirable to construct a negation system that can correctly identify the presence or absence of negation in spans of text that are expressions of sentiment.",
        "It so follows that in developing a solution for the specific case of the negation of sentiment, the proposed system is also effective at solving the general case of negation scope identification.",
        "This rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "§2 presents related work on the topic of automatic detection of the scope of linguistic negations.",
        "The annotated corpora used to evaluate the proposed negation scope identification method are presented in §3, including a new data set developed for the purpose of identifying negation scopes in the context of online reviews.",
        "§4 describes the proposed negation scope detection system.",
        "The novel system is evaluated in §5 in terms of raw results on the annotated negation corpora as well as the performance improvement on sentiment classification achieved by incorporating the negation system in a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis pipeline.",

        "A recent study by Nakagawa et al.",
        "(2010) developed an semi-supervised model for sub-sentential sentiment analysis that predicts polarity based on the interactions between nodes in dependency graphs, which potentially can induce the scope of negation.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the goal of this work is to define a system that can identify exactly the scope of negation in free text, which requires a robustness to the wide variation of negation expression, both syntactic and lexical.",
        "Thus, this work is complimentary to those mentioned above in that we are measuring not only whether negation detection is useful for sentiment, but to what extent we can determine its exact scope in the text.",
        "Towards this end in we describe both an annotated negation span corpus as well as a negation span detector that is trained on the corpus.",
        "The span detector is based on conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira, 2001), which is a structured prediction learning framework common in sub-sentential natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis (Choi and Cardie, 2007; McDonald et al., 2007)",
        "The approach presented here resembles work by Morante and Daelemans (2009), who used IGTree to predict negation cues and a CRF metalearner that combined input from k-nearest neighbor classification, a support vector machine, and another underlying CRF to predict the scope of negations within the BioScope corpus.",
        "However, our work represents a simplified approach that replaces machine-learned cue prediction with a lexicon of explicit negation cues, and uses only a single CRF to predict negation scopes, with a more comprehensive model that includes features from a dependency parser."

        "In addition to measuring the raw performance of the negation scope detection system, an experiment was conducted to measure the effect of the final negation system within the context of a larger sentiment analysis system.",

        "The sentiment detection system in stage 2 finds and scores mentions of n-grams found in a large lexicon of sentiment terms and phrases.",
        "The sentiment lexicon is based on recent work using label propagation over a very large distributional similarity graph derived from the web (Velikovich et al., 2010), and applies positive or negative scores to terms such as \"good\", \"bad\", or \"just what the doctor ordered\".",
        "The sentence scoring system in stage 4 then determines whether any scored sentiment terms fall within the scope of a negation, and flips the sign of the sentiment score for all negated sentiment terms.",
        "The scoring system then sums all sentiment scores within each sentence and computes overall sentence sentiment scores.",
        "A sample of English-language online reviews was collected, containing a total of 1135 sentences.",
        "Human raters were presented with consecutive sentences and asked to classify each sentence",
        "Figure 1 : Precision-recall curve showing the effect of negation detection on positive sentiment prediction.",
        "as expressing one of the following types of sentiment: 1) positive, 2) negative, 3) neutral, or 4) mixed positive and negative.",
        "Each sentence was reviewed independently by five separate raters, and final sentence classification was determined by consensus.",
        "Of the original 1135 sentences 216, or 19%, were found to contain negations.",
        "The effect of the negation system on sentiment classification was evaluated on the smaller subset of 216 sentences in order to more precisely measure the impact of negation detection.",
        "The smaller negation subset contained 73 sentences classified as positive, 114 classified as negative, 12 classified as neutral, and 17 classified as mixed.",
        "The number of sentences classified as neutral or mixed was too small for a useful performance measurement, so only sentences classified as positive or negative sentences were considered.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show the precision-recall curves for sentences predicted by the sentiment analysis system to be positive and negative, respectively.",
        "The curves indicate relatively low performance, which is consistent with the fact that sentiment polarity detection is notoriously difficult on sentences with negations.",
        "The solid lines show performance with the negation scope detection system in place, and the dashed lines show performance with no negation detection at all.",
        "From the figures, a significant improvement is immediately apparent at all recall levels.",
        "It can also be inferred from the figures that the sentiment analysis system is significantly biased towards positive predictions: even though there were significantly more sentences classified by human raters as neg-",
        "Figure 2: Precision-recall curve showing the effect of negation detection on negative sentiment prediction.",
        "Table 5: Sentiment classification results, showing the percentage improvement obtained from including negation scope detection (w/ Neg.)",
        "over results obtained without including negation scope detection (w/o Neg.",
        ").",
        "ative, the number of data points for positive predictions far exceeds the number of negative predictions, with or without negation detection.",
        "The overall results are presented in Table 5, separated by positive and negative class predictions.",
        "As expected, performance is improved dramatically by introducing negation scope detection.",
        "The precision ofpositive sentiment predictions sees the largest improvement, largely due to the inherent bias in the sentiment scoring algorithm.",
        "F1 scores for positive and negative sentiment predictions improve by 29.5% and 11.4%, respectively.",
        "of a conditional random field model informed by a dependency parser.",
        "Results were presented on the standard BioScope corpus that compare favorably to the best results reported to date, using a software stack that is significantly simpler than the best-performing approach.",
        "A new data set was presented that targets the domain of online product reviews.",
        "The product review corpus represents a departure from the standard BioScope corpus in two distinct dimensions: the reviews corpus contains diverse common and vernacular language patterns rather than professional prose, and also presents a divergent method for annotating negations in text.",
        "Cross-training by learning a model on one corpus and testing on another suggests that scope boundary detection in the product reviews corpus may be a more difficult learning problem, although the method used to annotate the reviews corpus may result in a more consistent representation of the problem.",
        "Finally, the negation system was built into a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis system in order to measure the practical impact of accurate negation scope detection, with dramatic results.",
        "The negation system improved the precision ofpositive sentiment polarity detection by 35.9% and negative sentiment polarity detection by 46.8%.",
        "Error reduction on the recall measure was less dramatic, but still significant, showing improved recall for positive polarity of 20.0% and improved recall for negative polarity of6.6%.",
        "Future research will include treatment of implicit negation cues, ideally by learning to predict the presence of implicit negation using a probabilistic model that generates meaningful confidence scores.",
        "A related topic to be addressed is the automatic detection of sarcasm, which is an important problem for proper sentiment analysis, particularly in open web domains where language is vernacular.",
        "Additionally, we would like to tackle the problem ofinter-sentential negations, which could involve a natural extension of negation scope detection through co-reference resolution, such that negated pronouns trigger negations in text surrounding their pronoun antecedents."
