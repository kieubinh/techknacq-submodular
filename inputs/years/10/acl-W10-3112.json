        "The ability to recognise high-level information (or meta-knowledge) relating to the interpretation of texts is an important task for text mining systems.",
        "There are several types of metaknowledge that fall under this category.",
        "For example, the detection of expressions of speculation and negation is important across all domains, although the way in which these phenomena are expressed may be domain-specific.",
        "In scientific texts, it is also important to be able to determine other types of information, such as the author's rhetorical/pragmatic intent (de Waard et al., 2009).",
        "This would correspond to whether the information expressed represents a hypothesis, accepted knowledge, new experimental knowledge, etc.",
        "The ability to distinguish between these different types of information can be important for tasks such as building and updating models of biological processes, like pathways (Oda et al., 2008), and curation of biological databases (Ashburner et al., 2000).",
        "Central to both of these tasks is the identification of new knowledge that can enhance these resources, e.g. to build upon an existing, but incomplete model of a biological process (Lisacek et al., 2005) or to ensure that the database is kept up to date.",
        "Any new knowledge added should be supported though evidence, which could include linking hypotheses with experimental findings.",
        "It is also important to take into account inconsistencies and contradictions reported in the literature.",
        "The production of annotated corpora can help to train text mining systems to recognise types of meta-knowledge, such as the above.",
        "Although a number of such corpora have already been produced, different annotation schemes are required according to the exact domain under consideration, as well as the types of task that will be undertaken by the text mining system.",
        "The work described in this paper is focused on the design and evaluation of the meta-knowledge annotation scheme described in Nawaz et al., (2010).",
        "The annotation scheme has been specifically designed to recognise a range of metaknowledge types for events extracted from biomedical texts (henceforth bio-events).",
        "The aim is to facilitate the development of more useful systems in the context of various biomedical information extraction (IE) and textual inference (TI) tasks.",
        "Although the scheme has been designed for application to existing bio-event corpora, it is intended to be applied to any type of bio-relation corpora, and can easily be tailored for other types of relations/events within the domain.",
        "Searching for relevant information in electronic documents is most commonly carried out by entering keywords into a search engine.",
        "However, such searches will normally return a huge number of documents, many of which will be irrelevant to the user's needs.",
        "A more promising and efficient way of searching is over events that have been extracted from texts through the application of natural language processing methods.",
        "An event is a structured representation of a certain piece of information contained within the text, which is usually anchored to a particular word in the text (typically a verb or noun) that is central to the description of the event.",
        "Events are often represented by a template-like structure with slots that are filled by the event participants.",
        "Each event participant is also assigned a role within the event.",
        "These participants can be entities, concepts or even other events.",
        "This kind of event representation allows the information contained in a text to be represented as a collection of nested events.",
        "A bio-event is an event specialised for the biomedical domain.",
        "Kim et al.",
        "(2008) define a bio-event as a dynamic bio-relation involving one or more participants.",
        "These participants can be bio-entities or (other) bio-events, and are each assigned a semantic role/slot like theme and cause etc.",
        "Each bio-event is typically assigned a type/class from a chosen bio-event taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the GENIA Event Ontology (Kim et al., 2008).",
        "Similarly, the bio-entities are also assigned types/classes from a chosen bio-term taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000).",
        "As an example, consider the simple sentence shown in Figure 1.",
        "The results suggest that the narL gene product activates the nitrate reductase operon.",
        "EVENT-TRIGGER: activates EVENT-TYPE: positive_regulation THEME: nitrate reductase operon: operon CAUSE: narL gene product: protein",
        "lation to be assigned.",
        "The event has two slots, i.e. theme and cause whose labels help to characterise the contribution that the slot filler makes towards the meaning of the event.",
        "In this case, the slots are filled by the subject and object of the verb activates, both of which correspond to different types of bio-entities (i.e. operon and protein).",
        "IE systems trained to extract bio-events from texts allow users to formulate semantic queries over the extracted events.",
        "Such queries can specify semantic restrictions on the events in terms of event types, semantic role labels and named entity types etc.",
        "(Miyao et al., 2006), in addition to particular keywords.",
        "For example, it would be possible to search only for those texts containing bio-events of type nega-tive_regulation where the cause is an entity of type protein.",
        "Such queries provide a great deal more descriptive power than traditional keyword searches over unstructured documents.",
        "Biomedical corpora that have been manually annotated with event level information (e.g., Pyysalo et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2009) facilitate the training of systems such as those described above.",
        "Whilst event-based querying has advantages for efficient searching, the extracted events have little practical use if they are not accompanied by meta-knowledge information to aid in their interpretation.",
        "Various corpora of biomedical literature (abstracts and/or full papers) have been produced that feature some degree of meta-knowledge annotation.",
        "These corpora vary in both the richness of the annotation added, and the type/size of the units at which the meta-knowledge annotation has been performed.",
        "Taking the unit of annotation into account, we can distinguish between annotations that apply to continuous text-spans, and annotations that have been performed at the event level.",
        "Text-Span Annotation: Such annotations have mostly been carried out at the sentence level.",
        "They normally concentrate on a single aspect (or",
        "This sentence contains a single bio-event, anchored to the verb activates.",
        "Figure 2 shows a typical structured representation of this bioevent.",
        "The fact that the verb is anchored to the verb activates allows the event-type of positive regu- dimension) of meta-knowledge, normally either speculation/certainty level, (e.g., Light et al., 2004; Medlock & Briscoe, 2007; Vincze et al., 2008) or general information content/rhetorical intent, e.g., background, methods, results, insights.",
        "This latter type of annotation has been attempted both on abstracts, (e.g., McKnight & Srinivasan, 2003; Ruch et al., 2007) and full papers, (e.g. Teufel et al., 1999; Langer et al., 2004; Mizuta & Collier, 2004), with the number of distinct annotation categories varying between 4 and 14.",
        "Despite the availability of these corpora, annotation at the sentence level can often be too granular.",
        "In terms of information content, a sentence may describe, for example, both an experimental method and its results.",
        "The situation becomes more complicated if a sentence contains an expression of speculation.",
        "If this is only marked at the sentence level, there may be confusion about which part(s) of the sentence are affected by the speculative expression.",
        "Certain corpora and associated systems have attempted to address these issues.",
        "The BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) annotates the scopes of negative and speculative keywords, whilst Morante & Daelemans (2009) have trained a system to undertake this task.",
        "The scheme described by Wilbur et al.",
        "(2006) applies annotation to fragments of sentences, which are created on the basis of changes in the meta-knowledge expressed.",
        "The scheme consists of multiple annotation dimensions which capture aspects of both certainty and rhetorical/pragmatic intent, amongst other things.",
        "Training a system to automatically annotate these dimensions is shown to be highly feasible (Shatkay et al., 2008).",
        "Event-Level Annotation: Explicit annotation of meta-knowledge at the event-level is currently rather minimal within biomedical corpora.",
        "Whilst several corpora contain annotations to distinguish positive and negative events (e.g. Sanchez-Graillet & Poesio, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007), the annotation of the GENIA Event Corpus (Kim et al., 2008) is slightly more extensive, in that it additionally annotates certainty level.",
        "To our knowledge, no existing bio-event corpus has attempted annotation that concerns rhetorical/pragmatic intent.",
        "1.3 The Need for an Event-Centric MetaKnowledge Annotation Scheme",
        "In comparison to meta-knowledge annotation carried out at the text-span level, the amount of annotation carried out at the event level is quite sparse.",
        "The question thus arises as to whether it is possible to use systems trained on text-span annotated corpora to assign meta-knowledge to bio-events, or whether new annotation at the event level is required.",
        "Some corpora seem better suited to this purpose than others - whilst sentence-level annotations are certainly too granular for an event-centric view of the text, sentence fragments, such as those identified by Wilbur et al.",
        "(2006), are likely to correspond more closely to the extent of text that describes an event and its slots.",
        "Likewise, knowing the scopes of negative and speculative keywords within a sentence may be a useful aid in determining whether they affect the interpretation of a particular event.",
        "However, the information provided in these corpora is still not sufficiently precise for eventlevel meta-knowledge annotation.",
        "Even within a text fragment, there may be several different bioevents, each with slightly different metaknowledge interpretations.",
        "In a similar way, not all events that occur within the scope of a negation or speculation keyword are necessarily affected by it.",
        "Based on these observations, we have developed a meta-knowledge annotation scheme that is specifically tailored to bio-events.",
        "Our scheme annotates various different aspects or dimensions of meta-knowledge.",
        "A close examination of a large number of relevant bio-events has resulted in a scheme that has some similarities to previously proposed schemes, but has a number of differences that seem especially relevant when dealing with events, e.g. the annotation of the manner of the event.",
        "The scheme is intended to be general enough to allow integration with existing bio-event annotation schemes, whilst being detailed enough to capture important subtleties in the nature of the meta-knowledge expressed about the event.",
        "Most of the existing corpora mentioned above annotate text spans or events with particular categories (e.g. certainty level or general information type) in different meta-knowledge dimensions.",
        "However, what they do not normally do is to annotate lexical clues or keywords used to determine the correct values.",
        "A number of previous studies have demonstrated the importance of lexical markers (i.e., words or phrases) that can accompany statements in scientific articles in determining the intended interpretation of the text (e.g. Hyland, 1996; Ri-zomilioti 2006).",
        "We also performed a similar study (Thompson et al., 2008) although, in contrast to other studies, we took a multidimensional approach to the categorisation of such lexical items, acknowledging that several types of important information may be expressed through different words in the same sentence.",
        "As an example, let us consider the example sentence in Figure 3.",
        "The DNA-binding properties of mutations at positions 849 and 668 may indicate that the catalytic role of these side chains is associated with their interaction with the DNA substrate.",
        "The author's pragmatic/rhetorical intent towards the statement that the catalytic role of these side chains is associated with their interaction with the DNA substrate is encoded by the word indicate, which shows that the statement represents an analysis of the evidence stated at the beginning of the sentence, i.e., that the mutations at positions 849 and 668 have DNA-binding properties.",
        "Furthermore, the author's certainty level (i.e., their degree of confidence) towards this analysis is shown by the word may.",
        "Here, the author is uncertain about the validity of their analysis.",
        "Whilst our previous work served to demonstrate that the different aspects of metaknowledge that can be specified lexically within texts require a multidimensional analysis to correctly capture their subtleties, it showed that the presence of particular lexical items is not the only important feature for determining metaknowledge categories.",
        "In particular, their presence does not guarantee that the \"expected\" interpretation can be assumed (Sândor, 2007).",
        "In addition, not all types of meta-knowledge are indicated through explicit markers.",
        "Mizuta & Collier (2004) note that rhetorical zones may be indicated not only through explicit lexical markers, but also through features such as the main verb in the clause and the position of the sentence within the article or abstract.",
        "For these reasons, we perform annotation on all relevant instances, regardless of the presence of lexical markers.",
        "This will allow systems to be trained that can learn to determine the correct meta-knowledge category, even when lexical markers are not present.",
        "However, due to the proven importance of lexical markers in determining certain meta-knowledge dimensions, our annotation scheme annotates such markers, whenever they are present.",
        "Annotation Scheme",
        "The annotation scheme we present here is a slightly modified version of our original metaknowledge annotation scheme (Nawaz et al., 2010).",
        "The modified scheme consists of five meta-knowledge dimensions, each with a set of complete and mutually-exclusive categories, i.e., any given bio-event belongs to exactly one category in each dimension.",
        "Our chosen set of annotation dimensions has been motivated by the major information needs of biologists discussed earlier, i.e., the ability to distinguish between different intended interpretations of events.",
        "In order to minimise the annotation burden, the number of possible categories within each dimension has been kept as small as possible, whilst still respecting important distinctions in meta-knowledge that have been observed during our corpus study.",
        "The advantage of using a multidimensional scheme is that the interplay between different values of each dimension can reveal both subtle and substantial differences in the types of metaknowledge expressed in the surrounding text.",
        "Therefore, in most cases, the exact rhetorical/pragmatic intent of an event can only be determined by considering a combination of the values of different dimensions.",
        "This aspect of our scheme is further discussed in section 3.",

        "Hyper-Dimensions Certainty Level Class / Type",
        "Figure 4 provides an overview of the annotation scheme.",
        "The boxes with the light-coloured (grey) background correspond to information that is common to most bio-event annotation schemes, i.e., the participants in the event, together with an indication of the class or type of the event.",
        "The boxes with the darker (green) backgrounds correspond to our proposed metaknowledge annotation dimensions and their possible values.",
        "The remainder of this section provides brief details of each annotation dimension.",
        "This dimension is responsible for capturing the general information content of the event.",
        "Whilst less detailed than some of the previously proposed sentence-level schemes, its purpose is to form the basis of distinguishing between the most critical types of rhetorical/pragmatic intent, according to the needs of biologists.",
        "Each event is thus classified into one of the following four categories:",
        "Investigation: Enquiries or investigations, which have either already been conducted or are planned for the future, typically marked by lexical clues like examined, investigated and studied, etc.",
        "Observation: Direct observations, often represented by lexical clues like found, observed and report, etc.",
        "Simple past tense sentences typically also describe observations.",
        "Such events represent experimental knowledge.",
        "Analysis: Inferences, interpretations, speculations or other types of cognitive analysis, typically expressed by lexical clues like suggest, indicate, therefore and conclude etc.",
        "Such events, if they are interpretations or reliable inferences based on experimental results, can also constitute another type of (indirect) experimental knowledge.",
        "Weaker inferences or speculations, however, may be considered as hypotheses which need further proof through experiments.",
        "General: Scientific facts, processes, states or methodology.",
        "This is the default category for the knowledge type dimension.",
        "The value of this dimension is almost always indicated through the presence/absence of an explicit lexical marker.",
        "In scientific literature, it is normally only applicable to events whose KT corresponds either to Analysis or General.",
        "In the case of Analysis events, CL encodes confidence in the truth of the event, whilst for General events, there is a temporal aspect, to account for cases where a particular process is explicitly stated to occur most (but not all) of the time, using a marker such as normally, or only occasionally, using a marker like sometimes.",
        "Events corresponding to direct Observations are not open to judgements of certainty, nor are Investigation events, which refer to things which have not yet happened or have not been verified.",
        "Regarding the choice of values for the CL dimension, there is an ongoing discussion as to whether it is possible to partition the epistemic scale into discrete categories (Rubin, 2007).",
        "However, the use of a number of distinct categories is undoubtedly easier for annotation purposes and has been proposed in a number of previous schemes.",
        "Although recent work has suggested the use of four or more categories (Shat-kay et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2008), our initial analysis of bio-event corpora has shown that only three levels of certainty seem readily distinguishable for bio-events.",
        "This is in line with Hoye (1997), whose analysis of general English showed that there are at least three articulated points on the epistemic scale.",
        "We have chosen to use numerical values for this dimension, in order to reduce potential annotator confusions or biases that may be introduced through the use of labels corresponding to particular lexical markers of each category, such as probable or possible, and also to account for the fact that slightly different interpretations apply to the different levels, according to whether the event has a KT value of Analysis or General.",
        "L3: No expression of uncertainty or speculation (default category) L2: High confidence or slight speculation.",
        "L1: Low confidence or considerable speculation; typical lexical markers include may, might and perhaps.",
        "The source of experimental evidence provides important information for biologists.",
        "This is demonstrated by its annotation during the creation of the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) and in the corpus created by Wilbur et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "The Source dimension can also help in distinguishing new experimental knowledge from previously reported knowledge.",
        "Our scheme distinguishes two categories, namely: Other: The event is attributed to a previous study.",
        "In this case, explicit clues (citations or phrases like previous studies etc.)",
        "are normally present.",
        "Current: The event makes an assertion that can be (explicitly or implicitly) attributed to the current study.",
        "This is the default category, and is assigned in the absence of explicit lexical or contextual clues.",
        "This dimension identifies negated events.",
        "Although certain bio-event corpora are annotated with this information, it is still missing from others.",
        "The indication of whether an event is negated is vital, as the interpretation of a negated event instance is completely opposite to the interpretation of a non-negated (positive) instance of the same event.",
        "We define negation as the absence or non-existence of an entity or a process.",
        "Negation is typically expressed by the adverbial not and the nominal no.",
        "However, other lexical devices like negative affixals (un- and in-, etc.",
        "), restrictive verbs (fail, lack, and unable, etc.",
        "), restrictive nouns (exception, etc.",
        "), certain adjectives (independent, etc.",
        "), and certain adverbs (without, etc.)",
        "can also be used.",
        "Events may be accompanied by a word or phrase which provides an indication of the rate, level, strength or intensity of the interaction.",
        "We refer to this as the Manner of the event.",
        "Information regarding manner is absent from the majority of existing bio-event corpora, but yet the presence of such words can be significant in the correct interpretation of the event.",
        "Our scheme distinguishes 3 categories of Manner, namely: High: Typically expressed by adverbs and adjectives like strongly, rapidly and high, etc.",
        "Low: Typically expressed by adverbs and adjectives like weakly, slightly and slow, etc.",

        "Similarly, we found that around 20% of corpus events belong to speculative sentences.",
        "Since speculative sentences contain non-speculative events as well, the frequency of speculative events is expected to be much less than the frequency of speculative sentences.",
        "In accordance with this hypothesis, we found that only 7% of corpus events were expressed with some degree of speculation.",
        "We also found that almost all speculated events had explicit lexical clues.",
        "Polarity: Our event-centric view of negation showed just above 3% of the events to be negated.",
        "Similarly to speculation, the expected frequency of negated events is lower than the frequency of negated sentences.",
        "Another reason for finding fewer negated events is the fact that, in contrast to previous schemes, we draw a distinction between events that are negated and events expressed with Low manner.",
        "For example, certain words like limited and barely are often considered as negation clues.",
        "However, we consider them as clues for Low manner.",
        "In all cases, negation was expressed through explicit lexical clues.",
        "Manner: Whilst only a small fraction (4%) of events contains an indication of Manner, we found that where present, manner conveys vital information about the event.",
        "Our results also revealed that indications of High manner are three times more frequent than the indications of Low manner.",
        "We also noted that both High and Low manners were always indicated through the use of explicit clues.",
