        "Sejong Electronic Dictionaries (SJD) for nouns and predicates (verbs and adjectives) along with semantic classes (Hong 2007) were developed for syntactic and semantic analysis, but the current versions do not contain enough entries for concrete applications, and they show inconsistency problem.",

        "The primary goal of our recent work including the work reported in this paper is to build a language resource, which will improve Korean semantico-syntactic parsing technology.",

        "To find common clues from lexical information among those language resources is important process in automatic mapping method.",
        "Our proposed automatic mapping method with three approaches shows notable performances by comparing with other studies on automatic mapping among language resources: recall 0.837, precision 0.717 and F1 0.773.",
        "Therefore, from those studies, we can improve Korean seman-tico-syntactic parsing technology by integrating the argument structures as provided by SJD, and the lexical-semantic hierarchy as provided by KorLex.",
        "In addition, we can enrich three resources: KorLex, SJD and STD as results of comparing and integrating them.",
        "We expect to improve automatic mapping technology among other Korean language resources through this study.",
