        "Semantic parsing is important in natural language processing, and it has attracted an increasing number of studies in recent years.",
        "Currently, its most important aspect is the formalization of the proposition meaning of one sentence through the semantic role labeling.",
        "Therefore, many large human-annotated corpora have been constructed to support related research, such as",
        "FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Kings-bury and Palmer, 2002), NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004), and so on.",
        "On this basis, several international semantic evaluations have been organized, which include Senseval 3 (Litkowski, 2004), 2008 (Surdeanu et al., 2008), CoNLL 2009 (Hajic et al., 2009), and so on.",
        "The first SRL model on FrameNet was proposed by Gildea and Jurafsky(2002).",
        "The model consists of two subtasks of boundary identification^) and semantic role classification(SRC).",
        "Both subtasks were implemented on the pretreatment results of the full parsing tree.",
        "Many lexical and syntactic features were extracted to improve the accuracy of the model.",
        "On the test data of FrameNet, the system achieved 65% precision and 61% recall.",
        "Most works on SRL followed Gildea's framework of processing the SRL task on English FrameNet and PropBank.",
        "They built their model on the full parse tree and selected features using various machine learning methods to improve the accuracy of SRL models.",
        "Many attempts have made significant progress, ssuch as the works of and so on.",
        "Other researchers regarded the task of SRL as a sequential tagging problem and employed the shallow chunking technique to solve it, as described by Marquez at al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Although the SRL model based on a full parse tree has good performance in English, this method of processing is not available in other languages, especially in Chinese.",
        "A systemic study of Chinese SRL was done by Xue et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Like the English SRL procedure, he removed many uncorrelated constituents of a parse tree and relied on the remainder to identify the semantic roles using the maximum entropy model.",
        "When human-corrected parse is used, the F-measures on the PropBank and NomBank achieve 92.0 and 69.6%, respectively.",
        "However, when automatic full parse is used, the F-measures only achieve 71.9 and 60.4%, respectively.",
        "This significant decrease prompts us to analyze its causes and to find a potential solution.",
        "First, the Chinese human-annotated resources of semantic roles are relatively small.",
        "Sun and Gildea only studied the SRL of 10 Chinese verbs and extracted 1,138 sentences in the Chinese Tree Bank.",
        "The size of the Chinese PropBank and Chinese NomBank used in the paper of Xue is significantly smaller than the ones used in English language studies.",
        "Moreover, more verbs exist in Chinese than in English, which increases the sparsity of Chinese Semantic Role data resources.",
        "The same problem also exists in our experiment.",
        "The current corpus of Chinese FrameNet includes about 18,322 human-annotated sentences of 1,671 target words.",
        "There is only an average of less than 10 sentences for every target word.",
        "To reduce the influence of the data sparsity, we adopt a twofold cross validation technique for train and test labeling.",
        "Second, because of the lack of morphological clues in Chinese, the accuracy of a state-of-the-art parsing system significantly decreases when used for a realistic scenario.",
        "In the preliminary stage of building an SRL model of CFN, we employed a Stanford full parser to parse all sentences in the corpus and adopted the traditional SRL technique on our data set.",
        "However, the experiment result was insignificant.",
        "Only 76.48% of the semantic roles in the data set have a constituent with the same text span in the parse tree, and the F-measure of BI can only achieves 54%.",
        "Therefore, we attempted to use another processing technique for",
        "SRL on CFN.",
        "We formalized SRL on CFN into a sequential tagging problem at the word level.",
        "We first extracted 11 word features into the baseline model.",
        "Then we added 15 additional base chunk features into the SRL model.",
        "In this paper, the SRL task of CFN comprises two subtasks: BI and SRC.",
        "These are regarded as a sequential tagging problem at the word level.",
        "Conditional random fields(CRFs) model is employed to train the model and predict the result of the unlabeled sentence.",
