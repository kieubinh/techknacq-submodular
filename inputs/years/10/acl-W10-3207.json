        "Three types of standard agreement measures such as Cohen's kappa (k) (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996), Measure of Agreement on Set-valued Items (MASI) (Pas-sonneau, 2004) and agr (Wiebe et al., 2005) metrics are employed for annotating the emotion related components.",

        "Negations (tt na [no], «r?r noy [not]) and conjuncts freely occur in the sentence and change the emotion of the sentence.",
        "For that very reason, a crucial analysis of negation and conjuncts is carried out both at intra and inter phrase level to obtain the sentential emotions and intensities.",

        "As there is no fixed category in this case, we have employed two different strategies instead of kappa (k) to calculate the agreement between annotators.",
        "Firstly, we chose the measure of agreement on set-valued items (MASI) (Pas-sonneau, 2006) that was used for measuring agreement on co reference annotation (Passon-neau, 2004) and in the semantic and pragmatic annotation (Passonneau, 2006).",

        "J = | A fi B |/| A U B | Monotonicity (M) is defined as, 1, ifA = B",
        "Secondly, the annotators will annotate different emotional expressions by identifying the responsible text anchors and the agreement is measured using agr metric (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "If A and B are the sets of anchors annotated by annotators a and b, respectively, agr is a directional measure of agreement that measures what proportion of a was also marked by b.",
        "Specifically, we compute the agreement of b to a as:",
        "AmatchingB |",
        "The agr (a|| b) metric corresponds to the recall if a is the gold standard and b the system, and to precision, if b is the gold standard and a is the system.",
        "The results of two agreement strategies for each emotion class are shown in Table 1.",
        "The annotation agreement of emotional expressions produces slightly less values for both kappa and agr.",
