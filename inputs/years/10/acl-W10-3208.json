        "Sentiment analysis and classification from electronic text is a hard semantic disambiguation problem.",
        "The regulating aspects of semantic orientation of a text are natural language context information (Pang et al., 2002) language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Ga-mon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the time dimension (Read, 2005).",

        "In typical computational approaches (Higa-shinaka et al., 2007; Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2000) to sentiment analysis researchers consider the problem of learning a dictionary that maps semantic representations to verbalizations, where the data comes from opinionated electronic text.",
        "Although lexicons in these dictionaries are not explicitly marked up with respect to their contextual semantics, they contain only explicit polarity rating and aspect indicators.",
        "Lexicon-based approaches can be broadly classified into two categories firstly where the discriminative polarity tag of lexicons is determined on labeled training data and secondly where the lexicons are manually compiled, the later constitutes the main effective approach.",
        "It is undoubted that the manual compilation is always the best way to create monolingual semantic lexicons, but manual methods are expensive in terms of human resources, it involves a substantial number of human annotators and it takes lot of time as well.",

        "Subjectivity Word List is most trustable as the opinion mining system OpinionFinder that uses the subjectivity word list has reported highest score for opinion/sentiment subjectivity (Wiebe and Riloff, 2006).",

        "The subjectivity word list is compiled from manually developed resources augmented with entries learned from corpora.",
        "The entries in the subjectivity word list have been labeled with part of speech (POS) tags as well as either strong or weak subjective tag depending on the reliability of the subjective nature of the entry.",
        "These two resources have been merged automatically and the merged resource is used for SentiWordNet(s) generation in the present task.",
        "The generated sentiment lexicons or Senti-WordNet(s) for several Indian languages mostly contain synsets (approximately 60%) of respective languages.",
        "Synset based method is robust for any kind of monolingual lexicon creation and useful to avoid further word sense disambiguation problem in application domain.",
        "Additionally we have developed an online intuitive game to create and validate the developed SentiWordNet(s) by involving Internet population.",
