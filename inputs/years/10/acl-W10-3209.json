        "Opinion mining and sentiment analysis is such task for analyzing and summarizing what people think about a certain topic.",
        "Due to its potential and useful applications, opinion mining has gained a lot of interest in text mining and NLP communities (Ding et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2009).",
        "Much work in this area focused on evaluating reviews as being positive or negative either at the document level (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Beineke et al., 2004) or sentence level (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Wilson et al., 2009; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).",
        "For instance, given some reviews of a product, the system classifies them into positive or negative reviews.",
        "No specific details or features are identified about what customers like or dislike.",
        "To obtain such details, a feature-based opinion mining approach has been proposed (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).",

        "2.",

        "Using these lexicons, we could construct a set of syntactic rules based on the frequently occurred patterns.",

        "Their assumption is that unless the context is changed with adversative expressions, sentences appearing together in that context tend to have the same polarities.",
        "Hence, if one of them contains sentiments words, the other successive sentences are likely to contain sentiment words as well.",

        "The design of domain-dependent lexicons is based on the feature-based opinion mining framework proposed by Liu et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "The framework starts by setting the domain scope such as digital camera.",
        "The next step is to design a set of features associated with the given domain.",
        "For the domain of digital camera, features could be, for instance, \"price\", \"screen size\" and \"picture quality\".",
        "Features could contain sub-features.",
        "For example, the picture quality could have the subfeatures as \"macro mode\", \"portrait mode\" and \"night mode\".",
        "Preparing multiple feature levels could be time-consuming, therefore, we limit the features into two levels: main features and subfeatures.",
        "Another domain-dependent lexicon is polar words.",
        "Polar words are sentiment words which represent either positive or negative views on features.",
        "Although some polar words are domain-independent and have explicit meanings such as \"excellent\", \"beautiful\", \"expensive\" and \"terrible\".",
        "Some polar words are domain-dependent and have implicit meanings depending on the contexts.",
        "For example, the word \"large\" is generally considered positive for the screen size feature of digital camera domain.",
        "However, for the dimension feature of mobile phone domain, the word \"large\" could be considered as negative.",
        "On the other hand, the domain-independent lexicons are regular words which provide different parts of speech (POS) and functions in the sentence.",
        "For opinion mining task, we design six different domain-independent lexicons as follows (some examples are shown in Table 1).",
        "• Particles (PAR): In Thai language, these words refer to the sentence endings which are normally used to add politeness of the speakers (Cooke, 1992).",
        "• Negative words (NEG): Like English, these words are used to invert the opinion polarity.",
        "Examples are \"not\", \"unlikely\" and \"never\".",
        "• Degree words (DEG): These words are used as an intensifier to the polar words.",
        "Examples are \"large\", \"very\", \"enormous\".",
        "• Auxiliary verbs (AUX): These words are used to modify verbs.",
        "Examples are \"should\", \"must\" and \"then\".",
        "• Prepositions (PRE): Like English, Thai prepositions are used to mark the relations between two words.",
        "• Stop words (STO): These words are used for grammaticalization.",
        "Thai language is considered an isolating language, to form a noun the words \"karn\" and \"kwam\" are normally placed in front of a verb or a noun, respectively.",

        "The completeness of lexicons is very important for the feature-based opinion mining.",
        "To collect more lexicons, patterns are used in the dual pattern extraction process to extract more features and polar words from the untagged corpus.",

        "For example, in Thai, a degree word is usually placed after a polar word.",

        "We proposed a framework for constructing Thai opinion mining resource with a case study on hotel reviews.",
        "Two sets of lexicons, domain-dependent and domain-independent, are designed to support the pattern extraction process.",
        "The proposed method first constructs a set of patterns from a tagged corpus.",
        "The extracted patterns are then used to automatically extract and collect more sub-features and polars words from an untagged corpus.",
        "The performance evaluation was done with a collection of hotel reviews obtained from a hotel reservation website.",
        "From the experimental results, polar words could be extracted more easily than sub-features.",
        "This is due to the polar words often appear in specific positions with repeated contexts in the opinionated texts.",
        "In some cases, extraction of subfeatures and polar words are not straightforward due to the difficulties in generalizing patterns.",
        "For example, some subjectivity requires complete phrases to describe the polarity.",
        "In some cases, the sub-features are not explicitly shown in the sentence.",
        "For future work, we plan to complete the construction of the corpus by considering the rest of main features.",
        "Another plan is to include the semantic analysis into the pattern extraction process.",
        "For example, the phrase \"forget something\" could imply negative polarity for the service feature.",
