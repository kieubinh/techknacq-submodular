        "Furthermore, we need to form a schema which incorporates all of the above, that is, to compile all this information together to get the integral structure about the report.",
        "The available annotated corpora concerning the different types of information mentioned above include: the event-annotated corpora such as ACE corpora, the corpora annotating temporal information such as TimeBank, the corpora annotating event factuality such as FactBank, the corpora annotating various types of discourse relations such as RST corpus and Penn Discourse TreeBank.",

        "A report of occurrences always has many related events that are very easy to recognize.",

        "The entity level means the entities, times, and locations that are involved in events.",

        "In order to check the taggability of the annotation strategy mentioned above, three graduate students manually annotated about 60 news reports in 3 categories, including earthquake, fire and attack, using sina search engine, according to the method and principles above.",
        "Each text was annotated by two annotators and discussed jointly if the annotation results were inconsistent or not proper.",
        "As can be seen from Table 3 below, 1) the event patterns extracted can cover the texts well because up to 78% sentences have been annotated.",
        "2) There are 1.6 times more annotated events than annotated sentences.",
        "This shows that there is generally more than one event in a sentence.",
        "So, it is reasonable to assume that the annotation method can accomplish the task of a detailed description of relationships between events.",
        "3) The relevant events are more numerous than the core events.",
        "This shows that it is necessary to distinguish the core events from the relevant events.",
        "Table 3.",
        "The annotation of EVENTs C: Sub-category; C1: earthquake; C2: fire; C3: terrorist attacks; C4: total T: the number of texts; S: the number of sentences NS: the number of sentences not annotated EV: the number of EVENTs CE: the number of core EVENTs RE: the number of relevant EVENTs AR: the number of arguments",
        "We have also analyzed the event attributes in detail(Zou and Yang, 2010).",
        "An interesting event attribute is Fulfillment, which is only applicable to those events with intentions whose result is often emphasized.",
        "Sometimes, readers care about the intended results or outcomes as much as or more than the events themselves.",
        "Therefore it would be useful to explore the notion of Fulfillment, and investigate which linguistic categories could play a role in deciding the value of Fulfillment.",
        "We plan to create a Fulfillment corpus in the next stage.",
        "The annotation of event schema is time-consuming, partly because it needs to annotate all three levels of event information of every text, and partly because of the difficulties to identify the event information from trivial descriptions, in other words, one question we often discuss is whether it deserves to annotate certain parts of a text.",
        "Also, we often need to make a balance between obtaining enough event patterns to cover various types of related events well and omitting low frequent event types to simply the obtainment of event patterns.",
        "In discourse-level annotation, the main difficulty is the identification of relations between events without lexical hints.",
        "This discourse-level annotation is only just underway.",
        "We also plan to give detailed analysis in the next stage.",
