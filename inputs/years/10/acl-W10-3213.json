        "The most challenging features of Dzongkha script is the lack of word boundary separation between the words.",
        "So, in order to do the further linguistic and natural language processing tasks, the scripts should be transformed into a chain of words.",

        "Like Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) languages, Dzongkha script being written continuously without any word delimiter causes a major problem in natural language processing tasks.",

        "Here, given the collection of lexicon, the maximal matching algorithm selects the segmentation that yields the minimum number of words token from all possible segmentations of the input sentence.",
