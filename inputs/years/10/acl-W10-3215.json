        "Ever since Unaccusativity Hypothesis (UH, Perlmutter, 1978), it is widely recognized that there are two heterogeneous subclasses of intransitive verbs, namely unaccusatives and un-ergatives.",
        "The phenomenon of unaccusa-tive/unergative distinction is wide-ranging and labeled in a variety of ways, including active, split S, and split intransitivity (SI).",
        "(cf. Mithun,",
        "Studies dealing with SI are numerous and recently, works taking auxiliary selection as the basis of this syntactic phenomenon have increased (cf. McFadden, 2007 and the references therein).",
        "However, SI in languages that lack explicit syntactic manifestations such as auxiliary selection has been less studied.",
        "Computational approaches are even scarcer.",
        "The major goal of this study is to discuss the linguistic issues surrounding SI in Turkish and present a novel computational approach that decides which verbs are unaccusative and which verbs are unergative in this language.",
        "The computational approach may in turn be used to study the split in lesser-known languages, especially the ones lacking a clear diagnostic.",
        "It may also be used with well-known languages where the split is observed as a means to confirm earlier predictions made about SI."

      "text": [
        "Broadly speaking, approaches to the SI may be syntactic or semantic.",
        "Syntactic approaches divide intransitive verbs into two syntactically distinct classes.",
        "According to the seminal work of Perlmutter (1978), unaccusative and unerga-tive verbs form two syntactically distinct classes of intransitive verbs.",
        "Within the context of Relational Grammar, Perlmutter (1978) proposed that unaccusative verbs have an underlying object promoted to the subject position, while un-ergative verbs have a base-generated subject.",
        "This hypothesis, known as the Unaccusativity Hypothesis (UH) maintains that the mapping of the sole argument of an intransitive verb onto syntax as subject or direct object is semantically predictable.",
        "The UH distinguishes active or activity clauses (i.e., unergative clauses) from un-accusative ones.",
        "Unergative clauses include",
        "An exception is Japanese.",
        "For example see Kishimoto (1996), Hirakawa (1999), Oshita (1997), Sorace and Sho-mura (2001), and the references therein.",
        "Also see Richa (2008) for Hindi.",
        "willed or volitional acts (work, speak) and certain involuntary bodily process predicates (cough, sleep); unaccusative clauses include predicates whose initial term is semantically patient (fall, die), predicates of existing and happening (happen, vanish), nonvoluntary emission predicates (smell, shine), aspectual predicates (begin, cease), and duratives (remain, survive).",
        "From a Government and Binding perspective, Burzio (1986) differentiates between two intransitive classes by the verbs' theta-marking properties.",
        "In unaccusative verbs (labeled 'erga-tives'), the sole argument is the same as the deep structure object; in unergative verbs, the sole argument is the same as the agent at the surface.",
        "The configuration of the two intransitive verb types may be represented simply as follows:",
        "Unergatives: NP [Vp V] John ran.",
        "Unaccusatives: [VP V NP] John fell.",
        "In its original formulation, the UH claimed that the determination of verbs as unaccusative or unergative somehow correlated with their semantics and since then, there has been so much theoretical discussion about how strong this connection is.",
        "It has also been noted that a strict binary division is actually not tenable because across languages, some verbs fail to behave consistently with respect to certain diagnostics.",
        "For example, it has been shown that, with standard diagnostics, certain verbs such as last, stink, bleed, die, etc can be classified as unaccusative in one language, unergative in a different language (Rosen, 1984; Zaenen, 1988, among many others).",
        "This situation is referred to as unaccusativity mismatches.",
        "New proposals that specifically focus on these problems have also been made (e.g., Sorace, 2000, below).",
        "Following the initial theoretical discussions about the connection between syntactic diagnostics and their semantic underpinnings, various semantic factors were suggested.",
        "These involve directed change and internal/external causation (Levin & Rappaport-Hovav, 1995), inferable eventual position or state (Lieber & Baayen, 1997), telicity and controllability (Zaenen, 1993), and locomotion (see Randall, 2007; Alexiadou et al., 2004, and, Aranovich, 2007, and McFadden, 2007 for reviews).",
        "Some researchers have suggested that syntax has no role in SI.",
        "For example, van Valin (1990), focusing on Italian, Georgian, and Achenese, proposed that SI is best characterized in terms of Aksion-sart and volitionality.",
        "Kishimoto (1996) suggested that volitionality is the semantic parameter that largely determines unaccusa-tive/unergative distinction in Japanese.",
        "Auxiliary selection is among the most reliable syntactic diagnostics proposed for SI.",
        "This refers to the auxiliary selection properties of languages that have two perfect auxiliaries corresponding to be and have in English.",
        "In Romance and Germanic languages such as Italian, Dutch, German, and to a lesser extent French, the equivalents of be (essere, zijn, sein, etre) tend to be selected by unaccusative predicates while the equivalents of have (avere, haben, hebben, avoir) tend to be selected by unergative predicates (Burzio, 1986; Zaenen, 1993; Keller, 2000; Legendre, 2007, among others).",
        "In (1a-b) the situation is illustrated in French (F), German (G) and Italian (I).",
        "(Examples are from Legendre, 2007).",
        "auxiliary selection as a manifestation of the semantic property of telicity.",
        "Hence in Dutch, zijn-taking verbs are by and large telic, hebben-taking verbs are atelic.",
        "Impersonal passivization is another diagnostic that seems applicable to a wide range of languages and used by a number of authors, e.g. Perlmutter (1978), Hoekstra and Mulder (1990), Keller (2000).",
        "This construction is predicted to be grammatical with unergative clauses but not with unaccusative clauses.",
        "Zaenen (1993) notes that impersonal passivization is controlled by the semantic notion of protagonist control in Dutch; therefore incompatibility of examples such as bleed with impersonal passivization is attributed to the fact that bleed is not a protagonist control verb.",
        "Levin and Rappaport-Hovav (1995:141) take impersonal passivization as an unaccusativity diagnostic but take its sensitivity to protagonist control as a necessary but an insufficient condition for unergative verbs to allow it.",
        "In other words, only unergative verbs will be found in this construction, though not all of them.",
        "Refinements of the UH have also been proposed.",
        "Most notably, Sorace (2000) argued that the variation attested across languages (as well as within the dialects of a single language) is orderly, and that there are a number of cut-off points to which verb classes can be sensitive.",
        "Sorace's work on (monadic) intransitive verbs is built on variation in the perfective auxiliary selection of verbs in Romance and Germanic languages and called Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy (ASH).",
        "She demonstrates that the variation is based on a hierarchy of thematic and aspectual specification of the verbs (viz., telicity and agentivity) and that it is a function of the position of a verb on the hierarchy.",
        "Verbs with a high degree of aspectual and thematic specification occupy the extreme ends; variable verbs occupy the middle position, reflecting the decreasing degree of aspectual specification.",
        "Both cross-dialectally and across languages, these verbs may be used either with unaccusative or unergative syntax.",
        "The ASH therefore is a descriptive statement considering auxiliary selection as a property characterized by both syntax and semantics, as originally viewed by the UH.",
        "We now turn to Turkish, which lacks perfective auxiliaries.",
        "A number of other syntactic diagnostics, reviewed below, have been proposed but unlike auxiliaries in other languages, these are not obligatory constructions in Turkish.",
        "In addition, the semantic properties underlying the proposed diagnostics have not been studied extensively.",
        "Therefore, Turkish presents a particular challenge for any study about SI.",

        "A major finding of the suggested model is that the predictions of the two models are compatible with the UH (Perlmutter, 1978) in that they divide most intransitive verbs into two, as expected.",
        "Furthermore, the differences between the decisions of the diagnostics-based DIAG model and the semantic-parameters-based SEMANP model reflect a reported finding in the unaccusativity literature, i.e., the tests used to differentiate between unaccusatives and unergatives do not uniformly delegate all verbs to the same classes (the solution of why such mismatches occur in Turkish is beyond the scope of this study, see Sorace, 2000; Randall, 2007, for some suggestions).",
        "More specifically, the three Group-A verbs that were predicted as unaccusative by the DIAG model and unerga-tive by the SEMANP model (dur- 'remain, stay', kal- 'stall, stay, and varol- 'exist') are stative verbs, which are known to show inconsistent behavior in the literature and classified as variable-behavior verbs by Sorace (2000).",
        "An unexpected finding is the Group-B verb (yüz-'swim'), which is predicted as unergative by the DIAG model and unaccusative by the SEMANP model.",
        "This seems to reflect the role of semantic parameters other than telicity (namely, dy-namicity and directed motion) in Turkish.",
        "The remaining nine verbs of thirteen tested verbs were predicted to be of the same type (either unaccusative or unergative) by both models.",
        "Another finding of the model is the alignment between the most weighted syntactic diagnostics for unaccusative/unergative distinction in Turkish, namely the -mI§ participle which received the highest weight after the training, and the most weighted semantic parameter, namely telicity."

        "This study contributes to our understanding of the distinction in several respects.",
        "Firstly, it proposes a novel computational approach that tackles the unaccusative/unergative distinction in Turkish.",
        "The model confirms that a split between unaccusative and unergative verbs indeed exists in Turkish but that the division is not clear-cut.",
        "The model suggests that certain verbs (e.g., stative verbs) behave inconsistently, as mentioned in most accounts in the literature.",
        "Moreover, the model reflects a correspondence between syntactic diagnostics and semantics, which supports the view that unaccu-sativity is semantically determined and syntactically manifested (Permutter, 1978, Levin & Rappaport-Hovav, 1995).",
        "Since this approach uses relevant language-dependent features, it is particularly applicable to languages that lack explicit syntactic diagnostics of SI.",
        "The computational approach is based on the connectionist paradigm which employs feedforward artificial neural networks with a back-propagation algorithm.",
        "There are several dimensions in which the model will further be developed.",
        "First, the reliability of input node values will be strengthened by conducting acceptability judgment experiments with native speakers, and the training of the model will be improved by increasing the number of verbs used for training.",
        "Acceptability judgments are influenced not only by verbs but also by other constituents in clauses or sentences; therefore the input data will be improved to involve different senses of verbs under various sentential constructions.",
        "Second, alternative classifiers, such as decision trees and naïve Bayes, as well as the classifiers that use discretized weights may provide more informative accounts of the findings of SI in Turkish.",
        "These alternatives will be investigated in further studies.",
