        "The Korean Resource Grammar (KRG) has been under development since 2003 (Kim and Yang, 2003) with the aim of building an open source grammar of Korean.",
        "The grammatical framework for the KRG is Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG: (Pollard and Sag, 1994; Sag et al., 2003)), a non-derivational, constraint-based, and surface-oriented grammatical architecture.",
        "The grammar models human languages as systems of constraints on typed feature structures.",
        "This enables the extension of grammar in a systematic and efficient way, resulting in linguistically precise and theoretically motivated descriptions of languages.",
        "The initial stage of the KRG (hereafter, KRG1) has covered a large part of the Korean grammar with fine-grained analyses of HPSG.",
        "However, this version, focusing on linguistic data with theory-oriented approaches, is unable to yield efficient parsing or generation.",
        "The additional limit of the KRG1 is its unattested parsing efficiency with a large scale of naturally occurring data, which is a prerequisite to the practical uses of the developed grammar in the area of MT.",
        "Such weak points have motivated us to move the development of KRG to a data-driven approach from a theory-based one upon which the KRG1 is couched.",
        "In particular, this second phase of the KRG (henceforth, KRG2) also starts with two methods: shared grammar libraries (the Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002; Bender et al., 2010)) and data-driven expansion (using the Korean portions of multilingual texts).",
        "Next, we introduce the resources we used (§ 2).",
        "this is followed by more detailed motivation for our extensions (§ 3).",
        "We then detail how we use the grammar libraries from the Grammar Matrix to enable generation (§ 2) and then expand the coverage based on a corpus study (§ 5)."

        "HPSG/MRS-based MT architecture consists of parsing, transfer, and generation, as assumed in Figure 1 (Bond et al., 2005).",
        "As noted earlier, the KRG1 with no generation function is limited only to the Source Analysis in Figure 1.",
        "In addition, since its first aim was to develop a Korean grammar that reflects its individual properties in detail, the KRG1 lacks compatible semantic representations with other grammars such as ERG and Jacy.",
        "The mismatches between the components of the KRG1 and those of other grammars make it difficult to adopt the Korean grammar for an MT system.",
        "To take a representative example, the KRG1 treats tense information as a feature type of HEAD, while other grammars incorporate it into the semantics; thus, during the transfer process in Figure 1, some information will be missing.",
        "In addition, KRG1 used default inheritance, which makes the grammar more compact, but means it could not used with the faster PET parser.",
        "We will discuss this issue in more detail in Section 4.1.",
        "Another main issue in the KRG1 is that some of the defined types and rules in the grammar are inefficient in generation.",
        "Because the declared types and rules are defined with theoretical motivations, the runtime for generating any parsing units within the system takes more than expected and further causes memory overflow errors to crop up almost invariably, even though the input is quite simple.",
        "This problem is partially due to the complex morphological inflection system in the KRG1.",
        "Section 4. discusses how KRG , solves this problem.",
        "Third it is better \"to be robust for parsing and strict for generation\" (Bond et al., 2008).",
        "That means robust rules will apply in parsing, though the input sentence does not sound perfect, but not in generation.",
        "For example, the sentence (1b), the colloquial form of the formal, standard sentence (1a), is used more frequently in colloquial context:",
        "(1) a. ney-ka cham yeppu-ney.",
        "you-NOM really pretty-DECL 'You are really pretty.'",
        "b. ni-ka cham ippu-ney",
        "The grammar needs to parse both (1a) and (1b) and needs to yield the same MRS because both sentences convey the same truth-conditional meaning.",
        "However, the KRG1 handles only the legitimate sentence (1a), excluding (1b).",
        "The KRG1 is thus not sophisticated enough to distinguish these two stylistic different sentences.",
        "Therefore we need to develop the generation procedures that can choose a proper sentence style.",

        "We have first evaluated the coverage and performance of the KRG1 using a large size of data to track down the KRG1's problems that may cause parsing inefficiencies and generating clog.",
        "In other words, referring to the experimental results, we patterned the problematic parts in the current version.",
        "According to the error pattern, on the one hand, we expanded lexicon from occurring texts in our generalization.",
        "On the other hand, we fixed the previous rules and sometimes introduced new rules with reference to the occurrence in texts.",
        "In developing the KRG, we have employed two strategies for improvement; (i) shared grammar libraries and (ii) exploiting large text corpora.",
        "We share grammar libraries with the Grammar Matrix in the grammar (Bender et al., 2002) as the foundation of KRG2.",
        "The Grammar Matrix provides types and constraints that assist the grammar in producing well-formed MRS representations.",
        "The Grammar Matrix customization system provides with a linguistically-motivated broad coverage grammar for Korean as well as the basis for multilingual grammar engineering.",
        "In addition, we exploit naturally occurring texts as the generalization corpus.",
        "We chose as our corpora Korean texts that have translations available in English or Japanese, because they can be the baseline of multilingual MT.",
        "Since the data-driven approach is influenced by data type, multilingual texts help us make the grammar more suitable for MT in the long term.",

        "Therefore, we first rebuilt the basic schema of the KRG1 on the Grammar Matrix customization system, and then imported each grammar module from KRG1 to the matrix-based frame (§4.1).",
        "In addition, we reformed the inflectional hierarchy assumed in the KRG1, so that the grammar does not impede generation any longer (§ 4.2).",
        "Finally, we introduced the style feature structure for sentence choice in accordance with our principles (2c-d) (§4.3).",
        "The root folder krg contains the basic type definition language files (*.tdl.",
        "In the KRG2, we subdivided the types.tdl into: matrix.tdl file which corresponds to general principles; korean.tdl with language particular rules; types-lex.tdl for lexical types and types-ph.tdl for phrasal types.",
        "In addition, we reorganized the KRG1's lexicons.tdl file into the lex folder consisting of several sub-files in accordance with the POS values (e.g.; lex-v.tdl for verbs).",
        "The next step is to revise grammar modules in order to use the Grammar Matrix to a full extent.",
        "In this process, when inconsistencies arise between KRG1 and KRG2, we followed (2a-b).",

        "The test items, consisting of 6,180 grammatical sentences, 118 ungrammatical sentences, were divided into subgroups according to the related phenomena (e.g. light verb constructions).",

        "Let us compare each complexity to get the target node D. For convenience' sake, let us assume that each node has ten constraints to be satisfied.",
        "In (a), since there are three parents nodes (i.e. A, B, and C) on top of D, D cannot be generated until A, B, and C are checked previously.",
        "Hence, it costs at least 10,000 (10[A] x10[B] x10[C] x10[D]) calculations.",
        "In contrast, in (b), only 100 (10[A] x 10[D]) calculations is enough to generate node D. That means, the deeper the hierarchy is, the more the complexity increases.",
        "Table 1 shows (a) requires more than 52 times as much complexity as (b), though they have the same number of nodes.",
        "When generation is processed by LKB, all potential inflectional nodes are made before syntactic configurations according to the given MRS.",
        "Thus, if the hierarchy becomes deeper and contains more nodes, complexity of (a)-styled hierarchy grows almost by geometric progression.",
        "This makes generation virtually impossible, causing memory overflow errors to the generation within the KRG1.",

        "First of all, the flat approach ignores the fact that Korean is an agglutinative language.",
        "Korean morphological paradigm can yield a wide variety of forms; therefore, to enumerate all potential forms is not only undesirable but also even impossible.",
        "The KRG2 thus follows a hybrid approach (c) that takes each advantage of (a) and (b).",
        "(c) is more flattened than (a), which lessens computational complexity.",
        "On the other hand, in (c), the depth of the inflectional hierarchy is fixed as two, and the skeleton looks like a unary form, though each major node (marked as a bigger circle) has its own subtypes (marked as dotted lines).",

        "In a similar vein, there are not a few lexical-ized forms as well; for example, a verbal lexeme kkamek- is composed of kka- \"peel\" and mek-\"eat\", but it conveys a sense of \"forget\", rather than \"peel and eat\".",
        "In addition, we also need to cover idiomatic expressions (e.g. \"thanks\") for robust parsing.",
        "Exploiting our corpus, we added 1,720 grammaticalized or lexicalized forms and 352 idioms.",
        "Now, we call this 'KRG2'.",
        "Table 6 shows the evaluation measure of this study.",
        "p' and g' stand for parsing' and generation', respectively.",
        "'+' represents the difference compared to KRG1.",
        "Since KRG1 does not generate, there is no g+'.",
        "On average, the parsing coverage increases 24.5%.",
        "The reason why there are negative values in 'p+' of kpsg and seri is that we discarded some modules that run counter efficient processing (e.g., the grammar module for handling floating quantifiers sometimes produces too many ambiguities.).",
        "Since KRG1 has been constructed largely around the test sets, we expected it to perform well here.",
        "If we measure the parsing coverage again, after excluding the results of kpsg and seri, it accounts for 32.5%.",
        "The generation coverage of KRG2 accounts for almost 60% per parsed sentence on average.",
        "Note that KRG1 could not parse at all.",
        "'s' (short for 'success') means the portion of both parsed and generated sentences (i.e. 'p'x'g'), which accounts for about 29%.",
        "Ambiguity means '# of parses/# of sentences' for parsing and '# of realizations/# of MRSes' for generation.",
        "The numbers look rather big, which should be narrowed down in our future study.",

        "It is influenced by three factors; (i) lexical variety, (ii) sentence length, and (iii) text domain.",
        "This difference implies that it is highly necessary to use variegated texts in order to improve grammar in a comprehensive way.",
        "Figure 7 to 10 represent how much each experiment in §5.3 contributes to improvement.",
        "First, let us see Figure 7 and 8.",
        "As we anticipated, lex and irules contribute greatly to the growth of parsing coverage.",
        "In particular, the line of b-c in Figure 8, which mostly consists of spoken forms, rises rapidly in irules and KRG2.",
        "That implies Korean parsing largely depends on richness of lexical rules.",
        "On the other hand, as we also expected, MRS makes a great contribution to generation coverage (Figure 8).",
        "In MRS, the growth accounts for 22% on average.",
        "That implies testing with large corpora must take precedence in order for coverage to grow.",
        "Figure 9 and 10 shows performance in parsing and generation, respectively.",
        "Comparing to KRG1, our Matrix-based grammars (from base to KRG2) yields fairly good performance.",
        "It is mainly because we deployed the PET parser that runs fast, whereas KRG1 runs only on LKB.",
        "Figure 10, on the other hand, shows that the revision of MRS also does much to enhance generation performance, in common with coverage mentioned before.",
        "It decreases the running times by about 3.1 seconds on average."
