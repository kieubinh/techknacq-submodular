        "The diversity of the visitors' linguistic backgrounds suggests two things: 1) Monolingual translation service is not enough.",
        "2) It shows that we can benefit from allowing them to contribute to a multilingual repository.",
        "So we design and build a collaborative multilingual terminological database and seed using the DSR project and its resources (Daoud, Kitamoto et al.",
        "2008).",
        "However, Discovering and translating domain specific terminology is a very complicated and expensive task, because (1) traditionally, it depends on human terminologists (Cabre and Sager 1999) which increases the cost, (2) terminology is dynamic (Kageura 2002), thousands of terms are coined each year, and (3) it is difficult to involve domain experts in the construction process.",
        "That will not only increase the cost, but it will reduce the quality, and the coverage (number of languages and size).",
        "Databases like (UNhuge organizations, and it is difficult for a smaller community to produce its own multilingual terminological database._",
        "In the next section we will give definitions for the basic concepts presented in this article, in particular, the preterminology and its lexical network (graph).",
        "Then, in the third section we will show the automatic approach to seed the multilingual preterminological graph based on the resources of the DSR.",
        "And then, we will discuss the human involvement in the development of such a resource by providing a study of the possible contributors through analyzing the multilinguality and loyalty of the DSR visitors.",
