        "Due to their importance, many studies have examined methods of extracting taxonomic relations automatically - either from unstructured text (Cimiano et al., 2005; Cimiano(2) et al., 2005), or from structured data such as Wikipedia category structures (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007; Nastase and Strube, 2008; Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Many researchers have attempted to obtain taxonomic relations from unstructured text to con-stuct a taxonomy, but in most cases such a system shows poor precision and low recall.",
        "Approaches to extracting taxonomic relations from structured data show relatively high performance, but to obtain a taxonomy these require huge amounts of structured data.",
        "Recently, as large amounts of structured data such as the infoboxes and category structures of Wikipedia or DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) have become available, an obstacle to this approach has been removed.",
        "Although a category structure does contain some kind of hierarchical structure, in many cases it cannot be considered as an isa/instanceOf hierarchy.",
        "For example, the article \"Pioneer 11 \" on Wikipedia is categorized under \"Radio frequency propagation\", which is related to the \"Pioneer 11\" but is obviously not a taxonomical parent of \"Pioneer 11\".",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for extracting taxonomic relations from a given category structure.",
        "More precisely, for a category link in the given category structure, the algorithm determines whether the link could be considered an isa/instanceOf relation, or if the link simply represents a broader term/narrower term/related term relation.",
        "For a given category link <A, B>, in which A is the upper category name and B is the lower category/article name, we attempt to get the definition of B to classify the link.",
        "More precisely, we analyze the upper categories of B from the given category structure, to get tokens that represents the definition of B.",
        "Once we get the tokens, we compare the tokens with the name of A, to classify the given category link.",
        "We call the tokens that represent the definition of B \"intrinsic tokens\" of B; a more precise definition will be presented in section 3.1.",
        "To show the validity of this approach, the algorithm is applied to Wikipedia's category structure, to obtain taxonomic relations there.",
        "Wikipedia's category structure consists of categories, article titles and links between them.",
        "A Wikipedia article represents one document, and a category is the grouping of those articles by non-categorization-expert users.",

        "Since some intrinsic tokens that are appropriate as modifiers are not appropriate as head words - for example, if the token \"Jupiter\" is used as a modifier, it will be a good intrinsic token of \"Pioneer 11\", but if it is used as a head word, choosing it as the intrinsic token of \"Pioneer 11\" would be bad choice - thus, we distinguish between intrinsic score as head word, and intrinsic score as modifier.",

        "We extract category links from the Wikipedia category structure and annotate them to construct the test corpus.",
        "During the process of choosing category links, we intentionally removed category links with names containing any of the following words: \"stub\", \"wikiproject\", \"wikipedia\", \"template\", \"article\", \"start-class\", \"category\", \"redirect\", \"mediawiki\", \"user\", \"portal\", \"page\", and \"list\".",
        "These words are normally used to represent Wikipedia maintenance pages.",
        "After we remove the links described before, we randomly choose 3,951 category-category links and 1,688 article-category links.",
        "Two annotators worked separately to annotate whether or not the given link is an isa/instanceOf link, and in the event of conflict they would discuss the case and make a inal decision.",
        "We carried out experiments on category-category link set and article-category link set separately, since their characteristics are different.",

        "We divided the 3,951 category-category links into two equally-sized sets, and used one set as a training set and the other one as a test set.",
        "The training set was used to identify the a and ß values for isa link classiication: in other words, the a and ß values that showed the best performance when applied to training set were selected as the actual parameters used by the system.",
        "As Wikipedia's category structure contains a huge number of category links, precision is more important than recall.",
        "As recall cannot be ignored, we chose the parameters that gave the highest precision on the training set, while giving a recall of at least 0.7.",
        "Also, we carried out experiments on three baseline systems.The irst one determined every link as an isa link.",
        "The second one applied the head word matching rule (M) only, which says that for category-category link <A, B>, if the head words of A and B are the same, then <A, B> should be classiied as an isa link.",

        "The comparison of setting M and AHM, P and AHP shows that the intrinsic-property based approach increases recall of the existing system about 7-10 %, at the cost of of 2-6 % precision loss.",
        "This shows that, rather than looking only at the given category link and analyzing patterns on its name, by gathering information from the upper category set, we were able to significantly increase recall.",
        "However, it also shows that some \"garbage\" information is introduced through the upper category set, resulting in a 2-6 % precision loss.",
        "The best system shows about a 8-10 % increase in recall, with comparably good precision compared to the two baseline systems.",
        "In a similar manner to the experiments on category-category links, we divided the 1,688 article-category links into two equally-sized sets, and used one set as a training set and the other one as a test set.",

        "Table 6 shows the baseline results and the best results of the combinatory system.",
        "As you can observe from the above table, M (head word matching rule) does not work well in article-category links, although its precision is still high or comparable to that of other methods.",
        "Since in most cases an article represents one instance, in many cases they have their own name, making the recall of the head word matching rule extremely low.",
