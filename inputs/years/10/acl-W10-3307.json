        "Increasing biosurveillance capacity is a public health priority in both the developed and developing world, both for the early identification of emerging diseases and for pinpointing epidemic outbreaks (Chen et al., 2010).",
        "The 2009 Mexican flu outbreak provides an example of how an outbreak of a new disease (in this case a new variant of H1N1 influenza) can spend some weeks spreading in a community before it is recognized as a threat by public health officials.",
        "Syndromic surveillance is vital if we are to detect outbreaks at an early stage (Henning, 2004; Wagner et al., 2006).",
        "The United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines syndromic surveillance as \"surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or outbreak to warrant further public health response.\"",
        "That is, the focus of syndromic surveillance is the identification of disease outbreaks before the traditional public health apparatus of confirmatory laboratory testing and official diagnosis can be used.",
        "Data sources for syndromic surveillance have included, over the counter pharmacy sales (Tsui et al., 2003), school absenteeism records (Lombardo et al., 2003), calls to NHS Direct (a nurse led information and advice service in the United Kingdom) (Cooper, 2007), and search engine queries (Eysenbach, 2006).",
        "However, in this paper we concentrate on mining text based clinical records for outbreak data.",
        "Clinical interactions between health workers and patients generate large amounts of textual data – in the form of clinical reports, chief complaints, and so on – which provide an obvious source of pre-diagnosis information.",
        "In order to mine the information in these clinical reports we are faced with two distinct problems:",
        "1.",
        "How should we define a syndrome of interest?",
        "That is, how are signs and symptoms mapped to syndromes?",
        "2.",
        "Given that we have established such a set of mappings, how then do we map from the text in our clinical reports to the signs and symptoms that constitute a syndrome, given the high level of terminological variability in clinical reports.",
        "This paper presents an application ontology that attempts to address both these issues for the domain of Influenza-Like-Illness Syndrome (ILI).",
        "The case definition for ILI, as defined by the United States Center for Disease Control is \"fever greater than or equal to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and either cough or sore throat.\"",
        "In contrast to the CDC's straightforward definition, the syndrome is variously described as a cluster of symptoms and findings, including fever and cold symptoms, cough, nausea, vomiting, body aches and sore throat (Scholer, 2004).",
        "In constructing an application specific syndrome definition for this ontology, we used a data driven approach to defining ILI, generating a list of terms through an analysis of Emergency Room reports.",
        "The remainder of the paper is divided into five parts.",
        "First, we briefly describe related work, before going on to report on the ontology development process.",
        "We then set forth an evaluation of the ontology with respect to its coverage of terms in the target domain.",
        "We go on to outline areas for future work, before finally presenting some concluding comments."

        "In recent years there has been significant progress in interfacing lexical resources (in particular WordNet (Miller, 1995)) and upper level ontologies (like the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) (Gangemi et al., 2002) and the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) (Niles and Pease, 2003)).",
        "However, as our domain of interest employs a highly specialized terminology, the use of general linguistic resources like WordNet was inappropriate.",
        "Our work has focused on the representation of ILI relevant concepts that occur in clinical reports in order to facilitate syndromic surveillance.",
        "While the widely used medical taxonomies and nomenclatures (for example Unified Medical Language System and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) contain many of the ILI relevant concepts found in clinical texts, these general resources do not have the specific relations (and lexical information) relevant to syndromic surveillance from clinical reports.",
        "Currently, there are at least four major terminological resources available that focus on the public health domain: PHSkb, SSO, and the BioCaster Ontology.",
        "The Public Health Surveillance knowledge base PHSkb (Doyle et al., 2005) developed by the CDC is a coding system for the communication of notifiable disease findings for public health professionals at the state and federal level in the United States.",

        "The PHSkb emphasizes diagnosed diseases.",
        "That is, the PHSKb is focused on post diagnosis reporting, when laboratory tests have been conducted and the presence of a disease is confirmed.",
        "This approach is not suitable for syndromic surveillance where we seek to identify clusters of symptoms and signs before a diagnosis.",
        "2.",
        "PHSkb is no longer under active development.",
        "The Syndromic Surveillance Ontology (SSO) (Okhmatovskaia et al., 2009) was developed to address a pressing problem for system developers and public health officials.",
        "How can we integrate outbreak information when every site uses different syndrome definitions?",
        "For instance, if State X defines sore throat as part of ILI, yet State Y does not, syndromic surveillance results from each state will not be directly comparable.",
        "When we apply this example to the wider national scene, with federal regional and provincial public health agencies attempting to share data with each other, and international agencies, we can see the scale of the problem to be addressed.",
        "In order to manage this data sharing problem, a working group of eighteen researchers, representing ten functional syndromic surveillance systems in the United States (for example, Boston Public Health Department and the US Department of Defense) convened to develop standard definitions for four syndromes of interest (respiratory, gastrointestinal, constitutional and ILI)and constructed an OWL ontology based on these definitions.",
        "While the SSO is a useful starting points, there are several reasons why – on its own – it is insufficient for clinical report processing:",
        "1.",
        "SSO is centered on chiefcomplaints.",
        "Chief complaints (or \"presenting complaints\") are phrases that briefly describe a patient's presenting condition on first contact with a medical facility.",
        "They usually describe symptoms, refrain from diagnostic speculation and employ frequent abbreviations and misspellings (for example \"vom + naus\" for \"vomiting and nausea\").",
        "Clinical texts – the focus of attention in this paper – are full length documents, normally using correct spellings (even if they are somewhat \"telegraphic\" in style).",
        "Furthermore, clinical reports frequently list physical findings (that is, physical signs elicited by the physician, like, for instance reflex tests) which are not present in symptom orientated chiefcom-plaints.",
        "2.",
        "The range of syndromes represented in SSO is limited to four.",
        "Although we are starting out with ILI, we have plans (and data) to extend our resource to four new syndromes (see Section 5 for details of further work).",
        "3.",
        "The most distinctive feature of the SSO is that the knowledge engineering process was conducted in a face-to-face committee context.",
        "Currently, there is no process in place to extend the SSO to new syndromes, symptoms or domains.",
        "The BioCaster application ontology was built to facilitate text mining of news articles for disease outbreaks in several different Pacific Rim languages (including English, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese) (Collier et al., 2006).",

        "2.",
        "The BioCaster ontology, while it does represent syndromes (for example, constitutional and hemorrhagic syndromes) and symptoms, does not represent physical findings, as these are beyond its scope.",
