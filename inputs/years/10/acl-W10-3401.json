        "I show how to define such a semantics, how to build the appropriate lexicon, how to format it, and how to use it for various tasks.",
        "The talk pulls together a wide range of related topics, including Pantel-style resources like DIRT, inferences / expectations such as those used in Schank-style expectation-based parsing and expectation-driven NLU, PropBank-style word valence lexical items, and the treatment of negation and modalities.",
        "I conclude by arguing that the human cognitive lexicon has to have the same kinds of properties as the Distributional Semantics lexicon, given the ways people do things with words."
