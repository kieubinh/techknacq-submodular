        "Electronic lexical resources such as WordNet and FrameNet are used for a great variety of natural processing tasks, ranging from query expansion, to word sense disambiguation, text classification, or textual entailment.",
        "Some of these resources are also used by human users as on-line dictionaries; see the Princeton WordNet and the MultiWordNet on-line sites.",
        "In this paper we describe a novel attempt to exploit the information contained in wordnets to build a tool designed to support the therapy of language disorders.",
        "In doing so, we will tackle also an interesting theoretical issue.",
        "Is the WordNet conceptual model apt to represent the common sense knowledge associated to concepts, which is partly lost in case of language disorders (aphasia) due to a brain damage?",
        "Note that, in cognitively oriented studies of the lexicon such knowledge is often represented in the form of featural descriptions elicited from speakers, such as <a cat> is lazy , <camels> are found in deserts, <planes> fly etc.",
        "Anomia is the most pervasive and persistent of aphasia symptoms.",
        "It has been described as \"a difficulty in finding high information words, both in fluent discourse and when called upon to identify an object of action by name\" (Goodglass and Wingfield, 1997:3).",
        "The naming difficulties experienced by anomic patients can vary substantially, so that different \"anomias\" can be characterized as arising from either a mainly lexical or mainly semantic breakdown.",
        "Depending on the kind of anomia, therapeutic approaches can vary, so as to employ the more appropriate tasks and stimuli.",
        "Computers can support the rehabilitation of language disorders in many ways: from assisting the administrative management to enhancing common assessment methods, from helping the clinician during the therapeutic session to alleviating the communicative difficulties of a patient by exploiting his unimpaired abilities (Pe-theram, 2004).",
        "In these pages we introduce STaRS.sys (Semantic Task Rehabilitation Support system), a Computer Assisted Therapy (CAT) tool designed to support the therapist in the preparation of semantic exercises such as odd-one-out, yes/no attribute question answering, property generation and so forth.",
        "All these exercises are based on the kinds of information that are carried by featural",
        "italics times new roman.",
        "descriptions.",
        "Such a scenario motivates the need for a lexical semantic resource which is richer and somehow more cognitively-oriented than the existing ones.",
        "We will argue that such needs can be satisfied by enhancing the WordNet model (WN: Fellbaum, 1998 ed) as implemented in the",

        "In this section we will illustrate the semantic requirements that the therapeutic use of STaRS.sys poses, and how we foresee the tool will be used in practical therapeutic scenarios.",
        "An essential requirement of the STaRS.sys tool is the capability of managing the major variables that influence the performance of anomic patients in semantic therapeutic tasks (Raymer and",
        "Gonzalez-Rothi, 2002; Cree and McRae, 2003).",
        "Accordingly, we identified a minimum of five types of information which should be available for every lexical concept:",
        "Conceptual Taxonomy.",
        "A fully-specified conceptual taxonomy is an essential requirement for our tool, in the light of the existence of patients affected by language disorders specific to certain semantic categories, such as tools, or living beings (Capitani et al., 2003).",
        "Featural Descriptions.",
        "Featural descriptions are assumed to play a central role in the human semantic memory (Murphy, 2002) and will be represented here as <concept> feature couples, e.g. <dog> has a tail.",
        "This information can be exploited for selecting sets of concepts which are relevant in a certain therapeutic context, e.g. concepts sharing a feature value (\"red objects\") or those for which a type of feature is particularly relevant (e.g. \"animals with a peculiar fur\").",
        "Feature Types Classification.",
        "A grouping of FDs into feature types is needed for selectively working on feature types of interest, or for the estimation of semantic measures such as feature distinctiveness, semantic relevance, concept similarity and feature correlation (Cree and McRae, 2003; Sartori and Lombardi, 2004; Vin-son et al., 2003).",
        "As we will see in the following sections, feature types can be mapped onto WordNet-like relations.",
        "Prototypicality.",
        "A concept can be more or less representative of its category.",
        "Choosing and working on concepts with different levels of pro-totypicality can be informative, for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.",
        "Word Frequency.",
        "Patients' performance can be affected by word frequency.",
        "Thereby, a critical skill for our tool is the ability to discriminate between words used with different frequencies.",
        "By exploiting a lexical infrastructure encoding such semantic information, STaRS.sys can be used by a therapist for:",
        "• retrieving concepts;",
        "• retrieving information associated to concepts;",
        "• comparing concepts.",
        "These three functionalities can be illustrated by the preparation of three different tasks for a patient affected by, e.g., a semantic deficit selectively affecting animal concepts.",
        "Such a kind of patient would show comprehension and production difficulties restricted to concepts belonging to the animal category (Capitani et al., 2003).",
        "Plausibly, furthermore, his production problems would manifest both as naming failure in controlled conditions (i.e. in tests like the ones reported below) and as a difficulty/inability to retrieve the intended word in spontaneous speech (Semenza, 1999).",
        "In the first scenario, the therapist looks for concepts that match given specifications in order to prepare a feature generation task.",
        "As an example, she submits to STaRS.sys a request for concepts of frequent use, referring to animals, associated to highly distinctive color features and having a high mean feature distinctiveness.",
        "The system returns concepts such as zebra, tiger and cow.",
        "Finally the patient is asked to generate phrasal descriptions for these concepts.",
        "In a second scenario, STaRS.sys is used to retrieve FDs for a given set of concepts.",
        "Right and wrong concept-feature couples are created to build a questionnaire, in which the patient is required to distinguish the right from the wrong pairs.",
        "For instance, the therapist submits to STaRS.sys a query for features of the concept leopard that are highly relevant and either perceptual or taxonomical, and obtains features such as is yellow with black spots and is a cat.",
        "Finally, in the third scenario the therapist uses STaRS.sys to find concepts for an odd-one-out task.",
        "That is, she looks for triples composed of two similar concepts plus an incoherent one that has to be found by the patient.",
        "As an example, starting from the concept lion, she looks for animals that typically live in a similar/different natural habitat, and obtains similar concepts such as leopard and cheetah, and a dissimilar concept such as wolf."

        "R1 : is cognitively motivated; R2: is based on a fully-specified is-a hierarchy; R3: is intuitive enough to be used by a therapist; R4: allows for the encoding of featural properties and their association to concepts;",
        "While designing the STaRS.sys tool, we made the hypothesis that a semantic lexical resource built according to the WN model could meet most of the above requirements.",
        "In the WN model every concept is represented as a synset (set of synonyms) such as {hand, ma-nus, hook, mauler, mitt, paw}.",
        "Such semantic units are organized in a network interconnected trough several relations.",
        "Examples of semantic relations include the is-a relation, e.g.{left_hand, left} is-a {hand, ...}, and the meronymy relation, e.g. {hand, ...} has-part {finger}.",
        "At a first glance, WN seems to easily meet three of the above criteria.",
        "First, WN was initially conceived as a model of the human lexical memory.",
        "Second, WordNet implement extensive and systematic noun hierarchies.",
        "More specifically, a preliminary analysis of the Italian MWN nominal hierarchy has shown that the semantic categories which are relevant for rehabilitation purposes can be easily mapped onto MWN top level nodes (tools, animals, people).",
        "Third, WN is based on a conceptual model which is relatively simple and near to language use (as opposed to more sophisticated logics-based models).",
        "We expect that this feature will facilitate the use of STaRS.sys by therapists, which may not have all the formal logics awareness that is needed to use formal ontologies.",
        "Furthermore, MWN is manually developed trough an on-line Web application.",
        "We expect that such application can be used by therapists using STaRS.sys for the shared and community-based development/maintenance of the lexical resource they need.",
        "A final motivation in favor of the choice of MWN is the fact that this Italian resource is strictly aligned at the semantic level to English and other European languages (e.g. Spanish, Portuguese, Romania, Hebrew).",
        "Thus, we can envisage that at least part of the semantic information which is encoded for Italian can be ported to the aligned languages and used for similar purposes."

      "heading": "4. Mapping featural descriptions into MWN",
      "text": [
        "Our hypothesis about the usefulness of the WN model for the needs of STaRS.sys can be fully confirmed only if we find a way to encode in such a model all or most of the knowledge which is contained in feature descriptions elicited from Italian speakers (R4 in previous section).",
        "In more general terms we need to answer the following questions.",
        "Does MWN already contain all the information that is needed by the STaRS.sys requirements?",
        "If we need to extend the existing MWN, can we simply add new synsets and instances of existing relations, or do we need to add new relation types?",
        "Is the conceptual model of MWN or of any other WN variant powerful enough to encode all the information contained in feature descriptions?",
        "A first simple approach to representing feature descriptions in MWN is associating feature descriptions to synset glosses.",
        "As a consequence, a MWN gloss, which is currently composed of a definition and a list of usage examples, all crafted by lexicographers, would contain also a list of feature descriptions, elicited from language speakers.",
        "This approach may be useful for some of the foreseen usages of STaRS.sys (e.g. retrieving feature descriptions from concepts), and can also be interesting for a generic use of MWN.",
        "However, to fully exploit the knowledge contained in FDs (e.g. for calculating concept similarity) it is necessary to encode that knowledge in a more explicit way; that is we need to map each FD in a wordnet-like relation between a source and a target concept.",
        "For instance, a pair such as <cup> is used for drinking can be represented as a is usedJor relation holding between the source concept {cup} and the target concept {drink}.",
        "Encoding the source concept is relatively easy given that it is usually expressed as an isolated word that is used as stimulus for feature elicitation from subjects, e.g. \"scimmia\" (\"monkey\").",
        "The only problematic aspect in this step may be the choice of the right sense which was meant when the word has been proposed to subjects.",
        "In some cases this may be not trivial, even if, in principle, stimulus words are supposed to be chosen so as to avoid ambiguities; see for instance the word \"cipolla\" (\"onion\"), which in MWN is ambiguous between the vegetable and food sense.",
        "More complex is the encoding of the feature itself which is a free and possibly complex linguistic description (e.g. likes eating bananas).",
        "To fulfill our goal, we need to map such description in a wordnet-like relation and a target concept.",
        "Such goal can be accomplished in two steps.",
        "Given the semantic requirements illustrated in Sec. 2.1, one the first steps in the development of the STaRS.sys tool has been the design of a classification of FDs in feature types; see Lebani and Pianta (2010).",
        "In a second moment, we realized that assigning a FD to a feature type is equivalent to assigning it to a wordnet relation, given that it is possible to create one-to-one mappings between features types and relations.",
        "The adopted feature type classification has been designed so as to be (1) reasonably intuitive, (2) robust and (3) cognitively plausible.",
        "The cognitive plausibility requirement has been fulfilled by moving from an analysis of similar proposals put forwards in the experimental literature, or exploited in the therapeutic practice.",
        "As for the former, we considered research fields as distant as lexicography, theoretical linguistics and cognitive psychology.",
        "Examples of compatible proposals currently exploited in the therapeutic practice are the question type of Laiacona et al's (1993) semantic questionnaire, a type classification adopted by the therapists of the CIMeC's CeRiN (personal communication) and the Semantic Feature Analysis paradigm (Boyle and Coelho, 1995).",
        "The resulting classification only considers concrete objects and is composed of 25 feature types.",
        "All of them (except the is associated with relations) belong to one of the following six relations) belong to one of the following six major classes: taxonomic properties, part-of- relations, perceptual properties, usage properties, locational properties and associated events and attributes.",

        "The inter-coder agreement between subjects (Fleiss' Multi-7i = 0,73) validated the skeleton of our classification, at the same time suggesting some minor changes that have been applied to the classification proposed here.",
        "An evaluation of the improved classification involving therapists has been planned for the (very near) future.",
        "Note that in order to map all of the feature types into wordnet relations we had to create a number of new relations which are not available in existing wordnets.",
        "The list of existing MWN relations used to encode STaRS.sys feature types includes five items: hypernym, has co-ordinate, has_part, has member, has substance.",
        "The following table contains the list of the 20 additional relations, along with examples.",
        "A second step needed in order to fully represent the semantics of feature descriptions in MWN is the encoding of target concepts.",
        "Target concepts can be expressed by a noun (e.g. has a <neck>), an adjective (e.g. is <big>) or a verb or a verbal construction (e.g. is used for <drinking>, is used to <cut bread>).",
        "In principle this is not problematic as WN encodes all these lexical categories.",
        "What is problematic instead is the possible complexity of target concepts.",
        "Whereas in WN synsets are bound to contain only lexical units (with the few exceptions of the so called artificial nodes), the target of a featural description can be a free combination of words, for instance a noun modified by an adjective (e.g. has a <long neck>), an adjective modified by an adverb (e.g. is <very big>) or a verb with an argument (e.g. is used to <cut bread>).",
        "Forgiving an idea of the phenomenon, consider that 27,6% of the features that composes the experimental sample in",
        "Lebani and Pianta (2010) contain target concepts expressed by free combination of words",
        "The solution we adopted to solve this problem relies on the notion of phraset proposed by Ben-tivogli and Pianta (2003; 2004), that is a data structure used for encoding \"sets of synonymous free combination of words (as opposed to lexical units) which are recurrently used to express a concept\".",
        "In the original proposal, the authors introduced such a data structure to cope with lexical gaps in multingual resources or to encode alternative (linguistically complex) ways of expressing an existing concept.",
        "Phrasets can be associated to existing synsets to represent alternative (non lexical) ways of expressing lexicalized concepts, e.g. the Italian translations of \"dishcloth\":",
        "Synset: {canovaccio, strofinaccio} Phraset: {strofinaccio_per_i_piatti, straccio_per_i_piatti} where \"strofinaccio per i piatti\" and \"straccio per i piatti\" and are free combinations of words.",
        "In alternative, they can be used to represent lexical gaps, such as the Italian translation equivalent of \"breadknife\":",
        "Synset: {GAP}",
        "Phraset: {coltello_da_pane, coltello_per_il_pane}",
        "Phrasets can be annotated by exploiting the com-poses/composed-of lexical relation linking phraset with the synsets corresponding to the concepts that compose it.",
        "For instance the expression in the above phraset is linked by a hypernym and by a composed-of relation with the synset {col-tello} (knife) and {pane} (bread).",
        "As far as FDs are concerned, the use of phrasets is compatible with the received view about the compositional nature of the human conceptual knowledge (Murphy, 2002).",
        "Figure 1 shows how phrasets allow for representing the complex FD <breadknife> is used to cut bread in the MWN model."
