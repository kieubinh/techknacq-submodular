        "Noun classifiers are a typical feature of Chinese that distinguishes itself from many other languages.",
        "In simple terms, a classifier is a morpheme or word used to classify a noun according to its inherent semantic features.",
        "Noun classifiers in Chinese are obligatory as a category of its own and used to specify a noun when it is used with a determiner or a numeral.",
        "In other words, A Chinese classifier is never used independently.",
        "It must occur before a noun with a numeral (e.g., yi 'one', liang 'two', san 'three') and/or a determiner (e.g., zhe 'this', nei 'that'), or",
        "However, the definition of Chinese classifiers is not a simple one.",
        "There are different types of classifiers in terms of their semantic functions.",
        "Some of them carry the unique features of the Chinese language; others are representatives of classifier languages, and yet all of them have the grammatical functions of measure words, which are a universal category in all languages.",
        "Due to the complexity of classifier functions, different definitions and classifications have been found.",
        "However, generally speaking, classifiers refer to common properties of noun objects across domains and common relations of objects in the world, rather than to categories having to do solely with language-internal relations (Lucy, 1992).",
        "Some researchers take a functional approach and define Chinese classifiers based on their grammatical functions.",
        "For example, Chao (1968) divides classifiers into nine categories.",
        "They are \"classifiers or individual measures\", \"classifiers associated with v-o\", \"group measures\", \"partitive measures\", \"container measures\", \"temporary measures\", \"standard measures\", \"quasi-measures or autonomous measures\", and \"measures for verbs of action\".",
        "From his classification we can see that he does not distinguish the concept of a classifier from that of a measure word.",
        "The advantage of such a classification is its inclusion of all the three types of classifiers mentioned above and being able to define them all as measure words, but the disadvantage is that those that are Chinese specific noun classifiers are all treated under the universal concept of measure words.",
        "This may be easy for learners to understand the grammatical functions of Chinese classifiers but the ontological nature of noun objects that classifiers are associated with are certain quantifiers (e.g., ji 'how many', mei 'every').",
        "Such a combination is referred to as a classifier phrase.",
        "largely ignored.",
        "In recent decades, researchers have started to take a cognitive approach to understand the links between nouns and classifiers and found it necessary to make a distinction between classifiers and measure words.",
        "For instance, Tai & Wang (1990:38) state that \"A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual properties, either physically or functionally based, which are permanently associated with entities named by the class of nouns; a measure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity named by a noun. \"",
        "This definition makes a clear distinction between a classifier and a measure word, which is assumed to be helpful for L2 learners to have a better understanding of the cognitive basis of a classifier system.",
        "This is because there are no measure words in English or other European languages that can also function as classifiers in the same sense as Chinese classifiers.",
        "A recent study done by Gao (2010) has shown that Swedish adult learners of Chinese had a lower proficiency in classifier application than their general Chinese proficiency and that most of them were not aware of the difference between the concept of a classifier and that of a measure word.",
        "Other previous studies on classifiers include descriptive and experimental studies of classifier systems of natural languages.",
        "For example, some descriptive studies make typological surveys of classifier systems in different languages (e.g. Allan, 1977; Lyons, 1977; Goddard, 1998); others provide semantic analysis of classifiers and their associated nouns (e.g.",
        "Downing, 1993; Huang & Ahrens, 2003; Matsumoto, 1993), and base on which classifiers and nouns are associated with (Sowa 2000; Philpot et al., 2003; Nichols et al., 2005).",
        "Experimental studies using computer technology to apply findings of classifier knowledge to natural language processing (NLP) have provided a new approach for the semantic analysis of classifiers (e.g. Nirenburg & Raskin, 2004; Hwang et al., 2007, Quek, 2010) and for computer-assisted language learning (e.g. Guo & Zhong, 2005).",
        "However, no e-learning systems developed so far are found to be able to guide second language learners to use the semantic properties to understand the links between classifiers and their associated nouns.",
        "The emergence of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) provides language learners with a user-friendly and flexible e-learning tool.",
        "CALL incorporates technology into the language learning process and also applies itself across a broad spectrum of teaching styles, textbooks, and courses (Donaldson & Haggstrom, 2006).",
        "Its bidirectional and individualized features makes it possible for learners to use it effectively to improve different aspects of language skills (e.g. Mallon 2006;",
        "Chang et al., 2008).",
        "My idea of designing the e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers is similar to that of CALL.",
        "Empirical studies have shown that classifier learning is a big challenge for L2 learners of Chinese.",
        "My argument with regards to Chinese classifier acquisition is that cognitive strategies with a bottom-up approach are the key to the understanding of the complexity of classifier and noun associations.",
        "Therefore, the design of the e-dictionary has a focus on guiding learners to explore the cognitive foundations of classifier-noun relations.",
        "The e-learning system implemented in the e-dictionary is designed to promote self-paced accelerated learning.",
        "It consists of a database of the decomposed semantic features of classifiers and their associated nouns.",
        "These well-defined unique and non-unique features will help learners to take a cognitive approach to explore case by case the matched pairs of classifiers and nouns.",
        "Currently the e-dictionary has included 168 noun classifiers and 680 nouns, of which 80 classifiers and 560 nouns have been analysed and entered into the e-learning database.",
        "My aim is to define and include all Chinese classifiers and their associated nouns and eventually link them to the e-learning system.",

        "Categorical records created as data files are used to store the associated nouns.",
        "The records created so far include 11 categories of nouns described in Section 3.",
        "Such a categorization appears explicit, but its top-down approach fails to reveal the feature-based mapping between a classifier and its associated nouns.",
        "However, the e-learning part of the dictionary can guide learners to search for correct classifier and noun pairs by looking for the defined features of the noun referents in a different database, firstly from those broadly \"thickness\", \"length\", \"function\", etc., to those specific ones extracted from each particular noun referent.",
        "With such a bottom-up approach, the e-dictionary allows users to learn the particular interrelated features of a classifier and its associated noun referents in a case-by-case fashion.",
        "In this way, learners can better understand the point that a classifier reflects the cognitive classification of its associated noun referents.",

        "The e-learning environment in the dictionary also provides learners the noun-classifier phrases that are commonly used but they may not be easy for learners to acquire.",
        "Take the noun classifier zhi for example.",
        "It is associated with noun referents that belong to \"animals and body-parts\", and \"man-made objects\", such as bird, hand, pen, etc.",
        "The unique perceptual features of these noun referents are identified and built into the e-learning system so that users can click different categories in the interface to make particular associations as long as they have some general knowledge of the entities, such as their functions and perceptual features, etc.",
        "4.2 Implementation of Agent-based Model in Classifier E-learning",
        "The e-learning tool in our classifier e-dictionary is targeted for automatic classifier-noun associations.",
        "By adopting an agent-based model (Holland, 1995), we have developed a classifier-noun network for learners to learn step by step classifier phrases.",
        "Included in the prototype model will be nouns and classifiers, divided into two groups of agents.",
        "To design a semantic interface between the two types of agents with a computational approach, a tag is attached to each agent.",
        "The tags are of opposite polarity, one to a noun, and the other to a classifier.",
        "Each tag is a pseudo-binary-bit string of {0, 1, #}, where \"#\" is the \"doesn't care\" symbol.",
        "The position a symbol occupies in the string corresponds to a particular semantic feature of the agent, with \"#\" independent data entries linked to the e-learning tool.",
        "For instance, if a learner wants to know which classifier is the correct one for boat, he can enter the word boat, finds its category as \"vehicles\", choose its shape as \"longitudinal\".",
        "category (see cases where there are two or more items that are indicating that the corresponding feature is not critical for the formulation of the classifier phrase, even though the noun referent owns such a feature.",
        "When a noun agent meets a classifier agent, we line up the two tags and match the digits in one string with those in the other position by position.",
        "To report a match score at the end of this comparison, there are three match rules to follow: (i) it scores 1 given there is a match between two \"1\"s or between two \"0\"s; (ii) it scores 0 given there is a match between a \"1\" and a \"#\" or a \"0\" and a \"#\" or between two \"#\"s; (iii) it scores 1 given there is a match between a \"1\" and a \"0\".",
        "The aggregate match score indicates the likeliness of a correct classifier phrase with the involved classifier and the noun.",
        "More specifically, in this model each tag consists of 4 pseudo-binary bits.",
        "Out of the noun's many semantic features, let's selectively represent two of them: the first feature with the with the last two.",
        "For example, a tag \"1100\" is assigned to the agent (noun) leg to represent the noun's features defined as \"longitudinal\" and \"body-part\" respectively.",
        "In this case, \"longitudinal\" might be considered as the most salient feature of leg with regards to the selection of a classifier.",
        "Hence, it is represented by \"11\".",
        "On the other hand, if \"longitudinal\" is by no means an external or internal feature of the associated noun referent, the symbols at the corresponding positions would be \"00\".",
        "Other possible combinations of symbols such as \"01\" and \"10\" are reserved for fuzzy states, which are associated with marginally accepted classifier phrases.",
        "Besides, the noun referent leg also has a \"body-part\" property listed, but it is not of primary importance for finding its classifier match.",
        "Therefore, it is represented by \"##\" at the last two string positions, rather than explicitly indicated by any of the four combinations mentioned above.",
        "We assign the tags to classifier agents in a similar way.",
        "For instance, \"11##\" may be assigned to the classifier tiao, due to the fact that tiao often occurs in a classifier phrase with nouns defined as having \"longitudinal\" features.",
        "On the other hand, \"##11\" may be assigned to the noun classifier zhi, which is commonly applied to noun referents of body-part.",
        "Regarding the agent's interaction with those agents of classifiers, when the tag \"1100\" of leg is compared with the tag \"11##\" of the agent tiao, the match score is 1+1+0+0 = 2.",
        "In contrast, its match score with the tag \"##11\" of the agent zhi is reported as 0+0+0+0 = -2.",
        "The match score 2 indicates tiao is more likely to be linked to leg, and the match score 2 implies an undesirable match between leg and zhi.",
        "It is noteworthy, however, that if a user assigns \"1111\" to leg, they will obtain a match score of 2 (0+0+1+1) with zhi.",
        "They will hence conclude that, beside tiao, zhi is another correct classifier for leg.",
        "Among the semantic features, some are defined as unique features which distinguish their corresponding nouns from the rest of the nouns' group.",
        "For instance, we may define \"chained jewel\" as the unique feature of a necklace, and \"limbless reptile, some of which produce venom\" as that of a snake (see Figure 1).",
        "We assign two kinds of tags respectively, one for non-unique feature agents and the other for unique feature agents.",
        "Each non-unique feature agent is attached with an adhesion tag (Holland, 1995).",
        "This adhesion tag provides the possibility of forming multi-feature agent aggregates with with a two-segment tag.",
        "The first segment plays the same role as the classifier/noun tag, which controls the agent's interaction with agents of other groups, i.e. nouns and noun classifiers.",
        "The second segment functions simply as an adhesion tag.",
        "To decide whether to form a multi-feature agent aggregate, we can match a non-unique feature agent's adhesion tag and the second",
        "In addition, we include the defined features of nouns and classifiers as a group of interactive agents.",
        "This group is designed to facilitate the",
        "L2 learners for example.",
        "First they may tiao is the correct classifier for leg because the noun referent of leg has the longitudinal attribute.",
        "Next, they tend to look for other nouns with the longitudinal feature, such as necklace and snake, and to verify whether tiao is also the correct classifier for these nouns.",

        "In other words, adhesion does not occur between either two unique feature agents or two en classifi (Holland, 1995).",
        "In our model, both the condition and the action are linguistic variables, which are in turn represented by pseudo-binary-bit strings.",
        "The rules represent the interconnection among the agent group of classifiers, the agent group of nouns, and the group of defined features.",
        "For instance, the same noun classifier tiao occurs in the classifier phrase yi tiao xianglian 'a necklace'.",
        "Let ®, © and © respectively denote the features of \"chained jewel\", \"man-made\", and \"longitudinal\", where ® is the unique feature to identify the noun referent of necklace.",

        "Rule 1 outputs its action as a message, which is subsequently received by Rule 2 as its condition.",
        "This is an example of transitivity, a property of the rule-based network.",
        "The condition and action part in each of the three rules could also be exchanged to implement three inverse rules.",
        "Now let's take a look at the noun snake and its classifier tiao.",
        "Given that ® represents \"animate\" and © represents \"limbless reptile, some of which produce venom\", we can retrieve ©, ©, © from the features' group and form them as another multi-feature agent aggregate as ©©©.",

        "The property of transitivity implies, however, that we can establish the mapping between nouns and non-unique feature agents indirectly.",
        "For example, we represent the relation between the noun necklace and the feature agent ® \"chained jewel\" by Rule lows:",
