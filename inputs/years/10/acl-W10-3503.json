        "The annotation layer is intended for the evaluation of accuracy of linking to Wikipedia in the framework of a coreference resolution system.",
        "1 Introduction",
        "Collaboratively Constructed Resources (CCR) such as Wikipedia are starting to be used for a number of semantic processing tasks that up to few years ago could only rely on few manually constructed resources such as WordNet and Sem-Cor (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The impact of the new resources can be multiplied by connecting them to other existing datasets, e.g. reference corpora.",
        "In this paper we will illustrate an ongoing annotation effort which aims at adding a manual annotation layer connecting an existing annotated corpus such as the English ACE-2005 dataset to a CCR such as Wikipedia.",
        "This effort will produce a new integrated resource which can be useful for the coreference resolution task.",
        "Coreference resolution is the task of identifying which mentions, i.e. individual textual descriptions usually realized as noun phrases or pronouns, refer to the same entity.",
        "To solve this task, especially in the case of non-pronominal co-reference, researchers have recently started to exploit semantic knowledge, e.g. trying to calculate",
        "http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/",
        "the semantic similarity of mentions (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006) or their semantic classes (Ng, 2007; Soon et al., 2001).",
        "Up to now, WordNet has been one of the most frequently used sources of semantic knowledge for the coreference resolution task (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "Researchers have shown, however, that WordNet has some limits.",
        "On one hand, although WordNet has a big coverage of the English language in terms of common nouns, it still has a limited coverage of proper nouns (e.g. Barack Obama is not available in the on-line version) and entity descriptions (e.g. president of India).",
        "On the other hand WordNet sense inventory is considered too finegrained (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001).",
        "In alternative, it has been recently shown that Wikipedia can be a promising source of semantic knowledge for coreference resolution between nominals (Ponzetto and Strube,",
        "2006).",
        "Consider some possible uses of Wikipedia.",
        "For example, knowing that the entity mention \"Obama\" is described on the Wikipedia page Barack_Obama, one can benefit from the Wikipedia category structure.",
        "Categories assigned to the Barack_Obama page can be used as semantic classes, e.g. \"21st-century presidents of the United States\".",
        "Another example of a useful Wikipedia feature are the links between Wikipedia pages.",
        "For instance, some Wikipedia pages contain links to the Barack_Obama page.",
        "Anchor texts of these links can provide alterna-",
        "The links to Wikipedia pages are given displaying only the last part of the link which corresponds to the title of the",

        "The accuracy of linking entity mentions to Wikipedia is a very important issue.",
        "For example, such linking is a step of the approach to coreference resolution described in (Bryl et al., 2010).",
        "In order to evaluate this accuracy in the framework of a coreference resolution system, a corpus of documents, where entity mentions are annotated with ground-truth links to Wikipedia, is required.",
        "The possible solution of this problem is to extend the annotation of entity mentions in a corefer-ence resolution corpus.",
        "In the recent years, coref-erence resolution systems have been evaluated on various versions of the English Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006; Versley et al., 2008; Ng, 2007; Culotta et al., 2007; Bryl et al., 2010).",

        "The annotation is currently in progress.",
        "At the moment of writing this paper we have completed around 55% of the work.",
        "The extension can be exploited by coreference resolution systems, which already use ACE 2005 corpus for development and testing purposes, e.g. (Bryl et al., 2010).",
        "Moreover, English ACE 2005 corpus is multi-purpose and can be used in other information extraction (IE) tasks as well, e.g. relation extraction.",
        "Therefore, we believe that our extension might also be useful for other IE tasks, which exploit semantic knowledge.",

        "evaluation of accuracy of linking to Wikipedia in the framework of a coreference resolution system.",
        "The English ACE 2005 corpus is composed of 599 articles assembled from a variety of sources selected from broadcast news programs, newspapers, newswire reports, internet sources and from transcribed audio.",
        "It contains the annotation of a series of entities (person, location, organization) for a total of 15,382 different entities and 43,624 mentions of these entities.",
        "A mention is an instance of a textual reference to an object, which can be either named (e.g. Barack Obama), nominal (e.g. the president), or pronominal (e.g. he, his, it).",
        "An entity is an aggregate of all the mentions which refer to one conceptual entity.",
        "Beyond the annotation of entities and mentions, ACE 05 contains also the annotation of local co-reference for the entities; this means that mentions which refer to the same entity in a document have been marked with the same ID.",
        "For the purpose of our task, not all the ACE 05 mentions are annotated, but only the named (henceforth NAM) and nominal (henceforth NOM) mentions.",
        "The resulting additional annotation layer will contain a total of 29,300 mentions linked to Wikipedia pages.",
        "As specifically regards the annotation of NAM mentions, information about local coreference contained in ACE 05 has been exploited in order to speed up the annotation process.",
        "In fact, only the first occurrence of the NAM mentions in each document has been annotated and the annotation is then propagated to all the other co-referring NAM mentions in the document.",
        "Finally, it must be noted that in ACE 05, given a complex entity description, both the full extent of the mention (e.g. president of the United States) and its syntactic head (e.g. \"president\") are marked.",
        "In our Wikipedia extension only the head of the mention is annotated, while the full extent of the mention is available from the original ACE 05 corpus.",
        "Depending on the mention type to be annotated, i.e. NAM or NOM, a different annotation strategy has been followed.",
        "Each mention of type NAM is annotated with a link to a Wikipedia page describing the referred entity.",
        "For instance, \"George Bush\" is annotated with a link to the Wikipedia page George_W._Bush.",
        "NOM mentions are annotated with a link to the Wikipedia page which provides a description of its appropriate sense.",
        "For instance, in the example \"I was driving Northwest of Baghdad and I bumped into these guys going around the capital\" the mention \"capital\" is linked to the page which provides a description of its meaning, i.e. Capital_(political).",
        "Note that the object of linking is the textual description of an entity, and not the entity itself.",
        "In the example, even though from the context it is clear that the mention \"capital\" refers to Baghdad, we provide a link to the concept of capital and not to the entity Bagdad.",
        "As a term can have both a more generic sense and a more specific one, depending on the context in which it occurs, mentions of type NOM can often be linked to more than one Wikipedia page.",
        "Whenever possible, the NOM mentions are annotated with a list of links to appropriate Wikipedia pages in the given context.",
        "In such cases, links are sorted in order of relevance, where the first link corresponds to the most specific sense for that term in its context, and therefore is regarded as the best choice.",
        "For instance, for the NOM mention head \"President\" which in the context identifies the United States President George Bush the annotation's purpose is to provide a description of the item \"President\", so the following links are selected as appropriate: President_of_the_ United_States and President.",
        "The correct interpretation of the term is strictly related to the context in which the term occurs.",
        "While performing the annotation, the context of the entire document has always been exploited in order to correctly identify the specific sense of the mention.",
        "The annotation procedure requires that the mention string is searched in Wikipedia in order to find the appropriate page(s) to be used for annotating the mention.",
        "In the annotation exercise, the annotators have always taken into consideration the context where a mention occurs, searching for both the generic and the most specific sense of the mention disambiguated in the context.",
        "In fact, in the example provided above, not only \"President\", but also \"President of the United States\" has been queried in Wikipedia as required by the context.",

        "Disambiguation pages cannot be used as links for the annotation as they are not suitable for the purposes of this task.",
        "In fact, the annotator's task is to disambiguate the meaning of the mention, so one link, pointing to a specific sense, is to be chosen.",

        "1.",
        "As explained before in Section 3.2, as a general rule the head of the ACE 05 mention is annotated with Wikipedia links.",
        "In those cases where the syntactic head of the mention is a multiword lexical unit, the ACE 05 practice is to mark as head only the rightmost item of the multiword.",
        "For instance, in the case of the multiword \"flight attendant\" only \"attendant\" is marked as head of the mention, although \"flight attendant\" is clearly a multiword lexical unit that should be annotated as one semantic whole.",
        "In our annotation we take into account the meaning of the whole lexical unit; so, in the above example, the generic sense of \"attendant\" has not been given, whereas Flight_attendant is considered as the appropriate link.",
        "2.",
        "In some cases, in ACE 2005 pronouns like \"somebody\", \"anybody\", \"anyone\", \"one\", \"others\", were incorrectly marked as NOM (instead of PRO).",

        "3.",
        "When a page exists in Wikipedia for a given mention but not for the specific sense in that context the \"Missing sense\" annotation has been used.",
        "One example of \"Missing sense\" is for instance the term \"heart\" which has 29 links proposed in the \"Disambiguation page\" touching different categories (sport, science, anthropology, gaming, etc.",
        "), but there is no link pointing to the sense of \"center or core of something\"; so, when referring to the heart of a city, the term has been marked as \"Missing sense\".",

        "As reported in Table 8, in the 61,5% of the cases of disagreement, the different annotations are caused by the diverse interpretation of the context and not by the lack of senses in Wikipedia.",
