        "A language model is a probability assignment over all possible word sequences in a natural language.",
        "It assigns a relatively large probability to meaningful, grammatical, or frequent word sequences and a low probability or a zero probability to nonsensical, ungrammatical or rare ones.",
        "The statistical approach used in N-gram language modeling requires a large amount of text data in order to make an accurate estimation of probabilities.",
        "These data are not available in large quantities for under-resourced languages and the lack of text data has a direct impact on the performance of language models.",
        "While the word is usually a basic unit in statistical language modeling, word identification is not a simple task even for languages that separate words by a special character (a white space in general).",
        "For unsegmented languages, which have a writing system without obvious word delimiters, the N-grams of words are usually estimated from the text corpus segmented into words employing automatic methods.",
        "Automatic segmentation of text is not a trivial task and introduces errors due to the ambiguities in natural language and the presence of out of vocabulary words in the text.",
        "While the lack of text resources has a negative impact on the performance of language models, the errors produced by the word segmentation make those data even less usable.",
        "The word N-grams not found in the training corpus could be due not only to the errors introduced by the automatic segmentation but also to the fact that a sequence of characters could have more than one correct segmentation.",
        "In previous article (Seng et al., 2009), we have proposed a method to estimate an N-gram language model from the training corpus on which each sentence is segmented into multiple ways instead of a unique segmentation.",
        "The objective of multiple segmentation is to generate more N-grams from the training corpus to use in language modeling.",
        "It was possible to show that this approach generates more N-grams (compared to the classical dictionary-based unique segmentation method) that are potentially useful and relevant in language modeling.",
        "The application of multiple segmentation in language modeling for Khmer and Vietnamese showed improvement in terms of tri-gram hits and recognition error rate in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.",
        "This work is a continuation of our previous work on the use of multiple segmentation.",
        "It is conducted on Vietnamese only.",
        "A close analysis of N-gram counts shows that the approach has in fact two contributions: boosting the N-gram counts that are generated with first best segmentation and generating new N-grams.",
        "We have also identified that there are N-grams that negatively affect the performance of the language models.",
        "In this paper, we study the contribution of boosting N-gram counts and of new N-grams to the performance of the language models and consequently to the recognition performance.",
        "We also present experiments where rare or bad N-grams are cut off in order to minimize their negative effect on the performance of the language models.",

        "Text segmentation is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "Many NLP applications require the input text segmented into words before making further progress because the word is considered the basic semantic unit in natural languages.",
        "For unsegmented languages segmenting text into words is not a trivial task.",
        "Because of ambiguities in human languages, a sequence of characters may be segmented in more than one way to produce a sequence of valid words.",
        "This is due to the fact that there are different segmentation conventions and the definition of word in a language is often ambiguous.",
        "Text segmentation techniques generally use an algorithm which searches in the text the words corresponding to those in a dictionary.",
        "In case of ambiguity, the algorithm selects the one that optimizes a parameter dependent on the chosen strategy.",
        "The most common optimization strategies consist of maximizing the length of words (\"longest matching\") or minimizing the number of words in the entire sentence (\"maximum matching\").",
        "These techniques rely heavily on the availability and the quality of the dictionaries and while it is possible to automatically generate a dictionary from an unsegmented text corpus using unsupervised methods, dictionaries are often created manually.",
        "The state-of-the-art methods generally use a combination of hand-crafted, dictionary and statistical techniques to obtain a better result.",
        "However, statistical methods need a large corpus segmented manually beforehand.",
        "Statistical methods and complex training methods are not appropriate in the context of under-resourced languages as the resources needed to implement these methods do not exist.",
        "For an under-resourced language, we seek segmentation methods that allow better exploitation of the limited resources.",
        "In our previous paper (Seng et al., 2009) we have indicated the problems of existing text segmentation approaches and introduced a weighted finite state transducer (WFST) based multiple text segmentation algorithm.",
        "Our approach is implemented using the AT & T FSM Toolkit (Mohri et al., 1998).",
        "The algorithm is inspired with the work on the segmentation of Arabic words (Lee et al., 2003).",
        "The multiple segmentation of a sequence of characters is made using the composition of three controllers.",
        "Given a finite list of words we can build a finite state transducer M (or word transducer) that, once composed with an acceptor I of the input string that represent a single character with each arc, generates a lattice of the words that represent all of the possible segmentations.",
        "To handle out-of-vocabulary entries, we make a model of any string of characters by a star closure operation over all the possible characters.",
        "Thus, the unknown word WFST can parse any sequence of characters and generate a unique unk word symbol.",
        "The word transducer can, therefore, be described in terms of the WFST operations as M = (WD U UNK)+ where WD is a WFST that represents the dictionary and UNK represents the unknown word WFST.",
        "Here, U and + are the union and Kleene \"+\" closure operations.",
        "A language model L is used to score the lattice of all possible segmentations obtained by the composition of our word transducer M and the input string I.",
        "A language model of any order can be represented by a WFST.",
        "In our case, it is important to note that only a simple uni-gram language model is used.",
        "The uni-gram model is estimated from a small training corpus segmented automatically into words using a dictionary based method.",
        "The composition of the sequence of input string I with the word transducer M yields a transducer that represents all possible segmentations.",
        "This transducer is then composed with the language model L, resulting in a transducer that represents all possible segmentations for the input string I, scored according to L. The highest scoring paths of the compound transducer is the segmentation m that can be defined as: P {m) =maxP (mk j",
        "The segmentation procedure can then be expressed formally as: m=bestpath ( I°M°L )",
        "where ◦ is the composition operator.",

        "Often, two syllables go together to form a single word, which can be identified by the way it functions grammatically in a sentence.",
        "To have a word-based language model, word segmentation would, therefore, be a must in Vietnamese.",
        "A Vietnamese training corpus that contains 3 millions sentences from broadcast news domain has been used in this experiment.",
        "A Vietnamese dictionary of 30k words has been used both for the segmentation and counting the N-grams.",
        "Therefore, in the experiments, the ASR vocabulary always remains the same and only the language model is changing.",

        "Then, additional language models have been trained using the corpus segmented with N-best segmentation: the number of N-best segmentations to generate for each sentence is fixed to 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 1000.",

        "The model topology is a 3-state, left-to-right HMM with 16 Gaussian mixtures per state.",
        "The preprocessing of the system consists of extracting a 39 dimensional features vector of 13 MFCCs, the first and second derivatives.",
        "The CMU's SphinxTrain has been used to train the acoustic models used in our experiment.",
        "The Vietnamese acoustic modeling training corpus is made up of 14 hours of transcribed read speech.",
        "More details on the automatic speech recognition system for Vietnamese language can be found in (Le et al., 2008).",
        "While the evaluation metric WER (Word Error Rate) is generally used to evaluate and compare the performance of the ASR systems, this metric does not fit well for unsegmented languages because the errors introduced during the segmentation of the references and the output hypothesis may prevent a fair comparison of different ASR system outputs.",
        "We, therefore, used the Syllable Error Rate (SER) as Vietnamese text is composed of syllables naturally separated by white space.",

        "Note that no new tri-grams are added here, and we evaluate only the effect and, therefore, the tri-gram hit remains the same as that of lm_1.",

        "The performance of the language models have been evaluated in terms of perplexity and their contribution to the performance improvement of a speech recognition system.",
        "We have observed (detailed results are not reported here) that boosting only the tri-gram counts has not contributed any improvement in the performance of the language models.",
        "The reason is probably due to the fact that simply updating tri-gram counts without updating the uni-grams and the bi-grams lead to a biased and inefficient LM.",
        "To explore the contributions of only newly added tri-grams, we have added their counts to the N-gram counts of Segmul1.",
