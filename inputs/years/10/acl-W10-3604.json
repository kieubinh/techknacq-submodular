        "A highly inflectional language has the capability of generating hundreds of words from a single root.",
        "Hence, morphological analysis is vital for high level applications to understand various words in the language.",
        "Morphological analyzer forms the foundation for applications like information retrieval, POS tagging, chunking and ultimately the machine translation.",
        "Morphological analyzers for various languages have been studied and developed for years.",
        "But, this research is dominated by the morphological analyzers for agglutinative languages or for the languages like English that show low degree of inflection.",
        "Though agglutinative languages show high morpheme per word ratio and have complex morphotactic structures, the absence of fusion at morpheme boundaries makes the task of segmentation fluent once the model for implementation of morphotactics is ready.",
        "On this background, a morphological analyzer for highly inflectional language like Marathi which has the tendency to overlay the morphemes in a way that aggravates the task of segmentation presents an interesting case study.",
        "Eryigit and Adali (2004) propose a suffix stripping approach for Turkish.",
        "The rule based and agglutinative nature of Turkish allows the language to be modeled using FSMs and does not need a lexicon.",
        "The morphological analyzer does not face the problem of the changes taking place at morpheme boundaries which is not the case with inflectional languages.",
        "Hence, although apprehensible this model is not sufficient for handling the morphology of Marathi.",
        "Many morphological analyzers have been developed using the two-level morphological model (Koskenniemi, 1983) for morphological analysis.",
        "(Oflazer, 1993; Kim et al., 1994) have been developed using PC-Kimmo (Antworth, 1991), a morphological parser based on the two-level model.",
        "Conceptually, the model segments the word in its constituent parts, and accounts for phonological and orthographical changes within a word.",
        "While, the model proves to be very useful for developing the morphological analyzers for agglutinative languages or the languages with very less degree of inflection, it fails to explicitly capture the regularities within and between paradigms present in the inflectional languages.",
        "Marathi has a well defined paradigm-based system of inflection.",
        "Hence, we decided to develop our own model which works on the similar lines of PC-Kimmo (Antworth, 1991) but exploits the usefulness of paradigm-based inflectional system.",

        "To throw the light of role played by morphological analyzer in improving the accuracies of the sequence labelers, we performed the experiments using two sets of features: The Learning Based (LB) labeler was trained using only elementary features whereas Morphologically Driven Learning Based (MDLB) labeler used the morphological features along with the elementary features.",
        "The results were obtained by performing 4-fold cross validation over the corpora.",
        "The average accuracy of MDLB Pos tagger turned out to be 95.03 as compared to 85% of LB.",
