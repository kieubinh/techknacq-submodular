        "Urdu is a Central Indo-Aryan language of the Indo-Iranian branch, belonging to the Indo-European family of languages.",
        "It is the national language of Pakistan.",
        "It is also one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of five Indian states.",
        "Urdu script has 35 simple consonants, 15 aspirated consonants, one character for nasal sound and 15 diacritical marks.",
        "Urdu characters change their shapes depending upon neighboring context.",
        "But generally they acquire one of these four shapes, namely isolated, initial, medial and final.",
        "Urdu characters can be divided into two groups, non-joiners and joiners.",
        "The non-joiners can acquire only isolated and final shape and do not join with the next character.",
        "On contrary joiners can acquire all the four shapes and get merged with the following character.",
        "A group of joiners and/or non-joiner joined together form a ligature.",
        "A word in Urdu is a collection of one or more ligatures.",
        "The isolated form of joiners and non-joiners is shown in figures 1-2.",
        "The space character is used in Urdu both to generate correct shaping and also to separate words.",
        "Though for words ending with non-joiners correct shaping is generated even when space is not typed and thus, many times a user omits the space.",
        "The sequence of Urdu words written together without space is still readable because of the character joining property in Urdu.",
        "As for example, consider the word cluster ^I^jSj^I , which is composed of four words jl5ol, jS , Iij and The Urdu readers can very easily segment and read the four words separately, but the computer will read them as a single word since there is no space in between.",
        "Similarly, the word cluster ^1?%jjjJj is composed of five words(jJ, jjJ, 1£ and ^ ), which can be easily read as five separate words by Urdu readers but will be considered as a single word by the computer.",
        "Another unique feature of Urdu is that the Urdu words are usually written without short vowels or diacritic symbols.",
        "Any machine transliteration or text to speech synthesis system has to automatically guess and insert these missing symbols.",
        "This is a non-trivial problem and requires an in-depth statistical analysis.",
        "An Urdu word is a combination of ligatures (characters which join together) and isolated characters.",
        "For example is composed of isolated characters I and j and ligature 15j .",
        "A ligature or isolated character will be called as Urdu character cluster (UCC) in this paper.",

        "The third problem is the segmentation of unknown word.",

        "The unknown word causes segmentation error since the word does not exist in the dictionary, it could be incorrectly segmented into shorter words.",

        "This algorithm fails to find the correct segmentation in many cases because of its greedy characteristic.",
        "This method first generates all possible segmentations for a sentence and then selects the one that contain the fewest words, which can be done efficiently by using dynamic programming technique.",
        "When the alternatives have the same number of words, the algorithm cannot determine the best candidate and some other heuristics have to be applied.",
        "We tried both longest matching and maximum matching and the smallest unit taken for combining is UCC.",
