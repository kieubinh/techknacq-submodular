        "This is especially true in case of a morphologically rich language like Gujarati, where a single word may take many forms.",
        "The aim is to ensure that related words map to common stem, irrespective of whether or not the stem is a meaningful word in the vocabulary of the language.",
        "Current state of the art approaches to stemming can be classified into three categories, viz., rule based, unsupervised and hybrid.",
        "Building a rule based stemmer for a morphologically rich language is an uphill task considering the different inflectional and morphological variations possible.",
        "Purely unsupervised approaches on the other hand fail to take advantage of some language phenomenon which can be easily expressed by simple rules.",

        "Gujarati has three genders (masculine, neuter and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural) and three cases (nominative, oblique/vocative and locative) for nouns.",
        "The gender of a noun is determined either by its meaning or by its termination.",
        "The nouns get inflected on the basis of the word ending, number and case.",
        "The Gujarati adjectives are of two types - declinable and indeclinable.",

        "Our approach is based on Goldsmith's (2001) take-all-splits method.",
        "Goldsmith's method was purely unsupervised, but we have used a list of hand crafted Gujarati suffixes in our approach to learn a better set of stems and suffixes during the training phase.",
        "In our approach, we make use of a list of Gujarati words extracted from EMILLE corpus for the purpose of learning the probable stems and suffixes for Gujarati during the training phase.",
        "This set of stems and suffixes will be used for stemming any word provided to the stemmer.",
        "We have described the details of our approach below.",
        "During the training phase, we try to obtain the optimal split position for each word present in the Gujarati word list provided for training.",
        "We obtain the optimal split for any word by taking all possible splits of the word (see Figure 1) and choosing the split which maximizes the function given in Eqn 1 as the optimal split position.",
        "The suffix corresponding to the optimal split position is verified against the list of 59 Gujarati suffixes created by us.",
        "If it cannot be generated by agglutination of the hand crafted suffixes, then the length of the word is chosen as the optimal split position.",
        "i.e. the entire word is treated as a stem with no suffix.",
        "i: split position (varies from 1 to L) L: Length of the word",
        "The function used for finding the optimal split position reflects the probability of a particular split since the probability of any split is determined by the frequencies of the stem and suffix generated by that split.",
        "The frequency of shorter stems and suffixes is very high when compared to the slightly longer ones.",
        "Thus the multipliers i (length of stemi) and Li (length of suffixi) have been introduced in the function in order to compensate for this disparity.",
        "Once we obtain the optimal split of any word, we update the frequencies of the stem and suffix generated by that split.",
        "We iterate over the word list and recompute the optimal split position until the optimal split positions of all the words remain unchanged.",
        "The training phase was observed to take three iterations typically.",
        "After the training phase, we have a list of stems and suffixes along with their frequencies.",
        "We use this list to create signatures.",
        "As shown in Figure 2, each signature contains a list of stems and a list of suffixes appearing with these stems.",
        "The signatures which contain very few stems or very few suffixes may not be useful in stemming of unknown words, thus we eliminate the signatures containing at most one stem or at most one suffix.",
        "The stems and suffixes in the remaining signatures will be used to stem new words.",
        "An overview of the training algorithm is shown in Figure 3.",
        "For stemming of any word given to the stemmer, we evaluate the function in Eqn 1 for each possible split using the frequencies of stems and suffixes obtained from the training process.",
