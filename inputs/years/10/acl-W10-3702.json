        "Multi-word units (MWU) are linguistic objects placed between morphology and syntax: their general syntactic behavior makes them similar to free phrases, while some of their idiosyncratic (notably from the morphological point of view) properties call for a lexicalized approach in which they are treated as units of description.",
        "Moreover, MWUs, which encompass such classes as compounds, complex terms, multi-word named entities, etc., often have unique and constant references, thus they are seen as semantically rich objects in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as information retrieval.",
        "One of the main problems here is the conflation of different surface realizations of the same underlying concept by the proper treatment of orthographic (head word vs. headword), morphological (man servant vs. men servants), syntactic (birth date vs. birth of date), semantic (hereditary disease vs. genetic disease) and pragmatic (Prime minister vs. he) variants (Jacquemin, 2001).",
        "In this paper we are mainly interested in orthographic, morphological, and partially syntactic variants of contiguous MWUs (i.e. not admitting insertions of external elements).",
        "Describing them properly is particularly challenging in morphologically rich languages, such as Slavic ones.",
        "We believe that the proper treatment of MWUs in this context calls for a computational approach which must be, at least partially, lexicalized, i.e. based on electronic lexicons, in which MWUs are explicitly described.",
        "Corpus-based machine learning approaches bring interesting complementary robustness-oriented solutions.",
        "However taken alone, they can hardly cope with the following important phenomenon: while MWUs represent a high percentage of items in natural language texts, most of them, taken separately, appear very rarely in corpora.",
        "For instance, (Baldwin and Villavi-cencio, 2002) experimented with a random sample of two hundred English verb-particle constructions and showed that as many as two thirds of them appear at most three times in the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "The variability of MWUs is another challenge to knowledge-poor methods, since basic techniques such as lemmatisation or stemming of all corpus words, result in overgeneral-izations (e.g. customs office vs. *custom office) or in overlooking of exceptions (e.g. passersby).",
        "Moreover, machine learning methods cannot reliably be used alone for less resourced languages.",
        "In such cases an efficient annotation of a large corpus needed for machine learning usually requires the pre-existence of e-lexicons (Savary and Piskorski, 2010).",
        "Despite these drawbacks machine learning allows robustness and a rapid development, while knowledge-based methods in general have the reputation of being very labor intensive.",
        "In this paper we try to show how effective tools of the the latter class can be.",
        "We present two formalisms and tools designed in view of lexicalized MWU variant description: Multiflex and POLENG.",
        "We discuss their expressivity, mainly with respect to Polish.",

        "), (iv) large sizes of inflection paradigms (e.g. dozens of forms in Polish).",
        "A larger class of verbal multiword expressions additionally may show huge variability in word order and insertion of external elements.",
        "For instance in the Polish examples below: (1) requires case-gender-number agreement between the two first components only, in (2) the components agree in case and number but not in gender, (3) admits a variable word order, (4) shows a depreciative paradigm (no plural), (5) includes a foreign lexeme inflected in Polish manner, (6) is characterized by a shift in gender (masculine animate noun is the head of a masculine human compound), and (7) is a foreign compound with unstable Polish gender (masculine, neuter or non-masculine plural).",

        "Due to this complex behavior, as well as to a rich semantic content, MWUs have been a hot topic in international research for quite a number of years (Rayson et al., 2010) in the context of information retrieval and extraction, named entity recognition, text alignment, machine translation, text categorization, corpus annotation, etc.",
        "In this study we are interested in lexical approaches to MWUs, i.e. those in which MWUs are explicitly described on the entry-per-entry basis, in particular with respect to their morpho-syntax.",
        "Earlier examples of such approaches include lexc (Karttunen et al., 1992), FASTR (Jacquemin, 2001), HABIL (Alegria et al., 2004), and Multiflex discussed below.",
        "They mainly concentrate on contiguous nominal and adjectival MWUs, sometimes considering limited insertions of external elements.",
        "More recent approaches, such as (Villavicencio et al., 2004), (Seretan, 2009) and (Grégoire, 2010), increasingly address verbal and other non contiguous multi-word expressions (MWEs).",
        "These studies are complemented by recent advances in parsing: robust and reliable syntactic analysis now available can be coupled with MWEs identification, and possibly also translation.",
        "The POLENG formalism discussed below belongs to some extent to this class oftools.",
        "While the processing of non contiguous MWEs is an important step forward, the morphological phenomena in MWUs should still be addressed withpreci-sion, in particular in inflectionally rich languages.",

        "The POLENG formalism was designed with simplicity, conciseness and practical applicability for the MWU recognition and generation in mind, rather than care for nuances and theoretical coherence or elegance.",
        "As in Multiflex, a two-tier approach was used; however all inflected forms of a MWU are described by means of a compact, linear string rather than a graph.",
        "(One of the advantages of using such an approach is that MWU descriptions can be edited within a regular text input control and can be easily stored in a single database field.)",
        "For instance the term subsydia zielone from example (3) has the following description:",
        "The main drawbacks of the formalism include: (i) the difficulty of conflating variants of MWUs containing numerical expressions (ulica XI Poprzeczna, ulica Jedenasta Poprzeczna '11th Cross Street'), (ii) impossibility of expressing relations existing between an MWU and external elements (e.g. in German die Vereinten Nationen, Vereinte Nationen 'United Nations').",
        "Last but not least, Multiflex is meant for describing only contiguous compounds, i.e. those that admit no insertions of external elements (He made up his bloody mind.",

        "Secondly, inflection variants of single words, such as transformacyj 'transformationflenp1, ' are not distinguished in Morfeusz by grammatical features, thus it is impossible to forbid them in compounds via feature constraints (transfor-macji wolnorynkowych but not *transformacyj wolnorynkowych 'free market transformations').",
        "Thirdly, since depreciativity is modeled in Mor-feusz as inflectional class rather than category it is not easy to obtain depreciative forms of nouns from their base forms (ch opi/ch opy na schwa 'lusty fellows').",

        "• As was the case with Multiflex, some single components (mainly of economical and financial compounds) were absent in the POLENG Polish lexicon.",
        "Nonetheless, inflected forms of an unknown component can be recognized/generated provided that they end in frequent and regular suffixes (e.g. in suffixes typical of adjectives such as -owy, -cyjny) - i.e. \"virtual\" lexemes are created if needed.",

        "MWUs show a complex linguistic behavior, particularly in inflectionally rich languages, such as Slavic ones.",
        "They call for descriptive formalisms that allow to account for their numerous morphological, syntactic and semantic variants.",
        "We have presented two formalisms used for the description of MWUs in Polish, and we have performed a comparative analysis of the two formalisms.",
        "Mul-tiflex aims at a precise and explicit description, as well as at adaptivity to different languages and morphological models.",
        "It allows to conflate many types of MWUs variants such as acronyms, inversions etc.",
        "However its use is relatively slow, and non contiguous units, or units containing semantically free elements ('slots'), cannot be described.",
        "See also (Savary, 2008) for a detailed contrastive analysis of Multiflex with respect to 10 other systems for a lexical description of MWUs in different languages such as (Karttunen et al., 1992), (Jacquemin, 2001), and (Alegria et al., 2004).",
        "POLENG offers a complementary approach: it includes a faster semi-controlled encoding process, allows for the treatment of non contiguous units or 'slots', and was applied to more massive data in professional machine translation.",
        "Its formalism is however more implicit, thus less interoperable, and variant conflation can be done to a limited degree only.",
        "Encoding experiments involving both novice and expert lexicographers showed that both tools can be efficiently used for creating morphological resources of MWUs.",
        "They also allowed to put forward further improvements of our tools such as verifying the completeness of morphological description, checking paradigm identity, and encoding new single-word entries.",
        "Both tools are used for the morphological description of MWUs in different languages, notably Slavic ones, which show a rich inflection system.",
        "They have been used in various NLP applications: computational lexicography, machine translation, term extraction, named entity identification, and text normalization."
