        "An idiom is a multi-word expression that has a figurative meaning that is comprehended in regard to a common use of that expression that is separate from the literal meaning or definition of the words of which it is made (McArthur, 1992).",
        "From a linguistic perspective, idioms are usually presumed to be figures of speech that are contradictory to the principle of compositionality.",
        "The words that construct an idiom no longer keep their original meaning or popular sense, while in the process of its formation it develops a specialized meaning as an entity whose sense is different from the literal meanings of the constituent elements.",
        "Although an idiom is an expression not readily analyzable from its grammatical structure or from the meaning of its component Shiwe n Yu",
        "Key Laboratory of Computational Linguistics of Ministry of Education, Peking University yusw@pku.edu.cn words, it is the distinctive form or construction of a particular language that has a unique form or style characteristic only of that language.",
        "An idiom is also used, in most cases, with some intention of the writer or to express certain emotion or attitude.",
        "Thus in nature, idioms are exaggerative and descriptive and do not belong to the plain type.",
        "Therefore, to classify idioms according to its emotional property or descriptive property is important for many practical applications.",
        "In recent years, emotion classification has become a very popular task in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which tries to predict sentiment (opinion, emotion, etc.)",
        "from texts.",
        "Most research has focused on subjectivity (subjective/objective) or polarity (positive/neutral/negative) classification.",
        "The applications with this respect include human or machine translation, automatic text classification or Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language (TCFL).",
        "For example, when a student learning Chinese as a foreign language encounters an idiom in his or her reading or conversation, for better understanding it is important for him or her to know whether the idiom is used to indicate an appreciative or derogatory sense which is very crucial to understand the attitude of the idiom user.",
        "Another example is that long articles about politics in newspapers often include a lot of idiom usage to boost their expressiveness and these idioms may carry emotional information.",
        "Obviously by knowing the emotional inclination we may easily obtain a clue about the general attitude of the particular medium.",
        "We may even be able to detect or monitor automatically the possible hostile attitude from certain electronic media which today provide so huge amount of information that seems hard for human processing on a daily basis.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the construction of a Chinese Idiom Knowledge Base (CIKB) and introduces its several applications so far.",
        "Section 3 concludes the related work that serves as the basis of the building of CIKB and the emotion classification experiment introduced in this paper.",

        "Knowledge Base",
        "Generally an idiom is a metaphor – a term requiring some background knowledge, contextual information, or cultural experience, mostly to use only within a particular language, where conversational parties must possess common cultural references.",
        "Therefore, idioms are not considered part of the language, but part of a nation's history, society or culture.",
        "As culture typically is localized, idioms often can only be understood within the same cultural background; nevertheless, this is not a definite rule because some idioms can overcome cultural barriers and easily be translated across languages, and their metaphoric meanings can still be deduced.",
        "Contrary to common knowledge that language is a living thing, idioms do not readily change as time passes.",
        "Some idioms gain and lose favor in popular literature or speeches, but they rarely have any actual shift in their constructs as long as they do not become extinct.",
        "In real life, people also have a natural tendency to over exaggerate what they mean or over describe what they see or hear sometimes and this gives birth to new idioms by accident.",
        "Most Chinese idioms (fiKiip: chéng yù, literally meaning \"set phrases\") are derived from ancient literature, especially Chinese classics, and are widely used in written Chinese texts.",
        "Some idioms appear in spoken or vernacular Chinese.",
        "The majority of Chinese idioms consist of four characters, but some have fewer or more.",
        "The meaning of an idiom usually surpasses the sum of the meanings carried by the few characters, as Chinese idioms are often closely related with the fable, story or historical account from which they were originally born.",
        "As their constructs remain stable through history, Chinese idioms do not follow the usual lexical pattern and syntax of modern Chinese language which has been reformed many a time.",
        "They are instead highly compact and resemble more ancient Chinese language in many linguistic features.",
        "Usually a Chinese idiom reflects the moral behind the story that it is derived.",
        "(Lo, 1997)",
        "For example, the idiom \"S^sèy/LÂ\" (pô fù chén zhôu) literally means \"smash the cauldrons and sink the boats.\"",
        "It was based on a historical story where General Xiang Yu in Qin Dynasty (221 B. C. - 207 B. C.) ordered his army to destroy all cooking utensils and boats after they crossed a river into the enemy's territory.",
        "He and his men won the battle for their \"life or death\" courage and \"no-retreat\" policy.",
        "Although there are similar phrases in English, such as \"burning bridges\" or \"crossing the Rubicon\", this particular idiom cannot be used in a losing scenario because the story behind it does not indicate a failure.",
        "Another typical example is the idiom \"/REE|$T\" (guâ tiân lï xià) which literally means \"melon field, under the plum trees\".",
        "Metaphorically it implies a suspicious situation.",
        "Derived from a verse called ((ff^HT» (jün zï xing, meaning \"A Gentleman's Journey\") from Eastern Han",
        ", ^T^iÊM\" (guâ tiân bù nà lü, lï xià bù zhëng guân) which describe a code of conduct for a gentleman that says \"Don't adjust your shoes in a melon field and don't tidy your hat under plum trees\" in order to avoid suspicion of stealing.",
        "However, most Chinese idioms do not possess an allusion nature and are just a combination of morphemes that will give this set phrase phonetic, semantic or formal",
        "expressiveness.",
        "For example, the idiom Uife\" (huân tiân xï di, metaphorically meaning \"be highly delighted\") literally means \"happy heaven and joyful earth\"; or in the idiom \"filfêj \\Wt\" (lâng dâng rù yù, meaning \"be thrown into the jail\"), the word \"filfêj\" is just the sound of a prisoner's fetters.",
        "For the importance of idioms in Chinese language and culture, an idiom bank with about 6,790 entries were included in the most influential Chinese language knowledge base the Grammatical Knowledge base of Contemporary Chinese (GKB) completed by the Institute of Computational Linguistics at Peking University (ICL), which has been working on language resources for over 20 years and building many knowledge bases on Chinese language.",
        "Based on that, the Chinese Idiom Knowledge Base (CIKB) had been constructed from the year 2004 to 2009 and collects more than 38, 000 idioms with more semantic and pragmatic properties added.",
        "Basically the properties of each entry in CIKB can be classified into four categories: lexical, semantic, syntactic and pragmatic, each of which also includes several fields in its container -- the SQL database.",
        "Table 1 shows the details about the fields.",
        "There are three fields of translation as we can see in Table 1.",
        "In spite of the fact that a literal translation of an idiom will not reflect its metaphorical meaning generally, it will still be of value to those who expect to get familiar with the constituent characters and may want to connect its literal meaning with its metaphorical meaning, especially for those learners of Chinese as a foreign language.",
        "The idioms are classified into three grades in terms of appearance in texts and complexity of annotation.",
        "The most commonly used 3,000 idioms serve as the core idioms based on the statistics obtained from the corpus of People's Daily (the year of 1998), a newspaper that has the largest circulation in China.",
        "Another 11,000 idioms are selected into a category named as basic idioms (fully annotated in every field) and the total 38,117 forms the whole knowledge base.",
        "Its hierarchical structure can be seen in Figure 1.",
        "The syntactic category aims at NLP tasks like automatic identification or machine translation.",
        "Compared with English idioms, the identification of Chinese idioms is not so difficult for its fossilized structure, i.e. continuity in a text.",
        "To build a lexicon like CIKB will complete the task successfully.",
        "As for machine translation, however, it is completely another story because the compositional complexity of Chinese idioms enables them to function as different syntactic constituents with variable part-of-speech (POS).",
        "We classify them into nine categories according to its compositional relations of the morphemes and into seven categories according to its syntactic functions that they may serve in a sentence, as is shown in Table 2.",

        "Upon the completion of CIKB, a few research projects have been conducted to investigate possible applications.",
        "Li (2006) investigates the frequency and formation of idiom usage in People's Daily and Wang (2010) selects 1,000 popular idioms from CIKB to compile a book for Chinese learners.",
        "On the basis of CIKB, we also made a couple of attempts on the automatic classification of idioms to identify the token-level characteristics of an idiom.",
        "This paper will focus on the emotion classification of idioms with machine learning method and the work will be elaborated in section 4.",
        "Here we define the emotion types as \"appreciative (A)\", \"derogatory (D)\" and \"neutral (N)\"."
