        "A lexicon of multiword expressions (MWEs) has a significant importance as a linguistic resource because MWEs cannot usually be analyzed literally, or word-for-word.",
        "In this paper we apply three approaches to the extraction of Arabic MWEs from multilingual, bilingual, and monolingual data sources.",
        "We rely on linguistic information, frequency counts, and statistical measures to create a refined list of candidates.",
        "We validate the results with manual and automatic testing.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: in this introduction we describe MWEs and provide a summary of previous related research.",
        "Section 2 gives a brief description of the data sources used.",
        "Section 3 presents the three approaches used in our experiments, and each approach is tested and evaluated in its relevant sub-section.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the results of the experiments.",
        "Finally, we conclude in Section 5.",
        "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are defined as idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries or spaces (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "The exact meaning of an MWE is not directly obtained from its component parts.",
        "Accommodating MWEs in NLP applications has been reported to improve tasks, such as text mining (SanJuan and Ibekwe-SanJuan, 2006), syntactic parsing (Nivre and Nils-son, 2004; Attia, 2006), and Machine Translation (Deksne, 2008).",
        "There are two basic criteria for identifying MWEs: first, component words exhibit statistically significant co-occurrence, and second, they show a certain level of semantic opaqueness or non-compositionality.",
        "Statistically significant cooccurrence can give a good indication of how likely a sequence of words is to form an MWE.",
        "This is particularly interesting for statistical techniques which utilize the fact that a large number of MWEs are composed of words that co-occur together more often than can be expected by chance.",
        "The compositionality, or decomposability (Villavicencio et al.",
        "2004), of MWEs is also a core issue that presents a challenge for NLP applications because the meaning of the expression is not directly predicted from the meaning of the component words.",
        "In this respect, composition-alily varies between phrases that are highly compositional, such as, IJjJL.j-k.s- Ixs-Li qa-",
        "idatun askariyyatun, \"military base\", and those that show a degree of idiomaticity, such as, \"&x* jjA^ i madiynatu 'l-malahiy, \"amusement park\", lit.",
        "\"city of amusements\".",
        "In extreme cases the meaning of the expression as a whole is utterly unrelated to the component words, such as, ^/ iyjJ\\ farasu 'l-nabiyyi, \"grasshopper\", lit.",
        "\"the horse of the Prophet\".",
        "A considerable amount of research has focused on the identification and extraction of MWEs.",
        "Given the heterogeneity of MWEs, different approaches were devised.",
        "Broadly speaking, work on the extraction of MWEs revolves around four approaches: (a) statistical methods which use association measures to rank MWE candidates (Van de Cruys and Moiron, 2006); (b) symbolic methods which use morpho-syntactic patterns (Vintar and Fiser, 2008); (c) hybrid methods which use both statistical measures and linguistic filters (Boulak-nadel et al.",
        "2009; Duan et al., 2009); and (d) word alignment (Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006).",
        "None of the approaches is without limitations.",
        "It is difficult to apply symbolic methods to data with no syntactic annotations.",
        "Furthermore, due to corpus size, statistical measures have mostly been applied to bigrams and trigrams, and it becomes more problematic to extract MWEs of more than three words.",
        "As a consequence, each approach requires specific resources and is suitable for dealing with only one side of a multifaceted problem.",
        "Pecina (2010) evaluates 82 lexical association measures for the ranking of collocation candidates and concludes that it is not possible to select a single best universal measure, and that different measures give different results for different tasks depending on data, language, and the types of MWE that the task is focused on.",
        "Similarly, Ramisch et al.",
        "(2008) investigate the hypothesis that MWEs can be detected solely by looking at the distinct statistical properties of their individual words and conclude that the association measures can only detect trends and preferences in the co-occurrences of words.",
        "A lot of effort has concentrated on the task of automatically extracting MWEs for various languages besides English, including Slovene (Vin-",
        "Czech (Pecina, 2010), Dutch (Van de Cruys and Moiron, 2006), Latvian (Deksne, 2008) and German ( Zarrieß and Kuhn, 2009).",
        "A few papers, however, focus on Arabic",
        "MWEs.",
        "Boulaknadel et al.",
        "(2009) develop a hybrid multiword term extraction tool for Arabic in the \"environment\" domain.",
        "Attia (2006) reports on the semi-automatic extraction of various types of MWEs in Arabic and how they are used in an LFG-based parser.",
        "In this paper we report on three different methods for the extraction of MWEs for Arabic, a less resourced language.",
        "Our approach is linguistically motivated and can be applied to other languages."

        "WK contains additional information that proved to be helpful for linguistic processing such as a category taxonomy and cross-referencing.",
        "Each article in WK is assigned a category and may be also linked to equivalent articles in other languages through what are called \"interwiki links\".",
        "It also contains \"disambiguation pages\" for resolving the ambiguity related to names that have variant spellings.",

        "In our analysis ofPWN 3.0 we find that MWEs are widespread among all the categories, yet with different proportions, as shown by Table 1.",
        "Arabic WordNet (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006) is constructed according to the methods and techniques used in the development of PWN, but it is limited in size, containing only 11,269 synsets (including 2,348 MWEs).",

        "A crucial factor in the selection of the approach is the availability of rich resources that have not been exploited in similar tasks before.",
        "We focus on nominal MWEs because the vast majority of MWEs are nouns, as evidenced by statistics in Table 1 above.",
        "We define nominal MWEs as MWEs that act as nouns and have the internal structure of either:",
        "- noun-noun, such as j^/^l Si_ji duwdatu 'lard, \"earthworm\"; - noun-adjective, such as Çhjt olsU – j isafatun awwaliyyatun, \"first aid\"; - noun-preposition-noun, such as, ^Js- AyUI Ju-LA\\ al-tazallug ala 'l-galiyd, \"Skiing', lit.",

        "We use three approaches to identify and extract MWEs: (a) crosslingual correspondence asymmetries, (b) translation-based extraction, and (c) corpus-based statistics.",
        "For each approach we use a number of linguistic and statistical validation techniques and both automatic and manual evaluation.",
        "In the first approach (Section 3.1) we make use of the crosslingual correspondence asymmetry, or many-to-one relations between the titles in the Arabic Wikipedia (AWK) and the corresponding titles in other languages to harvest MWEs.",
        "In the second approach (Section 3.2) we assume that automatic translation of MWEs collected from PWN into Arabic are high likelihood MWE candidates that need to be automatically checked and validated.",
        "In the third approach (Section 3.3) we try to detect MWEs in a large raw corpus relying on statistical measures and POS-annotation filtering.",
        "In this approach, our focus is on semantic non-decomposable MWEs and we rely on Crosslin-gual Correspondence Asymmetries (CCAs) for capturing them.",
        "Semantic non-compositionality can be considered as a powerful indication that a phrase is an MWE.",
        "Baldwin et al.",
        "(2003) classify MWEs, with respect to compositionality, into three categories: (a) non-compositional MWEs, where the expression is semantically impenetrable, such as hot dog, (b) idiosyncratically compositional, where the component words are forced to take semantics unavailable outside the MWE, such as radar footprint, and (c) simply compositional, where the phrase is institutionalized, such as traffic light.",
        "This, however, can only serve as an approximation, not as a clear-cut division.",

        "These two indications have been exploited differently by different researchers.",
        "Van de Cruys and Moiron (2006) develop an unsupervised method for detecting MWEs using clusters of semantically related words and taking the ratio of the word preference over the cluster preference as an indication of how likely a particular expression is to be an MWE.",

        "Moiron and Tiedemann (2006) use word alignment of parallel corpora to locate the translation of an MWE in a target language and decide whether the original expression is idiomatic or literal.",
        "The technique used here is inspired by that of Zarrieß and Kuhn (2009) who rely on the linguistic intuition that if a group of words in one language is translated as a single word in another language, this can be considered as an indication that we have a fixed expression with a non-compositional meaning.",
        "They applied their data-driven method to the German-English section of the Europarl corpus after preprocessing with dependency parsing and word alignment, and tested their method on four German verb lemmas.",
        "We also utilize CCAs for the task of MWE extraction.",
        "As an approximation we make a binary decision between whether an expression is decomposable or non-decomposable based on the criterion of single word translatability.",
        "This technique follows Zarrieß and Kuhn's (2009) assumption that the idiosyncrasy and non-compositionality of MWEs makes it unlikely, to some extent, to have a mirrored representation in the other languages.",
        "We consider many-to-one correspondence relationships (an MWE in one language has a single-word translation in another language) as empirical evidence for the detection of MWEs.",
        "Here our candidate MWEs are the AWK titles that are made up of more than one word.",
        "For each of them we check whether there exists a many-to-one correspondence relation for this title in other languages (the translations are obtained by exploiting the interlingual links of AWK).",
        "To increase the predictive power of our approach and ensure that the results are more representative we expand the search space into 21 languages, rather than only one, as in Zarrieß and Kuhn (2009).",
        "This approach helps us with idiomatic MWEs.",
        "For non-idiomatic MWEs we rely on the second and third methods discussed in 3.2 and 3.3 respectively.",
        "The steps undertaken in this approach are: (1) Candidate Selection.",
        "All AWK multiword titles are taken as candidates.",
        "(2) Filtering.",
        "We exclude titles of disambiguation and administrative pages.",
        "(3) Validation.",
        "This includes two steps.",
        "First, we check if there is a single-word translation in any of the target languages.",
        "Second, we look for the candidate and/or its translations in LRs; the Italian, Spanish, and English translations are looked up in the corresponding WordNets while both the AWK title and its translations are looked up in a multilingual lexicon of Named Entities (NEs), MINELex (Attia et al., 2010).",
        "If the candidate title is found in MINELex or if any of its translations is a single word or is found in any WordNet or in MINELex, then the AWK title is classified as a MWE.",
        "Otherwise, it is considered a non-MWE.",
        "It is worth-noting that many titles in the AWK are named entities (NEs).",
        "We conduct our evaluation on a set of 1100 multiword titles from AWK that have been manually tagged as: non-NE-MWEs (181), NE-MWEs (849) or non-MWEs (70).",
        "Given the high percentage of NE-MWEs in the set we derive two gold standards: the first includes NEs as MWEs, and is made up of 1030 MWEs and 70 non-MWEs, and the second drops NEs and hence consists of 251 entries (181 MWEs and 70 non-MWEs).",
        "In the experiment these sets are matched with our validation approach.",
        "Table 2 compares the results of our experiment (CCA) with a baseline, which considers all multiword titles as MWEs, in terms of precision, recall, Fß=1and Fß=o.5.",
        "We notice that our precision is substantially higher for both sets.",
        "Some examples of the CCA method are given in Table 3.",
        "Table 2: Evaluation (in percent) of the CCA approach.",
        "Table 3: MWE identification through correspondence asymmetries.",
        "The first column shows the Arabic candidate MWE.",
        "The second column is the English translation of the expression.",
        "The third column is the number oflanguages that have correspondences for the Arabic expression.",
        "The last column is the ratio of many-to-one correspondences where 100% means that all other the languages have the expression as one word, and 0% means that all other languages have a parallel compositional phrase.",
        "This approach is bilingual and complements the first approach by focusing on compositional compound nouns which the many-to-one correspondence approach is not likely to identify.",
        "We collect English MWEs from PWN, translate them into Arabic, and automatically validate the results.",
        "This technique also has an ontological advantage as the translated and validated expressions can be used to extend the Arabic WordNet by linking the expressions to their respective synsets.",
        "This method is partly similar to that of Vin-tar and Fiser (2008) who automatically extended the Slovene WordNet with nominal multiword expressions by translating the MWEs in PWN using a technique based on word alignment and lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "Here we also use the MWEs in PWN as a starting point to collect MWEs in our target language, Arabic.",
        "We depart from Vintar and Fisser (2008) in that instead of using a parallel corpus to find the translation, we use an off-the-shelf SMT system, namely Google Translate.",
        "The reason we did not use an alignment-based approach is that word alignment, per se, is complex and the quality of the output is dependent on the size and domain of the corpus as well as on the quality of the alignment process itself.",
        "Therefore, we use a state-of-art MT system and concentrate on validating the results using frequency statistics.",
        "The rationale behind this technique is that we try to discover MWEs by inducing and analysing a translation model.",
        "We assume that an MWE in one language is likely to be translated as an MWE in another language, although we are aware that translations into single words or paraphrases are also possible.",
        "First, we extract the list of nominal MWEs from PWN 3.0.",
        "This provides us with predefined knowledge of what concepts are likely to be represented as MWEs in the target language.",
        "Second, we translate the list into Arabic using Google Translate.",
        "Third, we validate the results, by asking a different question: given a list of candidate translations, how likely are they to be correct translations and how well do they correspond to MWEs?",
