        "Collocations constitute a central language phenomenon and an impressive amount of work has been devoted over the past decades to the automatic acquisition of collocational resources - as attested, among others, by initiatives like the MWE 2008 shared task aimed at creating a repository of reference data (Gr√©goire et al., 2008).",
        "However, little or no reference exist in the literature about",
        "!We adopt the lexicographic understanding for the term collocation (Benson et al., 1986), as opposed to the British contextualist tradition focused on statistical co-occurrence (Firth, 1957; Sinclair, 1991).",
        "the actual use made of these resources in other NLP applications.",
        "In this paper, we consider the particular application of syntactic parsing.",
        "Just as other types of multi-word expressions (henceforth, MWEs), collocations are problematic for parsing because they have to be recognised and treated as a whole, rather than compositionally, i.e., in a word by word fashion (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "The standard approach in dealing with MWEs in parsing is to apply a \"words-with-spaces\" preprocessing step, which marks the MWEs in the input sentence as units which will later be integrated as single blocks in the parse tree built during analysis.",
        "We argue that such an approach, albeit sufficiently appropriate for some subtypes of MWEs, is not really adequate for processing collocations.",
        "Unlike other expressions that are fixed or semi-fixed, collocations do not allow a \"words-with-spaces\" treatment because they have a high morpho-syntactic flexibility.",
        "There is no systematic restriction, for instance, on the number of forms a lexical item (such as a verb) may have in a collocation, on the order of items in a collocation, or on the number of words that may intervene between these items.",
        "Collocations are situated at the intersection of lexicon and grammar; therefore, they cannot be accounted for merely by the lexical component of a parsing system, but have to be integrated to the grammatical component as well, as the parser has to consider all the possible syntactic realisations of collocations.",
        "Alternatively, a post-processing approach (such as the one we pursued previously in Wehrli et al.",
        "(2009b)) would identify collocations after the syntactic analysis has been performed, and output a parse tree in which collocational relations are highlighted between the composing items, in order to inform the subsequent processing applications (e.g., a machine translation application).",
        "Again, this solution is not fully appropriate, and the reason lies with the important observation that prior collocational knowledge is highly relevant for parsing.",
        "Collocational restrictions are, along with other types of information like selectional preferences and subcategorization frames, a major means of structural disambiguation.",
        "Collocational relations between the words in a sentence proved very helpful in selecting the most plausible among all the possible parse trees for a sentence (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Alshawi and Carter, 1994; Berthe question whether collocations should be identified in a sentence before or after parsing is not an easy one.",
        "The previous literature on parsing and collocations fails to provide insightful details on how this circular issue is (or can be) solved.",
        "In this paper, we argue that the identification of collocations and the construction of a parse tree are interrelated processes, that must be accounted for simultaneously.",
        "We present a processing model in which collocations, if present in a lexicon, are identified in the input sentence during the analysis of that sentence.",
        "At the same time, they are used to rank competing parsing hypotheses.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews the previous work on the interrelation between parsing and processing of collocations (or, more generally, MWEs).",
        "Section 3 introduces our approach, and section 4 evaluates it by comparing it against the standard non-simultaneous approach.",
        "Section 5 provides concluding remarks and presents directions for future work."

        "Extending the lexical component of a parser with MWEs was proved to contribute to a significant improvement of the coverage and accuracy of parsing results.",
        "For instance, Brun (1998) compared the coverage of a French parser with and without terminology recognition in the preprocessing stage.",
        "She found that the integration of 210 nominal terms in the preprocessing components of the parser resulted in a significant reduction of the number of alternative parses (from an average of 4.21 to 2.79).",
        "The eliminated parses were found to be semantically undesirable.",
        "No valid analysis were ruled out.",
        "Similarly, Zhang and Kor-doni (2006) extended a lexicon with 373 additional MWE lexical entries and obtained a significant increase in the coverage of an English grammar (14.4%, from 4.3% to 18.7%).",
        "In the cases mentioned above, a \"words-with-spaces\" approach was used.",
        "In contrast, Ale-gria et al.",
        "(2004) and Villavicencio et al.",
        "(2007) adopted a compositional approach to the encoding of MWEs, able to capture more morpho-syntactically flexible MWEs.",
        "Alegria et al.",
        "(2004) showed that by using a MWE processor in the preprocessing stage of their parser (in development) for Basque, a significant improvement in the POS-tagging precision is obtained.",
        "Villavicencio et al.",
        "to the lexicon led to a significant increase in the grammar coverage (from 7.1% to 22.7%), without altering the grammar accuracy.",
        "An area of intensive research in parsing is concerned with the use of lexical preferences, cooccurrence frequencies, collocations, and contextually similar words for PP attachment disambiguation.",
        "Thus, an important number of unsupervised (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2000), supervised (Alshawi and Carter, 1994; Berthouzoz and Merlo, 1997), and combined (Volk, 2002) methods have been developed to this end.",
        "However, as Hindle and Rooth (1993) pointed out, the parsers used by such methods lack precisely the kind of corpus-based information that is required to resolve ambiguity, because many of the existing attachments may be missing or wrong.",
        "The current literature provides no indication about the manner in which this circular problem can be circumvented, and on whether flexible MWEs should be processed before, during or after the sentence analysis takes place."

      "text": [
        "As argued by many researchers - e.g., Heid (1994) - collocation identification is best performed on the basis of parsed material.",
        "This is due to the fact that collocations are co-occurrences of lexical items in a specific syntactic configuration.",
        "The collocation break record, for instance, is obtained only in the configurations where break is a verb whose direct object is (semantically) headed by the lexical item record.",
        "In other words, the collocation is not defined in terms of linear proximity, but in terms of a specific grammatical relation.",
        "As the examples in this section show, the relative order of the two items is not relevant, nor is the distance between the two terms, which is unlimited as long as the grammatical relation holds.",
        "In our system, the grammatical relations are computed by a syntactic parser, namely, Fips (Wehrli, collocation identification process took place at the end of the parse in a so-called \"interpretation\" procedure applied to the complete parse trees.",
        "Although quite successful, this way of doing presents a major drawback: it happens too late to help the parser.",
        "This section discusses this point and describes the alternative that we are currently developing, which consists in identifying collocations as soon as possible during the parse.",
        "One of the major hurdles for non-deterministic parsers is the huge number of alternatives that must be considered.",
        "Given the high frequency of lexical ambiguities, the high level of non-determinism of natural language grammars, grammar-based parsers are faced with a number of alternatives which grows exponentially with the length of the input sentence.",
        "Various methods have been proposed to reduce that number, and in most cases heuristics are added to the parsing algorithm to limit the number of alternatives.",
        "Without such heuristics, the performance of a parser might not be satisfactory enough for large scale applications such as machine translation or other tasks involving large corpora.",
        "We would like to argue, along the lines of previous work (section 2), that collocations can contribute to the disambiguation process so crucial for parsing.",
        "To put it differently, identifying collocations should not be seen as a burden, as an additional task the parser should perform, but on the contrary as a process which may help the parser through the maze of alternatives.",
        "Collocations, in their vast majority, are made of frequently used terms, often highly ambiguous (e.g., break record, loose change).",
        "Identifying them and giving them high priority over alternatives is an efficient way to reduce the ambiguity level.",
        "Ambiguity reduction through the identification of collocations is not limited to lexical ambiguities, but also applies to attachment ambiguities, and in particular to the well-known problem of PP attachment.",
        "Consider the following French examples in which the prepositions are highlighted:",
        "(1)a. ligne de partage des eaux (\"watershed\")",
        "b. systeme de gestion de base de donnees (\"database management system\") c. force de maintien de la paix (\"peacekeeping",
        "d. organisation de protection de l'environnement (\"environmental protection agency\")",
        "In such cases, the identification of a noun-preposition-noun collocation will prevent or discourage any other type of prepositional attachment that the parser would otherwise consider.",
        "To fulfill the goal of interconnecting the parsing procedure and the identification of collocations, we have incorporated the collocation identification mechanism within the constituent attachment procedure of our parser Fips (Wehrli, 2007).",
        "This parser, like many grammar-based parsers, uses left attachment and right attachment rules to build respectively left subconstituents and right sub-constituents.",
        "Given the fact that Fips' rules always involve exactly two constituents - see Wehrli (2007) for details - it is easy to add to the attachment mechanism the task of collocation identification.",
        "To take a very simple example, when the rule attaching a prenominal adjective to a noun applies, the collocation identification procedure is invoked.",
        "It first verifies that both terms bear the lexical feature [+partOfCollocation], which signals that a given word is associated in our lexical database to one or several collocations, and then searches the collocation database for an adjective-noun collocation with those two terms.",
        "If successful, the corresponding parse tree will be given a high priority.",
        "With examples such as loose change, the identification of the collocation will immediately relegate any (partial) analysis based on the verbal reading of either terms.",
        "To take a somewhat more complex example, consider a verb-object collocation such as break record, as in example (2).",
        "(2) a. John broke a record.",
        "Here, it is a right attachment rule which will trigger the identification procedure.",
        "To be precise, the right attachment rule in this case concerns the attachment of the noun record as complement of the indefinite determiner (head of the DP direct object of the verb).",
        "The identification procedure considers, in turn, all the governing nodes dominating the noun record, halting at the first node of category Noun, Verb or Adjective.",
        "In our example, the determiner node and then the verb node will be considered.",
        "Notice that the procedure will, quite correctly, identify a collocation in the French example (3a), but not in (3b), although both structures are identical.",
        "The reason has to do with the fact that the noun governing record in the first example is a [+number] noun, that is a classifier noun which is transparent for the identification procedure.",
        "(3) a. Jean a battu un grand nombre de records.",
        "\"Jean broke a large number of records\" b. Jean a battu le detenteur du record.",
        "\"Jean has beaten the holder of the record\"",
        "As in the other examples, an analysis in which a collocation has been found is given high priority over alternatives.",
        "In the case of (2), this will relegate potential analyses based on the adjectival reading of broke or the verbal reading of record.",
        "Notice that exactly the same procedure applies when the trace of an extraposed element is (right) inserted, as in the examples (4), which illustrate the case of wh-interrogative (a), relative clause (b), tough-movement (c).",
        "(4) a.",
        "Which record will Paul try to break ?",
        "b.",
        "The record Paul broke was very old.",
        "c. This record is difficult to break.",
        "In all such cases, that is, when the right inserted element is a trace, the identification procedure will consider its antecedent, or to be more precise, the semantic head of its antecedent.",
        "Finally, the grammatical processes involved in example (4a,c) can combine as in the more complex example (5), for which we give the slightly simplified structure with the chain of elements with index i extending from the fronted wh-phrase which record to the direct object position of the verb break, via the direct object position of the verb consider and the subject position of the secondary predicate (FP) headed by the [+tough] adjective difficult.",
        "(5) a.",
        "Which record did Paul consider difficult to",
        "As stated, for instance, by (Heid, 1994), collocations can involve more than two (main) terms and it is possible to adopt a recursive definition of collocations, i.e., complex collocations can be viewed as collocations of collocations.",
        "The collocation identification procedure has been extended to handle such cases.",
        "Consider examples (6) below.",
        "(6) a.",
        "La voiture tombera probablement en panne d'essence.",
        "\"the car will probably run out of gas\" b. natural language processing c. He broke a world record.",
        "In the French sentence (6a), panne d'essence (literally, \"breakdown of gas\", \"out of gas\") is a collocation of type Noun+Prep+Noun, which combines with the verb tomber (literally, \"to fall\") to form a larger collocation of type Verb+PrepObject tomber en panne d'essence (\"to run out of gas\").",
        "Given the strict left to right processing order assumed by the parser, it will first identify the collocation tomber en panne (\"to break down\") when attaching the word panne.",
        "Then, reading the last word, essence (\"gas\"), the parser will first identify the collocation panne d'essence.",
        "Since that collocation bears the lexical feature [+partOfCollocation], the identification procedure goes on, through the governors of that item.",

        "We extend this comparison by performing a task-based evaluation, which investigates the impact that the new method has on the quality of translations produced by a machine translation system relying on our parser (Wehrli et al., 2009a).",
        "The data considered in this experiment consist of a subpart of a corpus of newspaper articles collected from the on-line version of The Economist, containing slightly more that 0.5 million words.",
        "On these data, we run two versions of our parser:",
        "‚Ä¢ V1: a version implementing the previous method of collocation identification,",
        "‚Ä¢ V2: a version implementing the new method described in section 3.",
        "The lexicon of the parser was kept constant, which is to say that both versions used the same lexicon (which contains slightly more than 7500 English collocation entries), only the parsing module handling collocations was different.",
        "From the output of each parser version, we collected statistics on the number of collocations (present in the lexicon) that were identified in the test corpus.",
        "More precisely, we traversed the output trees and counted the items that were marked as collocation heads, each time this was the case (note that an item may participate in several collocations, not only one).",
        "Table 1 presents the number of collocations identified, both with respect to collocation instances and collocation types.",
        "As the results show, the new method (column V2) is more efficient in retrieving collocation instances.",
        "It detects 696 more instances, which correspond to an increase of 14.8% relative to the previous method (column V1).",
        "As we lack the means to compare on a large scale the corresponding syntactic trees, we can only speculate that the increase is mainly due to the fact that more appropriate analyses are produced by the new method.",
        "A large number of instances are found by both versions of the parser.",
        "The difference between the two methods is more visible for some syntactic types than for others.",
        "Table 2 details the number of instances of each syntactic type which are retrieved exclusively by one method or by the other.",
        "To measure the precision of the two methods, we randomly selected 20 collocation instances among those identified by each version of the parser, V1 and V2, and manually checked whether these instances are correct.",
        "Correctness means that in the given context (i.e., the sentence in which they were identified), the word combination marked as instance of a lexicalized collocation is indeed an instance of that collocation.",

        "The precision obtained is 90% for V1, and 100% for V2.",
        "The small size of test set is motivated by the fact that the precision is expected to be very high, since the presence of both collocation components in a sentence in the relevant syntactic relation almost certainly means that the recognition of the corresponding collocation is justified.",
        "Exceptions would correspond to a minority of cases in which the parser either wrongly establishes a relation between two items which happen to belong to an entry in the lexicon, or the two items are related but the combination corresponds to a literal usage (examples are provided later in this section).",
        "The errors of V1 correspond, in fact, to cases in which a combination of words used literally was wrongly attributed to a collocation: in example (8a), V1 assigned the words on and business to the lexical entry on business, and in example (8b), it assigned in and country to the entry in the country.",

        "Thus, the precision of V1, when measured on the tokens in \"V1 only\", was 65%.",
        "The precision of V2 on \"V2 only\" was 90%.",
        "The 2 errors of V2 concern the pair in country, found in contexts similar to the one shown in example (8b).",
        "The errors of V1 also concerned the same pair, with one exception - the identification of the collocation world trade from the context the destruction of the World Trade Centre.",
        "Since World Trade Centre is not in the parser lexicon, V1 analysed it and assigned the first two words to the entry world trade.",

        "In this experiment, we considered the test set described in section 4.2 and we manually evaluated the translation obtained for each collocation instance.",
        "Both subsets (100 English sentences and 100 Italian sentences) were translated into French.",
        "We compared the translations obtained by relying on the versions V1 and V2 of our parser (recall that V2 corresponds to the newly-proposed method and V1 to the previous method).",
        "The use of automatic metrics for evaluating the translation output was not considered appropriate in this context, since such n-gram based metrics underestimate the effect that the substitution of a single word (like in our case, the verb in a verb-object collocation) has on the fluency, adequacy, and even on the interpretability of the output sentence.",

        "In this paper, we addressed the issue of the interconnection between collocation identification and syntactic parsing, and we proposed an original solution for identifying collocations in a sentence as soon as possible during the analysis (rather than at the end of the parsing process).",
        "The major advantage of this approach is that collocational information may be used to guide the parser through the maze of alternatives.",
        "The experimental results performed showed that the proposed method, which couples parsing and collocation identification, leads to substantial improvements in terms of precision and recall over the standard identification method, while contributing to augment the coverage of the parser.",
        "In addition, it was shown that it has a positive impact on the results of a subsequent application, namely, machine translation.",
        "Future work will concentrate on improving our method so that it accounts for all the possible syntactic configurations of collocational attachments, and on extending its recall evaluation to other syntactic types."
