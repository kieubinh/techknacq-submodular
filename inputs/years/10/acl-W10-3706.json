        "Complex Predicates (CPs) contain [verb] + verb (compound verbs) or [noun/ adjective/adverb] +verb (conjunct verbs) combinations in South Asian languages (Hook, 1974).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, Bengali is not only a language of South Asia but also the sixth popular language in the World, second in India and the national language of Bangladesh.",
        "The identification of Complex Predicates (CPs) adds values for building lexical resources (e.g. WordNet (Miller et al., 1990; VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)), parsing strategies and machine translation systems.",
        "Bengali is less computerized compared to English due to its morphological enrichment.",
        "As the identification of Complex Predicates (CPs) requires the knowledge of morphology, the task of automatically extracting the Complex Predicates (CPs) is a challenge.",
        "Complex Predicates (CPs) in Bengali consists of two types, compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs).",
        "The compound verbs (CompVs) (e.g. pstt mere phela 'kill', ttstt bolte laglo 'started saying') consist of two verbs.",
        "The first verb is termed as Full Verb (FV) that is present at surface level either as conjunctive participial form e e or the infinitive form -6s -te.",
        "The second verb bears the inflection based on Tense, Aspect and Person.",
        "The second verbs that are termed as Light Verbs (LV) are polysemous, semantically bleached and confined into some definite candidate seeds (Paul, 2010).",
        "On the other hand, each of the Bengali conjunct verbs (ConjVs) (e.g. ôïpïï bharsha kara 'to depend', ^wt jhakjhak kara 'to glow') consists of noun or adjective followed by a Light Verb (LV).",
        "The Light Verbs (LVs) bear the appropriate inflections based on Tense, Aspect and Person.",
        "According to the definition of multi-word expressions (MfEs)(Baldwin and Kim, 2010), the absence of conventional meaning of the Light Verbs in Complex Predicates (CPs) entails us to consider the Complex Predicates some typical examples of Complex Predicates (CPs), e.g. (w dekha kara 'see-do' that bear the similar lexical pattern as Full Verb (FV)+ Light Verb (LV) but both of the Full Verb (FV) and Light Verb (LV) loose their conventional meanings and generate a completely different meaning ('to meet' in this case).",
        "In addition to that, other types of predicates such as 1?rc?T pit niye gelo 'take-go' (took and went), fïïw err diye gelo 'give-go' (gave and went) follows the similar lexical patterns FV+LV as of Complex Predicates (CPs) but they are not mono-clausal.",
        "Both the Full Verb (FV) and Light Verb (LV) behave like independent syntactic entities and they belong to non-Complex Predicates (non-CPs).",
        "The verbs are also termed as Serial Verb (SV) (Mukherjee et al., 2006).",
        "Butt (1993) and Paul (2004) have also mentioned the following criteria that are used to check the validity of complex predicates (CPs) in Bengali.",
        "The following cases are the invalid criteria of complex predicates (CPs).",
        "1.",
        "Control Construction (CC): fTw likhte bollo 'asked to write', fTw ^ro ^wt likhte badhyo korlo 'forced to write'",
        "2.",
        "Modal Control Construction (MCC): prc® 513\" jete hobe 'have to go' pros khete hobe 'have to eat'",

        "4.",
        "Auxiliary Construction (AC): srrc^ bose ache 'is sitting', fàw f^r niye chilo 'had taken'.",
        "Sometimes, the successive sequence of the Complex Predicates (CPs) shows a problem of deciding the scopes of individual Complex",
        "Predicates (CPs) present in that sequence.",
        "For example the sequence, Uä *rcw cïwr\" uthe pore dekhlam 'rise-wear-see' (rose and saw) seems to contain two Complex Predicates (CPs) (Uä *rcw uthe pore 'rose' and *rcw (ïïwr\" pore dekhlam 'wore and see').",
        "But there is actually one Complex Predicate (CP).",
        "The first one Uä *rcw uthe pore 'rose' is a compound verb (CompV) as well as a Complex Predicate (CP).",
        "Another one is (wtr\" dekhlam 'saw' that is a simple verb.",
        "As the sequence is not mono-clausal, the Complex Predicate (CP) Uä *rcw uthe pore 'rose' associated with (ïïwr\" dekhlam 'saw' is to be separated by a lexical boundary.",
        "Thus the determination of lexical scopes of Complex Predicates (CPs) from a long consecutive sequence is indeed a crucial task.",
        "The present task therefore not only aims to extract the Complex Predicates (CPs) containing compound and conjunct verbs but also to resolve the problem of deciding the lexical scopes automatically.",
        "The compound verbs (CompVs) and conjunct verbs (ConjVs) are extracted from two separate Bengali corpora based on the morphological information (e.g. participle forms, infinitive forms and inflections) and list of Light Verbs (LVs).",
        "As the Light Verbs (LVs) in the compound verbs (CompVs) are limited in number, fifteen predefined verbs (Paul, 2010) are chosen as Light Verbs (LVs) for framing the compound verbs (CompVs).",
        "A manually prepared seed list that is used to frame the lexical patterns for conjunct verbs (ConjVs) contains frequently used Light Verbs (LVs).",
        "An automatic method is designed to identify the lexical scopes of compound and conjunct verbs in the long sequences of Complex Predicates (CPs).",
        "The identification of lexical scope of the Complex Predicates (CPs) improves the performance of the system as the number of identified Complex Predicates (CPs) increases.",
        "Manual evaluation is carried out on two types of Bengali corpus.",
        "The experiments are carried out on 800 development sentences from two corpora but the final evaluation is carried out on 1000 sentences.",
        "Overall, the system achieves F-Scores of 75.73%, and 77.92% for compound verbs and 89.90% and 89.66% for conjunct verbs respectively.",
        "The error analysis shows that not only the lexical patterns but also the augmentation of argument structure agreement (Das, 2009), the analysis of Non-MonoClausal Verb (NMCV) or Serial Verb, Control Construction (CC), Modal Control Construction (MCC), Passives (Pass) and Auxiliary Construction (AC) (Butt, 1993; Paul, 2004) are also necessary to identify the Complex Predicates (CPs).",
        "The error analysis shows that the system suffers in distinguishing the Complex Predicates (CPs) from the above constraint constructions.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the related work done in this area.",
        "The automatic extraction of compound and conjunct verbs is described in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, the identification of lexical scopes of the Complex Predicates (CPs) is mentioned.",

        "The task described in (Mukherjee et al., 2006) highlights the development of a database based on the hypothesis that an English verb is projected onto a multi-word sequence in Hindi.",
        "The simple idea of projecting POS tags across an English-Hindi parallel corpus considers the Complex Predicate types, adjective-verb (AV), noun-verb (NV), adverb-verb (Adv-V), and verb-verb (VV) composites.",
        "A similar task (Sinha, 2009) presents a simple method for detecting Complex Predicates of all kinds using a Hindi-English parallel corpus.",
        "His simple strategy exploits the fact that Complex Predicate is a multi-word expression with a meaning that is distinct from the meaning of the Light Verb.",

        "The analysis of V+V complex predicates termed as lexical compound verbs (LCpdVs) and the linguistic tests for their detection in Hindi are described in (Chakrabarti et al., 2008) .",
        "In addition to compound verbs, the present system also identifies the conjunct verbs in Bengali.",
        "But, it was observed that the identification of Hindi conjunct verbs that contain noun in the first slot is puzzling and therefore a sophisticated solution was proposed in (Das, 2009) based on the control agreement strategy with other overtly case marked noun phrases.",
        "The present task also agrees with the above problem in identifying conjunct verbs in Bengali although the system satisfactorily identifies the conjunct verbs (ConjVs).",
