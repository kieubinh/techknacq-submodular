        "What distinguishes Chinese Information Retrieval from information retrieval (IR) in other languages is the challenge of segmenting the queries and the documents, created by the lack of word delimiters.",
        "In general, there are two categories of segmenters: character-based methods and word-based methods.",
        "Despite the superior performance of bigram segmenters (Nie et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2000; Foo and Li, 2004), word-based approaches continue to be investigated because of their application in sophisticated IR tasks such as cross language IR, and within techniques such as query expansion (Nie et al., 2000; Peng et al., 2002a).",
        "Most word-based segmenters in Chinese IR are either rule-based models, which rely on a lexicon, or statistical-based models, which are trained on manually segmented corpora (Zhang et al., 2003).",
        "However, the relationship between the accuracy of Chinese word segmentation and the performance of Chinese IR is non-monotonic.",
        "Peng et al.",
        "(2002b) reported that segmentation methods achieving segmentation accuracy higher than 90% according to a manual segmentation standard yield no improvement in IR performance.",
        "They further argued that IR often benefits from splitting compound words that are annotated as single units by manual segmentation.",
        "The essence of the problem is that there is no clear definition of word in Chinese.",
        "Experiments have shown only about 75% agreement among native speakers regarding the correct word segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996).",
        "While units such as (peanut) and T^A\" (match maker) should clearly be considered as a single term in Chinese IR, compounds such as \"f/lfl^ >J \" (machine learning) are more controversial.",
        "Xu et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a \"continuum hypothesis\" that rejects a clean binary classification of Chinese semantic units as either compositional or non-compositional.",
        "Instead, they introduced the notion of a tightness measure, which quantifies the degree of compositionality.",
        "On this tightness continuum, at one extreme are noncompositional semantic units, such as \"M T A\" (match maker), and at the other end are sequences of consecutive words with no dependency relationship, such as \"_h M WW\" (Shanghai where).",
        "In the middle of the spectrum are compositional compounds such as \"ft ff ^ (machine learning) and phrases such as \"IE S ft A\" (legitimate income).",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to apply the concept of semantic tightness to Chinese IR, which refines the output of a general Chinese word segmenter using tightness information.",
        "In the first phase, we recombine multiple units that are considered semantically tight into single terms.",
        "In the second phase, we break single units that are not sufficiently tight.",
        "The experiments involving two different IR systems demonstrate that the new method improves IR performance as compared to the general segmenter.",
        "only 54 queries, which are linked to relevancy-judged documents.",
        "During our experiments, we found the TREC query data is ill-suited for analyzing the effects of compound segmentation on Chinese IR.",

        "In order to combine components, we first extract 4-gram non-compositional compounds whose tightness values are greater than a threshold a1 in a reference corpus, and then revise a general segmenter by combining two separated words if their combination is in the list.",
