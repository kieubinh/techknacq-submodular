        "Multi-word term (MWT) extraction is a challenging and well-known automatic term recognition (ATR) subtask, aimed at retrieving complex domain terminology from specialized corpora.",
        "Although domain sublanguages are characterized by specific vocabularies, a well-defined border between specific sublanguages (SLs) and general language (GL) vocabularies is difficult to establish since lexicon shifts in a continuum from a highly specialized area to a transition area between GL and SLs (Rondeau et al., 1984).",
        "Within this continuum, Cabre (1999) identifies three types of lexical items: a. GL lexical items; b. SL terms, c. lexical items belonging to a borderline area between GL and SL.",
        "The proportion of these different types of lexical items varies depending on the text type.",
        "To our knowledge, automatic term recognition methods proposed so far in the literature focussed on highly specialized corpora (typically, technical and scientific literature), mainly characterized by SL terminology.",
        "However, the same ATR methods may not be equally effective when dealing with corpora characterized by a different proportion of term types; e.g. from texts such as Wikipedia articles, which are conceived for a more extended audience, both SL terms and common words are acquired as long as they show a statistically significant distribution.",
        "In this paper, we claim that the contrastive approach to MWT extraction described in Bonin et al.",
        "(2010) can be effectively exploited to distinguish between common words and domain-specific terminology in different types of corpora as well as to identify terms belonging to different SLs when occurring in the same text.",
        "The latter is the case of legal texts, characterized by a mixture of different SLs, the legal and the regulated-domain SLs (Breuker et al., 2004).",
        "Effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed ATR approach has been tested with different experiments aimed at the extraction of domain terminology from corpora characterized by different degrees of difficulty as far as ATR is concerned, namely (i) environmental scientific literature, (ii) Wikipedia environmental articles, and (iii) a corpus of legal texts on environmental domain."

        "The MWT extraction methodology we follow is organized in two steps, described in detail in Bonin et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Firstly, a shortlist of well-formed and relevant candidate MWTs is extracted from a given target corpus and secondly a contrastive method is applied against the selected MWTs only.",
        "In fact, in the first stage, candidate MWTs are searched for in an automatically POS-tagged and lemmatized text and they are then weighted with the C-NC Value method (Frantzi et al., 1999).",
        "In the second stage, the list of MWTs extracted is revised and re-ranked with a contrastive score, based on the distribution of terms across corpora of different domains; in particular, the Contrastive Selection of multi-word terms (CSmw) function, newly introduced in Bonin et al.",
        "(2010), was used, which proved to be particularly suitable for handling variation in low frequency events.",
        "The main benefit of such an approach consists in its modularity; by first selecting valid MWTs which have significant distributional tendencies, and then by assessing their domain-relevance using a contrastive function, the MWT sparsity problem is overcome or at lest significantly reduced."

        "The MWT extraction methodology described above has been followed in order to acquire environmental terminology from three different kinds of domain corpora.",
        "The first experiment has been carried out on a corpus of scientific articles concerning climate change research of Italian National Research Council (CNR), of 397,297 tokens, while the second experiment has been carried out on a corpus of Wikipedia articles from the Italian Portal \"Ecologia e Ambiente\" (Ecology and Environment) (174,391 tokens).",
        "As general contrastive corpus, we used, in both cases, order to filter out GL lexical items.",
        "The third and more challenging experiment has been carried out on a collection of Italian European legal texts concerning the environmental domain for a total of 394,088 word tokens.",
        "In this case, as contrastive corpus we exploited a collection of Italian European legal texts regulating a domain other than the environmental one, in order to extract MWTs belonging to the environmental domain, but also to single out legal-domain terms, used in legal texts.",
        "For each acquisition corpus we followed the two-layered approach described above, selecting, firstly, a top list of 2000 environmental MWTs from the candidate term list ranked on the C-NC Value score and, secondly, re-ranking this 2000-term list on the basis of the CSmw function; then we extracted the final top list of 300 environmental MWTs.",
        "In order to assess the effectiveness of the approach against different types of corpora, we analyzed the two 300-term top lists of MWTs acquired respectively after the first and the second extraction steps.",
        "In both cases, we divided the 300-term top lists in 30-term groups which show domain-specific terms' distribution, so that they could be easily compared.",
        "The evaluation has been carried out by comparing the lists of MWTs extracted against a gold standard resource, i.e. the thesaurus EARTh (Environmental Applications Reference Thesaurus)..",
        "In addition, a second resource has been used in the third experiment for evaluating legal terms: the Dizionario giuridico (Edizioni Simone).",
        "Those terms which could not find a positive matching against the gold standard resources were manually validated by domain experts.",
        "Table 1: Environmental terms in the 300-term top lists from scientific articles (columns 2 and 3) and from Wikipedia (columns 4 and 5).",
        "Achieved experimental results highlight two main issues.",
        "Firstly, they show that the proposed contrastive approach to domain-specific MWTs extraction has a general good performance.",
        "As Figures 1, 2 and 3 show, the amount of environmental MWTs after the contrastive stage increases with respect to the amount of MWTs acquired after the candidate MWT extraction stage carried out with the C-NC Value method.",
        "Secondly, reported results witness that such performances are differently affected by the different types of input corpora: as summarized in Table 3, the relative increment of environmental MWTs after the contrastive filtering stage ranges from 11.3% to 23.81%.",
        "Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, the results obtained in the first and second experiments show similar trends.",
        "This is due to the overwhelming occurrence in the two input corpora of specialized terminology with respect to the GL items.",
        "Differently from what could have been expected, Wikipedia texts contain highly specialized terminology.",
        "However, a qualititative evaluation of MTWs extracted revealed that this latter corpus includes terms which belong to that borderline area between GL and SL (case c. in the Cabre (1999) classification).",
        "It follows that in the Wikipedia case the contrastive stage filtered out not only common words, such as milione di dollari 'a million dollars', but also terms such as unita immobiliare 'real estate' belonging to such borderline area of terminology; their difficult classification slightly decreases the contrastive stage performance.",

        "This trend can be observed in Figure 4, where the divergent lines show the different distributions of environmental and legal terms: interestingly, lines cross each other where legal terms outnumber environmental terms, i.e. in the last 30-term group.",
        "Such a relative increment with respect to the C-NC Value ranking can be easily explained in terms of the main features of the two methods, where C-NC Value method is overtly aimed at extracting domain-specific terminology (both environmental and legal terms), and the contrastive re-ranking step is specifically aimed at distinguishing the relevance of acquired MWTs with respect to the involved domains."
