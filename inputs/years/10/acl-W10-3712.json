        "Functional expressions are one of the most important elements of Japanese grammar that anyone studying the language must learn.",
        "Despite the importance of functional expressions, many tools that assist learners of Japanese with reading texts only provide dictionary lookup of simple words.",
        "However, the ability to quickly obtain information about such grammar could not only improve the learner's comprehension of the text, but also facilitate their learning process of new elements of Japanese grammar.",
        "Thus, we have decided to develop a Japanese reading assistant that is capable of providing explanations of functional expressions in addition to vocabulary.",
        "Functional expressions in Japanese are compound expressions that contain content and function words, and can have both compositional and non-compositional meanings.",
        "For example, in Table 1, sentences 1 and 2 contain the????",
        "(niatari) compound expression.",
        "In sentence 1, this expression has a functional, non-compositional meaning of ?when.?",
        "However, in sentence 2, the same expression has a compositional meaning that results simply from using the post-particle?",
        "(ni) and verb ???",
        "(a conjugated form of ???",
        "(ataru), meaning ?to hit?)",
        "together.",
        "We refer to this as the content usage of a functional expression.",
        "However, there are also functional expressions where this type of content usage is very rare (or even nonexistent).",
        "Sentence 3 shows an example of the?????????",
        "(nakerebanarimasen) functional expression which has a very common functional meaning of ?must or have to.?",
        "Tsuchiya et al. (2006) have proposed a method based on machine learning to identify functional expressions.",
        "However, this method only covers functional expressions which have balanced functional vs. content usage ratios.",
        "In order to boost coverage of current methods, we propose a hybrid approach for functional expression identification which uses a combination of the machine learning method proposed by Tsuchiya et al. (2006) and simple patterns.",
        "Coverage analysis and empirical evaluations show that our method doubles the coverage of previous approaches while still maintaining a high level of performance."
