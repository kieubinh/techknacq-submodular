        "Furthermore, a system with just 61.88% of the patterns filtered by functional words obtains a comparable performance with the unfiltered one on the randomly selected testset, and achieves 1.74% relative improvements on the NIST 2008 testset."

        "Previous work has shown that the problem of structural differences between language pairs in SMT can be alleviated by source-side syntactic reordering.",
        "Taking account for the integration with SMT systems, these methods can be divided into two different kinds of approaches (Elming, 2008): the deterministic reordering and the non-deterministic reordering approach.",
        "To carry out the deterministic approach, syntactic reordering is performed uniformly on the training, devset and testset before being fed into the SMT systems, so that only the reordered source sentences are dealt with while building during the SMT system.",
        "In this case, most work is focused on methods to extract and to apply syntactic reordering patterns which come from manually created rules (Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007a), or via an automatic extraction process taking advantage of parse trees (Collins et al., 2005; Habash, 2007).",
        "Because reordered source sentence cannot be undone by the SMT decoders (Al-Onaizan et al., 2006), which implies a systematic error for this approach, classifiers (Chang et al., 2009b; Du & Way, 2010) are utilized to obtain high-performance reordering for some specialized syntactic structures (e.g. DE construction in Chinese).",
        "On the other hand, the non-deterministic approach leaves the decisions to the decoders to choose appropriate source-side reorderings.",
        "This is more flexible because both the original and reordered source sentences are presented in the inputs.",
        "Word lattices generated from syntactic structures for N-gram-based SMT is presented in (Crego et al., 2007).",
        "In (Zhang et al., 2007a; Zhang et al., 2007b), chunks and POS tags are used to extract reordering rules, while the generated word lattices are weighted by language models and reordering models.",
        "Rules created from a syntactic parser are also utilized to form weighted n-best lists which are fed into the decoder (Li et ing, 2009) uses syntactic rules to score the output word order, both on English-Danish and English-Arabic tasks.",
        "Syntactic reordering information is also considered as an extra feature to improve PB-SMT in (Chang et al., 2009b) for the Chinese-English task.",
        "These results confirmed the effectiveness of syntactic reorderings.",
        "However, for the particular case of Chinese source inputs, although the DE construction has been addressed for both PBSMT and HPBSMT systems in (Chang et al., 2009b; Du & Way, 2010), as indicated by (Wang et al., 2007a), there are still lots of unexamined structures that imply source-side reordering, especially in the non-deterministic approach.",
        "As specified in (Xue, 2005), these include the ôez'-construction, Reconstruction, three kinds of deconstruction (including DE construction) and general preposition constructions.",
        "Such structures are referred with functional words in this paper, and all the constructions can be identified by their corresponding tags in the Penn Chinese TreeBank.",
        "It is interesting to investigate these functional words for the syntactic reordering task since most of them tend to produce structural reordering between the source and target sentences.",
        "Another related work is to filter the bilingual phrase pairs with closed-class words (Sanchez-Martinez, 2009).",
        "By taking account of the word alignments and word types, the filtering process reduces the phrase tables by up to a third, but still provide a system with competitive performance compared to the baseline.",
        "Similarly, our idea is to use special type of words for the filtering purpose on the syntactic reordering patterns.",
        "In this paper, our objective is to exploit these functional words for source-side syntactic reordering of Chinese-English SMT in the non-deterministic approach.",
        "Our assumption is that syntactic reordering patterns with functional words are the most effective ones, and others can be pruned for both speed and performance.",
        "To validate this assumption, three systems are compared in this paper: a baseline PBSMT system, a syntactic reordering system with all patterns extracted from a corpus, and a syntactic reordering system with patterns filtered with functional words.",
        "To accomplish this, firstly the lattice scoring approach (Jiang et al., 2010) is utilized to discover non-monotonic phrase alignments, and then syntactic reordering patterns are extracted from source-side parse trees.",
        "After that, functional word tags specified in (Xue, 2005) are adopted to perform pattern filtering.",
        "Finally, both the unfiltered pattern set and the filtered one are used to transform inputs into word lattices to present potential reorderings for improving PB-SMT system.",
        "A comparison between the three systems is carried out to examine the performance of syntactic reordering as well as the usefulness of functional words for pattern filtering.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe the extraction process of syntactic reordering patterns, including the lattice scoring approach and the extraction procedures.",
        "Then section 3 presents the filtering process used to obtain patterns with functional words.",
        "After that, section 4 shows the generation of word lattices with patterns, and experimental setup and results included related discussion are presented in section 5.",
        "Finally, we give our conclusion and avenues for future work in section 6."

        "Instead of top-down approaches such as (Wang et al., 2007a; Chang et al., 2009a), we use a bottom-up approach similar to (Xia et al., 2004; Crego et al., 2007) to extract syntactic reordering patterns from non-monotonic phrase alignments and source-side parse trees.",
        "The following steps are carried out to extract syntactic reordering patterns: 1) the lattice scoring approach proposed in (Jiang et al., 2010) is used to obtain phrase alignments from the training corpus; 2) reordering regions from the non-monotonic phrase alignments are used to identify minimum treelets for pattern extraction; and 3) the treelets are transformed into syntactic reordering patterns which are then weighted by their occurrences in the training corpus.",
        "Details of each of these steps are presented in the rest of this section.",
        "The lattice scoring approach is proposed in (Jiang et al., 2010) for the SMT data cleaning task.",
        "To clean the training corpus, word alignments are used to obtain approximate decoding results, which are then used to calculate BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores to filter out low-scoring sentences pairs.",
        "The following steps are taken in the lattice scoring approach: 1) train an initial PBSMT model; 2) collect anchor pairs containing source and target phrase positions from word alignments generated in the training phase; 3) build source-side lattices from the anchor pairs and the translation model; 4) search on the source-side lattices to obtain approximate decoding results; 5) calculate BLEU scores for the purpose of data cleaning.",
        "Note that the source-side lattices in step 3 come from anchor pairs, so each edge in the lattices contain both the source and target phrase positions.",
        "Thus the outputs of step 4 contain phrase alignments on the training corpus.",
        "These phrase alignments are used to identify non-monotonic areas for the extraction of reordering patterns.",

        "3.",
        "Traverse T in pre-order to obtain syntactic reordering pattern P. Label all the leaf nodes of T with A or B as reorder options, which indicate that the descendants of nodes with label A are supposed to be swapped with those with label B.",
        "Instead of using subtrees, we use treelets to refer the located parse tree substructures, since treelets do not necessarily go down to leaf nodes.",
        "Since phrase alignments cannot always be perfectly matched with parse trees, we also expand AB to the right and/or the left side with a limited number of words to find a minimum treelet.",

        "These results demonstrate that the pattern filtering improves the syntactic reordering system on the NIST set, while both of them significantly outperform the baseline.",
        "Experiments in the previous sections demonstrate that: 1) the two syntactic reordering systems improve the PBSMT system by providing potential reorderings obtained from phrase alignments and parse trees; 2) patterns with functional words play a major role in the syntactic reordering process, and filtering the patterns with functional words maintains or even improves the system performance for Chinese-English SMT task.",
        "Furthermore, as shown in the previous section, pattern filtering prunes the whole pattern set by 61.88% and also reduces the sizes of word lattices by up to 37.99%, thus the whole syntactic reordering procedure for the original inputs as well as the tuning/decoding steps are sped up dramatically, which make the proposed methods more useful in the real world, especially for online SMT systems.",
        "From the statistics on the filtered pattern set in Table 2, we also argue that the first kind of deconstruction and general preposition (excluding bei and ba) are the main sources of Chinese-English syntactic reordering.",
        "Previous work (Chang et al., 2009b; Du & Way, 2010) showed the advantages of dealing with the DE construction.",
        "In our experiments too, even though all the patterns are automatically extracted from phrase alignments, these two constructions still dominate the filtered pattern set.",
        "This result confirms the effectiveness of previous work on DE construction, and also highlights the importance of the general preposition construction in this task."
