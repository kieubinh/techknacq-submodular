        "With the entrance of the World Wide Web effectively connecting countries together over a giant network, this interaction reached a new peak.",
        "In the area of business and commerce, the vast majority of companies simply would not work without this global connection.",

        "As the international connection barriers continually break down, the language barrier becomes a greater issue.",
        "The English language is now the world's lingua franca, and non-English speaking people are faced with the problem of communication, and limited access to resources in English.",
        "Machine translation is the process of using computers for translation from one human language to another(Lopez, 2008).",
        "This is not a recent area of research and development.",
        "In fact, machine translation was one of the first applications of natural language processing, with research work dating back to the 1950s(Cancedda, Dymetman, Foster, & Goutte, 2009).",
        "However, due to the complexity and diversity of human language, automated translation is one of the hardest problems in computer science, and significantly successful results are uncommon.",
        "There are a number of different approaches to machine translation.",
        "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) however, seems to be the preferred approach of many industrial and academic research laboratories (Schmidt, 2007).",
        "The advantages of SMT compared to rule-based approaches lie in their adaptability to different domains and languages: once a functional system exists, all that has to be done in order to make it work with other language pairs or text domains is to train it on new data.",
        "Research work on statistical machine translation systems began in the early 1990s.",
        "These systems, which are based on phrase-based approaches, operate using parallel corpora huge databases of corresponding sentences in two languages, and employ statistics and probability to learn by example which translation of a word or phrase is most likely correct.",
        "The translation moves directly from source language to target language with no intermediate transfer step.",
        "In recent years, such phrase-based MT approaches have become popular because they generally show better translation results.",
        "One major factor for this development is the growing availability of large monolingual and bilingual text corpora in recent years for a number of languages.",
        "The focus of this paper is on statistical machine translation for the English/Persian language pair.",
        "The statistical approach has only been employed in several experimental translation attempts for this language pair, and is still largely undeveloped.",
        "This project is considered to be a challenge for several reasons.",
        "Firstly, the Persian language structure is very different in comparison to English; secondly, there has been little previous work done for this language pair; and thirdly, effective SMT systems rely on very large bilingual corpora, however these are not readily available for the English/Persian language pair.",
        "The Persian language, or Farsi as it is also known as, belongs to the Indo-European language family and is one of the more dominant languages in parts of the Middle East.",
        "It is in fact the most widely spoken language in the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian languages, being the official language of Iran (Persia) and also spoken in several countries including Iran, Tajikistan and Afghanistan.",
        "There also exist large groups and communities in Iraq, United Arab Emirates, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Bahrain, and Oman, not to mention communities in the USA.",
        "Persian uses a script that is written from right to left.",
        "It has similarities with Arabic but has an extended alphabet and different words and/or pronunciations from Arabic.",
        "During its long history, the language has been influenced by other languages such as Arabic, Turkish and even European languages such as English and French.",
        "Today's Persian contains many words from these languages and in some cases words from other languages still follow the grammar of their original language particularly in building plural, singular or different verb forms.",
        "Because of the special and different nature of the Persian language compared to other languages like English, the design of SMT systems for Persian requires special considerations.",
        "Several MT systems have already been constructed for the English/Persian language pair.",
        "One such system is the Shiraz project, (Amtrup, Laboratory, & University, 2000).",
        "The Shiraz MT system is an MT prototype that translates text one way from Persian to English.",
        "The project began in 1997 and the final version was delivered in 1999.",
        "The Shiraz corpus is a 10 MB manually-constructed bilingually tagged Persian to English dictionary of about 50,000 words, developed using on-line material for testing purposes in a project at New Mexico State University.",
        "The system also comprises its own syntactic parser and morphological analyzer, and is focused on news stories material translation as its domain.",
        "Another English/Persian system was developed system, called PEnTrans, is a bidirectional text translator, comprising two main modules (PEnT1, and PEnT2) which translate in opposite directions (PEnT1 from English to Persian; PEnT2 from Persian to English).",
        "PEnT1 employs a combination of both corpus based and extended dictionary approaches, and PEnT2 uses a combination of rule, knowledge and corpus based approaches.",
        "PEnTrans introduced a new WSD method with a hybrid measure which evaluates different word senses in a sentence and scores them according to their condition in the sentence, together with the placement of other words in that sentence.",
        "ParsTranslator is a machine translation system built to translate English to Persian text.",
        "It was first released for public use in mid-1997, the latest update being PTran version in April 2004.",

        "The latest version is able to operate for over 1.5 million words and terminologies in English.",

        "Another English to Persian MT system is the rule-based system developed by (Faili & Ghassem-Sani, 2005)This system was based on tree adjoining grammar (TAG), and later improved by implementing trained decision trees as a word sense disambiguation module.",

        "The problems encountered, especially with the process of alignment are discussed in this research (Mohaghegh & Sarrafzadeh, 2009).",
        "Most of these systems have largely used a rule based approach, and their BLEU scores on a standard data set have not been published.",
        "Nowadays however, most large companies employ the statistical translation approach, using exceedingly large amounts of bilingual data (aligned sentences in two languages).",
        "A good example of this is perhaps the most well-known Persian/English MT system: Google Translate recently released option for this language pair.",
        "Google's MT system is based on the statistical approach, and was made available online as a BETA version in June 2009.",
        "The Transonics Spoken Dialogue Translator is also partially a statistically based machine translation system.",
        "The complete system itself operates using a speech to text converter, statistical language translation, and subsequent text to speech conversion.",

        "A classifier attempts to assign a concept to an utterance.",
        "If the object to be translated is within the translation domain, the system is capable of significantly accurate translations.",
        "Where the object is outside the translation domain, the SMT method is used.",

        "They present an unsupervised training technique to alleviate the problem of the lack of bilingual training data by taking advantage of available source language data(Xiang, Deng, & Gao, 2008).",
        "However, there was no large parallel text corpus available at the time of development for both of these systems.",
        "For its specific domain, the Transonics translation system relied on a dictionary approach for translation, using a speech corpus, rather than a parallel text corpus.",
        "Their Statistical Translation approach was merely used as a backup system."

        "This paper presented an overview of some of the work in the area of English/Persian MT systems that has been done to date, and showed a set of experiments in which our SMT system was applied to the Persian language using a relatively small corpus.",
        "The first part of this work was to test how well our system translates from Persian to English when trained on the available corpora and to spot and try and resolve problems with the process and the output produced.",
        "According to the results we obtained, it was concluded that a corpus of much greater size would be required to produce satisfactory results.",
        "Our experience with the corpus of smaller size shows us that for a large corpus, there will be a significant amount of work required in aligning sentences."
