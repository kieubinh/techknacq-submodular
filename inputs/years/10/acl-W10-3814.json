        "Labels on these nonterminal symbols are often used to enforce syntactic constraints in the generation of bilingual sentences and imply conditional independence assumptions in the statistical translation model.",
        "Several techniques have been recently proposed to automatically identify and estimate parameters for PSCFGs (or related synchronous grammars) from parallel corpora (Galley et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006).",

        "(2008) introduce structural distortion features into a hierarchical phrase-based model, aimed at modeling nonterminal reordering given source span length, by estimating for each possible source span length l a Bernoulli distribution p(R\\l) where R takes value one if reordering takes place and zero otherwise.",
        "Maximum-likelihood estimation of the distribution amounts to simply counting the relative frequency of nonterminal reorderings over all extracted rule instances that incurred a substitution of span length l. In a more fine-grained approach they add a separate binary feature (R, l) for each combination of reordering truth value R and span length l (where all l > 10 are merged into a single value), and then tune the feature weights discriminatively on a development set.",
        "Our approach differs from Chiang et al.",
        "(2008) in that we estimate one source span length distribution for each substitution site of each grammar rule, resulting in unique distributions for each rule, estimated from all instances of the rule in the training data.",
        "This enables our model to condition reordering range on the individual rules used in a derivation, and even allows to distinguish between two rules r1 and r2that both reorder arguments with identical mean span lengths l, but where the span lengths encountered in extracted instances of ri are all close to l, whereas span length instances for r2 vary widely.",
        "Chen and Eisele (2010) propose a hypbrid approach between hierarchical phrase based MT and a rule based MT system, reporting improvement over each individual model on an English-to-German translation task.",
        "Essentially, the rule based system is converted to a single-nonterminal PSCFG, and hence can be combined with the hierarchical model, another single-nonterminal PSCFG, by taking the union of the rule sets and augmenting the feature vectors, adding zero-values for rules that only exist in one of the two grammars.",
        "We face the challenge of combining the single-nonterminal hierarchical grammar with a multi-nonterminal syntax-augmented grammar.",

        "They allow the model preference between hierarchical and syntax rules to be learned from development data by adding an indicator feature to all rules, which is one for hierarchical rules and zero for syntax rules.",
        "However, no empirical comparison is given between the purely syntax-augmented and the hybrid grammar.",
        "We aim to fill this gap by experimenting with both models, and further refine the hybrid approach by adding interpolated probability models to the syntax rules.",
        "Chiang (2010) augments a hierarchical phrase-based MT model with binary syntax features representing the source and target syntactic constituents of a given rule's instantiations during training, thus taking source and target syntax into account while avoiding the data-sparseness and decoding-complexity problems of multi-nonterminal PSCFG models.",
        "In our approach, the source-and target-side syntax directly determines the grammar, resulting in a nonterminal set derived from the labels underlying the source-and target-language treebanks."

        "Given a source language sentence f, statistical machine translation defines the translation task as selecting the most likely target translation e under a model P(e\\f), i.e.:",
        "where the arg max operation denotes a search through a structured space of translation outputs in the target language, hi(e, f) are bilingual features of e and f and monolingual features of e, and weights Ai are typically trained discrim-inatively to maximize translation quality (based on automatic metrics) on held out data, e.g., using minimum-error-rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).",
        "In PSCFG-based systems, the search space is structured by automatically extracted rules that model both translation and reordering operations.",
        "Most large scale systems approximate the search above by simply searching for the most likely derivation of rules, rather than searching for the most likely translated output.",
        "There are efficient algorithms to perform this search (Kasami, 1965; Chappelier and Rajman, 1998) that have been extended to efficiently integrate n-gram language model features (Chiang, 2007; Venugopal et al., 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007; Zollmann et al., 2008; Petrov et al., 2008).",
        "In this work we experiment with PSCFGs that have been automatically learned from word-aligned parallel corpora.",
        "PSCFGs are defined by a source terminal set (source vocabulary) Ts, a target terminal set (target vocabulary) 7T, a shared nonterminal set N and rules of the form: X – (Y, a, w) where",
        "• X G N is a labeled nonterminal referred to as the left-hand-side of the rule.",
        "• y G (N U 7S)* is the source side of the rule.",
        "• a G (N U 7T) * is the target side of the rule.",
        "• w G [0, oo) is a non-negative real-valued weight assigned to the rule; in our model, w is the exponential function of the inner product of features h and weights A.",
        "Building upon the success of phrase-based methods, Chiang (2005) presents a PSCFG model of translation that uses the bilingual phrase pairs of phrase-based MT as starting point to learn hierarchical rules.",
        "For each training sentence pair's set of extracted phrase pairs, the set of induced PSCFG rules can be generated as follows: First, each phrase pair is assigned a generic X-nonterminal as left-hand-side, making it an initial rule.",
        "We can now recursively generalize each already obtained rule (initial or including nonterminals) for which there is an initial rule N – fi-XkfU+i/et Xk en+i where e.g. fi-i is shorthand for fi... fi-i, and where k is an index for the nonterminal X that indicates the one-to-one correspondence between the new X tokens on the two sides (it is not in the space of word indices like i,j,u,v,m,n).",
        "The recursive form of this generalization operation allows the generation of rules with multiple nonterminal pairs.",
        "Chiang (2005) uses features analogous to the ones used in phrase-based translation: a language model neg-log probability, a 'rule given source-side' neg-log-probability, a 'rule given target-side' neg-log-probability, source-and target conditioned 'lexical' neg-log-probabilities based on word-to-word co-occurrences (Koehn et al., 2003), as well as rule, target word, and glue operation counters.",
        "We follow Venugopal and Zollmann (2009) to further add a rareness penalty, where count(r) is the occurrence count of rule r in the training corpus, allowing the system to learn penalization of low-frequency rules, as well as three indicator features firing if the rule has one, two unswapped, and two swapped nonterminal pairs, respectively.",
        "Syntax Augmented MT (SAMT) (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) extends Chiang (2005) to include nonterminal symbols from target language phrase structure parse trees.",
        "Each target sentence in the training corpus is parsed with a stochastic parser to produce constituent labels for target spans.",
        "Phrase pairs (extracted from a particular sentence pair) are assigned left-hand-side nonterminal symbols based on the target side parse tree constituent spans.",
        "Phrase pairs whose target side corresponds to a constituent span are assigned that constituent's label as their left-hand-side nonterminal.",
        "If the target side of the phrase pair is not spanned by a single constituent in the corresponding parse tree, we use the labels of subsuming, subsumed, and neighboring parse tree constituents to assign an extended label of the form Ci + C2, Ci/C2, or C2\\Ci (the latter two being motivated from the operations in combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000)), indicating that the phrase pair's target side spans two adjacent syntactic categories (e.g., she went: NP+VB), a partial syntactic category Ci missing a C2 at the right (e.g., the great: NP/NN), or a partial Ci missing a C2 at the left (e.g., great wall: DT\\NP), respectively.",
        "The label assignment is attempted in the order just described, i.e., assembling labels based on '+' concatenation of two subsumed constituents is preferred, as smaller constituents tend to be more accurately labeled.",
        "If no label is assignable by either of these three methods, a default label 'FAIL' is assigned.",

        "Conversely, during translation, applying this rule amounts to combining k hypotheses from k different chart cells, each represented by a source span and a nonterminal, to form a new hypothesis and file it into a chart cell.",
