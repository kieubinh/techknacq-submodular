        "As part of the Statement Map project we proposed the development of a system to support information credibility analysis on the Web (Murakami et al., 2009b) by automatically summarizing facts and opinions on topics of interest to users and showing them the evidence and conflicts for each viewpoint.",
        "To facilitate the detection of semantic relations in Internet data, we defined a sentence-like unit of information called the statement that encompasses both facts and opinions, started compiling a corpus of statements annotated with semantic relations (Murakami et al., 2009a), and begin constructing a system to automatically identify semantic relations between statements.",
        "In this paper, we describe the construction and evaluation of a prototype semantic relation identification system.",
        "We build on the semantic relations proposed in RTE and CST and in our previous work, refining them into a streamlined set of semantic relations that apply across facts and opinions, but that are simple enough to make automatic recognition of semantic relations between statements in Internet text possible.Our semantic relations are [Agreement], [Conflict], [Confinement], and [Evidence].",

        "our task differs from opinion mining and sentiment analysis which largely focus on identifying the polarity of an opinion for defined parameters rather than identify how facts and opinions relate to each other, and it differs from web document summarization tasks which focus on extracting information from web page structure and contextual information from hyperlinks rather than analyzing the semantics of the language on the webpage itself.",
        "We present a system that automatically identifies semantic relations between statements in Japanese Internet texts.",
