        "Similarity calculation is one of essential tasks in natural language processing (1990; 1992; 1994; 1997; 1998; 1999; 2005).",
        "We look for a semantically similar word to do corpus-driven summarization, machine translation, language generation, recognition of textual entailment and other tasks.",
        "In task of language modeling and disambiguation we also need to semantically generalize words or cluster words into some groups.",
        "As the amount of text increases more and more in the contemporary world, the importance of similarity calculation also increases concurrently.",
        "Similarity is computed by roughly two approaches: based on thesaurus and based on corpus.",
        "The former idea uses thesaurus, such as WordNet, that is a knowledge resource of hierarchical word classification.",
        "The latter idea, that is the target of our work, originates from Harris's distributional hypothesis more than four decades ago (1968), stating that semantically similar words tend to appear in similar contexts.",
        "In many cases a context of a word is represented as a feature vector, where each feature is another expression that co-occurs with the given word in the context.",
        "Over a long period of its history, in particular in recent years, several works have been done on distributional similarity calculation.",
        "Although the conventional works have attained the fine performance, we attempt to further improve the quality of this measure.",
        "Our motivation of this work simply comes from our observation and analysis of the output by conventional methods; Japanese, our target language here, is written in a mixture of four scripts: Chinese characters, Latin alphabet, and two Japanese-origin characters.",
        "In this writing environment some words which have same meaning and same pronunciation are written in two (or more) different scripts.",
        "This is interesting in terms of similarity calculation since these two words are completely same in semantics so the similarity should be ideally 1.0.",
        "However, the reality is, as far as we have explored, that the score is far from 1.0 in many same word pairs.",
        "This fact implies that the conventional calculation methods are far enough to the goal and are expected to improve further.",
        "The basic framework for computing distributional similarity is same; for each of two input words a context (i.e., surrounding words) is extracted from a corpus, a vector is made in which an element of the vector is a value or a weight, and two vectors are compared with a formula to compute similarity.",
        "Among these processes we have focused on features, that are elements of the vector, some of which, we think, adversely affect the performance.",
        "That is, traditional approaches such as Lin (1998) basically use all of observed words as context, that causes noise in feature vector comparison.",
        "One may agree that the number of the characteristic words to determine the meaning of a word is some, not all, of words around the target word.",
        "Thus our goal is to detect and reduce such noisy features.",
        "Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan (2009) have same motivation with us and introduced a bootstrapping strategy that changes the original features weights.",
        "The general idea here is to promote the weights of features that are common for associated words, since these features are likely to be most characteristic for determining the word's meaning.",
        "In this paper, we propose instead a method to using features that are both unassociated to the two input words, in addition to use of features that are associated to the input."

        "Although our target language is Japanese, we use English examples in order to provide better understanding to the readers.",
        "We first explain how to construct our feature vector from a text corpus.",
        "A word is represented by a feature vector, where features are collection of syntactically dependent words co-occurred in a given corpus.",
        "Thus, we first collect syntactically dependent words for each word.",
        "This is defined, as in Lin (1998), as a triple (w,r, w'), where w and w' are words and r is a syntactic role.",
        "As for definition of word, we use not only words given by a morphological analyzer but also compound words.",
        "Nine case particles are used as syntactic roles, that roughly express subject, object, modifier, and so on, since they are easy to be obtained from text with no need of semantic analysis.",
        "In order to reduce noise we delete triples that appears only once in the corpus.",
        "We then construct a feature vector out of collection of the triples.",
        "A feature of a word is an another word syntactically dependent with a certain role.",
        "In other words, given a triple (w, r, w'), a feature of w corresponds to a dependent word with a role (r, w').",
        "There are several weighting functions to determine a value for each feature element.",
        "As far as we have investigated the literature the most widely used feature weighting function is point-wise mutual information (MI), that is defined as follows:",
        "where freq(r, w') is the frequency of the cooccurrence word w' with role r, freq(w) is the independent frequency of a word w, freq(w, r, w') is the frequency of the triples (w, r, w'), and S is the number ofall triples.",
        "In this paper we do not discuss what is the best weighting functions, since this is out of target.",
        "We use mutual information here because it is most widely used, i.e., in order to compare performance with others we want to adopt the standard approach.",

        "In this paper we adopt Simpson-Jaccard index, sim, which of the features, i.e., the surrounding words, are not equally characteristic to the input word.",
