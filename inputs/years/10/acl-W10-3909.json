        "In this paper, we generate two statistically-based semantic features from a large corpus and measure their influence on pronoun coreference.",
        "One is contextual compatibility, which decides if the antecedent can be used in the anaphor's context; the other is role pair, which decides if the actions asserted of the antecedent and the anaphor are likely to apply to the same entity.",
        "We apply a semantic labeling system and a baseline coreference system to a large corpus to generate semantic patterns and convert them into features in a MaxEnt model.",
        "These features produce an absolute gain of 1.5% to 1.7% in resolution accuracy (a 6% reduction in errors).",
        "To understand the limitations of these features, we also extract patterns from the test corpus, use these patterns to train a coreference model, and examine some of the cases where coreference still fails.",

        "Coreference resolution is the task of determining whether two phrases refer to the same entity.",
        "Coreference is critical to most NLP tasks, yet even the sub-problem of pronoun coreference remains very challenging.",
        "In principle, we need several types of information to identify the right antecedent.",
        "First, number and gender agreement constraints can narrow the candidate set.",
        "If multiple candidates remain, we would next use some sequence or syntactic features, like position, word, word salience and discourse focus.",
        "For example, whether an antecedent is in subject position might be helpful because the subject is more likely to be referred to; or an entity that has been referred to repeatedly is more likely to be referred to again.",
        "However, these features do not suffice to pick the correct antecedent, and sometimes similar syntactic structures might have quite different coreference solutions.",
        "For example, for the following two sentences:",
        "(1) The terrorist shot a 13-year-old boy; he was arrested after the attack.",
        "(2) The terrorist shot a 13-year-old boy; he was fatally wounded in the attack.",
        "it is likely that \"he\" refers to \"terrorist\" in (1) and \"boy\" in (2).",
        "However, we cannot get the right antecedent using the features we mentioned above because the examples share the same antecedent words and syntactic structure.",
        "People can still resolve these correctly because \"terrorist\" is more likely to be arrested than \"boy\", and because the one shooting is more likely to be arrested than the one being shot.",
        "In such cases, semantic constraints and preferences are required for correct coreference resolution.",
        "Methods for acquiring and using such knowledge are receiving increasing attention in recent work on anaphora resolution.",
        "Dagan and Itai (1990), Bean and Riloff (2004), Yang and Su (2007), and Ponzetto and Strube (2006) all explored this task.",
        "However, this task is difficult because it requires the acquisition of a large amount of semantic information.",
        "Furthermore, there is not universal agreement on the value of these semantic preferences for pronoun coreference.",
        "Kehler et al.",
        "(2004) reported that such information did not produce apparent improvement in overall pronoun resolution.",
        "In this paper, we will extract semantic features from a semantic role labeling system instead of a parse tree, and explore whether pronoun corefer-ence resolution can benefit from such knowledge, which is automatically extracted from a large corpus.",
        "We studied two features: the contextual compatibility feature which has been demonstrated to work at the syntactic level by previous work; and the role pair feature, which has not previously been applied to general domain pronoun co-reference.",
        "In addition, to obtain a rough upper bound on the benefits of our approach and understand its limitations, we conducted a second experiment in which the semantic knowledge is extracted from the evaluation corpus.",
        "We will use the term mention to describe an individual referring phrase.",
        "For most studies of coreference, mentions are noun phrases and may be headed by a name, a common noun, or a pronoun.",

        "2009).",
        "We use semantic labeling because it provides more general and meaningful patterns, with a \"deeper\" analysis than parsed text.",
        "The output of the semantic labeling is the dependency representation of the text, where each sentence is a graph consisting of nodes (corresponding to words) and arcs.",
        "Each arc captures up to three relations between two words: (1) a SURFACE relation, the relation between a predicate and an argument in the parse of a sentence; (2) a LOGIC1 (grammatical logical) relation which regularizes for lexical and syntactic phenomena like passive, relative clauses, and deleted subjects; and (3) a LOGIC2 (predicate-argument) relation corresponding to relations in PropBank and NomBank.",

        "Because nouns and verbs provide the most relevant contexts and capture the events in which the entities participate, we generate semantic patterns (triples) only for those arcs with verb or noun heads.",

        "• Logic2 relations: We use in particular the Arg0 relation (which corresponds roughly to agent) and Arg1 relation (which corresponds roughly to patient).",
        "• Logic1 relations: We use in particular the Sbj and Obj relations, representing the logical subject and object of a verb (regularizing passive, relative clauses, deleted subjects)",
        "• Surface relations: T-pos relation is particularly used, which captures the head noun determiner relation for possessive constructs such as \"bomber's attack\" and \"his responsibility\".",

        "To quantify this problem, we counted the patterns that appear in both positive examples (correct antecedents) and negative examples (incorrect antecedents).",
        "For contextual compatibility patterns, 39.5% of the patterns which appear with positive examples also appear in the negative sample, while for role pair patterns, 19% of the patterns which appear with positive examples also appear in the negative sample.",
        "So we see that, even with a pattern set highly tuned to the test set, many patterns do not by themselves serve to distinguish correct from incorrect coreference.",
        "We analyzed some of the cases where the semantic information does not help, or even harms the analysis.",
        "In some cases all the antecedent scores are very low, either because the patterns are very rare or the antecedent is a common word that appears in a lot of patterns.",
        "In other cases, several antecedents have a high compatibility score but the correct one does not have the top score.",
        "In these cases, the contextual compatibility is not reliable, as was pointed out by Kehler et al.",
