        "In natural language processing, information extraction is a task where, given raw text, a system is to give precise information fitting in a predefined semantic template.",
        "Automated news surveillance is an important application of information extraction.",
        "The detection of terrorist events and economic surveillance were the first applications, in particular in the framework of the evaluation campaigns of the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) (MUC, 1992; MUC, 1993).",
        "In MUC-3 (1991) and MUC-4 (1992), about terrorism in Latin American countries, the task of participants was, given a collection of news feed data, to fill in a predetermined semantic template containing the name of the terrorist group that perpetrated a terrorist event, the name of the victim(s), the type of event, and the date and location where it occurred.",
        "In economic surveillance, one can for instance extract mergers or corporate management changes.",
        "An application of information extraction that lately gained much importance is that of epidemiological surveillance, with a special emphasis on the detection of disease outbreaks.",
        "Given news data, the task is to detect epidemiological events, and extract the location where they occurred, the name of the disease, the number of victims, and the \"case\", that is, a text description of the event, that may be the \"status\" of victims (sick, injured, dead, hospitalised ... ) or a written description of symptoms.",
        "Epidemiological surveillance has become a crucial tool with increasing world travel and the latest crises of SARS, avian flu, H1N1 ...",
        "In this paper, we present an application to epidemic surveillance, but it may be equally applied to any subdomain of news surveillance.",
        "As in many fields of NLP, most of the work in information extraction long focused on English data (Etzioni et al., 2008).Multilingual has often been understood as adding many monolingual systems, except in pioneer multilingual parsing (Vergne, 2002).",
        "Whereas English is nowadays the lingua franca in many fields (in particular, business), we will see that for several applications, this is not sufficient.",
        "Most news agencies are translating part of their feed into English (e.g., AFPand Xinhua for which the source languages are respectively French and Chinese), but a good deal of the data is never translated, while for the part that is, the translation process naturally incurs a delay that is, by essence, problematic in a field where exhaus-tivity and early detection are crucial aspects.",
        "Subsequently, the ability to simultaneously handle documents written in different languages is becoming a more and more important feature (Poibeau et al., 2008; Gey et al., 2009).",
        "Indeed, in the field of epidemiological surveillance, it is especially important to detect a new event the very first time it is mentioned, and this very first occurrence will almost always happen in the local language (except for countries like Iraq for instance).",
        "Therefore, it is not enough to be able to deal with several languages : It is necessary to handle many.",
        "For instance, the Medical Information System (Medisys) of the European Community gathers news data in 42 different languages (Atkinson and der Goot, 2009) (now 45).",
        "There are currently 2 main approaches to multilingual information extraction.",
        "The first approach relies on the prior translation of all the documents into one common language (usually English), for which a well-performing information extraction system has been developed (Linge et al., 2009).",
        "Whereas the simple design of this solution is attractive, the current state of the art in machine translation only allows for mediocre results.",
        "Most monolingual information extraction systems indeed rely on a combination of grammatical patterns and specialized lexicons (Grishman et al., 2002; Riloff, 1996).",
        "The second main approach consists in leaving documents in their original language but to translate the lexicons and extraction patterns into that language (Efimenko et al., same problems occur as in the first approach because the patterns are strongly language-related.",
        "Yet, to \"translate the system\" seems more realistic than to translate the documents, as it can be done manually, and offline (once and for all, and not as documents arrive).",
        "The bottleneck is then that the amount of work for each language is enormous: it naturally requires the complete translation of the lexicon (for all trigger words), but the more challenging issue is the translation of patterns, whose language-dependence might well mean that the amount of work needed to translate them comes close to that required for writing them from scratch.",
        "In addition, this task must necessarily be achieved by a domain expert, with excellent skills in the languages at hand.",
        "One could want to tackle this problem by using machine learning but she will need training data in many languages.",
        "In practice, this will often mean that only a few major languages will be dealt with, whilst all the others (amongst which all low-resource languages), will again be totally discarded.",
        "One can then only wish that epidemics will chose to occur in locations handled by surveillance systems.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "Both approaches additionally require a number of linguistic processing tools, in a number comparable to the number of languages to be dealt with: tokenizer, stemmer, syntactic analyzer, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "One might therefore conclude that such techniques are not properly multilingual but rather monolingual methods that may be adapted to other languages individually.",
        "In this paper, we explore a third approach to multilingual information extraction.",
        "We restrain ourselves to the sole use of truly multilingual elements, facts that are equally true for any language.",
        "The approach hence relies on universals, relying, e.g., on stylistics and rhetorics."

        "The objective of the system is to monitor news in a variety of languages to detect disease outbreaks which is an important issue for an alert system in epidemic surveillance.",
        "For this task a simple and clear framework is needed in order to limit the amount of work for new languages while keeping good reliability.",
        "The main idea of our work is using text granularity and discourse properties to write rules that may be language independent, fast and reliable (Vergne, 2002).",
        "For this study, regularities at text level are exploited.",
        "These phenomena can be related to stylistics and pragmatics.",
        "It has already been shown that news discourse has its own constraints reflected in press articles of different languages (Van Dijk, 1988; Lucas, 2004).",
        "Journalists all over the world know how to hook their potential readers.",
        "These methods are described in journalism schools (Itule and Anderson, 2006).",
        "One very important rule for journalists seems to be the\"5W rule\" which emphasise on the fact that answering to the questions\"What\",\"Where\",\"When\", \"Why\" and \"Who\" is a priority at the start of a paper.",
        "Only after that can journalists develop and give secondary information.",
        "This phenomenon is genre dependent and is exploited for processing texts by searching for repetitions.",
        "Example 1 shows a piece of news where the disease name is found in the beginning of the news article and developed later on.",
        "No local pattern is needed to detect what the article is about, repetition phenomena is sufficient.",
        "Example 2 is a counter example, where a disease name is found but not repeated.",
        "This French document reports on a pop music band being the \"coqueluche\" of Hip-Hop, which can mean \"pertussis\", but here means \"fashion\" in a figurative sense (underlining the fast spread of the band's popularity).",
        "Usually, figurative meanings are not used twice in the same article (Itule and Anderson, 2006) and hence the repetition criteria allows one to rightfully ignore this article.",
        "As press articles are made for humans, strong effort is exerted to ensure that readers will understand the main information with as few inferences as possible (Sperber and Wilson, 1998).",
        "In fact, the more inferences the reader has to make, the more errors he is likely to make and the more probability he will get confused and not read the full article.",
        "Repetitions are there to relieve the memory effort.",
        "A point that journalists pay much attention to is leaving as few ambiguities on main facts as possible.",
        "It means that potentially unknown or complicated terms will be used quite rarely.",
