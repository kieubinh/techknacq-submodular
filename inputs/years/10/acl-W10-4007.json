        "Bilingual dictionaries play a pivotal role in a number of Natural Language Processing tasks like Machine Translation and Cross Lingual Information Retrieval(CLIR).",
        "Machine Translation systems often use bilingual dictionaries in order to augment word and phrase alignment (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "CLIR systems use bilingual dictionaries in the query translation step (Grefenstette, 1998).",
        "However, high coverage electronic bilingual dictionaries are not available for all language pairs.",
        "So a major research area in Machine Translation and CLIR is bilingual dictionary extraction.",
        "The most common approach for extracting bilingual dictionary is applying some statistical alignment algorithm on a parallel corpus.",
        "However, parallel corpora are not readily available for most language pairs.",
        "Also, it takes a lot of effort to actually get the accurate translations of sentences.",
        "Hence, constructing parallel corpora involves a lot of effort and time.",
        "So in recent years, extracting bilingual dictionaries from comparable corpora has become an important area of research.",
        "Comparable corpora consist of documents on similar topics in different languages.",
        "Unlike parallel corpora, they are not sentence aligned.",
        "In fact, the sentences in one language do not have to be the exact translations of the sentence in the other language.",
        "However, the two corpora must be on the same domain or topic.",
        "Comparable corpora can be obtained more easily than parallel corpora.",
        "For example, a collection of news articles from the same time period but in different languages can form a comparable corpora.",
        "But after careful study of news articles in English and Hindi published on same days at the same city, we have observed that along with articles on similar topics, the corpora also contain a lot of articles which have no topical similarity.",
        "Thus, the corpora are quite noisy, which makes it unsuitable for lexicon extraction.",
        "Thus another important factor in comparable corpora construction is the degree of similarity of the corpora.",
        "Approaches for lexicon extraction from comparable corpora have been proposed that use the bag-of-words model to find words that occur in similar lexical contexts (Rapp, 1995).",
        "There have been approaches proposed which improve upon this model by using some linguistic information (Yuu and Tsujii, 2009).",
        "However, these require some linguistic tool like dependency parsers which are not commonly obtainable for resource-poor languages.",
        "For example, in case of Indian languages like Hindi and Bengali, we still do not have good enough dependency parsers.",
        "In this paper, we propose a word co-occurrence based approach for lexicon extraction from comparable corpora using English and Hindi as the source and target languages respectively.",
        "We do not use any languagespecific resource in our approach.",
        "We did experiments with 100 words in En-glish,and show that our approach performs significantly better than the the Context Heterogeneity approach (Fung, 1995).",
        "We show the results over corpora with varying degrees of comparability.",
        "The outline of the paper is as follows.",
        "In section 2, we analyze the different approaches for lexicon extraction from comparable corpora.",
        "In section 3, we present our algorithm and the experimental results.",
        "In section 4, we present an analysis of the results followed by the conclusion and future research directions in section 5."

        "One of the first works in the area of comparable corpora mining was based on word co-occurrence based approach (Rapp, 1995).",
        "The basic assumption behind this approach was two words are likely to occur together in the same context if their joint probability of occurrence in a corpus exceeds the probability that the words occur randomly.",
        "In his paper, Rapp made use of a similarity matrix and using a joint probability estimate determined the word maps.",
        "However this approach did not yield significantly good results.",
        "The \"Context Heterogeneity\" approach was one of the pioneering works in this area.",
        "It uses a 2-dimensional context vector for each word based on the right and left context.",
        "The context vector depended on how many distinct words occur in the particular context and also the unigram frequency of the word to be translated.",
        "Euclidean distance between context vectors was used as a similarity measure.",
        "Another approach used Distributed Clustering of Translational Equivalents for word sense acquisition from bilingual comparable corpora (Kaji, 2003).",
        "However, the major drawback of this paper is the assumption that translation equivalents usually represent only one sense of the target word.",
        "This may not be the case for languages having similar origin, for example, Hindi and Bengali.",
        "Approaches using context information for extracting lexical translations from comparable corpora have also been proposed (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999).",
        "But they resulted in very poor coverage.",
        "These approaches were improved upon by extracting phrasal alignments from comparable corpora using joint probability SMT model (Ku-mano et al., 2007).",
        "Another proposed method uses dependency parsing and Dependency Heterogeneity for extracting bilingual lexicon (Yuu and Tsujii, 2009) .",
        "This approach was similar to that of Fung, except they used a dependency parser to get the tags for each word and depending on the frequency of each tag they defined a vector to represent each word in question.",
        "Here too, Euclidean similarity was used to compute the similarity between two words using their context vectors.",
        "However, this method is dependent on availability of a dependency parser for the languages and is not feasible for languages for which resources are scarce.",
        "3 Bilingual Dictionary Extraction Using Co-occurrence Information",
        "The Context Heterogeneity and Dependency Heterogeneity approaches suffer from one major drawback.",
        "They do not use any kind of information about how individual words combine in a particular context to form a meaningful sentence.",
        "They only use some statistics about the number of words that co-occur in a particular context or the number of times a word receives a particular tag in dependency parsing.",
        "So, we wished to study if the quality of dictionary extracted would improve if we consider how individual words co-occur in text and store that information in the form of a vector, with one dimension representing one word in the corpus.",
        "One important point to note here is that the function words in a language are usually very small in number.",
        "If we need to construct a dictionary of function words in two languages, that can be done without much effort manually.",
        "Also, the function words do not play an important role in CLIR applications, as they are usually stripped off.",
        "Our algorithm is based on the intuition that words having similar semantic connotations occur together.",
        "For example, the words \"bread\" is more likely to occur with \"eat\" than with \"play\".",
        "Our algorithm uses this distribution of co-occurrence frequency along with a small initial seed dictionary to extract words that are translations of one another.",
        "We define a co-occurrence vector of words in both the languages, and also record the number of times two words co-occur.",
        "To find the translation for word Wx, we check for the words co-occurring with Wx such that this word already has a map in the other language, and compute a scoring function using all such words co-occurring with Wx.",
        "In short, we use the already existing information to find new translations and add them to the existing lexicon to grow it.",
        "Below is a snapshot of a part of the data from one of our experiments using the FIRE 2010 corpus.",
        "For each word in English and Hindi, the cooccurrence data is expressed as a list of tuples.",

        "From the aforementioned results we can see that a model based on simple word co-occurrence highly outperforms the \"Context Heterogeneity\" model in almost all the cases.",
        "One possible reason behind this is the amount of information captured by our model is more than that captured by the \"Context Heterogeneity\" model.",
        "\"Context Heterogeneity\" does not model actual word-word interactions.",
        "Each word is represented by a function of the number of different contexts it can occur in.",
        "However, we represent the word by a co-occurrence vector.",
        "This captures all possible contexts of the word.",
        "Also, we can actually determine which are the words which co-occur with any other word.",
        "So our model captures more semantics of the word in question than the \"Context Heterogeneity\" model, thereby leading to better results.",
        "Another possible factor is the nature in which we compute the translation scores.",
        "Due to the iterative nature of the algorithm and since we normalize after each iteration, some of the word pairs that received unduly high score in an earlier iteration end up having a substantially low score.",
        "However, since the \"Context Heterogeneity\" does only a single pass over the set of words, it fails to tackle this problem.",
        "The seed dictionary plays an important role in our algorithm.",
        "A good seed dictionary gives us some initial information to work with.",
        "However, since \"Context Heterogeneity\" does not use a seed dictionary, it loses out on the amount of information initially available to it.",
        "Since the seed dictionary size for our approach is quite small, it can be easily constructed manually.",
        "However, how the seed dictionary size varies with corpus size is an issue that remains to be seen.",
        "Another important factor in our algorithm is the way in which we have defined the co-occurrence vectors.",
        "This is not the same as the context vector that we define in case of Context Heterogeneity.",
        "In a windowed context vector, we fail to capture a lot of dependencies that might be captured using a sentence-level co-occurrence.",
        "This problem is especially more visible in case of free-word-order languages like the Indo-European group of languages.",
        "For these languages, a windowed context vector is also likely to introduce many spurious dependencies.",
        "Since Hindi is a language of this family, our algorithm captures many more correct semantic dependencies than Context Heterogeneity algorithm, resulting in better preformance.",
        "Another strong point of our proposed approach is the closeness of the values of Accuracy and MMR.",
        "This shows that the translation candidates extracted by our algorithm are not only correct, but also the best translation candidate gets the highest score with high probability.",
        "This is a very important factor in Machine Translation systems, where a more accurate dictionary would give us an improved performance.",
        "A noticeable point about the evaluation scores is the difference in scores given by the automated system and the manual system.",
        "This can be attributed to synonymy and spelling errors.",
        "In the target language Hindi, synonymy plays a very important part.",
        "It is not expected that all synonyms of a particular word may be present in an online dictionary.",
        "In such cases, the manual evaluator marks a translation pair as True, whereas the automated system marks it as False.",
        "Instances of spelling errors have also been found.",
        "For example, for the word \"neighbors\", the top translation provided by the system was \"paDosana\"(female neighbor).",
        "If we consider root form of words, this is correct.",
        "But the actual translation should be \"paDosiyAn\"(neighbors, may refer to both male and female).",
        "Thus the auto evaluation system tags it as False, whereas the manual evaluator tags it as True.",
        "There are many more such occurrences throughout.",
        "Apart from that, the manual evaluation process has been quite relaxed.",
        "Even if the properties like tense, number of words does not match, as long as the root forms match the manual evaluator has marked it as True.",
        "But this is not the case for the automated evaluator.",
        "Although stemming has been done, but problems still persist which can be only solved by lemmatization, because Hindi is a highly inflected language."
