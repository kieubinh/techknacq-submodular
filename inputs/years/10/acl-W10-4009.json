        "In our scenario, there are two types of textual data to deal with : companion texts in the database (captions), but also user requests.",
        "The two are processed in a very similar way.",
        "The general architecture is depicted in figure 1.",
        "The main components, that will be described in detail, may be summarized as follows:",
        "• Texts (both companions and requests) are first lemmatised with a language-dependent piece of software.",
        "Ambiguities are preserved in a Q-graph structure presented in section 3.1.2.",
        "• Then, the lemmatised texts are annotated with interlingual (ideally unambiguous) lexemes, namely Universal Words (UW) presented in section 3.1.1.",
        "This adds a lot of ambiguities to the structure, as an actual lemma may refer to several semantically different lexemes.",
        "• The possible meanings for lemmas are then weighted in the Q-graph through a disambiguation process.",
        "• Finally, relevant conceptual information is extracted using an alignment between a domain ontology and the interlingual lexemes.",
        "The conceptual information in the output may adopt different shapes, such as a weighted conceptual vector, statements in the A-Box of the ontology or annotations in the original text, etc.",
        "In the case of OMNIA, conceptual information extracted from companion texts is stored in a database, while conceptual information extracted from users requests are transformed into formal requests for the database (such as SQL, SPARQL, etc.",
        ").",
        "The general process is implemented following a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).",
        "Each part of the process corresponds to a service.",
        "This allowed us to reuse part of existing resources developed on heterogeneous platforms using web interfaces (in the best case REST interfaces (Fielding, 2000), but frequently only HTML form-based interfaces).",
        "A service supervisor has been built to deal with such an heterogeneity and address normalization issues (e.g. line-breaks, encoding, identification, cookies, page forwarding, etc.",
        ").",
        "This architecture is able to process multiple tasks concurrently, allowing to deal with users requests in real time while processing companion texts in the background.",
        "We can think of inserting the UW annotations with tags (e.g. XML) directly along the source text as in table 1.",
        "However, this naive approach is not adequate to represent the segmentation ambiguities that can occur in the text interpretation (in the example of table 1, we list the different possible meanings for \"in\", but cannot represent \"waiting\", \"room\" and \"waiting room\" as three possible lexical units).",
        "In order to allow the representation of segmentation and other ambiguities, that can occur in a text interpretation, we propose to use the Q-Systems.",
        "They represent texts in an adequate",

        "An example of the Q-System formalism is given in figure 3 of section 3.2.3.",
        "It presents successively : the textual input representing a Q-graph, a rewriting rule and a graphical view of the Q-graph obtained after the application of the rule (and others).",
        "The Q-Systems were proposed by Alain Colmeraurer at Montreal University (Colmer-auer, 1970).",
        "For our goal, they have three main advantages :",
        "• they provide the formalized internal structure for linguistic portability that we mentioned in the introduction (Hajlaoui and Boitet, 2007) ;",
        "• they unify text processing with powerful graph rewriting systems ;",
        "• they allow the creation or the edition of a process by non-programmers (e.g. linguists) using SLLP (Specialized Language for Linguistic Programming).",

        "It brings two kinds of ambiguities into play : on one hand, an occurrence can be interpreted as different lemmas, on the other, there can be several possible segmentations (eventually overlapping) to determine the lexical units.",
        "For content extraction or information retrieval purpose, it is better to preserve an ambiguity than to badly resolve it.",
        "Therefore we expect from a lemmatiser to keep all ambiguities and to represent them in a confusion network (a simple tagger is not suitable).",
        "Several lemmatiser can be used to cover different languages.",

        "Each rule correspond to an entry in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "To obtain a tractable Q-Systems (sets of rules), we built local dictionaries that contain the entries for fragments of the text (about 250 words in the first experiment).",
