        "In the case of IMRS, the access was limited to the internal representation, visible as a non-linguistic interface in the original prototype (a set of 10 impressions manipulate by a set of 7 checkbox).",

        "Figure 1 shows the general structure of these systems.",
        "Examples of such applications and services are: categorization of various documents such as AFP (Agence France Presse) flash reports or customer messages on an ASS (After Sale Service) server, and information extraction to feed or consult a database (e.g. classified ads, FAQ, automated hotlines)._ ables, but the dictionary is used as a type lattice allowing specialization and generalization.",
        "Figure 1: general structure of an NLP-based CMS We first studied linguistic porting of ecommerce systems handling spontaneous utterances in natural languages, that are often noisy, but constrained by the situation, and constitute a more or less restricted sub-language (Kittredge, 1982), (Harris, 1968) (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986).",
        "This kind of system uses a specific content representation on which the functional kernel works.",
        "In most cases, this content representation is generated from the native language L1 by a content extractor.",
        "In our PhD, we have identified three possible methods of linguistic porting, and have illustrated them by porting to French CATS (Daoud, 2006), a Classified Ads Transaction System in SMS (Arabic) deployed in Amman on Fastlink, as well as IMRS, mentioned above.",

        "EnCo is a tool based on rules and dictionaries used for content extraction in original version of CATS system.",

        "For a company wanting to offer multilinguali-zation services, it would indeed be an ideal situation to have a generic content extractor, and to adapt it to each situation (language, sublanguage, domain, content representation, task, other constraints).",
        "However, there is still no known generic content extractor of that power, and not even a generic content extractor for particular languages, so that this approach cannot be considered at present.",
        "Our approach is then to adapt an existing content extractor, developed for L2 and a different domain/task, or for another language and the same domain/task.",

        "Porting CATS from Arabic to French by statistical translation gave a very good performance, and that with a very small training corpus (less than 10 000 words).",

        "), by associating them the same values as in IMRS.",
        "The content extractor processes simple utterances and extracts from them a 10-dimensional IMRS vector, and the additional information in the form (lists of) of items.",

        "To date, the evaluation has been done only for French.",
        "More than 30 users have participated, perhaps because they were rewarded in a sense: as a kind of compensation, each user could listen to appropriate music adapted to his way of perception and taste.",
        "The use of fuzzy logic proved useful and was perhaps even necessary to give some freedom of choice of impressions to users."
