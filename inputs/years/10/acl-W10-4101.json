        "We should have separate and different phases in the so-called segmentation.",
        "First of all, we need to limit segmentation only to the segmentation of Chinese characters instead of the so-called Chinese words.",
        "In character segmentation, we will extract all the information of each character.",
        "Then we start a phase called Chinese morphological processing (CMP).",
        "The first step of CMP is to do a combination of the separate characters and is then followed by post-segmentation processing, including all sorts of repetitive structures, Chinese-style abbreviations, recognition of pseudo-OOVs and their processing, etc.",
        "The most part of post-segmentation processing may have to be done by some rule-based sub-routines, thus we need change the current corpus-based methodology by merging with rule-based technique."

        "We very often hear some contradictory remarks about its advance.",
        "Most of reports from the evaluation tasks always gave us positive, or even impressive results, such as over 96% accuracy, but some reports were rather negative and expressed their deep concern.",
        "They claimed that word segmentation was still entangled in a difficult situation and no breakthrough in real applications.",
        "By careful and longtime observation, the incompetence is usually caused by the coarseness in the currently prevalent technology.",
        "We carefully observed some Chinese-English MT systems and found some errors were caused even in the very early stage of the processing, that is, in the stage of word segmentation.",
        "No matter the MT is statistics-based or rule-based, they have their Achilles' heel in the segmentation stage.",
        "Can today's prevalent technology effectively cope with the problem?",
        "Or do we need some change?",
        "The present technology is characterized by its \"trilogy\", that is, \"corpora + statistics (ML) + evaluation\".",
        "We regret to say that many researchers today may be indulged in methodology itself rather than the language they have to target.",
        "They are enchanted by the scores and ranks, but they forget the object they are processing.",
        "Therefore we propose that a Chinese morphological processing (CMP) should be taken to replace the current Chinese word segmentation.",
        "CMP includes the following components:",
        "• Chinese character processing (CCP)",
        "• Initial combination of Chinese multicharacter expressions (CMEs)",

        "\"Word or no word\" may be an even older story in Chinese linguistic circle.",
        "One assertion about Chinese words may be quite popular, even to most of western researchers in the NLP circle, that is, different from English or other western languages, there is no space between Chinese words and thus segmentation of a running text into words is necessary for Chinese processing.",
        "However, do words really exist in Chinese?",
        "It is still a vexing and controversial issue.",
        "Some Chinese grammarians argue that in Chinese there are no words at all, but there are only characters instead and some express their strong objection.",

        "It was reported that the concept of \"word\" had not been introduced into China until the very beginning of the last century.",
        "In fact word is alien to Chinese.",

        "In Chinese there are no clear-cut distinction between characters and so-called word, either between multi-character words and those that are similar to English MWE.",
        "Ordinary English people may be surprised if they are told that even in popular Chinese dictionaries there are no entries equivalent to English \"pork \"beef 4W, \"egg (X|g)\", \"rain (verb TM)\", \"snow (verb T=f)\", but there are entries equivalent to English \"lower limbs(Ttê)\", \"give orders (T^*)\", \"appendicitis (Wllfifc)\".",

        "Does English to-kenization deal with MWEs, such as \"United nations\", \"free of charge\", \"first lady\"?",
        "Why does Chinese word segmentation have to deal with Chinese multi-character \"word\"?",
        "We propose that the real task of so-called Chinese word segmentation is to segment a running text into single characters with spaces between.",

        "CCP is in parallel with English tokenization.",
        "In most cases CCP can achieve 100% accuracy.",

        "(c) An official was stabbed to death by the girl pedicurist.",
        "All the four erroneous MT translations above originate from the so-called recognition of OOVs \"£h^6R\" and \"#Pic\" in the segmentation.",

        "When a MT failed to tackle it, the translation would be so poor.",
        "• Abbreviated pseudo-OOVs",
        "Different from English abbreviations or acronyms, Chinese abbreviations in essence are contracted forms of words and expressions.",

        "\"ffUtt\" is the contraction of \"ff^H^t&S\".",

        "As for acceptableness of rhythm, \"ffUtt\" is a three-character expression, in which the first two are a \"verb + object structure and the last is single.",
        "The structure of \"2-character verb + 1-character noun\" is a highly-productive pattern of noun expression in Chinese.",
        "So it is desirable to process this type of structures before syntactic processing.",
        "As the structure can usually be pat-ternized, it is possible to have them well-processed.",

        "(c) Come and try on, it is too small.",
        "The above two erroneous MT translations (a) and (b) originate from the failure in dealing with a typical verb structural pattern for expression to urge someone to have a try.",
        "This pattern is: \"W^f\", its actual meaning is \"have a try\" and \"to see if ...\".",
        "The literal translation of the above instance \"WWff\" may be \"put on, put on and let's have a look\".",
        "Similarly we can have \"B^n^ff\" (which can be literally translated as \"taste, taste, and let's see\").",
        "Chinese is unique with its various types of repetitive structures.",
        "They are by no means rare phenomena in real texts.",
        "Any negligence or failure in the processing of repetitive structures will surely spoil the succedent tasks.",
        "Unfortunately this problem has not caught enough attention of researchers and developers of word segmentation tools.",
        "Most of neglecters usually leave the problem to the vocabulary that they collect.",
        "Let's compare the following two groups of translations:",

        "And the translations of Group B are messy enough to show that the repetitive structures become OOVs and are not well-processed.",
        "Generally most of Chinese repetitive structures originate from three word classes:",

        "It will be impracticable for any Chinese parsing or MT systems to leave all the resolutions of them to the vocabulary rather than special processing module.",
        "Chinese is featured by its plenty of classifiers.",
        "In many cases a concrete noun occurs idiomatically with its particular classifier especially when modified a numeral, for example, \"-^A\"(a person), \"WW(two cars), \"H£/t^H\"(3 kilos of apples).",
        "The processing of this type of structures will surely benefit the succeeding parsing and even word sense disambiguation.",
        "Besides the processing is comparatively easy even in the early stage.",
        "The verb aspect in Chinese is different from that in English.",
        "In general, by using Chinese aspects, we add some procedural tune to a verb rather than relating to time.",
        "In other words Chinese verb aspects give hints of the developmental phases or results, or the capability or possibility of the events.",
        "Chinese verb aspects are expressed by the aspect markers, such as simple markers \"_h\", \"T\", \"ä\", \"ft\", \"0\", \"ä\", \"fe\", \"ff\",",
        "\"ÜÜ\" and compound markers \"AA\", \"TA\", etc.",

        "Finally, when speaking about Chinese aspect, one point we would like to invite readers' attention that different from the aspect of English.",
        "It is known that English aspect is usually closely related to tenses, for example, English verbs can be used in progressive aspect with various tenses, such as present progressive, progressive and future progressive tenses.",
