        "The study of emotion attracts increasingly greater attention in the field of NLP due to its emerging wide applications, such as customer care (Gupta et al., 2010), and social information understanding (Lisa and Steyvers, 2010).",
        "In contrast to sentiment, which is the external subjective evaluation, emotion mainly concentrates on the internal mental state of human (Ortony et al., 1987).",
        "Emotion is indeed a highly complicated concept that raises a lot of controversies in the theories of emotion regarding the fundamental issues such as emotion definition, emotion structure and so on.",
        "The complexity nature of emotion concept makes automatic emotion processing rather challenging.",
        "Most emotion studies put great effort on emotion recognition, identifying emotion classes, such as happiness, sadness, and fear.",
        "On top of this surface level information, deeper level information regarding emotions such as the experiencer, cause, and result of an emotion, needs to be extracted and analyzed for real world applications.",
        "In this paper, we discuss these two closely related emotion tasks, namely emotion recognition and emotion cause detection and how they contribute to emotion processing.",
        "For emotion recognition, we construct an emotion corpus for explicit emotions with an unsupervised method.",
        "Explicit emotions are emotions represented by emotion keywords such as e.g., \"shocked\" in \"He was shocked after hearing the news''.",
        "In the course of emotion recognition, the keyword in an explicit emotion expression is deleted and only contextual information remains.",
        "In our pilot experiments, the context-based emotion identification works fairly well.",
        "This implies that plenty of information is provided in the context for emotion recognition.",
        "Moreover, with an in-depth analysis of the data, we observe that it is often the case that emotions co-occur and interact in a sentence.",
        "In this paper, we deal with emotion recognition from a dependent view so as to capture complicated emotion expressions.",
        "Emotion is often invoked by an event, which in turn is very likely to elicit an event (Descartes 1649, James 1884, Plutchik 1980, Wierzbicka 1999).",
        "Despite the fact that most researches recognize the important role of events in emotion theories, little work, if not none, attempts to make explicit link between events and emotion.",
        "In this paper, we examine emotion constructions based on contextual information which often contains considerable relevant eventive information.",
        "In particular, the correlations between emotion and cause events will be explored based on empirical data.",
        "Emotion causes refer to explicitly expressed propositions that evoke the corresponding emotions.",
        "To enhance emotion recognition, we examine emotion causes occurring in the context of an emotion.",
        "First, we manually annotate causes for emotions in our explicit emotion corpus.",
        "Since an emotion cause can be a complicated event, we model emotion cause detection as a multi-label problem to detect a cross-clause emotion cause.",
        "Furthermore, an in-depth linguistic analysis is done to capture the different constructions in expressing emotion causes.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses some related work regarding emotion recognition and emotion cause detection.",
        "In Section 3, we present our context-based emotion corpus and provide some data analysis.",
        "Section 4 describes our emotion recognition system, and discusses the experiments and results.",
        "In Section 5, we examine our emotion cause detection system, and discuss the performances.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes our main findings for emotion processing from the event perspective."

        "Most current emotion studies focus on the task of emotion recognition, especially in affective lexicon construction.",
        "In comparison with emotion recognition, emotion cause detection is a rather new research area, which account for emotions based on the correlations between emotions and cause events.",
        "This section discusses the related research on emotion recognition and emotion cause detection.",
        "Although emotion recognition has been intensively studied, some issues concerning emotion remain unresolved, such as emotion definition, emotion representation, and emotion classification technologies.",
        "For the emotion definition, emotion has been well-known for its abstract and uncertain definition which hinders emotion processing as a whole.",
        "Ortony et al., (1987) conducted an empirical study for a structure of affective lexicon based on the ~500 words used in previous emotion studies.",
        "However, most of the emotion corpora in NLP try to avoid the emotion definition problem.",
        "Instead, they choose to rely on the intuition of annotators (Ren's Blog Emotion Corpus, RBEC, Quan and Ren, 2009) or authors (Mishne's blog emotion corpus, Mishne, 2005).",
        "Therefore, one of the crucial drawbacks of emotion corpora is the problem of poor quality.",
        "In this paper, we explore emotion annotation from a different perspective.",
        "We concentrate on explicit emotions, and utilize their contextual information for emotion recognition.",
        "In terms of emotion representation, textual emotion corpora are basically annotated using either the enumerative representation or the compositional representation (Chen et al., 2009).",
        "The enumerative representation assigns an emotion a unique label, such as pride and jealousy.",
        "The compositional representation represents an emotion through a vector with a small set of fixed basic emotions with associated strength.",
        "For instance, pride is decomposed into \"happiness + fear\" according to Turner (2000).",
        "With regard to emotion recognition technologies, there are two kinds of classification models.",
        "One is based on an independent view (Mishne, 2005; Mihalcea and Liu, 2006; Aman and Szpa-kowicz, 2007; Tokuhisa et al., 2008; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), and the other is a dependent view (Abbasi et al., 2008; Keshtkar and Inkpen, 2009).",
        "The independent view treats emotions separately, and often chooses a single-label classification approach to identify emotions.",
        "In contrast, the dependent view takes into account complicated emotion expressions, such as emotion interaction and emotion co-occurrences, and thus requires more complicated models.",
        "Abbasi et al.",
        "(2008) adopt an ensemble classifier to detect the cooccurrences of different emotions; Keshtkar and Inkpen (2009) use iteratively single-label classifiers in the top-down order of a given emotion hierarchy.",
        "In this paper, we examine emotion recognition as a multi-label problem and investigate several multi-label classification approaches.",
        "Although most emotion theories recognize the important role of causes in emotion analysis (Descartes, 1649; James, 1884; Plutchik, 1962; Wierz-bicka 1996), yet very few studies in NLP explore the event composition and causal relation of emotions.",
        "As a pilot study, the current study proposes an emotion cause detection system.",
        "Emotion cause detection can be considered as a kind of causal relation detection between two events.",
        "In other words, emotion is envisioned as an event type which triggers another event, i.e. cause event.",
        "We attempt to examine emotion cause relations for open domains.",
        "However, not much work (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Girju, 2003; Chang and Choi, 2006) has been done on this kind of general causal relation for open domains.",
        "Most existing causal relation detection systems contain two steps: 1) cause candidate identification; 2) causal relation detection.",
        "However, Step 1) is often oversimplified in real systems.",
        "For example, the cause-effect pairs are limited to two noun phrases (Chang and Choi, 2005; Girju, 2003), or two clauses connected with selected conjunction words (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",
        "Moreover, the task of Step 2) often is considered as a binary classification problem, i.e. \"causal\" vs. \"non-causal\".",
        "With regard to feature extraction, there are two kinds of information extracted to identify the causal relation in Step 2).",
        "One is constructions expressing a cause-effect relation (Chang and Choi, 2005; Girju, 2003), and the other is semantic information in a text (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Persing and Ng, 2009), such as word pair probability.",
        "Undoubtedly, the two kinds of information often interact with each other in a real cause detection system."

        "2010).",

        "From this corpus, we observe that ~54% emotional sentences contain two emotions, yet only ~2% sentences contain more than two emotions.",
        "This implies emotion recognition is a typical multi-label problem.",
        "Particularly, more effort should be put on the co-occurrences of two emotions.",
        "Most emotion theories agree that the five primary emotions (i.e. happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise) are prototypical emotions.",
        "Therefore, for emotion cause detection, we only deal with the emotional sentences containing a keyword representing one of these primary emotions.",
        "Beyond a focus sentence, its context (the previous sentence and the following sentence) is also extracted, and those three sentences constitute an entry.",
        "After filtering non-emotional and ambiguous sentences, 5,629 entries remain in the emotion cause corpus.",
        "Each emotion keyword is annotated with its corresponding causes if existing.",
        "An emotion keyword can sometimes be associated with more than one cause, in such a case, both causes are marked.",
        "Moreover, the cause type is also identified, which is either a nominal event or a verbal event (a verb or a nominalization).",
        "From the corpus, we notice that 72% of the extracted entries express emotions, and 80% of the emotional entries have a cause, which means that causal event is a strong indicator for emotion recognition.",
        "Furthermore, since the actual cause can sometimes be so complicated that it involves several events, we investigate the span of a cause text as follows.",
        "For each emotion keyword, an entry is segmented into clauses with some punctuations, and thus an entry becomes a list of cause candidates.",
        "In terms of the cause distribution, we find ~90% causes occurring between 'left_2' and 'right_1'.",
        "Therefore, our cause search is limited to the list of cause candidates which contains five text units, i.e. <left_2, left_1, left_0, right_0, right_1>.",
        "If the clause where emotion keyword locates is assumed as a focus clause, 'left_2' and 'left_1 ' are the two previous clauses, and 'right_1' is the following one.",
        "'left_0' and 'right_0' are the partial texts of the focus clause, which locate in the left side of and the right side of the emotion keyword, respectively.",
