        "Figure 1 shows photocopies of printed and hand written documents from the 19th century.",
        "Within any given paragraph, the Chinese characters are printed as evenly spaced characters, with nothing to separate words from words, phrases from phrases, and sentences from sentences.",
        "Thus, inside a paragraph, explicit boundaries of sentences and clauses are lacking.",
        "In order to understand the structure, readers of Classical Chinese have to manually identify these boundaries during the reading.",

        "The outcomes of Classical Chinese sentence segmentation are not well-defined in linguistics at present.",

        "A sentence such as \" n-I^ëffiW^fatÉ\" (\"I do not believe it because it is ridiculous.\")",
        "is a short sentence itself, and does not require any segmentation.",
        "For a given text, there is no strict rule to determine at which level the segmentation should be performed.",

        "Besides Classical Chinese, sentence boundary detection (SBD) is also an issue in English and other western languages.",
        "SBD in written texts and speech represents quite different problems.",
        "For written text, the SBD task is to distinguish periods used as the end-of-sentence indicator (full stop) from other usages, such as parts of abbreviations and decimal points.",
        "By contrast, the task of SBD in speech is closely related to the task of Classical Chinese sentence segmentation.",
        "In speech processing, the outcome of speech recognizers is a sequence of words, in which the punctuation marks are absence, and the sentence boundaries are thus lacking.",
        "To recover the syntactic structure of the original speech, SBD is required.",
        "Like Classical Chinese sentence segmentation, the task of SBD in speech is to determine which of the inter-word boundaries in the stream of words should be marked as end-of-sentence, and then to divide the entire word sequence into individual sentences.",
        "Empirical methods are commonly employed to deal with this problem.",
        "Such methods involve many different sequence labeling models including HMMs (Shriberg et al., 2000), maximum entropy (Maxent) models (Liu et al., 2004), and CRFs (Liu et al., 2005).",
        "Among these, a CRF model used in Liu et al. (2005) offered the lowest error rate.",
        "Chinese word segmentation is a problem closely related to Classical Chinese sentence segmentation.",
        "The former identifies the boundaries of the words in a given text, while the latter identifies the boundaries of the sentences, clauses, and phrases.",
        "In contrast to sentences and clauses, the length of Chinese words is shorter, and the variety of Chinese words is more limited.",
        "Despite the minor unknown words, most of the frequent words can be handled with a dictionary predefined by Chinese language experts or extracted from the corpus automatically.",
        "However, it is impossible to maintain a dictionary of the infinite number of sentences and clauses.",
        "For these reasons, the Classical Chinese sentence segmentation problem is more challenging.",
        "Methods of Chinese word segmentation can be mainly classified into heuristic rule-based approaches, statistical machine learning approaches, and hybrid approaches.",
        "Hybrid approaches combine the advantages of heuristic and statistical approaches to achieve better results (Gao et al., 2003; Xue, 2003; Peng et al., 2004).",
        "Xue (2003) transformed the Chinese word segmentation problem into a tagging problem.",
        "For a given sequence of Chinese characters, the author applies a Maxent tagger to assign each character one of four positions-of-character (POC) tags, and then coverts the tagged sequence into a segmented sequence.",
        "The four POC tags used in Xue (2003) denote the positions of characters within a word.",
        "For example, the first character of a word is tagged \"left boundary\", the last character of a word is tagged \"right boundary\", the middle character of a word is tagged \"middle\", and a single character that forms a word by itself is tagged \"single-character-word\".",
        "Once the given sequence is tagged, the boundaries of words are also revealed, and the task of segmentation becomes straightforward.",
        "However, the Maxent models used in Xue (2003) suffer from an inherent the label bias problem.",
        "Peng et al. (2004) uses the CRFs to address this issue.",
        "The tags used in Peng et al. (2004) are of only two types, \"start\" and \"non-start\", in which the \"start\" tag denotes the first character of a word, and the characters in other positions are given the \"non-start\" tag.",
        "The closest previous works to Classic Chinese sentence segmentation are Huang (2008) and Zhang et al.",
        "(2009).",

        "To construct the sentence segmenter on",
        "CRF, the tagging scheme and the feature functions play the crucial roles.",
        "In the previous works (Huang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2009), POC tags used in Chinese word segmentation (Xue, 2003) are converted to denote the positions of characters within a clause.",
        "The 4-tag set is redefined as L (\"the left boundary of a clause\"), R (\"the right boundary of a clause\"), M (\"the middle character of a clause\"), and S (\"a single character forming a clause\").",
        "For example, the sentence \"ItSWi^^MM^^mSI T\"Jttfr<\" should be tagged as follows.",
        "We can easily split the sentence into clauses by making a break after each character tagged R and S and obtain the final outcome \"zftSWH /",
        "In this work, more tagging schemes are experimented.",

        "The segmented fragments (clauses) for sentence segmentation are usually much longer than those for word segmentation.",
        "Thus, we add more middle states into the 4-tag set to model the nature of long fragments.",
        "The Markov chain of our tagging scheme is shown in Figure 2, where L2, L3, Lk are the additional states to extend Xue's 4-tag set.",

        "The first one is Mandarin Phonetic Symbols (MPS), also known as Bopomofo, which is a phonetic system for Modern Chinese.",
        "The initial/final/tone of each character can be obtained from its MPS label.",
        "However, Chinese pronunciation varies in the thousands of years, and the pronunciation of Modern Chinese is much different from the Classical Chinese.",
        "For this reason, two Ancient Chinese phonetic systems, Fanqie ( j3£\"t>U) and Guangyun (JjffSi), are applied to label the characters.",
        "The pronunciation of a target character is represented by two characters in the Fanqie system.",
        "The first character indicates the initial of the target character, and the second character indicates the combination of the final and the tone.",

        "However, the performance is degraded when the k is larger.",

        "The performance of MPS is significantly inferior to the other two phonetic systems.",
        "As expected, the pronunciation of Classical Chinese is much different from that of Modern Chinese, thus the Ancient Chinese phonetic systems are more suitable for this work.",

        "However, performance of the combination of Character and Fanqie is similar to the performance of Character only model.",
        "This result indicates that the phonetic information is an important clue to Classical Chinese sentence segmentation but such information is mostly already covered by the characters.",

        "The best performance comes from the combination of Character and Fanqie with the 5-tag set.",
        "We use this configuration as our final tagger.",
