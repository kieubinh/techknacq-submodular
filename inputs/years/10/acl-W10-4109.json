        "Recently latent variable model has shown great potential in recovering the underlying structures.",
        "For example, the task of POS tagging is to recover the appropriate sequence structure given the input word sequence (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "One of the most popular example of latent models is Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which has been extensively studied for many years (Rabiner, 1989).",
        "The key problem of HMM is how to find an optimal hidden state number and the topology appropriately.",
        "In most cases, the topology of HMM is predefined by exploiting the domain or empirical knowledge.",
        "This topology will be fixed during the whole process.",
        "Therefore how to select the optimal topology for a certain application or a set of training data is still a problem, because many researches show that varying the size of the state space greatly affects the performance of HMM.",
        "Generally there are two ways to adjust the state number: top-down and bottom-up methods.",
        "In the bottom-up methods (Brand, 1999), the state number is initialized with a relatively large number.",
        "During the training, the states are merged or trimmed and ended with a small set of states.",
        "On the other hand, the top-down methods (Siddiqi et al., 2007) start from a small state set and split one or some states until no further improvement can be obtained.",
        "The bottom-up approaches require huge computational cost in deciding the states to be merged, which makes it impractical for applications with large state space.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the latter approaches.",
        "Another problem in HMM is that EM algorithm might yield local maximum value.",
        "Johnson (2007) points out that training HMM with EM gives poor results because it leads to a fairly flat distribution of hidden states when the empirical distribution is highly skewed.",
        "A multinomial prior, which favors sparse distribution, is a good choice for natural language tasks.",
        "In this paper, we proposed a new procedure for inferring the HMM topology and estimating its parameters simultaneously.",
        "Gibbs sampling has been used in infinite HMM (iHMM) (Beal et al., 2001; Fox et al., 2008; Van Gael et al., 2008) for inference.",
        "Unfortunately Gibbs sampling is slow and difficult to be converged.",
        "In this paper, we proposed the variational Bayesian inference for the adaptive HMM model with Dirichlet prior.",
        "It involves a modification to the Baum-Welch algorithm.",
        "In each iteration, we replaced only one hidden state with two new states until convergence.",
        "To reduce the number of observation variables, the words are pre-clustered and represented by the exemplar within the same cluster.",
        "It is a one-to-many clustering, because the same word play different roles under different contexts.",
        "We evaluate the similarity between the distribution of contexts, with the assumption that the context distribution implies syntactic pattern of the given word (Zelling, 1968; Weeds and Weir, 2003).",
        "With this clustering, more contextual information can be considered without increasing the model complexity.",
        "A relatively simple model is important for unsupervised task in terms of computational burden and data sparseness.",
        "This is the reason why we do not increase the order of HMM(Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2008;",
        "Headden et al., 2008).",
        "With unsupervised algorithms, there are two aspects to be evaluated (Van Gael et al., 2009).",
        "Fist one is how good the outcome clusters are.",
        "We compare the HMM results with the manually POS tags and report the similarity measures based on information theory.",
        "On the other hand, we test how good the outputs act as an intermediate results.",
        "In many natural language tasks, the inputs are word class, not the actual lexical item, for reason of sparsity.",
        "In this paper, we choose the unsupervised dependency parsing as the application to investigate whether our clusters can replace the manual labeled tags or not.",
        "The paper is organized as below: in section 2, we describe the definition of HMM and its variance inference.",
        "We present our dynamic HMM in section 3.",
        "To overcome the context limitation in the first-order HMM, we present our distributional similarity clustering in section 4.",
        "In section 5, we reported the results of the mentioned experiments while section 6 concludes the paper."
