        "1991; Gale and Church, 1991); b) lexical information in bilingual dictionaries (Ma, 2006); c) statistical translation model (Chen, 1993), or the composite of more than one approach (Simard and Plamondon, 1998; Moore, 2002).",
        "To overcome the lack of parallel documents, comparable corpora are also used to mine parallel sentences, which raises further challenges since the bilingual contents are not strictly parallel.",
        "For instance, Zhao and Vogel (2002) investigated the mining of parallel sentences for Web bilingual news.",
        "Munteanu and Marcu (2005) presented a method for discovering parallel sentences in large Chinese, Arabic, and English comparable, non-parallel corpora based on a maximum entropy classifier.",
        "Cao et al., (2007) and Lin et al., (2008) proposed two different methods utilizing the parenthesis pattern to extract term translations from bilingual web pages.",

        "(2009) presented an adaptive pattern-based method which produced Chinese-English bilingual sentences and terms with over 80% accuracy.",
        "Only a few papers were found on the related work in the patent domain.",
        "Higuchi et al.",
        "(2001) used the titles and abstracts of 32,000 Japanese-English bilingual patents to extract bilingual terms.",
        "Utiyama and Isahara (2007) mined about 2 million parallel sentences by using two parts in the description section of Japanese-English comparable patents.",
        "Lu et al.",
        "(2009) derived about 160K parallel sentences from Chinese-English comparable patents by aligning sentences and filtering alignments with the combination of different quality measures.",
        "Another closely related work is the English-Chinese parallel corpus (Lu et al., 2010), which is largely extended by this work, in which both the number of patents and that of parallel sentences are augmented by about 100%, and more SMT experiments are given.",
        "Moreover, we show the potential for mining parallel corpora from multilingual patents involving other languages.",
        "For statistical machine translation (SMT), tremendous strides have been made in two decades, including Brown et al.",

        "The websites from which the Chinese and English patents were downloaded were quite slow to access, and were occasionally down during access.",
        "To avoid too much workload for the websites, the downloading speed had been limited.",
        "Some large patents would cost much time for the websites to respond and had be specifically handled.",
        "It took considerable efforts to obtain these comparable patents.",
        "In addition our English-Chinese corpus mined in this study is at least one order of magnitude larger, we give some other differences between ours and those introduced in Section 2 (Higuchi et al., 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Lu et al., 2009)",
        "1) Their bilingual patents were identified by the priority information in the US patents, and could not be easily extended to language pairs without English; while our method using PCT applications as the pivot could be easily extended to other language pairs as illustrated in Section 5.",
        "2) The translation process is different: their patents were filed in USA Patent Office in English by translating from Japanese or Chinese, while our patents were first filed in English as a PCT application, and later translated into Chinese.",
        "The different translation processes may have different characteristics.",
        "Since the PCT and multilingual patent applications increase rapidly in recent years as discussed in Section 3, we could expect more multilingual patents to enlarge the large-scale parallel corpora with the new applications and keep them up-to-date with new technical terms.",
        "On the other hand, patents are usually translated by patent agents or professionals, we could expect high quality translations from multilingual patents.",
        "We have been planning to build trilingual and quadrilingual corpora from multilingual patents.",
        "One possible limitation of patent corpora is that the sentences are all from technical domains and written in formal style, and thus it is interesting to know if the parallel sentences could improve the performance of SMT systems on NIST MT evaluation corpus containing news sentences and web sentences."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we show how a large high-quality English-Chinese parallel corpus can be mined from a large amount of comparable patents harvested from the Web, which is the largest single parallel corpus in terms of the number of parallel sentences.",
        "Some sampled parallel sentences are available at http://www.livac.org/smt/parpat.html, and more parallel sentences would be publicly available to the research community.",
        "With 1.7 million PCT patent applications and their corresponding national ones, there are considerable potentials of constructing large-scale high-quality parallel corpora for languages.",
        "We give an estimation on the sizes of multilingual parallel corpora which could be obtained from multilingual patents involving English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, etc., which would to some extent reduce the parallel data acquisition bottleneck in multilingual information processing."
