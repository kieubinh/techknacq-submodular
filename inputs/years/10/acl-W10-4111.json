        "From the statistic, the number of modern Chinese adverbs is about 1000 with the broad definition standard.",
        "Compared with other fuctional words, the adverbs number is much larger.",
        "The function and usages of modern Chinese adverbs vary widely from each other, especially some common adverbs.",
        "Therefore for modern Chinese text understanding, adverbs are the important text features which can not be neglected.",
