        "Information Extraction (IE) is to automatically pull out the structured information required by the users from a large volume of plain text.",
        "It normally includes three sequential tasks, i.e., entity extraction, relation extraction and event extraction.",
        "In this paper, we limit our focus on relation extraction.",
        "In early time, pattern-based approaches were the main focus of most research studies in relation extraction.",
        "Although pattern-based approaches achieved reasonably good results, they have some obvious flaws.",
        "It requires expensive handcraft work to assemble patterns and not all relations can be identified by a set of reliable patterns (Willy Yap, 2009).",
        "Also, once the interest of task is transferred to a different domain or a different language, patterns have to be revised or even rewritten.",
        "That is to say, the discovered patterns are heavily dependent on the task in a specific domain or on a particular corpus.",
        "Naturally, a vast amount of work was spent on feature-based machine learning approaches in later years.",
        "In this camp, relation extraction is typically cast as a classification problem, where the most important issue is to train a model to scale and measure the similarity of features reflecting relation instances.",
        "The entity semantic information expressing relation was often formulated as the lexical and syntactic features, which are identical to a certain linear vector in high dimensions.",
        "Many learning models are capable of self-training and classifying these vectors according to similarity, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN).",
        "Recently, kernel-based approaches have been developing rapidly.",
        "These approaches involved kernels of structure representations, like parse tree or dependency tree, in similarity calculation.",
        "In fact, feature-based approaches can be viewed as the special and simplified kinds of kernel-based approaches.",
        "They used dot-product as the kernel function and did not range over the intricate structure information (Ji, et al.",
        "2009).",
        "Relation extraction in Chinese received quite limited attention as compared to English and other western languages.",
        "The main reason is the unique characteristic of Chinese, such as more flexible grammar, lack of boundary information and morphological variations etc (Sun and Dong, 2009).",
        "Especially, the existing Chinese syntactic analysis tools at current stage are not yet reliable to capture the valuable structured information.",
        "It is urgent to develop approaches that are in particular suitable for Chinese relation extraction.",
        "In this paper, we explore the use of Deep Belief Network (DBN), a new feature-based machine learning model for Chinese relation extraction.",
        "It is a neural network model developed under the deep learning architecture that is claimed by Hinton (2006) to be able to automatically learn a deep hierarchy of features with increasing levels of abstraction for the complex problems like natural language processing (NLP).",
        "It avoids assembling patterns that express the semantic relation information and meanwhile it succeeds to produce accurate model that is not confined to the parsing results.",
