        "The overall SP of a Chinese text is the sum of the SP of all its component parts.",

        "This is because no matter which writing style a text belongs to, it has a particular discourse structure which determines the importance of the component parts.",
        "Discourse structure is the organization and constitution law of language units (greater than sentence) within a discourse.",
        "It formally indicates the hierarchy of discourse contents, semantically guarantees the integrity of discourse contents and logically reflects the coherence of discourse contents.",

        "A discourse consists of several semantic parts.",
        "The central meaning of a discourse is the aggregation of the central meaning of its semantic parts in a certain logic way.",

        "It may be composed of as small as only a paragraph or as large as even a whole chapter.",

        "For argumentation, a typical argumentation may be divided into 4 parts as introduction, viewpoint presentation, demonstration and conclusion.",
        "Recognizing semantic parts has great significance in understanding the central idea of a text.",
        "Chinese reviews are a kind of argumentation.",
        "According to what is reviewed, they can be categorized into finance reviews (e.g., stock review), literature reviews (e.g., book review), product reviews (e.g., automobile review), current affairs reviews (e.g., news review), etc.",
        "Generally speaking, Chinese reviews bear the following features.",
        "Firstly, the topic of a Chinese review is explicit.",
        "A Chinese review always comments on some specific phenomenon, person or affair.",
        "The object it deals with is very explicit.",
        "Secondly, a Chinese review has generally only one topic.",
        "Thus, in a Chinese review, the reviewer always explicitly expresses his/her opinion towards the topic.",
        "The sentiment of the discussed topic is rather explicit.",
        "Some Chinese reviews may discuss subtopics and corresponding opinions on each subtopic may be shown.",
        "But it will not change or influence the reviewer's basic sentiment on the topic.",
        "Thirdly, the topic of a Chinese review is closely related to its title.",
        "Chinese Reviews often use concise expressions in titles to show clearly the topics or the themes.",
        "Therefore, the topic of a review can generally be found in its title.",
        "Fourthly, Chinese reviews have fixed expression patterns.",
        "A typical Chinese review consists of 4 semantic parts as is mentioned above.",
        "The reviewer's sentiment expressions towards the topic generally appears in the \"viewpoint presentation\" and \"conclusion\" part.",
        "To prove the correctness of our knowledge of Chinese reviews, we conducted a survey on 560 Chinese reviews which were collected from newspapers and the Internet.",
        "The manually examined results, which are showed as follows, verify the above mentioned 4 features of Chinese reviews.",
        "\"I\" stands for introduction, \"D\" for demonstration, \"C\" for conclusion and \"V\" for viewpoint presentation.",
        "According to the above analysis, the SP of a Chinese review is manifested by a certain expression pattern through several semantic parts, and its overall SP is generally expressed in the \"viewpoint presentation\" and \"conclusion\" part.",
        "Thus a straightforward idea to obtain the SP of a Chinese review is to: (1) partition the review into several semantic parts; (2) distinguish the viewpoint presentation part and the conclusion part; (3) analyze only the sentiment of the viewpoint presentation part and the conclusion part and take the result as the overall SP of the review.",
        "Intuitively, this seemingly simple method can achieve very good result.",
        "However, to perform an automatic discourse structure analysis itself is actually a hard task and will lose precision during the processing; to distinguish different semantic parts by means of language cues without a discourse structure analysis can only solve some instead of all problems.",
        "Therefore, we introduce the concept of topic sentiment sentence.",
        "A topic sentiment sentence is defined as a sentence bearing both the topic concept and sentiment towards that topic.",
        "The topic sentiment sentences in a Chinese review are the intersection of the topic sentences and sentiment sentences in it.",
        "Topic sentiment sentences are representative for sentiment analysis because, firstly, they are homogeneous in topic.",
        "And more importantly, the sentiment bearing in these sentences refer to the same topic.",
        "This makes sentiment in each sentence computable.",
        "Earlier works like Turney (2002) or Pang et al. (2002) don't take into account the topic and the sentiment relating to that topic together as a whole, thus makes the result less reliable in that the sentiment words and phrases processed are not homogeneous in topic.",
        "Secondly, the degree of semantic similarity between topic sentiment sentences and the topic of the review reflects a potential relatedness between the topic sentiment sentences and their corresponding semantic parts.",
        "The more a topic sentiment sentence is similar in meaning to the topic, the more likely it appears in the viewpoint presentation part or conclusion part.",
        "This is just the reason we avoid an analysis of discourse structure of a review.",
        "We also try to avoid an automatic partition of semantic parts of a review since the topic sentiment sentences themselves potentially point out the corresponding semantic parts they belong to.",
        "Thirdly, the distribution of the topic sentiment sentences, including density and extensity, reflects more or less the writer's intensity of attitude toward what is being discussed and can help with detailed sentiment analysis.",
