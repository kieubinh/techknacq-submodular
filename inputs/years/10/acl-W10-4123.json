        "We also intend to analyze the syntactic correlations of prosodic phrase in broadcasting news speech, and compare the phonetic and prosodic features in movie dialogues among several same-name movies in different historical eras.",
        "The contributions are as follows.",
        "Firstly, the syntactic structure is more complex than the prosodic structure, some conjunction and particle, such as deO, deng3, he2, dan4 and so on, more likely attached to the end of left structure or the beginning of right one and form a prosodic word, if the number of lexical words mismatch the prosodic words.",
        "Otherwise, they have almost similar structure.",
        "Secondly, the speech of 1970s in last century is greatly influenced by the special era.",
        "People usually use exaggerated voice, pronounce hard and raise the pitch unnaturally, giving others a taste of lecturing and ordering.",
        "In contrast, the speech of Mandarin in 1950s is more natural and close to the daily life pronunciation and intonation.",
        "Even so, the pitch patterns have no big changes, and this may explain that the pitch patterns are comparatively stable in Chinese Mandarin.",
        "Future research will include treatment of correlation between syntax and prosody within IP or IG, ideally comparing the diachronic phonetic or prosodic changes in Mandarin by the past 100 years.",
        "Additionally, we would like to tackle the problem of data management, update and periodical increasing as time passes."
