        "The basic idea of this approach is to conduct the segmentation of inflectional affixes from left side of a character string to its right side and vice versa.",
        "But during the process, the critical issue is to determine the border between stens and inflectional affixes.",
        "Under many situations, vague borders between stens and inflectional affixes cause the inaccurate stemming.",

        "The basic idea of this algorithm is to find all the segmentation forms of character strings waited for the segmentation starting from position \"i\".",

        "So we need to classify the inflectional affixes and enact the rules to guide their connection order.",
