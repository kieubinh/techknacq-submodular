        "Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) has witnessed a prominent progress in the first four SIGHAN Bakeoffs.",
        "Since Xue (2003) used character-based tagging, this method has attracted more and more attention.",
        "Some previous work (Peng et al., 2004; Tseng et al., 2005; Low et al., 2005) illustrated the effectiveness of using characters as tagging units, while literatures (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhao and Kit, 2007a; Zhang and Clark, 2007) focus on employing lexical words or subwords as tagging units.",
        "Because the word-based models can capture the word-level contextual information and IV knowledge.",
        "Besides, many strategies are proposed to balance the IV and OOV performance (Wang et al., 2008).",
        "CRF has been widely used in sequence labeling tasks and has a good performance (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Zhao and Kit (2007b; 2008) attempt to integrate global information with local information to further improve CRF-based tagging method of CWS, which provides a solid foundation for strengthening CRF learning with unsupervised learning outcomes.",
        "In order to increase the accuracy of tagging using CRF, we adopt the strategy, which is: if the marginal probability of characters is lower than a threshold, the modified component based on HMM will be trigged; combining the confidence measure the results will be regenerated."

        "In addition, we also use some rules to deal with the strings within letters and numbers.",
        "Tag Set A 6-tag set is adopted in our system.",
        "It includes six tags: B, B2, B3, M, E and S. Here, Tag B and E stand for the first and the last position in a multi-character word, respectively.",
        "S stands for a single-character word.",
        "B2 and B3 stand for the second and the third position in a",

        "M stands for the fourth or more rear position in a multi-character word with more than four characters.",
        "The 6-tag set is proved to work more effectively than other tag sets in improving the segmentation performance of CRFs by Zhao et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Feature templates In our system, six n-gram templates, namely, C-1, C0, C1, C-1C0, CCu C-1C1 are selected as features, where C stands for a character and the subscripts -1, 0 and 1 stand for the previous, current and next character, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, another one is character type feature template T-1T0T1.",
        "We use four classes of character sets which are predefined as: class N represents numbers, class L represents non-Chinese letters, class P represents punctuation labels and class C represents Chinese characters.",
        "Except for the character feature, we also employ global word feature templates.",
        "The basic idea of using global word information for CWS is to inform the supervised learner how likely it is that the subsequence can be a word candidate.",
        "The accessor variety (AV) (Feng et al., 2005) is opted as global word feature, which is integrated into CRF successfully in literatures (Zhao and Kit, 2007b; Zhao and Kit, 2008).",
        "The AV value of a substring s is defined as:",
        "AV(s) = min |Lûv (s), R»} (1) Where the left and right AV values Lv (s) and Rav (s) are defined, respectively, as the number of its distinct predecessors and the number of its distinct successors.",
        "Multiple feature templates are used to represent word candidates of various lengths identified by the AV criterion.",
        "Meanwhile, in order to alleviate the sparse data problem, we follow the feature function definition for a word candidate s with a score AV (s) in Zhao and Kit (2008), namely:",
        "In order to improve the efficiency, all candidates longer than five characters are given up.",
        "The AV features of word candidates can't directly be utilized to direct CRF learning before being transferred to the information of characters.",
        "So we only choose the one with the greatest AV score to activate the above feature function for that character.",
        "In the open test, we only add another feature of 'FRE', the basic idea of which is if a string matches a word in an existing dictionary, it may be a clue that the string is likely a true word.",
        "Then more word boundary information can be obtained, which may be helpful for CRF learning on CWS.",
        "The dictionary we used is downloaded from the Internet® and consists of 108,750 words with length of one to four characters.",
        "We get FRE features similar to the AV features.",
        "The MP (short for marginal probability) of each character labeled with one of the six tags can be got separately through the basic CRF tagger.",
        "Here, B replaces 'B' and 'S' , and I represents other tags ('B2', 'B3', 'M', 'E').",
        "So each character has corresponding new MP as defined in formula (3) and (4).",
        "calculated by using forward-backward algorithm and more details are in Lafferty et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "A low confident word refers to a word with word boundary ambiguity which can be reflected by the MP of the first character of a word.",
        "That is, it's a low confident word if the MP of the first character of the word is lower than a threshold ß (it's an empirical value and can be obtained by experiments).",
        "After getting the new MP, all these low confident candidate words are recombined with their direct predecessors until the occurrence of a word that the MP of its first character is above the threshold ß, and then a new substring is generated for post processing.",
        "Then, we use class-based HMM to re-segment the substrings mentioned above.",
        "Given a word",

        "Then, a class-based HMM model (Liu, 2004) can be got.",
        "Where P(ci | ci-1 ) indicates the transitive probability from one class to another and it can be obtained from training corpora.",
        "The word boundary of results from HMM is also represented by tag 'B' and 'I' which meaning are the same as mentioned in above.",
        "There are two segmentation results for substrings with low MP candidates after reprocessing using HMM.",
        "Analyzing experiments data, we find wrong tags labeled by CRF are mainly: OOV words in test data, IV words and incorrect words recognized by CRF.",
        "Rectifying the tags with lower MP simply may produce an even worse performance in some case.",
        "For example, some OOV words are recognized correctly by CRF but with low MP.",
        "So, we can't accept the revised results completely.",
        "A confidence measure approach is used to resolve this problem.",
        "Its calculation is defined as:",
        "Co is the MP of the character as 'I', l is the premium coefficient.",
        "Based on the new value, a threshold t was used, if the value was lower than t , the original tag 'I' will be rejected and changed into the tag 'B' which is labeled by",
        "HMM.",
        "At last, we use a simple rule to post-process the result directed at the strings that containing letters, numbers and punctuations.",
