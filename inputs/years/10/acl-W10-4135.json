        "Chinese word segmentation is deemed to be a prerequisite for Chinese language processing.",
        "The competition in the first CIPS-SIGHAN joint conference put the task of Chinese word segmentation in a more challengeable setting, where training and test data are obtained from different domains.",
        "This setting is widely known as domain adaptation.",
        "For domain adaptation, either a large-scale un-labeled target domain data or a small size of labeled target domain data is required to adapt a system built on source domain data to the target domain.",
        "In this word segmentation competition, unfortunately, only a small size of unlabeled target domain data is available.",
        "Thus we focus on handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "For this purpose, our system is based on a combination of subword-based tagging method (Zhang et al., 2006) and accessor variety-based new word recognition method (Feng et al., 2004).",

        "That is , each Chinese character can be assigned to one of the tags in {B, B2, B3, M, E, S }.",

        "dure for constructing a subword list is similar to the one used in (Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "To enhance the effect of subwords, we go one step further to build a list, named confident-word list here and below, which contains words that are not a portion of other words and are never segmented in the training data.",
        "In the competition, 400 most frequent words in the confident-word list are used.",
        "With subword list and confident-word list, both training and test data are segmented with forward maximum match method by using the union of subword list and confident-word list.",
        "Each segmentation unit (single-character or multicharacter unit) in the segmentation results are regarded as \"pseudo character\" and thus can be represented with the basic features in Table 1 and two additional features as shown in Table 2.",

        "Given a unsegmented text, each substring (candidate word) in the text can be assigned a value according to the following equation:",
        "where the left and right AV values, Lav (s) and Rav (s) are defined to be the number of distinct character types appearing on the left and right, respectively.",
        "Candidate words are sorted in the descending order of AV values and most highly ranked ones can be chosen as new words.",
        "In practical applications, heuristic filtering rules are generally needed (Feng et al., 2004).",

        "Moreover, we filter out candidate words that have AV values less than 3.",
        "Unfortunately, candidate word list generated this way still contains many noisy words (substrings that are not words).",
        "One possible reason is that unlabeled data (test data) used in the competition is extremely small in size.",

        "Moreover, we take all English words in test data as OOV words.",
        "A simple heuristic rule is defined for the purpose of English word recognition: an English word is a consecutive sequence ofEnglish characters and punctuations between two English characters (including these two characters).",

        "is str in subword list is str in confident-word list",
        "• A punctuation tends to be a single-character word.",
        "If a punctation's previous character and next character are both Chinese characters, i.e. not punctuation, digit, or English character, we always regard the punctuation as a word.",
        "• Consecutive and identical punctuations tend to be joined together as a word.",
        "For example, \" – \" represents a Chinese hyphen which consists of three and \"!!!\"",
        "is used to show emphasizing.",
        "Inspired by this observations, we would like to unite consecutive and identical punctuations as a single word.",
        "• When the character \" • \" appears in the training data, it is generally used as a connections symbol in a foreign person name, such as\"5: • (Saint John)\".",
        "Taking this observation into consideration, we always unite the character \" • \" and its previous and next segment units into a single word.",
        "A similar rule is designed to unite consecutive digits on the sides of the symbol ex.",
        "\"1.11\".",
        "• We notice that four consecutive characters which are in the pattern of AABB generally form a single word in Chinese, for example \"jp.jp.",
        "(dull)\".",
        "Taking this observation into account, we always unite consecutive characters in the AABB into a single word.",
        "Words containing digits generally belong to a open class, for example, the word \"2012^ (AD 2012) \" means a date.",
        "Thus CRF-based segmenter has difficulties in recognizing such words since they are frequently OOV words.",
        "To attack this challenge, we first generalize digits in the training data.",
        "In detail, we replaced consecutive digits with \"*\".",
        "For example, the word \"2012^\" will be transformed into \"*^-\".",
        "Second, we collect word templates which consist of three consecutive words on condition that at least one of the words in a template contains the character \"*\" and that the template appears in the training data more than 4 times.",
        "For example, we can get a template like \"* M (month) * S (day) (publish)\".",
        "With such templates, we are able to correct errors, say\"10M 17 S fc\"into\"10M 17 S fc\".",
        "We notice that long words have less ambiguity than short words in the sense of being words.",
        "For example, characters in \"A i[ jfr jfr (full of talents)\" always form a word in the training data, whereas \"A have two plausible splitting forms, as \"A^~ (talent)\" or \"A (people) 4\" (only)\".",
        "In our system, we collect words that have at least four characters and filter out words which belong to one of following cases: 1) the word is a part of other words; 2) the word consists solely of punctation and/or digit.",
        "For example, # i-51 (materialism)\" and ¥ – f (120)\" are discarded, since the former is a substring of the word \"B##Î5l;f- (materialist)\" and the latter is a word of digits.",
        "Finally we get a list containing about 6k words.",
        "If a character sequence in the test data is a member in the list, it is retained as a word in the final segmentation results.",
        "Another group of IV rules concern character sequences that have unique splitting in the training data.",
        "For example, \"^cAfn (women)\" is always split as \"-^cA (woman) n (s)\".",
        "Hereafter, we refer to such character sequences as unique-split-sequence (USS).",
        "In our system, we are concerned with UUSs which are composed of less than 5 words.",
        "In order to apply UUSs for postprocessing, we first collect word sequence of variable length (word number) from training data.",
        "In detail, we collect word sequences of two words, three words, and four words.",
        "Second, word sequences that have more than one splitting cases in the training data are filtered out.",
        "Third, spaces between words are removed to form USSs.",
        "For example, the words \"- A (woman) n (s)\" will form the USS \"- An \".",
        "Finally, we search the test data for each USS.",
        "If the searching succeeds, the USS will be replaced with the corresponding word sequence."
