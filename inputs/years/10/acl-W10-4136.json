        "After more than twenty years of intensive researches, considerable progress has been made in improving the performance of Chinese word segmentation.",
        "The bakeoff series hosted by the ACL SIGHAN shows that high F scores can be achieved in the closed test tracks, in which only specified training materials can be used in learning segmentation models.",
        "Instead of using lexicon-driven approaches, state-of-art Chinese word segmenter now use character tagging model as Xue(2003) firstly proposed.",
        "In character tagging model, no predefined Chinese lexicons are required; a tagging model is learned using manually segmented training texts.",
        "The model is then used to assign each character a tag indicating the position of this character within word.",
        "Xue's approach has been become the most popular approach to Chinese word segmentation for its high performance and unified way to deal with OOV issues.",
        "Most of the segmentation works since then follow this approach.",
        "Major improvements in this line of research including: 1) More sophisticated learning models were introduced instead of the maximum entropy model that Xue used, like conditional random fields (CRFs) model which fit the sequence tagging tasks much better than maximum entropy model (Tseng et al.,2005).",
        "2) More tags were introduced, as Zhao et al.",
        "(2006) shows 6 tags are superior to 4 tags in achieving high performance.",
        "3) New feature templates were added, such as templates used in representing numbers, dates, letters etc.",
        "(Low et al., 2005)",
        "Usually, the performance of segmentation model is evaluated on a test set from the same domain as the training set.",
        "Such evaluation does not reveal its ability to deal with domain variation.",
        "It is believed that, when test set is from other domains than the domain where training set is from, the learned model normally underperforms substantially.",
        "The CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of Chinese word segmentation is set to focus on the cross-domain performance of Chinese word segmentation model.",
        "We participate in the closed test track for simplified Chinese.",
        "Different with the previous bakeoffs, CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 bake-off provides both label corpus and unlabeled corpora.",
        "The labeled corpus is composed of texts from newspaper and has about 1.1 million words in total.",
        "The two unlabeled corpora cover two domains: literature and computer science, and each domain have about 100K characters in size.",
        "The test corpora cover four domains, two of which are literature and computer science, and the other two domains are unknown before releasing.",
        "We build the Chinese word segmenter following the character tagging model.",
        "Instead of using CRF model, we use the hidden Markov support vector machines (Altun et al., 2003), which is also a sequence labeling model like CRF.",
        "We just show it can also be used to model Chinese segmentation tasks as an alternative other than CRF.",
        "To increase the ability of the model to recall OOV words, we propose to use x statistics and bootstrapping strategy to the overall performance of the model to out-of-domain texts."

        "The hidden Markov support vector machine model is inspired by the hidden Markov model and is an instance of structural support vector machine dedicated to solve sequence labeling learning, a problem that CRF model is assumed to solve.",
        "In the SVM-HMM model, the sequence labeling problems is modeled by learning a discriminant function F: X*Y-^R over the input sequence and the label sequence pairs, thus prediction of label sequence can be derived by maximizing F over all possible label sequences for a specific given input sequence x. f (x; w) = arg max F (x, y ; w)",
        "In the structural SVMs, F is assumed to be linear in some combined feature representation of the input sequence and the label sequence y(x,y), i.e.",
