        "After a lot of researches, Chinese word segmentation has achieved a high accuracy.",
        "Many methods have been presented, among which the CRFs model has attracted more and more attention.",
        "Zhao's group used the CRFs model in the task of Chinese word segmentation in Bakeoff-4 and they ranked at the top in all closed tests of word segmentation (Zhao and Kit, 2008).",
        "The CRFs model has been widely used because of its excellent performance.",
        "However, finding a better segmentation algorithm for the out-of-domain text is the focus of CIP-SIGHAN-2010 bakeoff.",
        "We still consider word segmentation as a sequence labeling problem.",
        "What we concern is how to use the unlabeled corpora to enrich the supervised CRFs learning.",
        "So we take some strategies to make use of the information of the texts in the unlabeled corpora."

        "In this section, we will describe our system in details.",
        "The system is based on the CRFs model and we propose some novel steps for some improvements.",
        "It mainly consists of three steps: preprocessing, CRF-based labeling, and relabeling.",
        "This step mainly includes two operations.",
        "First, we should cut the whole text into a series of sentences.",
        "We regard '?",
        "'! '",
        "and '; ' as the symbols of the boundary between sentences.",
        "Then we do atomic segmentation to all the sentences.",
        "Here Atomic segmentation represents that we should regard the continuous nonChinese characters as a whole.",
        "Take the word computer' as an example, we should regard computer' as a whole, but not treat it as 8 separate letters of c', o', m', p', u', t', e', and r'.",
        "Conditional random field (CRF) is an extension of both Maximum Entropy Model (MEMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which was firstly introduced by Lafferty (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "It is an undirected graphical model trained to maximize the conditional probability of the desired outputs given the corresponding inputs.",
        "This model has achieved great successes in word segmentation.",
        "In the CRFs model, the conditional distribution P(y\\x) of the labels Y givens observations X directly is defined:",
        "y is the label sequence, x is observation sequence, Zx is a normalization term that makes the probability of all state sequences sum to one; fk(yt-i, yt, t) is often a binary-valued feature function and A k is the weight of fk.",
        "In our system, we choose six types of tags according to character position in a word.",
        "According to Zhao's work (Zhao et al., 2006a), the 6-tag set enables our system to generate a better CRF model than the 4-tag set.",
        "In our experiments, we test both the 6-tag set and the 4-tag set, and the 6-tag set truly has a better result.",
        "The 6-tag set is defined as below:",
        "Here B, B2, B3, M, E represent the first, second, third, continuing and end character positions in a multi-character word, and S is the single-character word tag.",
        "We adopt 6 n-gram feature templates as features.",
        "Some researches have proved that the combination of 6-tag set and 6 n-gram feature template can achieve a better performance (Zhao et al., 2006a; Zhao et al., 2006b; Zhao and Kit, 2007).",
        "The 6 n-gram feature templates used in our system are C-1, C0, C1, C-1C0, C0C1, C-1C1.",
        "Here C stands for a character and the subscripts -1, 0 and 1 stand for the previous, current and next character, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, we try to take advantage of the types for the characters.",
        "For example, in our system D stands for the date, N stands for the number, L stands for the letter, P stands for the punctuation and C stands for the other characters.",
        "Introducing these features is beneficial to the CRFs learning.",
        "Since the unlabeled corpora belong to different domains, traditional methods have some limitations.",
        "In this section, we propose an additional step to make good use of the unlabelled data for this special task.",
        "This step is based on the outputs of the CRFs model in the previous step.",
        "After CRFs learning, we get a training model.",
        "With this model, we can label the literature, computer, medicine and finance corpora.",
        "According to the outputs of the CRFs model, we choose some labeled sentences with high confidence and add them to the training corpus.",
        "Here the selection of high confidence must guarantee that the probability of the sentences selected being correct segmentations is rather high and the number of the sentences selected is not too little or they will make no difference to the generation of the new CRF model.",
        "Since the existing training model does not contain the information in the out-of-domain data, we treat the labeled sentences with high confidence as additional training corpus.",
        "Then we retrain the CRFs model with the new training data.",
        "With the training data extracted from different domains, the training model incorporates more cross-domain information and it can work better in the corresponding cross-domain prediction task."

        "The test corpus contains 4 domains, which are literature, computer science, medicine and finance.",
        "There are four evaluation metrics used in this bake-off task: Precision, Recall, F1 measure (F1 = 2RPI(R+P)) and OOV measure, where R and P are the recall and precision of the segmentation and OOV (Out-Of-Vocabulary Word) is a word which occurs in the reference corpus but does not occur in the labeled training corpus.",

        "Due to the diversity of the English words, segmenting the sentences with a lot non-Chinese characters correctly is rather difficult only through CRF learning.",
