        "In Chinese information processing, word is the minimum unit to be used independently and meaningfully.",
        "But, Chinese sentences are written as string of characters without clear delimiters.",
        "Therefore, the first step in Chinese information processing is to identify the sequence of words in a sentence, namely Chinese word segmentation.",
        "It's the foundation of syntax analysis, semantic analysis and discourse comprehension, and also the important section of machine translation, question answering, information retrieval and information extraction(Jiang Wei, et al., 2007; Liu Qun, et al., 2004).",
        "The research of Chinese word segmentation has been advancing rapidly and has gained many exciting achievements in recent years(Huang Changning, Zhao Hai.",
        "2007; Song Yan, et al., 2009), especially after the First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-off held in 2003.",
        "In this field, character-based tagging attracts more eyes and almost all excellent systems in evaluations has adopted this technology thought(Huang Changning, Zhao Hai.",
        "2007; Zhao Hai, Jie Chunyu.",
        "2007).",
        "In 2002, Xue presented the first paper about character-based tagging on the 1st international workshop of special interest group on Chinese language processing, SIGHAN.",
        "He segmented Chinese words with four character tags: LL, RR, MM and LR, depending on its position within a word using a maximum entropy tagger(Xue N W, Converse S P. 2002).",
        "Huang et al.",
        "implemented character-based segmentation system with conditional random fields, six wordposition tags: B, B2, B3, M, E, S, and TMPT-6 and achieved very excellent results(Huang Changning, Zhao Hai.",
        "2006; Huang Changning, Zhao Hai.",
        "2007).",
        "On this base, Zhao hai presented an effective subsequence-based tagging for Chinese word segmentation(Zhao Hai, Jie Chunyu.",
        "2007).",
        "All these references considered Chinese segmentation as character or subsequence tagging problem and implemented with statistical language models.",
        "The evaluation for Chinese word segmentation in CIPS-SIGHAN 2010 has two subtasks: word segmentation for simplified Chinese text and for traditional Chinese text.",
        "The simplified Chinese corpuses are offered by Institute of Computing Technology(ICT) and Peking Uni-versity(PKU), and the traditional Chinese cor-puses are offered City University of Hong Kong(CityU).",
        "The corpuses involved four domains: literary, computer science, medicine and finance.",
        "Considering plenty of abbreviations, numeric and other non-Chinese strings, our segmentation system adopted a method combining character-based and subsequence-based tagging, and took CRFs as sequence tagging model.",

        "2 Combining character-based and subsequence-based tagging for Chinese word segmentation",
        "In character-based tagging approach to Chinese word segmentation, it tags the word-position of non-Chinese characters, such as punctuation, letter words and numeric, just like what to do with Chinese characters.",
        "This method works well when there is a small quantity of these characters.",
        "But plenty of these characters will cut down the segmentation performance, especially some abbreviation and programming statement in computer science domain.",
        "Considering this, we used a method combining character-based and subsequence-based tagging that is to take an English word or programming statement as a subsequence to tag its wordposition.",
        "The correct tag for one-character word is S.",
        "In the closed track of traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese, four word-position tag set is used: B (Beginning of word), M(Middle of word), E(End of word) and S(one-character word).",
        "The tag set is also used in open tracks of traditional Chinese.",
        "And we used six wordposition tag set for open tracks of simplified Chinese: B(Beginning of word), B2(2nd character of word), B3(3rd character of word)",
        "M(Middle of word), E(End of word) and S(one-character word).",
        "To define the relationship of some specific language components or information in context and some being forecasted things is the main function of feature template.",
        "It is generally considered that feature template is abstracted from a group of context features on same attributes.",
        "In CRF++0.53 toolkit, there are two kind of templates: Unigram template and Bigram template.",
        "In word-position tagging Chinese segmentation, available features are rather limited.",
        "The main feature needed to take into account is character feature, which includes current character, previous and next character.",
        "Jiang, Wang and Guan (2007) abstracted the character features into six templates according different distances from current character.",
        "They are Unigram templates.",
        "The type and meaning of these templates are presented in table 1.",
        "When training with CRFs model, these templates will be extended to thousands of features and every feature has a group of corresponding feature functions.",
        "All these functions are very important to CRFs model learning.",
        "Seen from table 1, Bigram feature has only one template: T_iT0 which describes the word-position transfer feature of two adjacent characters or subsequences.",
        "This feature extends limited features in training.",
        "Take four-WORD-POSITION-tag for instance, it can be extended into sixteen features.",
        "In our tracks, open or closed one, the seven templates in table 1: C-1, C0, C1, C_iC0, C0C1, C-1C1, T_iT0are used.",
