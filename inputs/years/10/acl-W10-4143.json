        "Two main parts of the method are a benchmark database and several well-designed evaluation metrics.",
        "Its feasibility has been proven in the English language.",
        "After the release of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) and the PARSEVAL metrics (Black et al., 1991), some new corpus-based syntactic parsing techniques were explored in the English language.",
        "Based on them, many state-of-art English parser were built, including the well-known Collins parser (Collins, 2003), Charniak parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007).",
        "By automatically transforming the constituent structure trees annotated in PTB to other linguistic formalisms, such as dependency grammar, and combinatory categorical grammar (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007), many syntactic parser other than the CFG formalism were also developed.",
        "These include Malt Parser (Ni-vre et al., 2007), MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005), Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and C&C Parser (Clark and Curran, 2007).",

        "(Li et al., 2010) proposed a joint syntactic and semantic model for parsing Chinese.",
        "But till now, there is not a good Chinese parser whose performance can approach the state-of-art English parser.",

        "The other is the unknown",
        "words.",
        "The POS accuracy of them is about 4010% lower than the overall accuracy.",
        "2) The chunks with complex internal structures show poor performance in two chunking tasks.",
        "How to recognize them correctly needs more lexical semantic knowledge.",
        "3) The joint recognition of constituent tag and head position show poor performance in the constituent parsing task of EDCs.",
        "Therefore, the second Chinese syntactic parsing evaluation (CIPS-Bakeoff-ParsEval-2010) jointed with SIGHAN Bakeoff tasks was proposed to deal with these problems.",
        "Some new designing ideas are as follows:",
        "1) We use the segments sentences as the input of the syntactic parser to test the effects of POS tagging for Chinese parsing.",
        "2) We design a new metric to evaluate performance of event construction recognition in a constituent parser of EDCs.",
        "3) We try to evaluate the performance of event relation recognition in Chinese complex sentence.",
