        "Constituent parsing is a challenging but useful task aiming at analyzing the constituent structure of a sentence.",
        "Recently, it is widely adopted by the popular applications of natural language processing techniques, such as machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005), synonym generation (Shinyama et al., 2002), relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and lexical resource augmentation (Snow et al., 2004).",
        "A great deal of researches have been conducted on this topic with promising progress (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Sagae and Lavie, 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Finkel et al., 2008; Huang, 2008).",
        "Recently, several effective dependency parsing algorithms has been developed and shows excellent performance in the responding parsing tasks (McDonald, 2006; Nivre and Scholz, 2004).",
        "Since graph structures of dependency and constituent parsing over a sentence are strongly related, they should be benefited from each other.",
        "It is true that constituent parsing may be smoothly altered to fit dependency parsing.",
        "However, due to the inconvenience from dependency to constituent structure, it is not so easy to adopt the latter",

        "for the former.",

        "For the 2010 CIPS-ParsEval shared task, only segmented sentences are given in test data without part-of-speech (POS) tags, a POS tagger is required for this task.",

        "The conversion from constituent to dependency structures is straightforward with some specific rules based on linguistic theory.",
        "However, there is not an effective method which can accurately accomplish the opposite transformation, from the dependency structures back into constituent ones due to the existence of ambiguity introduced by the former transformation.",
        "Aimed at the above difficulty, our solution is to introduce a formal dependency structure and a machine learning method so that the ambiguity from dependency structures to constituent structures can be dealt with automatically.",
        "We first transform constituent trees into the form that all productions for all subtrees are either unary or binary, before converting them to dependency structures.",
        "Due to the binarization, the target constituent trees of the conversion from dependency back to constituent structures are binary branching.",
        "This binarization is done by the left-factoring approach described in (Charniak et al., 1998; Petrov and Klein, 2008), which converts each production with n children, where n > 2, into n – 1 binary productions.",
        "Additional non-terminal nodes introduced in this conversion must be clearly marked.",
        "Transforming the binary branching trees into arbitrary branching trees is accomplished by using the reverse process.",
        "We train a classifier to decide which dependency edges should be transformed first at each step of conversion automatically.",
        "After the binarization described in the previous section, only one dependency edge should be transformed at each step.",
        "Therefore the classifier only need to decide which dependency edge should be transformed at each step during the conversion.",
        "As a result of the projective property of constituent structures, this problem only happens in the cases that modifiers are at both sides of their heads.",
        "And for these cases that one head has multiple modifiers, only the leftmost or the rightmost dependency edge could be transformed first.",
        "Therefore, a binary classifier is always enough for the disambiguation at each step.",
        "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is adopted as the learning algorithm for the binary classifier and the features are in Table 1.",
        "The rest problem is that we should restore the label for each constituent when dependency structure trees are again converted to constituent structures.",
        "The problem is solved by storing constituent labels as labels of dependency types.",

        "Our conversion method obtains 99.76% precision and 99.76% recall, which is a great performance.",
        "Based on the proposed conversion method, dependency parsing algorithms can be used for constituent parsing.",
        "This can be done by firstly transforming training data from constituents into dependencies and extract training instances to train a binary classifier for dependency-constituent conversion, then training a dependency parser using the transformed training data.",
