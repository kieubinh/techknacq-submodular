        "Chinese parsing is an important basic research for Chinese information processing research, and gets the attention of many researchers.",
        "Current research focuses on the research on syntactic knowledge acquisition based on the corpus, and its goal is to use statistical methods from a good tree bank annotation to learn the parsing needed knowledge, and the trained parser also promotes the work of automatic/semi-automatic annotation to corpus.",
        "Statistical methods have an advantage for fine-grained knowledge of the language than the rule method, and can automatically learn knowledge from the annotated corpus, and is attractive and worthy of research.",
        "Meanwhile, many Chinese parsers that have the background for the practical application use the rule-based approach, and, in addition to the accumulation of knowledge in the process of manual knowledge acquisition, also use statistical methods to help get the phrases from the corpus, and also include the translation equivalents acquired automatically for machine translation.",
        "An important direction of development for these systems is to find ways to learn a lot of phrase knowledge from the corpus, which can greatly reduce the difficulties encountered in the ambiguity resolution to improve the accuracy of syntactic analysis.",
        "For Chinese-English machine translation system, the difficulty will be significantly lower after adding a large number of phrases and their translation to the system, and as a result, some syntactic structure ambiguities are eliminated, and many phrases are translated as a whole and the readability of the translation also are improved.",
        "An important development trend of natural language processing is that corpus is considered as processing objects and sources of knowledge acquisition.",
        "Rule approach has proven to be difficult to the task of processing large-scale real corpus, so the researchers turn to the help of statistical methods, and many experiments prove that statistical methods indeed have made great progress.",
        "But the statistical method has its inherent shortcomings, and statistical methods alone can hardly reach expectations of the perfect goal of natural language processing.",
        "Thus, Many researchers begin to explore ways of combination of statistical methods and rules, and have made some progress, but there is still a long way to go from the ultimate goal of natural language processing (computer can fully understand the nature of human language).",
        "The current trend of integration of empiricism and rationalism in natural language processing is a significant phenomenon, and its development will produce a lot of valuable results, and natural language processing research and applications will benefit from it.",
        "The CCID's future research will focus on methods of automatically extracting knowledge of Chinese phrases and their translations.",
        "These methods will be mainly statistical methods, combining with some of the rules means to facilitate access to single-language knowledge and improve the correct translation rate.",
        "Progress of the research in this regard will be helpful for our practical machine translation system to improve the quality of translation.",
        "At the same time, it has a direct role in improving the quality of Chinese parser.",
