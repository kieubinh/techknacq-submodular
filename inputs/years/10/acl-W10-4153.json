        "Different from English PND, word segmentation techniques are needed for Chinese PND tasks.",
        "In practice, person names are highly ambiguous because different people may have the same name, and the same name can be written in different ways.",
        "It's an n-to-n mapping of person names to the specific people.",
        "There are two main challenges on Chinese PND: the first one is how to correctly recognize personal names in the text, and the other is how to distinguish different persons who have the same name.",
        "For address these challenges, we designed a rule-based combination technique to improve NER performance and propose a multi-stage clustering framework for Chinese PND.",
        "We participated in the bakeoff of the Chinese PND task, on the test set and the diagnosis test set, our two systems are ranked at the 1st and 2nd position.",

      "text": [
        "In this section, we describe the framework of our systems in more detail, involving data preprocessing, discard-class document identification, feature definition, clustering algorithms, and subsystem combination.",
        "There are around 100-300 news articles per personal name in the evaluation corpus.",
        "Each article is stored in the form of XML and encoded in UTF-8.",
        "At first, each news article should be preprocessed as follows:",
        "• Use a publicly available Chinese encoding Converter tool to convert each news article from UTF-8 coding into GB;",
        "• Remove all XML tags;",
        "• Process Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and name entity recognition (NER);",
        "The performance of word segmentation and NER tools generally affect the effectiveness of our Chinese PND systems.",
        "During system developing process, we found that the publicly available NER systems obtain unsatisfactory performance on evaluation data.",
        "To address this challenge, we propose a new rule-based combination technique to improve NER performance.",
        "In our combination framework, two different NER systems are utilized, including a CRF-based NER system and our laboratory's NER system (Yao et al.,2002).",
        "The latter was implemented based on the maximum matching principle and some linguistic post-preprocessing rules.",
        "Since both two NER systems adopt different technical frameworks, it is possible to achieve a better performance by means of system combination techniques.",
        "The basic idea of our combination method is to first simply combine the results produced by both NER systems, and further utilize some heuristic post-processing rules to refine NE identification results.",
        "To achieve this goal, we first investigate error types caused by both NER systems, and design some post-preprocessing rules to correct errors or select the appropriate NER results from disagreements.",
        "Notice that such rules are learned from sample data (i.e., training set), not from test set.",
        "Experimental results demonstrate satisfactory NER performance by introducing these heuristic refinement rules as follows:",
        "• Conjunction Rules.",
        "Two NEs separated by a conjunction (such as \"^n\",\"f^\",\"^j\", '\\ \" ) belong to the same type, e.g., \"HJ /adj.",
        "$\\ / =kimM /person\".",
        "Such a conjunction rule can help NER systems make a consistent prediction on both NEs, e.g., \"H BJ/person\" and \"H^/person\".",
        "• Professional Title Rules.",
        "Professional title words such as are strong indicators of person names, e.g., \"Ü/^RlJ\".",
        "Such a rule can be written in the form of \"professionaltitle +personname\".",
        "• Suffix Rules.",
        "If an identified person name is followed by a suffix of another type of named entities such as location, it is not a true person name, for example, S^/person fl/W/j^K\".",
        "Since is a suffix of a location name.",
        "\"MPMPMM ^^/person fj£/location-suffix\" should be revised to be a new location name, namely \"W»Ml^«/location\".",
        "• Foreign Person Name Rules.",
        "Two identified person names connected by a dot are merged into a single foreign person name, e.g., \"W. /^M\" =>",
        "• Chinese Surname Rules.",
        "Surnames are very important for Chinese person name identification.",
        "However, some common surnames can be single words depending upon the context, for example, the Chinese word \" ^ \" can be either a surname or a quantifier.",
        "To tackle this problem, some post-processing rules for \"jrfc, S, H, M, M\" are designed in our system.",
        "• Query-Dependent Rules.",
        "Given a query person name A, if the string AB occurring in the current document has been identified as a single person name many times in other documents, our system would tend to segment AB as a single person name rather than as A/B.",
        "For example, if \"fßft J\" was identified as a true person name more than one time in other documents, in such a case, \"iXm/mft/ J/^/\"=> \"iXm/IBffiJ /person",
        "Incorporating these above post-processing rules, our NER system based on heuristic postprocessing rules shows 98.89% precision of NER on training set.",
        "Seen from evaluation data, there are a lot of documents belonging to a specific class, referred to as discard-class.",
        "In the discard-class, the query person name occurring in the document is not a true person name.",
        "For example, a query word \"jjf^l\" is a famous ocean name not a person name in the sentence \"HttPlM^^",
        "^^B*»> jf%fllfgg%5£fë\".",
        "In such a case, the corresponding document is considered as discard-class.",
        "Along this line, actually the discard-class document identification is very simple task.",
        "If a document does not contain a true person name that is the same as the query or contains the query, it is a discard-class document.",
        "To identify different types of person name and for the PND purpose, some effective binary features are defined to construct the document representation as feature vectors as follows:",
        "• Personal attributes: involving professional title, affiliation, location, cooccurrence person name and organization related to the given query.",
        "• NE-type Features: collecting all NEs occurring in the context of the given query.",
        "There are two kinds of NE-type features used in our systems, local features and global features.",
        "The global features are defined with respect to the whole document while the local features are extracted only from the two or three adjacent sentences for the given query.",
        "• BOW-type features: constructing the context feature vector based on bag-of-word model.",
        "Similarly, there are local and global BOW-type features with respect to the context considered.",
        "Seen from the training set, 36% of person names indicate journalists, 10% are sportsmen, and the remaining are common person names.",
        "Based on such observations, it is necessary to utilize different methodology to PND on different types of person names, for example, because the most effective information to distinguish different journalists are the reports' location and colleagues, instead of the whole document content.",
        "To achieve a satisfactory PND performance, in our system we design three different modules for analyzing journalist, sportsman and common person name, respectively.",
        "In our system, some regular expressions are designed to determine whether a person name is a journalist or not.",
        "For example:",
        "To disambiguate on the journalist class, our system utilizes a rule-based clustering technique distinguish different journalists.",
        "For each document containing the query person name as journalists, we first extract the organization and the location occurring in the local context of the query.",
        "Two such documents can be put into the same cluster if they contain the same organization or location names, otherwise not.",
        "In our system, a location dictionary containing province-city information extracted from Wikipedia is used to identify location name.",
        "For example: 31ft (tm X& » ISlIj ...), M^(5* j£ jgdj H^Ê; WW ffltë...).",
        "Based on this dictionary, it is very easy to map a city to its corresponding province.",
        "Like done in PND on the journalist class, we also use rule-based clustering techniques for disambiguating sportsman class.",
        "The major difference is to utilize topic features for PND on the sportsman class.",
        "If the topic of the given document is sports, this document can be considered as sportsman class.",
        "The key is to how to automatically identify the topic of the document containing the query.",
        "To address this challenge, we adopt a domain knowledge based technique for document topic identification.",
        "The basic idea is to utilize a domain knowledge dictionary NEUKD developed by our lab, which contains more than 600,000 domain associated terms and the corresponding domain features.",
        "Some domain associated terms defined in NEUKD are shown in Table 1.",
        "In the domain knowledge based topic identification algorithm, all domain associated terms occurring in the given document are first mapped into domain features such as football, basketball or cycling.",
        "The most frequent domain feature is considered as the most likely topic.",

        "Two documents with the same topic can be grouped into the same cluster.",
        "We proposed a multi-stage clustering framework for PND on common person name class, as shown In Figure 1.",
        "In the multi-stage clustering framework, the first-stage is to adopt strict rule-based hard clustering algorithm using the feature set of personal attributes.",
        "The second-stage is to implement constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering using NE-type local features.",
        "The third-stage is to design hierarchical agglomerative clustering using BOW-type global features.",
        "By combining those above techniques, we submitted the first system named NEU_1.",
        "Besides, we also submitted another PND system named NEU_2 by using the single-link hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm in which the distance of two clusters is the cosine similarity of their most similar members (Ma-saki et al., 2009, Duda et al., 2004).",
        "The difference between our two submission systems NEU_1 and NEU_2 is the feature weighting method.",
        "The motivation of feature weighting method used in NEU_2 is to assume that words surrounding the query person name in the given document are more important features than those far away from it, and person name and location names occurring in the context are more discriminative features than common words for PND purpose.",
        "Along this line, in the feature weighting scheme used in NEU_2, for each feature extracted from the sentence containing the query person name, the weight of a word-type feature with the POS of \"ns\", \"ni\" or \"nh \" is assigned as 3, Otherwise 1.5; For the features extracted from other sentences, the weight of a word with the POS of \"ns\"or \"nh \" is set to be 2, the ones of \"ni\" POS is set to 1.5, otherwise 1.0.",
