        "The first step of the method is to build social networks, by analyze the relationship of different people.",
        "Generally if two people's name always occurs in same document or very near context ,they will have close relations, one of them will be helpful for disambiguate the other.",
        "In this paper, we first use the domain of character's document to classify roughly, and then context information using social networking is considered again to disambiguate person's name again."
