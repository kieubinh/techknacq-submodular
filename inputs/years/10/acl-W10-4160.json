        "As the amount of web information expands at an ever more rapid pace, extraction of information for specific named entity is more and more important.",
        "Usually there are named-entity ambiguity in web data, for example more than one person use a same name, therefore it is difficult to decide which document refers to a specific named entity.",
        "The goal of CPN disambiguation is to clustering input Xinhua news corpus by the entity each document refers to.",
        "The new documents which span a time of fourteen years are extracted on web.",
        "As description of CPN disambiguation task of CIPS-SIGHAN 2010, Chinese personal name disambiguation is potentially more challenging due to the need for word segmentation, which could introduce errors that can in large part be avoided in the English task.",
        "In this paper we employ a CPN disambiguation system that extracts NE and common nouns from the input corpus as features, and then computes the similarity of each two documents in the corpus based on feature vector.",
        "Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm (AK Jain et al., 1999) is used to implement clustering.",
        "After a great deal of analysis of news corpus, we constitute several rules, the experiments show that these rules can improve the result of this task.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the preprocessing of test corpus, and in section 3 we present the methodology of our system.",
        "In section 4 we present the experimental results and give a conclusion in section 5."

        "Firstly, corpuses including a given name string are in different files, one document one file.",
        "In order to convenient for processing, we combine these documents into one file, distinguish them with document id.",
        "Secondly, some news corpuses have several subtitles but usually only part of them including focused name string, the others are noise of disambiguate of focused named entity, for example a news about sports may contain several subtitles about basketball, swimming, race and so on.",
        "These noises are removed from the corpus by us.",
        "Lastly, there is a lack of dateline in a few documents; in general, these data-lines are recognized as part of text, they can be recognized through simple matching method.",

      "text": [
        "The system follows a procedure include: word segmentation, the detection of ambiguous objects, feature extractions, computation of document similarity and clustering.",
        "First, the text is segmented by a word segmentation system explored by Luo and Huang (2009).",
        "The second step is extract all features from segmented text, all features are put into two feature vectors: NE vector and common noun vector.",
        "Then we will compute the distance between corresponding vectors of each two documents, the standard SoftTFIDF (Chen and Martin, 2007) are employed to compute the distance between two feature vectors.",
        "Lastly, we use the HAC algorithm for clustering of documents.",
        "Word segmentation is a base and difficult work of natural language processing (NLP) and a precondition of feature extraction.",
        "In this paper, the word segmentation system explored by Luo and Huang (2009) are employed to do this work.",
        "This system training on the corpus of 2000's \"People's Daily\".",
        "In addition, this system can recognize named entities including personal name, location name and organization name.",
        "We can extract these NEs by part-of-speech (POS) directly.",
        "Given a name string, the documents can be divided into three groups:",
        "(1) Documents which contain names that are exactly match the query name string.",
        "(2) Documents which contain names that have a substring exactly match the query name string.",
        "(3) Documents which contain the query name string that is not personal name.",
        "After word segmentation, all personal names are labeled by system, when we find one personal name or its substring match the query name string; we will cluster this document according to the name.",
        "If we failure all over the document, it's considered that this document belong to category (3), it will be discarded.",
        "The ambiguous personal name in a document may refer to multiple entities, for example a news about party of namesakes, but this is a very small probability event, so we assume that all mentions in one document refers to the same entity, viz. \"one person one document\".",
        "Although we assume that \"one person one document\", the same personal name may occur more than once.",
        "Some times the word segmentation system will give the same personal name different labels in one document, for example a personal name \"tiRKMi\" may be recognized as \"IItR\" and \"HjtKMI\" in different sentence in one document.",
        "Suppose that P1, P2, ... , Pn are recognized names that match the query name string, T1, T2, .",
        ", Tn are the corresponding occur times.",
        "We use the following method to ensure the final needed personal name:",
        "(1) If Ti > Tj for j = 1, 2, ... , n, Pi is selected as the final needed personal name, else go to step (2).",
        "(2) Define S = { Th T2, ... , T }, E1 = (Tn, T12, T1m}, E2 = S - E1 satisfying Tn = T12 = ...= T1m, E1 e S and Ti > Tj (Ti G E1, Tj G E2).",
        "Fi shows the word before Pi and Bi after Pi.",
        "For each Ti g E1, connect Fi, Ti and Bi into a new string named Ri, we can get R = {R11, R12, R1m} corresponding to E1, the longest common substring of R are considered the final needed personal name.",
        "We define local sentence as sentences which contain the query name string, the features extracted from local sentences named local features.",
        "Otherwise, all sentences except local sentences in a document are named global sentences; the features extracted from global sentences are global features.",
        "The reason to distinguish them is because they have different contribution to similarity computation.",
        "Local features are generally considered more important than global features, therefore a high weight should be given to local features.",
        "Named entities are important information about focused name.",
        "In this paper, NEs include personal names, location names and organization names.",
        "Location name and organization name usually indicate the region and department of focused name, and personal names usually have high co-occurrence rate, for example and are two names of table tennis players, so they always appear in a same news document about table tennis.",
        "The NE features which have been tagged by segmentation system can be extracted from the document directly.",
        "We also consider the features of common nouns.",
        "Semantically independent common nouns such as person's job and person's hobby etc usually include some useful information about the ambiguous object.",
        "We attempt to capture these noun features and use them as elements in feature vector.",
        "Location names in data-line.",
        "The location name in the data-line indicates the place the news had occurred, if two documents have the same dateline location name, and then there is a good chance that these two documents refer the same person.",
        "Appellation of query name.",
        "Appellation usually demonstrate a person's identity, for example, if the appellation of the query name is \"iB#\", it shows that he or she is a journalist.",
        "As location names in data-line, if two query names have the same appellation, the possibility of them refer to the same person increased.",
        "The word segmentation system doesn't clearly marked out appellation but marked as common noun.",
        "In generally, appellations appear neighbor in front of name, so we collect the common nouns neighbor front of query names as their appellations.",
        "So far, we have developed four feature vectors: local NE vector, local common noun vector, global NE vector and global common noun vector.",
        "Given feature vectors, we need to find a way to learn the similarity matrix.",
        "In this paper, we choose the standard TF-IDF method to calculate the similarity matrix.",
        "Location name in dateline and appellation of query name will be used in rule method without similarity calculation.",
        "Given a pair of feature vectors consisting of NEs or common nouns, we need to choose a similarity scheme to calculate the similarity matrix.",
        "The standard TF-IDF method is introduced here, then a little change for Chinese string.",
        "Where dist(w;v) is the Jaro-Winkler distance function (Winkler, 1999), which will be introduced later.",
        "Then the standard TF-IDF SoftTFIDF is computed as: SoftTFIDF (S ,T ) =",
        "Where TFw,S is the frequency of substring w in S, and IDFw is the inverse of the fraction of documents in the corpus that contain w .",
        "Suppose Nt is total number of documents, Nw is total number of documents which contain w .",
        "Then IDFw computed as:",
        "The Jaro-Winkler distance Jw of two given strings s1 and s2 as shown in formula (7), l is the length of common prefix at the start of the string up to a maximum of 4 characters, p is a constant scaling factor for how much the score is adjusted upwards for having common prefixes, the value for p is 0.1.",

        "In order to be consistent with the English strings, a Chinese character is seen as two English characters.",
        "Corresponding to four feature vectors, we can calculate the four similarities: S(gNE), S(gCN), S(lNE), S(lCN).",
        "The similarity between two documents (DS) is computed as:",
        "As time is tight, we just give Ã  a value of 0.8 with out experiment because we consider NEs have stronger instructions.",
        "Clustering is a key work of this task, it is very important to choose a clustering algorithm.",
