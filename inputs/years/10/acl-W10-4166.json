        "Word Sense Induction (WSI) is a particular task of computational linguistics which consists in automatically discovering the correct sense for each instance of a given ambiguous word (Pinto , 2007).",
        "This problem is closely related to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), however, in WSD the aim is to tag each ambiguous word in a text with one of the senses known as prior, whereas in WSI the aim is to induce the different senses of that word.",
        "The object of the sense induction task of CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 was to cluster 5,000 instances of 100 different words into senses or classes.",
        "The task data consisted of the combination of the test and training data (minus the sense tags) from the Chinese lexical sample task.",
        "Each instance is a context of several sentences which contains an occurrence of a given word that serves as the target of sense induction.",
        "The accuracy of the corpus-based algorithms for WSD is usually proportional to the amount of hand-tagged data available, but the construction of that kind of training data is often difficult for real applications.",
        "WSI overcomes this drawback by using clustering algorithms which do not need training data in order to determine the possible sense for a given ambiguous word.",
        "This paper describes an ensemble-based unsupervised system for induction and classification.",
        "Given a set of data to be classified, the system clusters the data by individual clusters, then operates cluster ensemble to ensure the result to be robust and accurate accordingly.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",

        "Sections 3 and 4 present in more detail the implementation of feature set and cluster algorithms used for the task, respectively.",

        "Sense induction is typically treated as an unsupervised clustering problem.",
        "The input to the clustering algorithm are instances of the ambiguous word with their accompanying contexts (represented by co-occurrence vectors) and the output is a grouping of these instances into classes corresponding to the induced senses.",
        "In other words, contexts that are grouped together in the same class represent a specific word sense.",
        "In this task, an instance to be clustered is represented as a bag of tokens or characters that co-occur with the target word.",
        "To exploit the diversity of features, besides the co-occurrence matrix, we invoke the n-gram such as bi-grams that occur in the contexts.",
        "For assigning a weight for each term in each instance, a number of alternatives to tf-idf and entropy have been investigated.",
        "This representation raises one severe problem: the high dimensionality of the feature space and the inherent data sparseness.",
        "Obviously, a single document has a sparse vector over the set of all terms.",
        "The performance of clustering algorithms will decline dramatically due to the problems of high dimensionality and data sparseness.",
        "Therefore it is highly desirable to reduce the feature space dimensionality.",
        "We used two techniques to deal with this problem: feature selection and feature combination.",
        "Feature selection is a process that chooses a subset from the original feature set according to some criterion.",
        "The selected feature retains original physical meaning and provides a better understanding for the data and learning process.",
        "Depending on whether the class label information is required, feature selection can be either unsupervised or supervised.",
        "For WSI should be an unsupervised fashion, the correlation of each feature with the class label is computed by distance, information dependence, or consistency measures.",
        "Feature combination is a process that combines multiple complementary features based on different aspects extracted at the selection step, and forms a new set of features.",
        "The methods mentioned above are not directly targeted to clustering instances; in this paper we introduce three cluster algorithms: (a) EM algorithms (Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997), (b) K-means (MacQueen, 1967), and (c) LAC (Locally Adaptive Clustering) (Domeniconi et al., 2004), and one cluster ensemble method to incorporate three results together to represent the target patterns and conduct sense clustering.",
        "We conduct multiple experiments to assess different methods for feature selection and feature combination on real unsupervised WSI problems, and make analysis through three facets: (a) to what extent feature selection can improve the clustering quality, (b) how much width of the smallest window that contains all the co-occurrence context can be reduced without losing useful information in text clustering, and (c) what index weighting methods should be applied to sense clustering.",
        "Besides the feature exploitation, we studied in more detail the performance of cluster ensemble method."

        "Each training or test instance for WSI task contains up to a few sentences as the surrounding context of the target word w, and the number of the sense of w is provided.",
        "We assume that the surrounding context of a target w is informative to determine the sense of it.",
        "Therefore a stream of induction methods can be designed by exploiting the context features for WSI.",
        "In our experiment, we consider both tokens (after word segmentation) and characters (without word segmentation) in the surrounding context of target word w as discriminative features, and these tokens or characters can be in different sentences from instances of w. Tokens in the list of stop words and tokens with only one character (such as punctuation symbols) are removed from the feature sets.",
        "All remaining terms are gathered to constitute the feature space of w.",
        "Since the long dependency property, the word sense could be relying on the context far away from it.",
        "From this point, it seems that more features will bring more accurate induction, and all linguistic cues should be incorporated into the model.",
        "However, more features are involved, more serious sparseness happens.",
        "Therefore, it is important to find a sound trade-off between the scale and the representativeness of features.",
        "We use the sample data provided by the CIPS-SIGHAN as a development data to find a genetic parameter to confine the context scale.",
        "Let co be the width of the smallest window in an instance d that contains terms near the target word, measured in the number of words in the window.",
        "In cases where the terms in the window do not contain all of the informative terms, we can set co to be some enormous number (co < the length of sentence).",
        "Such proximity-weighted scoring functions are a departure from pure cosine similarity and closer to the \"soft conjunctive\" semantics.",
        "Token or character is the most straightforward basic term to be used to represent an instance.",
        "For WSI, in many cases a term is a meaningful unit with little ambiguity even without considering context.",
        "In this case the bag-of-terms representation is in fact a bag-of-words, therefore N-gram model can be used to exploit such meaningful units.",
        "An n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive characters (or tokens) in an instance.",
        "The advantages of n-grams are: they are language independent, robust against errors in instance, and they capture information about phrases.",
        "We performed experiments to show that for WSI, n-gram features perform significantly better than the flat features.",
        "There exists many approaches to weight features in text computing (Aas and Eikvil, 1999).",
        "A simple approach is TF (term frequency) using the frequency of the word in the document.",
        "The schemes take into account the frequency of the word throughout all documents in the collection.",
        "A well known variant of TF measure is TF-IDF weighting which assigns the weight to word i in document k in proportion to the number of occurrences of the word in the document, and in inverse proportion to the number of documents in the collection for which the word occurs at least once.",
        "Another approach is Entropy weighting, Entropy weighting is based on information theoretic ideas and is the most sophisticated weighting scheme.",
        "It has been proved more effective than word frequency weighting in text representing.",
        "In the entropy weighting scheme, the weight for word in document k is given by a,k.",
        "Re-parameterization is the process of constructing new features as combinations or transformations of the original features.",
        "We investigated Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) method in our research and produce a term-document matrix for each target word.",
        "LSI is based on the assumption that there is some underlying or latent structure in the pattern of word usage across documents, and that statistical techniques can be used to estimate this structure.",
        "However, it is against the primitive goal of the LSI weighting that LSI performs slightly poorer compared with the TF, TF-IDF and entropy.",
        "The most likely reason may is that the feature space we construct is far from high-dimension, while feature the LSI omitted may be of help for specific sense induction.",
        "A simple features election method used here is frequency thresholding.",
        "Instance frequency is the number of instance to be clustered in which a term occurs.",
        "We compute the instance frequency for each unique term in the training corpus and remove from the feature space those terms whose instance frequency was less than some predetermined threshold (in our experiment, the threshold is 5).",
        "The basic assumption is that rare terms are either non-informative for category prediction, or not influential in global performance.",
        "The assumption of instance frequency threshold is more straightforward that of LSI, and in either case, removal of rare terms reduces the dimensionality of the feature space.",
        "Improvement in cluster accuracy is also possible if rare terms happen to be noise terms.",
        "Frequency threshold is the simplest technique for feature space reduction.",
        "It easily scales to sparse data, with a computational complexity approximately linear in the number of training documents.",
        "However, it is usually considered an ad hoc approach to improve efficiency, not a principled criterion for selecting predictive features.",
        "Also, frequency threshold is typically not used for aggressive term removal because of a widely received assumption in information retrieval.",
        "That is, low instance frequency terms are assumed to be relatively informative and therefore should not be removed aggressively.",
        "We will re-examine this assumption with respect to WSI tasks in experiments.",
        "Information gain (IG) is another feature felection can be easily applied to clustering and frequently employed as a term-goodness criterion in the field of machine learning.",
        "It measures the number of bits of information obtained for cluster prediction by knowing the presence or absence of a term in an instance.",
        "Since WSI should be conducted in an unsupervised fashion, that is, the labels are not provided, the IG method can not be directly used for WSI task.",
        "But IG can be used to find which kind of features we consider in Section 3.1 are most informative feature among all the feature set.",
        "We take the training samples as the development data to seek for the cues of most informative feature.",
        "For each unique term we compute the information gain and selecte from the feature space those terms whose information gain is more than some predetermined threshold.",
        "The computation includes the estimation of the conditional probabilities of a cluster given a term and the entropy computations in the definition.",
        "+p(t)I m1 p(Ci | f)log p(c. 17) where t is the token under consideration, Ci is the corresponding cluster.This definition is more general than the one employed in binary classification models.",
        "We use the more general form because WSI task have a feature sparse problem, and we need to measure the goodness",
        "of a feature selection method globally with respect to all clusters on average.",
        "Combining all features selected by different feature set can improve the performance of a WSI system.",
        "In the selection step, we find the feature that best distinguishes the sense classes, and iteratively search additional features which in combination with other chosen features improve word sense class discrimination.",
        "This process stops once the maximal evaluation criterion is achieved.",
        "We are trying to disply an empirical comparison of representative feature combination methods.",
        "We hold that particular cluster support specific datasets; a test with such combination of cluster algorithm and feature set may wrongly show a high accuracy rate unless a variety of clusterers are chosen and many statistically different feature sets are used.",
        "Also, as different feature selection methods have a different bias in selecting features, similar to that of different clusterers, it is not fair to use certain combinations of methods and clusterers, and try to generalize from the results that some feature selection methods are better than others without considering the clusterer.",
        "This problem is challenging because the instances belonging to the same sense class usually have high intraclass variability.",
        "To overcome the problem of variability, one strategy is to design feature combination method which are highly invariant to the variations present within the sense classes.",
        "Invariance is an improvement, but it is clear that none of the feature combination method will have the same discriminative power for all clusterers.",
        "For example, features based on global window might perform well when instances are shot, whereas a feature weighting method for this task should be invariant to the all the WSI corpus.",
        "Therefore it is widely accepted that, instead of using a single feature type for all target words it is better to adaptively combine a set of diverse and complementary features.",
        "In our experiment, we use several combination of features in multiple views, that is, uni-gram/bi-gram, global/window, and tfidf/entropy - in order to discriminate each combination best from all other clusters."

        "As described in Section 5.1, we use two language models (uni-gram and bi-gram), 4 types of the context window (20, 30, 40 and global) and 2 feature weighting methods (tf-idf and entropy), also, 10 combined feature set and 3 cluster algorithm is introduced; in the other word, we have at least 78 result, that is 78 consensus matrix interpreted as \"data\" to be aggregated.",
        "Thus we can evaluate the statistical significance of the difference among any ensemble methods on any cluster result set.",
        "To compare all ensemble methods, we group the result sets (out of 78) into different feature representation scheme.",
        "Significant difference for a given feature representation methods, the ensemble result is observed to check weather cluster ensembles can be more accurate than single feature set and to find out which method appears to be the best choice for the WSI task.",
        "Table 2 shows the ensembles examined in our experiment.",
        "The feature columns correspond to different group of result set, for example, bitfidf indicates bi-gram model and tf-idf feature weighting methods are selected, all the 3 cluster results on win20, win30, win 40 and global feature sets (12 consensus matrix) are aggregated; complex_entro indicates that all the feature representation methods selecting entropy weighting are chosen.",

        "The goal is to automatically induce the senses each word has, and cluster the contexts accordingly.",
        "The evaluation measures provided is F-Score measure.",
        "In order to improve the overall performance, we used two techniques: feature combination and Cluster Ensemble.",
