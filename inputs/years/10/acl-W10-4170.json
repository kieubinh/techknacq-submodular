        "It has been shown that using word senses instead of surface word forms could improve performance on many nature language processing tasks such as information extraction (Joyce and Alan, 1999), information retrieval (Ozlem et al., 1999) and machine translation (David et al., 2005).",
        "Historically, word senses are represented as a fixed-list of definitions coming from a manually complied dictionary.",
        "However, there seem to be some disadvantages associated with such fixed-list of senses paradigm.",
        "Since dictionaries usually contain general definitions and lack explicit semantic, they can't reflect the exact content of the context where the target word appears.",
        "Another disadvantage is that the granularity of sense distinctions is fixed, so it may not be entirely suitable for different applications.",
        "In order to overcome these limitations, some techniques like word sense induction (WSI) have been proposed for discovering words' senses automatically from the unannotated corpus.",
        "The word sense induction algorithms are usually base on the Distributional Hypothesis, proposed by (Zellig, 1954), which showed that words with similar meanings appear in similar contexts (Michael, 2009).",
        "And the hypothesis is also popularized with the phrase \"a word characterized by the company it keeps\" (John, 1957).",
        "This concept shows us a method to automatically discover senses of words by clustering the target words with similar contexts (Lin, 1998).",
        "The word sense induction can be regarded as an unsupervised clustering problem.",
        "First, select some features to be used when comparing similarity between words.",
        "Second, represent disambiguated words as vectors of selected features according to target words' contexts.",
        "Third, cluster the similar words using the vectors.",
        "But compared with European languages such as English, Chinese language has its own characteristics.",
        "For example, Chinese ideographs have senses while the English alphabets don't have.",
        "So the methods which work well in English may not be entirely suitable for Chinese.",
        "This paper proposes a method for Chinese word sense induction, which contains two stage processes: features selecting and context clustering.",
        "Chinese ideographs and Chinese words which have two or more Chinese ideographs are used different strategies when selecting features.",
        "The vectors of target word's instances are put together to constitute a matrix, whose row is instances and column is features.",
        "Reconstruct the matrix through singular value decomposition to get a new vector for each instance.",
        "Then, K-means clustering algorithm is employed to cluster the vectors of disambiguated words' contexts.",
        "Each cluster to which some instances belong to identifies a sense of corresponding target word.",
        "Our system participants in CLP2010 back off task4 - Chinese word sense induction.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "This section will present the strategies of selecting features for disambiguated Chinese words and k-means algorithm for clustering vectors of the contexts.",
        "Features Selection",
        "Since the input instances of target words are unstructured, it's necessary to select features and transform them into structured format to fit the automatic clustering algorithm.",
        "Following the example in (Ted, 2007), words are chosen as features to represent the contexts where target words appear.",
        "A word w in the context of the target word can be represented as a vector whose ith component is the average of the calculated conditional probabilities of w and Wj.",
        "The target words are usually removed from the corpus in the task of English word sense induction.",
        "But Chinese language is very different from European languages such as English.",
        "Chinese ideographs usually have meanings of their own while English alphabets don't have.",
        "In Chinese word senses induction tasks, the target word may be a Chinese word which could have one or more Chinese ideographs or a Chinese ideograph.",
        "And the meaning of Chinese ideographs is determined by the Chinese word where it appears.",
        "The following example shows us this case.",
        "In this example, the target word is Chinese ideograph displayed in italic in the contexts.",
        "In the first context, its meaning is paddy which is determined by the Chinese word \"ff # \", and similarly in the second context its meaning is valley determined by \"lll^r\".",
        "Since the meaning of the Chinese ideograph is determined by the word where it appears, it may not be appropriate to remove it from the contexts simply while the others of the word are left.",
        "Different strategies are employed to remove target words.",
        "If the target word contains two or more Chinese ideographs, it will be removed from the context.",
        "Otherwise it will be kept.",
        "To solve the problem of data sparseness, we extracted extra 100 instances for each target word from Sogou Data and also used the thesauruses (TongYiCi CiLin of HIT) to reduce the dimensionality of the word space (feature space).",
        "Two filtering heuristics are applied when selecting features.",
        "The first one is the minimum frequency p1 of words, and the second one is the maximum frequency p2 of words.",
        "Each selected word (feature) should be assigned a weight, which indicates the relative frequency of two co-occurring words.",
        "Using conditional probabilities for weighting for object/verb and subject/verb pairs is better than point-wise mutual information (Philipp et al., 2005).",
        "So we used conditional probabilities for weighting words pairs.",
        "Let nurriy denote the number of the instances where the word i and word j co-occur , and numi denote the number of the instances in which the word i appears.",
        "Then the jth component of the vector of the word i can be calculated using the following equation.",
        "The contexts of each target word are represented as the centroid of the vectors of the words occurring in the target contexts.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of context vector, where the Chinese word co-occurs with Chinese words \"7jC Clustering Algorithm",
        "K-means algorithm is applied to cluster the vectors of the target word.",
        "It assigns each element to one of K clusters according to which centroid the element is close to by the similarity function.",
        "The cosine function is used to measure the similarity between two vectors V and W:",
        "where n is the number of features in each vector.",
        "Before clustering the vectors of instances, we put together the vectors of instances in the corpus and obtain a co-occurrence matrix of instances and words.",
        "Singular value decomposition is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting multidimensional space and finds the major axes of variation in the word space (Golub and Van Loan, 1989).",
        "After the reduction, the similarity between two instances can be measured using the cosine function mentioned as above between the corresponding vectors.",
        "The clustering algorithm stops when the centroid of each cluster does not change or the iteration of the algorithm exceed a user-defined threshold p3.",
        "And the number of the clusters is determined by the corpus where the target word appears.",
        "Each cluster to which some instances belong represents one senses of the target word represented by the vector.",
        "We also employed a graph-based clustering algorithm Chinese Whispers (CW) (Chris, 2006) to deal with the task of Chinese WSI.",
        "CW does not require any input parameters and has a good performance in WSI (Chris, 2006).",
        "For more details about CW algorithm please refer to (Chris, 2006).",
        "We first constructed a graph, whose vertexes were instances of target word and edges' weight was the similarity of the corresponding two vertexes.",
        "Then we removed the edges with minimum weight until the percentage of the kept edges' sum respect the total was below a threshold p4.",
        "CW algorithm was employed to cluster the graph and each clusters represented a sense of target word."
