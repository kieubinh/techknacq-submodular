        "Rating-scale evaluations, where human evaluators assess system outputs by selecting a score on a discrete scale, are the most common form of humanassessed evaluation in nlp.",
        "Results are typically presented in rank tables of means for each system accompanied by means-based measures ofstatisti-cal significance of the differences between system scores.",
        "nlp system evaluation tends to involve sets of systems, rather than single ones (evaluations tend to at least incorporate a baseline or, more rarely, a topline system).",
        "The aim of system evaluation is to gain some insight into which systems are better than which others, in other words, the aim is inherently relative.",
        "Yet nlp system evaluation experiments have generally preferred rating scale experiments where evaluators assess each system's quality in isolation, in absolute terms.",
        "Such rating scales are not very intuitive to use; deciding whether a text deserves a 5, a 4 or a 3 etc.",
        "can be difficult.",
        "Furthermore, evaluators may ascribe different meanings to scores and the distances between them.",
        "Individual evaluators have different tendencies in using rating scales, e.g. what is known as 'end-aversion' tendency where certain individuals tend to stay away from the extreme ends of scales; other examples are positive skew and acquiescence bias, where individuals make disproportionately many positive or agreeing judgements; see e.g. Choi and Pak, (2005).",
        "It is not surprising then that stable averages of quality judgements, let alone high levels of agreement, are hard to achieve, as has been observed for mt (Turian et al., 2003; Lin and Och, 2004), text summarisation (Trang Dang, 2006), and language generation (Belz and Reiter, 2006).",
        "It has even been demonstrated that increasing the number of evaluators and/or data can have no stabilising effect at all on means (duc literature).",
        "The result of a rating scale experiment is ordinal data (sets of scores selected from the discrete rating scale).",
        "The means-based ranks and statistical significance tests that are commonly presented with the results of rses are not generally considered appropriate for ordinal data in the statistics literature (Siegel, 1957).",
        "At the least, \"a test on the means imposes the requirement that the measures must be additive, i.e. numerical\" (Siegel, 1957, p. 14).",
        "Parametric statistics are more powerful than non-parametric alternatives, because they make a number of strong assumptions (including that the data is numerical).",
        "If the assumptions are violated then the risks is that the significance of results is overestimated.",
        "In this paper we explore an alternative evaluation paradigm, Preference-strength Judgement Experiments (pjes).",
        "Binary preference judgements have been used in nlp system evaluation (Reiter et al., 2005), but to our knowledge this is the first systematic investigation ofpreference-strength judgements where evaluators express, in addition to their preference (which system do you prefer?",
        "), also the strength of their preference (how strongly do you prefer the system you prefer?).",
        "It seems intuitively convincing that it should be easier to decide which of two texts is clearer than to decide whether a text's clarity deserves a 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.",
        "However, it is less clear whether evaluators are also able to express the strength of their preference in a consistent fashion, resulting not only in good self-consistency, but also in good agreement with other evaluators.",
        "We present three pairs of directly comparable rse and pje evaluations, and investigate how they compare in terms of (i) the amount of variation accounted for by differences between systems (the more the better), relative to the amount of variation accounted for by other factors such as evaluator and arbitrary text properties (the less the better); (ii) inter-evaluator agreement, (iii) evaluator self-consistency, (iv) the number of significant differences identified, and (v) experimental cost."

        "In fact, in the case of Adequacy, even Text2 causes more variation than System.",

        "The results are unambiguous as far as the Clarity criterion (called Adequacy in tuna) is concerned: in all three experiment pairs, the preference-strength judgement (pse) version had a greater effect of System, a smaller effect of Text and Evaluator, more significant pairwise differences, better inter-evaluator agreement, and (where we were able to measure it) better self-consistency.",
        "The same is true for Readability in meteo and Fluency in tuna, in the latter case except for W which is slightly lower in tuna-pje than tuna-rse.",
        "However, Readability in grec-neg bucks the trend: here, all measures are worse in the pje version than in the rse version (although for the W measures, the differences are small).",
        "Part of the reason for this may be that in grec-neg pje each system was only compared to one single other 'system', the (human-authored) original Wikipedia texts.",
        "If we see less effect of Clarity than of Fluency in an experiment (as in grec-neg rse and tuna rse), then we might want to conclude that systems differed less in terms of Clarity than in terms of Fluency.",
        "However, the real explanation may be that evaluators simply found it harder to apply the Clarity criterion than the Fluency criterion in a given evaluation set-up.",
        "The fact that the difference in effect between Fluency and Clarity virtually disappears in grec-neg pje makes this the more likely explanation at least for the grec-neg evaluations.",
        "Parametric statistics are more powerful than non-parametric ones because of the strong assumptions they make about the nature of the data.",
        "Roughly speaking, they are more likely to uncover significant differences.",
        "Where the assumptions are violated, the risk is that significance is overestimated (the likelihood that null hypotheses are incorrectly rejected increases).",
        "One might consider using a slider mapping to a continuous scale instead of a multiple-choice rating form in order to overcome this problem, but the evidence from the tuna rse evaluation appears to be that this can result in unacceptably large variation in how individual evaluators apply the scale to assign absolute scores.",
        "What seems to make the difference in terms of ease of application of evaluation criteria and reduction of undesirable effects is not the use of continuous scales (as e.g. implemented in slider bars), but the comparative element, where pairs of systems are compared and one is selected as better in terms of a given criterion than the other.",
        "It makes sense intuitively that deciding which of two texts is clearer should be an easier task than deciding whether a system is a 5, 4, 3 or 1 in terms of its clarity.",
        "pjes enabled evaluators to apply the Clarity criterion to determine ranks more consistently in all three experiment pairs.",
        "However, it was an open question whether evaluators would also be able to express the strength of their preference consistently.",
        "From the results we report here it seems clear that this is indeed the case: the System F ratios which look at absolute scores (in the pjes quantifying the strength of a preference) are higher, and the Evaluator F ratios lower, in all but one of the experiments.",
        "While there were the same number of trials in the two grec-neg evaluations, there were 2.5 times as many trials in meteo-pje than in meteo-rse, and 3.5 times as many trials in tuna-pje than in tuna-rse.",
        "The increase in trials is counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that evaluators tend to give relative judgements far more quickly than absolute judgements, but clearly there is an increase in cost associated with including all system pairings in a pje.",
        "If this cost grows unacceptably large, a subset of systems has to be selected as reference systems."
