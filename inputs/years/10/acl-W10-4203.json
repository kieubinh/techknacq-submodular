        "Reference is a process in which participants interpret and produce their referring expressions according to the previous context.",
        "But as Stalnaker puts it: the discourse context \"is both the object on which speech acts act and the source of the information relative to which speech acts are interpreted\" (Stalnaker, 1998).",
        "To put it briefly, referring acts not only rely on the context to produce a reference but also modify it.",
        "This aspect is not taken into account in the classical generation algorithm by (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "Each referent is generated by discriminating it inside a context.",
        "However, the construction and update of this context is not adressed.",
        "Further literature on reference generation partially gives an account for the dynamic nature of the referring process.",
        "For example in (Krahmer and The-une, 2002), each referring act increases the salience of the referent such that further references can be made according to a smaller context, namely the set of objects whose salience is greater than the referent's salience.",
        "Reference Domain Theory (RDT) (Reboul, 1998; Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001) goes a step further by assuming that referring acts make salient the context sets themselves.",
        "This theory addresses the construction and update of the context sets, called in this theory reference domains.",
        "The goal of a referring act is then to discriminate a referent inside a reference domain but also a reference domain in a set of reference domains that we call here referential space.",
        "Moreover each referring act presupposes a given state of the referential space, and the explicit representation of these presuppositions as constraints on the suitable domain for interpretation or generation allows the implementation of a reversible reference module.",
        "We will focus here on generation.",
        "Details about the interpretation side of RDT can be found in (Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001; Denis et al., 2006).",
        "However most of the previous work on RDT does not address computational details.",
        "Although (Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2000) provides a generation algorithm, the formal definition of a reference domain and the explicit representation of the constraints are not provided.",
        "In this paper we show how RDT can be used to generate referring expressions.",
        "The context of our work is the GIVE challenge (Byron et al., 2007; Byron et al., 2009).",
        "This challenge aims to evaluate instruction generation systems in a situated setting.",
        "The goal is to provide instructions to a player in a 3D maze in order to guide him to find a hidden trophy.",
        "We are here interested with the referring aspect involved in GIVE: the player has to push buttons to open doors or disable alarms, thus the system has to generate referring expressions to these buttons.",
        "We first present in section 2 some definitions, then in section 3 we detail a generic generation algorithm.",
        "Section 4 shows a use case of RDT in the context of the GIVE challenge and provides a detailed example of the reference process.",
        "The presented model is generic, but all the examples given throughout the paper refer to the GIVE setting.",
        "Eventually, in section 6 we conclude the paper by demonstrating the success of RDT in an evaluation based on the GIVE setting."

        "The referring process is a discrimination process whose goal is to discriminate one or more individuals in a context set.",
        "The discrimination can make use of different sources of information.",
        "It can be a semantic discrimination, for instance by uttering semantic properties possessed by the referent to rule out distractors, e.g. \"the blue button\".",
        "It can be a discrimination of the focus, that is to make use of the current center of attention, e.g. \"this button\" or \"the other button\".",
        "The discrimination can also rely on the previous referring acts, for instance when uttering \"Push a blue button.",
        "Yes this one\", where \"this one\" would be unambiguously uttered in a context of a red and a blue button thanks to the mention of \"a blue button\".",
        "A reference model has to take into account these different ways to discriminate.",
        "On the other hand, a reference model has also to consider how objects are grouped together to form the context sets.",
        "They can be constructed thanks to similarity or proximity of objects (Thorisson, 1994), by the gestures that are made (Landragin, 2006) or by the discourse itself (Denis et al., 2006).",
        "We will be limited to the dimension of semantic similarity in this paper.",
        "RDT claims that the context sets (reference domains or RD) are structures that both gather individuals and discriminate them.",
        "A reference domain is basically a set of objects that share some semantic description N. A partition that discriminates the elements is also attached to the domain.",
        "The partition is based on a differentiation criterion such that two elements being discriminated with this criterion are put in two different equivalency classes.",
        "For instance, in a domain of two buttons, one blue and one red, the two individuals share the same type and are differentiated with the color.",
        "While each one is \"a button\", they can unambiguously be referred to with \"the blue button\" and \"the red button\" (or even shorter \"blue\", \"red\").",
        "Different elements of a domain may be more or less focused/salient depending on the visual scene, or on the previous discriminations.",
        "We are assuming that the focus is defined as the most salient parts of the partition of a domain and can thus be represented as a subset of the partition.",
        "This is a binary state, that is, a part is focused or not.",
        "While it removes the possibility to have different degrees of focus inside a domain, it would help modeling a preference to focus similar objects together.",
        "We did not explore though the empirical relevance of this hypothesis.",
        "We assume that each domain could be said more or less salient in a set of reference domains, called a referential space or RS.",
        "The referential space is a storage for the domains that have been created so far.",
        "We consider here it is unique and shared.",
        "In the GIVE setting, the RS is actually not shared because the player does not know the maze a priori while the system knows it completely.",
        "But we assume that the RS is limited to the current room where the player is standing.",
        "Each time the player enters a new room, the RS is refreshed and a new one is built.",
        "We then suppose that the player is able to access the objects by walking around, and hence that the RS is shared, removing problems related to asymmetry.",
        "The referential space provides a traversal order for the reference domains it contains.",
        "The most salient RD are tested first.",
        "While it would be interesting to model visual salience in the GIVE setting (Lan-dragin, 2006), we are limited to equate salience and recency.",
        "Thus, each domain will be associated to a number indicating how recently it has been selected.",
        "The way the salience or the whole RS is affected by the discrimination process is described in section 3.2.",
        "We now provide a formal definition of a reference domain and a referential space building algorithm.",
        "We assume that (E, V) is an environment composed of E, the universe of all objects and V, the set of ground predicates that hold in the environment.",
        "Props is a set of unary predicates names such as blue, red, left, or right.",
        "Types is a set of types of unary predicates such as color, or position.",
        "We distinguish two disjoint subsets of Types, Typespers the persistent types, that are all the properties that describe permanently the objects, and Typestrans the transient types, that are all the properties that change across time.",

        "In the GIVE context, we assumed that it is both shared and refreshed each time the player enters a room.",
        "The initial construction of the RS consists in grouping all the objects of the room that are similar inside new reference domains.",
        "The RS can be viewed as a treelike structure whose nodes are RD.",
        "The root node is a RD whose ground is all objects of the room.",
        "For a node domain D, and for each part of its partition which is not a singleton, there exists a child domain which discriminates the elements of the part.",
        "In other words, if a domain does not discriminate some individuals of its ground there exists another domain which does.",

        "VD G RS, VP G Pd ,",
        "In order to make sure that all the individuals could be discriminated, and thus focused, we introduce the default partition structure of a set X, which is a partition structure where the criterion is the identifier of objects and that contains then only singletons, we note def( X) the default partition of a set X, that is def(X) = (id,X/Rid, 0).",
        "To build initially the RS, the grouping algorithm (figure 1) is the following: it takes a list of types T (To means the head, and T1..„ the tail) which corresponds to different properties to group the objects.",
        "We are here only using the permanent properties of objects, that is in GIVE their type and their color, ordered arbitrarly.",
        "It takes also an input domain which has a default partition.",
        "It then tries to partition the ground of this domain with the first property.",
        "If this property does not partition the ground, the next property is tested.",
        "If this property partitions the ground, a new domain is created for each non-singleton part of the partition, and the algorithm tries to partition it with the next property, so on recursively.",
        "We note sh( X, c) the set of properties of the type c that are shared by all elements of X: sh(X, c) = {p|p G val(c), Vx G X;p(x) G V}.",
        "This partitioning algorithm is slightly different from the partitioning algorithm called IApart found in (Gatt and van Deemter, 2007).",
        "First, it only partitions a set of objects using one unique property, whereas in IApart the same set of objects can be partitioned several times.",
        "And second, while IApart\"destroys\" the ground that is partitioned, our partitioning algorithm maintains both the ground and the partition attached to the domain.",

        "In this section we detail the generation algorithm in RDT.",
        "It implements a dynamic view of referring whereby each referring act updates the current referential space.",
        "This incremental update of the referential space proceeds in three steps.",
        "First, a domain containing the referent is found.",
        "Then this domain is used to match a so called underspecified domain (Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001).",
        "Third, the input RS is restructured relative to the selected reference domain.",
        "The approach enables the implementation of a type B reversible reference module (Klarner, 2005), that is a module in which both directions share the same resources, namely a set of underspecified domains.",
        "In interpretation, the goal is to check for each existing domain if it matches the underspecified domain obtained from the referring expression.",
        "In generation, the idea is the opposite, that is, to check from an existing domain and a referent, which underspecified domain matches them.",
        "We first introduce the different types of underspecified domains.",
        "We then present the overall referring algorithm and the process steering the continuous update of the referential space.",
        "An underspecified domain (UD) represents a partially specified reference domain corresponding to the constraints carried by a referring act.",
        "We will say that an underspecified domain matches a reference domain if all the constraints of the UD are satisfied for the reference domain.",
        "There may be constraints on the ground of the domain, its salience or the existence of a particular partition structure.",
        "Table 1 summarizes most of the types of underspecified domains described in (Salmon-Alt and Ro-mary, 2000; Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001).",
        "Each underspecified domain is noted U(N,t), where t is the intended referent and N Ç Props is a semantic description.",
        "We will note N the set of objects that have the semantic description N that is N = {x|x G E, Vp G N,p(x) G V}.",
        "We assume there is for each description N a given wording, and we will write for instance \"the N\" to denote a definite RE where N has to be replaced by the wording of N. The notation msd(D) stands for most salient description, that is, there is no more salient domain than D with a different description.",
        "This is equivalent to $D' G RS; aD> > aD A SD = SD.",
        "The indefinite \"a N\" can always be generated but may be ambiguous.",
        "The only constraint placed on a domain by the corresponding UD is that it contains an element of type N. For example, the domain D1 = ({b1, b2, bs}, {button}, 0, (color, {{bb b2}, {bs}}, 0)) does not differentiate b1 from b2, the only way we could access to b1 would be by uttering \"a blue button\".",
        "The definite expression \"the N\" requires that the target forms a semantically disjoint part in the reference domain partition.",
        "For example, in the above domain D1 , \"the red button\" can be used to refer to bs.",
        "Like the definite and indefinite, the demonstrative \"this N\" requires that the referent is of type N (belongs to N ), but also requires the existence of a focused partition containing exactly the referent.",
        "For example, if a domain of blue buttons contains a partition structure such that P = {{b1}, {b2}}, it is possible to refer to b1 given that F = {{b1}} by uttering \"this blue button\", but it would not be the case if F = {{b1}, {b2}}.",
        "Alternative phrases such as \"another/the other N\" both require that there is already something in focus which is not the referent.",
        "Definite alternative phrases require that the unfocused part of the partition contains exactly the target referent while indefinites only require that the unfocused part contains the referent.",
        "For example, if there is a domain of three blue buttons b1 , b2 , bs with a partition structure such that F = {{b2}}, it is possible to use the indefinite \"another blue button\" to refer to b1 while it would not be possible to use the definite \"the other blue button\".",
        "One-anaphora of the form \"this/another/the other one\" can be generated only if the description of the domain in which the referent has to be discriminated is already salient, in other words that msd(D) is true.",
        "For example, if the most salient domain in RS is a domain of blue buttons, it would not be possible to utter \"this one\" to refer to a red button inside a less salient domain.",
        "The referring algorithm (figure 2) proceeds in three steps as follows.",
        "The first step (line 1-2) determines in which reference domain, referring will be processed and thereby, which description will be used for instantiating the underspecified domains.",
        "The selected RD is the most salient RD with the smallest ground containing the target referent.",
        "If there are several such RD, an arbitrary one is picked.",
        "If the selected domain is D = (Gd,Sd,aD, (c,P,F)), then the description S used to instantiate the underspecified domain is the conjunction of the properties in the description SDwith the value of the differentiation criterion used to create the partition namely, properties of val(c) true of the referent (line 2).",
        "If the criterion is the identifier, it is ignored in S. For instance, if there is a domain of buttons with a partition on color, the description might be {button, blue}.",

        "U(N, t) matches D iff 3(c, P, F) 6 D;",

        "In the second step, the algorithm iterates through the underspecified domains instantiated with S and selects the first that matches.",
        "The order in which underspecified domains are tested is particularly important.",
        "We use (Gundel et al., 1993) Givenness hierarchy and ordered the UDs based on the cognitive status of the corresponding referent.",
        "We extended the hierarchy to include alternative NPs: \"this one\" > \"this N\" > \"the N\" > \"the other one\" > \"the other N\" > \"another one\" > \"another N\" > \"a N\".",
        "In the third step, the referential space is restructured by either creating a new domain or increasing the salience of an existing domain (Figure 3).",
        "The goal of this restructuring step is to be able to restrict the further focus to a smaller domain.",
        "For instance, when dealing with red buttons we want to avoid focusing the blue buttons.",
        "The function first gathers all objects of D that have the persistent part of description S (Gp and Sp), and if there is already a domain composed by these objects, its salience is increased such that it is the most salient (line 4).",
        "If there is no such domain, a new most salient domain is created with these objects and a default partition.",
        "Transient properties are not taken into account to regroup the objects because it would restrict too much further focus.",
        "For instance, limiting the restructuring to persistent properties avoids sequences like \"Push the button on the right.",
        "Yeah this one\".",
        "For example in a domain D containing a button b1 and a chair c1 ,",
        "a reference to b1 could lead to the generation of the expression \"the button\", the restructuring makes sure to create a new domain whose ground is only {b1}.",
        "Therefore, we avoid producing unecessary reference to the chair such as \"Not this chair!",
        "Look for the button\" (see section 4).",
        "The plurals treatment is quite similar to the singular cases, but we need to do two modifications to be able to generate plurals.",
        "The first modification is about the underspecified domains.",
        "Whereas we had individuals, here we want to generate an RE to a set of targets T = {t1..tn}.",
        "The UDs can easily be modified by just replacing every occurrence of {t} by T (and t G N by T Ç N ).",
        "With this modification, we can only generate plurals for sets of 1: D – most salient/specific domain containing t 3: for all U(S, t) sorted by Givenness do 4: if U(S, t) matches D then 9: return failure objects that are parts of an existing partition.",
        "Imagine we have Gd = {b1,b2,bs,b4}, and a partition P = {{b1, b2}, {bs, b4}} then it is not possible to refer to {b2, bs} using a demonstrative because they cannot be focused together.",
        "It may be possible to adapt the UD to consider F instead of F, that is for instance instead of F = {T} we would require that [J F = T. But this possibility and its side-effects have not been yet explored.",
        "The second modification is related to the generation algorithm and the description used to build the underspecified domains.",
        "Instead of retrieving the properties of the differentiation criterion for a single target we need to make sure that the properties are true for all the targets, that is (line 2), we need to have S – SD U {p\\p G val(c), Vt G T,p(t) G V}."

        "The description used to refer to b1 is the description of the domain SDl = {button, blue} and the value for the criterion which is the identifier and is then ignored.",
        "Inside D1 it then tries to refer to b1 by iterating through the underspecified domains to find the first one that matches D1.",
        "Because there is no focus at this moment, the first found UD that matches is \"a N\".",
        "It then performs restructuration of the RS, by trying to build a new subdomain of D1.",

        "Eventually, the expression is verbalized and \"Push a blue button\" is uttered.",

        "According to the algorithm in figure 4, a reference to b2 has to be made first \"Not b2!\".",
        "Underspecified domains are iterated and the first that matches is \"this one\" considering that {blue, button} is the most salient description and b2 is in focus.",
        "No subdomain is created when restructuring the RS, only the salience of D1 is increased.",
        "The uttered expression is then \"Not this one!\".",
        "As for the reference to b1, the reference is still made in D1 and the first UD that matches is \"the other one\".",
        "No restructuring apart from increasing salience is performed and the returned expression is eventually \"Look for the other one!\".",
        "So, after referring to b2 and b1, the RS is {{D1}3, {Do}o}.",

        "We assume that b1 is on the right while b2 is on the left.",
        "Positions are computed and new ground predicates are added to V: {right(b1), left(b2)}.",
        "A new domain D2 with a ground equal to the focus of D1 , that is {b1, b2}, is built and used as input for the partition algorithm.",

        "Before the reference to b1 , the RS is then {{D2}4, {D1}3, {D0}0}.",
        "A new reference to b1 is then made, but as D2 is more salient than D1 it is preferred for the reference.",
        "The first UD that matches is the definite \"the N\" built with the description {button, blue, right}, and \"the blue button on the right\" is uttered.",
        "However, because D2 was built with transient properties, it is erased from the RS and is recreated before each reference unless the player changes its visual focus.",
        "Now we assume that the player turned around again and only sees now b1.",
        "The most salient/specific domain containing b1 is D1 and its focus is updated:",

        "We assume that given all these referring expressions, the player is at last able to push b1 .",
        "A new reference has to be made, this time to b3, the red button.",
        "The most salient/specific domain containing b3 is actually D0.",
        "In D0, the first matching underspecified domain is the definite \"the N\".",
        "The restructuring leads this time to create a new most salient domain D3 composed only of b3 (because it is the only red button):",
        "The further reference to objects will thus avoid referring to something else than red buttons (see section 3.2).",
        "The RS is then {{D3}5, {D1}4, {D0}0}.",
        "Provided that D3 is now the most salient/specific container of b3, b3 can be focalized in the default partition of D3, resulting in:",
        "The first matching UD is then \"this one\", the restructuring just increases the salience of D3 and the system utters eventually \"Yeah!",
        "This one!\".",
        "The RS is then {{D3}6, {D1}4, {D0}0}.",
        "Note that, even if the player would turn around and see b1 or b2 in the same time than b3, D3 being the current most salient/specific domain, b1 or b2 would not be focused.",
        "We now have to refer to the last button b2.",
        "The most salient/specific domain containing b2 is D1, however D1 contains already a focus to b1 .",
        "Thus, the first matching UD is \"the other N\".",
        "Note that we only considered visual focus, therefore the alternative anaphora \"the other\" does not refer to b2 because we already mentioned b1 but only because it is the last object the player saw in D1 .",
        "By chance, in the GIVE setting, the visual focus corresponds to the linguistic focus and thus uttering \"Push the other blue button\" sounds natural.",
        "It would be more complex to handle a setting with both the linguistic and the visual focus, but we think that the RDT is well-equipped to resolve this issue."
