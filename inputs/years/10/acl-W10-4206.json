        "Evaluation methodology in nlg has generated a lot of interest.",
        "Some recent work suggested that the relationship between various intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods (Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996) is not straightforward (Reiter and Belz, 2009; Gatt and Belz, to appear), leading to some arguments for more domain-specific intrinsic metrics (Foster, 2008).",
        "One reason why these issues are important is that reliable intrinsic evaluation metrics that correlate with performance in an extrinsic, task-based setting can inform system development.",
        "Indeed, this is often the stated purpose of evaluation metrics such as bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) and rouge (Lin and Hovy, 2003), which were originally characterised as evaluation 'understudies'.",
        "In this paper we take up these questions in the context of a knowledge-based nlg system, bt-45 (Portet et al., 2009), which summarises medical data for decision support purposes in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (nicu).",
        "Our extrinsic data comes from an experiment involving complex medical decision making based on automatically generated and human-authored texts (van der",
        "Meulen et al., 2009).",
        "This gives us the opportunity to directly compare the textual characteristics of generated and human-written summaries and their relationship to decision-making performance.",
        "The present work uses data from an earlier study (Gatt and Portet, 2009), which presented some preliminary results along these lines for the system in question.",
        "We extend this work in a number of ways.",
        "Our principal aim is to test the validity not only of general-purpose metrics which measure surface properties of text, but also of metrics which make use of domain knowledge, in the sense that they attempt to relate the 'deep semantics' of the texts to extrinsic factors, based on an ontology for the bt-45 domain.",
        "After an overview of related work in section 2, the b t-45 system, its domain ontology and the extrinsic evaluation are described in section 3.",
        "The ontology plays an important role in the evaluation metrics presented in Section 5.",
        "Finally, the evaluation of the methods is presented in Section 6, before discussing and concluding in Section 7."

        "In nlg evaluation, extrinsic, task-based methods play a significant role (Reiter et al., 2003; Karasi-mos and Isard, 2004; Stock et al., 2007).",
        "Depending on the study design, these studies often leave open the question of precisely which aspects of a system (and of the text it generates) contribute to success or failure.",
        "Intrinsic nlg evaluations often involve ratings of text quality or responses to questionnaires (Lester and Porter, with some studies using post-editing by human experts (Reiter et al., 2005).",
        "Automatically computed metrics exploiting corpora, such as bleu, nist and rouge, have mainly been used in evaluations of the coverage and quality of morphosyn-tactic realisers (Langkilde-Geary, 2002; Callaway, 2003), though they have recently also been used for subtasks such as Referring Expression Generation (Gatt and Belz, to appear) as well as end-to-end weather forecasting systems (Reiter and Belz, 2009).",
        "The widespread use of these metrics in nlp partly rests on the fact that they are quick and cheap, but there is controversy about their reliability both in mt (Calliston-Burch et al., 2006) and summarisation (Dorr et al., 2005; Liu and Liu, 2008).",
        "As noted in Section 1, similar questions have been raised in nlg.",
        "One of the problems associated with these metrics is that they rely on the notion of a 'gold standard', which is not always precisely definable given multiple solutions to the same generation, summarisation or translation task.",
        "These observations underlie recent developments in Summarisation evaluation such as the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), which in addition also emphasises content overlap with a set of reference summaries, rather than n-gram matches.",
        "It is interesting to note that, with some exceptions (Foster, 2008), most of the methodological studies on intrinsic evaluation cited here have focused on 'generic' metrics (corpus-based automatic measures being foremost among them), none of which use domain knowledge to quantify those aspects of a text related to its content.",
        "There is some work in Summarisation that suggests that incorporating more knowledge improves results.",
        "For example, Yoo and Song (Yoo et al., 2007) used the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to construct graphs representing the high-level content of documents, which are then used to cluster documents by topic, each cluster being used to produce a summary.",
        "In (Plaza et al., 2009), the authors have proposed a summarisation method based on WordNet concepts and showed that this higher level representation improves the summarisation task.",
        "The principal aim of this paper is to develop metrics with which to compare texts using domain knowledge - in the form of the ontology used in the bt-45 system - and to correlate results to human decision-making performance.",
        "The resulting metrics focus on aspects of content, structure and relevance that are shown to correlate meaningfully with task performance, in contrast to other, more surface-oriented ones (such as rouge)."

        "The ontology classified objects of type event and entity into several subtypes; for example, a drug administration is an intervention, which means it involves an agent and a patient.",
        "The ontology functioned as a repository of declarative knowledge, on the basis of which production rules were defined to support reasoning in order to make abstractions and to identify relations (such as causality) between events detected in the data based on their ontological class and their specific properties.",
        "In addition to the standard is-a links, the ontology contains functional relationships which connect events to concepts representing physiological systems (such as the respiratory or cardiovascular systems); these are referred to as functional concepts.",

        "The HR increases",
        "SeeE c, where E is the set of events mentioned, and c is the value of the cardinality attribute of an event e e E. Similarly, we computed the number of temporal (TREL) and discourse (DREL) relations mentioned in a text.",
        "We also used the Tree Edit Distance metric to compute the distance between the tree representations of the H and C texts (see Figure 2(b)).",
        "This measure computes the minimum number of node insertions, deletions and substitutions required to transform one tree into another and therefore takes into account not only the content (events and relations) but also its structural arrangement in the text.",
        "The edit distance between two trees is computed using the standard Levenshtein edit distance algorithm, computed over a string that represents the preorder traversal of the two trees, using a cost of 1 for insertions and deletions, and 2 for substitutions.",
        "N-gram overlap As a measure of n-gram overlap, we use ROUGE-n, which measures simple n – gram overlap (in the present paper we use n = 4).",
        "We also use rouge-su, in which overlap is computed using skip-bigrams while also accounting for unigrams that a text has in common with its reference (in order to avoid bias against texts which share several unigrams but few skip bigrams).",
        "Domain-dependent relevance metrics The metrics described so far make use of domain knowledge only to the extent that this is reflected in the textual markup.",
        "We now consider a family of metrics which are much more heavily reliant on domain-specific knowledge structures and reasoning.",
        "In our domain, the relevance of a text in a given experimental scenario s can be defined in terms of whether the events it mentions have some relationship to the appropriate clinical actions (APs).",
        "We attempt to model some aspects of this using a weighting strategy and reasoning rules.",
        "Recall from Section 3 that fc's represent the various physiological systems to which an event or action can be related.",
        "Therefore, each event e mentioned in a text can be related to a set of possible actions using the functional concepts fc(e) to which that event is linked in the ontology.",
        "Let ES;t be the set of events mentioned in text t for scenario s. An event e e Es t references an action a iff FC(e) n FC (a) = 0.",
        "Our hypothesis is that an appropriate action is more likely to be taken if there are events which reference it in the text - that is, if the text mentions things which are directly or indirectly relevant to the action.",
        "For instance, if a text mentions events related to the respiration fc, a clinician might be more likely to make a decision to manage a patient s ventilation support.",
        "It is worth emphasising that, since both the BT-45 and human-authored texts were descriptive and were not written or generated with the appropriate actions in mind, the hypothesis that the relevance of the content to the appropriate actions might increase the likelihood of these actions being chosen is far from a foregone conclusion.",
        "Part of the novelty in this way of quantifying relevance lies in its use of the knowledge (i.e. the ontology) that is already available to the system, rather than asking human experts to rate the relevance of a text, a time-consuming process which could be subject to experts personal biases.",
        "However, this way of conceptualising relevance generates links to too many actions for one event.",
        "It is often the case that an event, through its association with a functional concept, references more than one action, but not all of these are appropriate.",
        "For example, a change in oxygen saturation can be related to respiration, which itself is related to several respiration-related actions in a scenario, only some of which are appropriate.",
        "Clearly, relevance depends not only on a physiological connection between an event and a phsiological system (functional concept), but also on the context, that is, the other events and their relative importance in a given scenario.",
        "Another factor that needs to be taken into account is the overall probability of an action.",
        "Some actions are performed routinely, while others tend to be associated with emergencies (e.g. a nappy change is much more frequent over all than resuscitating a patient).",
        "This means that some actions - even appropriate ones - may have been less likely to be selected even though they were referenced by the text and were appropriate.",
        "We prune unwarranted connections between events and actions by taking into account (a) a patient s current status (described in the text and in the background information given to experimental participants); (b) the fact that some actions have much higher prior probabilities than others because they are performed more routinely; (c) the fact that some events may be more important than others (e.g. resuscitation is much more important than a nappy change).",
        "Based on this, we define the weight of an action a as follows:",
        "2^ E e.importance",
        "Where e is the set of events in the text, Ae the set of actions related to event e, e.importance G N+ the importance of the event e and Pr(a) the prior probability of action a.",

        "Pr(a) * e.importance EaeAe Pr(a)",
        "where a is the set ofall possible actions.",
        "The idea is that an event e makes some contribution (possibly 0) to the relevance of some actions ae, and the total weight of the event is distributed among all actions related to it using (a) the prior probability Pr(a) of each action (the most frequent action will have more weight) and (b) the importance of the event.",
        "At the end of the process each action would be assigned a score representing the accumulated weights of the events, which is then normalised, so that ^a€A Wa = 1.",
        "The prior probability in the equation is meant to reflect our earlier observation that clinical actions differ in the frequency with which they are performed and this may bias their selection.",
        "Priors were computed using maximum likelihood estimates from a large database containing exhaustive annotations of clinical actions recorded by an on-site research nurse over a period of 4 months in a nicu, which contains a total of 43,889 records of actions (Hunter et al., 2003).",
        "The importance value in equation (1) is meant to reflect the fact that events in the text do not attract the attention of a reader to the same extent, since they do not have the same degree of 'severity' or 'surprise'.",
        "We operationalise this by identifying the superconcepts in the ontology (pathological-function, disorder, surgical-intervention, etc.)",
        "which could be thought of as representing 'drastic' occurrences.",
        "To these we added the concept of a trend which corresponds to a change in a physiological parameter (such as an increase in heart rate), based on the rationale that the primary aim of nicu staff is to keep a patient stable, so that any physiological instability warrants an intervention.",
        "The importance of events subsumed by these superconcepts was then set to be three times that of 'normal' events.",
        "Finally, we apply knowledge-based rules to prune the number of actions Ae related to an event e. As an example, a decision to intubate a baby depends not only on events in the text which reference this action, but also on whether the baby is already intubated.",
        "This can be assessed by checking whether s/he is on CMV (a type of ventilation which is only used after intubation).",
        "The rule is represented as intubate – -on(baby, cmv).",
        "Although such rules are extremely rough, they do help to prune inconsistencies.",

        "Overall, these results show that differences in both content and structure made the H texts superior and human texts did a much better job at explicitly relating events or situating them in time, which is crucial for comprehension and correct decision-making.",

        "made in relation to the same data on the basis of a qualitative study (Reiter et al., 2008).",
        "Correlations with rouge-4 and rouge-su are shown in Table 2 both for absolute performance scores on the C texts, and for the differences between H and C. This is because rouge can be interpreted in two ways: on the one hand, it measures the 'quality' of C texts relative to the reference human texts; on the other it also indicates similarity between C and H.",
        "There are no significant correlations between rouge and any of our performance measures.",
        "Although this leaves open the question of whether a different set of performance measures, or a different experiment, would evince a more systematic covariation, the results suggest that it is not surface similarity (to the extent that this is measured by rouge) that is contributing to better decision making.",
        "it is however worth noting that some correlations with rouge-4, namely those involving P and PAPP, do turn out significant when the 'no action' scenarios are included.",
        "This turns out to be solely due to one of the 'no action' scenarios, which had a much higher rouge-4 score than the others, possibly because the corresponding human text was comparatively brief and the number of events mentioned in the two texts was roughly equal (11 for the C text, 12 for the H text).",
        "Finally, we compare our knowledge-based measures of the relevance of the content to appropriate actions (rel) and to inappropriate actions (irrel).",

        "The absolute scores in Table 3 show that both rel and irrel are significantly correlated to SPAPP, the proportion of appropriate actions out of the actions selected by participants.",
        "The correlations are in the expected direction: there is a strong tendency for participants to choose more appropriate actions when rel is high, and the reverse is true for irrel.",
        "In the case of the C texts, there is also a negative correlation (as expected) between rel and PINAP, though this is the only one that reaches significance with this variable.",
        "It therefore appears that the knowledge-based relevance measures evince a meaningful relationship with at least some of the more 'direct' measures of performance (those assessing the relative preference of participants for appropriate actions based on a textual summary), though not with the global preference score P. One possible reason for the low correlations with the latter is that the two measures attempt to quantify directly the relevance of the content units in a text to in/appropriate courses of action; hence, they have a more direct relationship to measures of proportions of the courses of actions chosen."

        "Some authors have also reported that rouge does not correlate well with human judgements of nlg texts (Reiter and Belz, 2009).",
        "On the other hand, we do find some evidence that the amount of content in texts, and the extent to which they explicitly relate content elements temporally and rhetorically, may impact decision-making.",
        "The significant correlations observed between the number of relations in a text and the extrinsic measures are worth emphasising, as they suggest a significant role not only for content, but also rhetorical and temporal structure, something that many metrics do not take into account.",
        "perhaps the most important contribution of this paper has been to emphasise knowledge-based aspects of textual evaluation, not only by measuring content units and structure, but also by developing a motivated relevance metric, the crucial assumption being that the utility of a summary is contingent on its managing to convey information that will motivate a reader to take the 'right' course of action.",
        "The strong correlations between the relevance measures and the extent to which people chose the correct actions (or more accurately, chose more correct actions) vindicates this assumption.",
        "Some of the correlations which turned out not to be significant may be due to 'noise' in the data, in particular, high variance in the performance scores (as suggested by the standard deviations for P given in Section 3).",
        "They therefore do not warrant the conclusion that no relationship exists between a particular measure and extrinsic task performance; nevertheless, where other studies have noted similar gaps, the trends in question may be systematic and general.",
        "This, however, can only be ascertained in further follow-up studies.",
