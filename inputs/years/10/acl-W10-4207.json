        "When two humans jointly carry out a mutual task for which both know the plan – for example, assembling a new shelf – it frequently happens that one makes an error, and the other has to assist and to explain what the error was and how it can be solved.",
        "Humans are skilled at spotting errors committed by another, as well as errors which they made themselves.",
        "Recent neurological studies have shown that error monitoring – i.e., observing the errors made by oneself or by others – plays an important role in joint activity.",
        "For example, Bekkering et al.",
        "(2009) have demonstrated that humans show the same brain activation patterns when they make an error themselves and when they observe someone else making an error.",
        "In this paper, we describe a human-robot interaction (HRI) system that is able both to analyse the actions and the utterances of a human partner to determine if the human made an error in the assembly plan, and to explain to the human what went wrong and what to do to solve the problem.",
        "This robot combines approaches from sub-symbolic processing and symbolic reasoning in a hybrid architecture based on that described in Foster et al.",
        "(2008b).",
        "During the construction process, it is frequently necessary to refer to an object which is being used to assemble the finished product, choosing an un-ambigious reference to distinguish the object from the others available.",
        "The classic reference generation algorithm, on which most subsequent implementations are based, is the incremental algorithm of Dale and Reiter (1995), which selects a set of attributes of a target object to single it out from a set of distractor objects.",
        "In real-world tasks, the speaker and hearer often have more context in common than just the knowledge of object attributes, and several extensions have been proposed, dealing with visual and discourse salience (Kelleher and Kniijff, 2006) and the ability to produce multimodal references including actions such as pointing (van der Shiis, 2005; Kranstedt and",
        "Wachsmuth, 2005).",
        "Foster et al.",
        "(2008a) noted another type of imil-timodal reference which is particularly useful in embodied, task-based contexts: haptic-ostensive reference, in which an object is referred to as it is being manipulated by the speaker.",
        "Manipulating an object, which must be done in any case as part of the task, also makes an object more salient and therefore affords linguistic references that indicate the increased accessibility of the referent.",
        "This type of reference is similar to the placing-for actions noted by Clark (1996).",
        "An initial approach for generating referring expressions that make use of haptic-ostensive reference was described in (Foster et al., 2009a).",

        "The experiment described in this paper makes use of a hybrid human-robot dialogue system which supports multimodal human-robot collaboration on a joint construction task.",
        "The robot (Figure 1) has a pair of manipulator arms with grippers, mounted in a position to resemble human arms, and an animatronic talking head (van Breemen, 2005) capable of producing facial expressions, rigid head motion, and lip-synchronised synthesised speech.",
        "The subject and the robot work together to assemble wooden construction toys on a common workspace, coordinating their actions through speech (English or German), gestures, and facial expressions.",

        "In the scenario considered here, both of the participants know the assembly plan and jointly execute it.",
        "The robot assists the human, explains necessary assembly steps in case the human makes an error, and offers pieces as required.",
        "The workspace is divided into two areas – one belonging to the robot and one to the human – to make joint action necessary for task success.",
        "The system has components which use both sub-symbolic and symbolic processing.",
        "It includes a goal inference module based on dynamic neural fields (Erlhagen and Bicho, 2006; Bicho et al., 2009), which selects the robot's next actions based on the human user's actions and utterances.",
        "Given a particular assembly plan and the knowledge of which objects the user has picked up, this module can determine when the user has made an error.",
        "The system also incorporates a dialogue manager based on the TrindiKit dialogue management toolkit (Larsson and Traum, 2000), which implements the information-state based approach to dialogue management.",
        "This unique combination of abilities means that when the robot detects that its human partner has made an error – for example, picking up or requesting an assembly piece that is not needed in the current step of the building plan – it can explain to the human what the error was and what can be done to correct the mistake – for example by picking up or indicating the correct assembly piece.",
        "Messages from all of the system's input channels (speech, object recognition, and gesture recognition) are processed and combined by a multimodal fusion component based on (Giuliani and Knoll, 2008), which is the link between the symbolic and the sub-symbolic parts of the system.",
        "The fusion component then communicates with the goal inference module, which calculates the next action instructions for the robot and also determines if the user made an error.",
        "From there, fusion combines the information from goal inference with the input data and sends unified hypotheses to the dialogue manager.",

        "In this system, two strategies were implemented for generating references to objects in the world: a constant version that uses only the basic incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) to select properties, and an adaptive version that uses more of the physical, dialogue and task context to help select the references.",
        "The constant system can produce a definite or indefinite reference, and the most appropriate combination of attributes according to the incremental algorithm.",
        "The adaptive system also generates pronominal and deictic references, and introduces the concept of multiple types of distractor sets depending on context.",
        "Figure 2 shows a fragment of a sample interaction in which the user picks up an incorrect piece: the robot detects the error and describes the correct assembly procedure.",
        "The underlined references show the range of output produced by the adaptive reference generation module; for the constant system, the references would all have been \"the red cube\".",
        "The algorithms used by the adaptive reference generation module are described below.",
        "The module stores a history of the referring expressions spoken by both the system and the user, and uses these together with distractor sets to select referring expressions.",
        "In this domain there are two types of objects which we need to refer to: concrete objects in the world (everything which is on the table, or in the robot's or user's hand), and objects which do not yet exist, but are in the process of being created.",
        "For non-existent objects we do not build a distractor set, but simply use the name of the object.",
        "In all other cases, we use one of three types of distractor set:",

        "• all the objects referred to since the last mention of this object; or",
        "• all the concrete objects in the world.",
        "The first type of set is used if the object under consideration (OUC) is a negative reference to a piece in context of the creation of a target object.",
        "In all other cases, the second type is used if the OUC has been mentioned before and the third type if it has not.",
        "When choosing a referring expression, we first process the distractor set, comparing the properties of the OUC with the properties of all distrac-tors.",
        "If a distractor has a different type from the OUC, it is removed from the distractor set.",
        "With all other properties, if the distractor has a different value from the OUC, it is removed from the dis-tractor set, and the OUC's property value is added to the list of properties to use.",
        "We then choose the type of referring expression.",
        "We first look for a previous reference (PR) to the OUC, and if one exists, determine whether it was in focus.",
        "Depending on the case, we use one of the following reference strategies.",

        "PR was not focal If the robot is holding the OUC, we make a deictic reference.",
        "Otherwise, if the PR was a pronoun, definite, or deictic, we use a definite article.",
        "If the PR was indefinite and there are no distractors, we use a definite article, if there are distractors, we use an indefinite article.",
        "If there are any properties in the list, and the reference chosen is not a pronoun, we add them.",

        "We select the properties to use in describing the object under consideration, processing the distrac-tor set.",
        "We first remove all objects which do not share the same type as our object under consideration, which leaves { red cube, blue cube} .",
        "We then compare the other attributes of our new object with the remaining distractors - in this case \"colour\".",
        "Since neither cube shares the colour \"yellow\" with the target object, both are removed from the dis-tractor set, and \"yellow\" is added to the list of properties to use.",
        "There is no previous reference to this object, and since we are making a negative reference, we automatically choose an indefinite article.",

        "On the other hand, while the varied forms produced by the more complex mechanism can increase the naturalness of the system output, they may actually be insufficient if they are not used in appropriate current circumstances – for example, \"this cube\" is not a particularly helpful reference if a user has no way to tell which \"this\" is.",
        "As a consequence, the system for generating such references must be sensitive to the current state of joint actions and – in effect – of joint attention.",
        "The difference between the two systems is a test of the adaptive version's ability to adjust expressions to pertinent circumstances.",
        "It is known that people respond well to reduced expressions like \"this cube\" or \"it\" when another person uses them appropriately (Bard et al., 2008); we need to see if the robot system can also achieve the benefits that situated reference could provide.",

        "Subjects were compensated for their participation in the experiment.",
        "This study used a between-subjects design with one independent variable: each subject interacted either with a system that used a constant strategy to generate referring expressions (19 subjects), or else with a system that used an adaptive strategy (22 subjects).1",
        "Each subject built two objects in collaboration with the system, always in the same order.",
        "The first target object was the windmill (Figure 3a); after the windmill was completed, the robot and human then built a railway signal (Figure 3b).",
        "For both target objects, the user was given a building plan (on paper).",
        "To induce an error, both of the plans given to the subjects instructed them to use an incorrect piece: a yellow cube instead of a red cube for the windmill, and a long (seven-hole) slat instead of a medium (five-hole) slat for the railway signal.",
        "The subjects were told that the plan contained an error and that the robot would correct them when necessary, but did not know the nature of the error.",
        "When the human picked up or requested an incorrect piece during the interaction, the system detected the error and explained to the human what to do in order to assemble the target object correctly.",
        "When the robot explained the error and when it handed over the pieces, it used referring expressions that were generated using the constant strategy for half of the subjects, and the adaptive strategy for the other half of the subjects.",
        "The participants stood in front of the table facing the robot, equipped with a headset microphone for speech recognition.",
        "The pieces required for the target object – plus a set of additional pieces in order to make the reference task more complex – were placed on the table, using the same layout for every participant.",
        "The layout was chosen to ensure that there would be points in the interaction where the subjects had to ask the robot for building pieces from the robot's workspace, as well as situations in which the robot automatically handed over the pieces.",
        "Along with the building plan mentioned above, the subjects were given a table with the names of the pieces they could build the objects with.",

        "Finally, we compared the results on the subjective and objective measures to determine which of the objective factors had the largest influence on subjective user satisfaction.",
        "The subjects in this study gave a generally positive assessment of their interactions with the system on the questionnaire – with a mean overall satisfaction score of 72.0 out of 100 – and rated the perceived intelligence of the robot particularly highly (overall mean of 76.8).",

        "Of the six questions that were related to the conversation quality, the most significant impact was on the two questions which assessed the subjects' understanding of what they were able to do at various points during the interaction.",
        "Based on the log files and video recordings, we computed a range of objective measures.",
        "These measures were divided into three classes, based on those used in the PARADISE dialogue-system evaluation framework (Walker et al., 2000):",
        "• Two dialogue efficiency measures: the mean duration of the interaction as measured both in seconds and in system turns;",
        "• Two dialogue quality measures: the number of times that the robot gave explanations, and the number of times that the user asked for instructions to be repeated; and",
        "• One task success measure: how many of the (two) target objects were constructed as intended (i.e., as shown in Figure 3).",
        "For each of these measures, we tested whether the difference in reference strategy had a significant effect, again via a Mann-Whitney test.",
        "Table 2 illustrates the results on these objective measures, divided by the reference strategy.",
        "The results from the two groups of subjects were very similar on all of these measures: on average, the experiment took 404 seconds (nearly seven minutes) to complete with the constant strategy and 410 seconds with the adaptive, the mean number of system turns was close to 30 in both cases, just over one-quarter of all subjects asked for instructions to be repeated, the robot gave just over two explanations per trial, and about three-quarters of all target objects (i.e. 1.5 out of 2) were correctly built.",
        "The Mann-Whitney test confirms that none of the differences between the two groups even came close to significance on any of the objective measures.",
        "In the preceding sections, we presented results on a number of objective and subjective measures.",
        "While the subjects generally rated their experience of using the system positively, there was some degree of variation, most of which could not be attributed to the difference in reference strategy.",
        "Also, the results on the objective measures varied widely across the subjects, but again were not generally affected by the reference strategy.",
        "In this section, we examine the relationship between these two classes of measures in order to determine which of the objective measures had the largest effect on users' subjective reactions to the HRI system.",
        "Being able to predict subjective user satisfaction from more easily-measured objective properties can be very useful for developers of interactive systems: in addition to making it possible to evaluate systems based on automatically available data without the need for extensive experiments with users, such a performance function can also be used in an online, incremental manner to adapt system behaviour to avoid entering a state that is likely to reduce user satisfaction (Litman and Pan, 2002), or can be used as a reward function in a reinforcement-learning scenario (Walker, 2000).",
        "We employed the procedure used in the PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al., 2000) to explore the relationship between the subjective and objective factors.",

        "On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the two groups on any of the objective measures: the dialogue efficiency, dialogue quality, and task success were nearly identical across the two groups of subjects.",
        "A detailed analysis of the subjects' gaze and object-manipulation behaviour immediately after various forms of generated references from the robot also failed to find any significant differences between the various reference types.",
        "These overall results are not particularly surprising: studies of humanhuman dialogue in a similar joint construction task (Bard et al., In prep.)",
        "have demonstrated that the collaborators preserve quality of construction in all cases, though circumstances may dictate what strategies they use to do this.",
        "Combined with the subjective findings, this lack of an objective effect suggests that the references generated by the adaptive strategy were both sufficient and more natural than those generated by the constant strategy.",
        "The analysis of the relationship between the subjective and objective measures analysis has also confirmed and extended the findings from a similar analysis (Foster et al., 2009b).",
        "In that study, the main contributors to user satisfaction were user repetition requests (negative), task success, and dialogue length (both positive).",
        "In the current study, the primary factors were similar, although dialogue length was less prominent as a factor and task success was more prominent.",
        "These findings are generally intuitive: subjects who are able to complete the joint construction task are clearly having more successful interactions than those who are not able to complete the task, while subjects who need to ask for instructions to be repeated are equally clearly not having successful interactions.",
        "The findings add evidence that, in this sort of task-based, embodied dialogue system, users enjoy the experience more when they are able to complete the task successfully and are able to understand the spoken contributions of their partner, and also suggest that designers should concentrate on these aspects of the interaction when designing the system."

        "We have presented the reference generation module of a hybrid human-robot interaction system that combines a goal-inference component based on sub-symbolic dynamic neural fields with a natural-language interface based on more traditional symbolic techniques.",
        "This combination of approaches results in a system that is able to work together with a human partner on a mutual construction task, interpreting its partner's verbal and non-verbal behaviour and responding appropriately to unexpected actions (errors) of the partner.",
        "We have then described a user evaluation ofthis system, concentrating on the impact of different techniques for generating situated references in the context of the robot's corrective feedback.",
        "The results of this study indicate that using an adaptive strategy to generate the references significantly increases the users' opinion of the robot as a conversational partner, without having any effect on any of the other measures.",
        "This result agrees with the findings of the system evaluation described in (Foster et al., 2009a), and adds evidence that sophisticated generation techniques are able to improve users' experiences with interactive systems.",
        "An analysis of the relationship between the objective and subjective measures found that the main contributors to user satisfaction were the users' task performance (which had a positive effect on most measures of satisfaction), and the number of times the users had to ask for instructions to be repeated (which had a generally negative effect).",
        "Again, these results agree with the findings of a previous study (Foster et al., 2009b), and also suggest priorities for designers of this type of task-based interactive system."
