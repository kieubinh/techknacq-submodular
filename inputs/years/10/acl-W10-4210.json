        "One of the dominating tasks in Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the generation ofexpressions to pick out a referent.",
        "In recent years there has been increased interest in generating referential expressions that are natural, e.g., like those produced by people.",
        "Although research on the generation ofreferring expressions has examined different aspects of how people generate reference, there has been surprisingly little research on how people refer to objects in a real-world setting.",
        "This paper addresses this issue, and we begin formulating the requirements for an REG algorithm that refers to visible three-dimensional objects in the real world.",
        "Reference to objects in a visual domain provides a straightforward extension of the sorts of reference REG research already tends to consider.",
        "Toy examples outline reference to objects, people, and animals that are perceptually available before the speaker begins generating an utterance (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer et al., 2003; van",
        "Deemter et al., 2006; Areces et al., 2008).",
        "Example referents may be referred to by their color, size, type (\"dog\" or \"cup\"), whether or not they have a beard, etc.",
        "Typically, the reference process proceeds by comparing the properties of the referent with the properties of all the other items in the set.",
        "The final expression roughly conforms to the Gricean maxims (Grice, 1975).",
        "However, when the goal is to generate natural reference, this framework is too simple.",
        "The form reference takes is profoundly affected by modality, task, and audience (Chapanis et al., 1977; Cohen, 1984; Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), and even when these aspects are controlled, different people will refer differently to the same object (Mitchell, 2008).",
        "In light of this, we isolate one kind of natural reference and begin building the algorithmic framework necessary to generate the observed language.",
        "Psycholinguistic research has examined reference in a variety of settings, which may inform research on natural REG, but it is not always clear how to extend this work to a computational model.",
        "This is true in part because these studies favor an analysis of reference in the context of collaboration; reference is embedded within language, and language is often a joint activity.",
        "However, most research on referring expression generation supposes a solitary generating agent.",
        "This tacitly assumes that reference will be taking place in a monologue setting, rather than a dialogue or group setting.",
        "Indeed, the goal of most REG algorithms is to produce uniquely distinguishing, one-shot referring expressions.",
        "Studies on natural reference usually use a two person (speaker-listener) communication task (e.g., Flavell et al., 1968; Krauss and Glucksberg, 1969; Ford and Olson, 1975).",
        "This research has shown that reference is more accurate and efficient when it incorporates things like gesture and gaze (Clark and Krych, 2004).",
        "There is a trade-off in effort between initiating a noun phrase and refashioning it so that both speakers understand the referent (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), and speakers communicate to form lexical pacts on how to refer to an object (Sacks and Schegloff, 1979; Brennan and Clark, 1996).",
        "Mutual understanding of referents is achieved in part by referring within a subset of potential referents (Clark et al., 1983; Beun and Cremers, 1998).",
        "A few studies have compared monologue to dialogue reference, and have shown that monologue references tend to be harder for a later listener to disambiguate (Clark and Krych, 2004) and that subsequent references tend to be longer than those in dialogues (Krauss and Weinheimer, 1967).",
        "Aiming to generate natural reference in a monologue setting raises questions about what an algorithm should use to produce utterances like those produced by people.",
        "In a monologue setting, the speaker (or algorithm) gets no feedback from the listener; the speaker's reference is not tied to interactions with other participants.",
        "The speaker is therefore in a difficult position, attempting to clearly convey a referent without being able to check ifthe reference is understood along the way.",
        "Recent studies that have focused on monologue reference do so rather explicitly, which may affect participant responses.",
        "These studies utilize 2D graphical depictions of simple 3D objects (van Deemter et al., 2006; Viethen and Dale, 2008), where a small set of properties can be used to distinguish one item from another.",
        "The expressions are elicited in isolation, typed and then submitted, which may hide some of the underlying referential processes.",
        "None of these studies utilize actual objects.",
        "It is therefore difficult to use these data to draw conclusions about how reference works in naturalistic settings.",
        "It is unclear if these experimental settings are natural enough, i.e., if they get at reference as it may occur every day.",
        "The study in this paper attempts to bring out information about reference in a number of ways.",
        "First, we conduct the study in-person, using real-world objects.",
        "This design invites referential phenomena that may not have been previously observed in simpler domains.",
        "Second, the referring expressions are produced orally.",
        "This allows us access to reference as it is generated, without the participants revising and so potentially obscuring information about their reference.",
        "Third, we use a relatively complicated task, where participants must explain how to use pieces to put together a picture of a face.",
        "The fact that we are looking at reference is not made explicit, which lessens any experimental effects caused by subjects guessing the purpose of the study.",
        "This approach also situates reference within a larger task, which may draw out aspects of reference not usually seen in experiments that elicit reference in isolation.",
        "Fourth, the objects used display a variety of different features: texture, material, color, size along several dimensions, etc.",
        "This brings the data set closer to objects that people interact with every day.",
        "A monologue setting offers a picture of the phenomena at play during a single individual's referring expression generation.",
        "The referring expressions gathered in this study exhibit several aspects of reference that have not yet been addressed in REG.",
        "This includes (1) part-whole modularity; (2) size comparisons across three dimensions; and (3) analogies.",
        "Work in cognitive sciences suggests that these phenomena are interrelated, and may be possible to represent in a computational framework.",
        "This research also offers connections to further aspects ofnatural reference that were not directly observed in the study, but will need to be accounted for in future work on naturalistic referring expression generation.",
        "Using these ideas, we begin formulating the structures that an REG algorithm would need in order to produce reference to real-world objects in a visual setting.",
        "Approaching REG in this way allows us to tie research in the generation of referring expressions to computational models of visual perception and cognitively-motivated computer vision.",
        "Moving in this direction offers the prospect of eventually developing an application for the generation of natural reference to objects automatically recognized by a computer vision system.",
        "In the next section, we describe our study.",
        "In Section 3, we analyze the results and discuss what they tell us about natural reference.",
        "In Section 4, we draw on our results and cognitive models ofob-ject recognition to begin building the framework for a referring expression algorithm that generates naturalistic reference to objects in a visual scene.",
        "In Section 5, we offer concluding remarks and outline areas for further study."

        "Spatial attentional mechanisms provide information about where the non-spatial features are located in relation to one another, size, and the spatial interrelations between component parts.",
        "Applying these findings to our study, an REG algorithm that generates natural reference should utilize a visual, feature-based representation ofob-jects alongside a structural, spatial representation of objects.",
        "A feature-based representation is already common to REG, and could be represented as a series of <ATTRiBUTE:value> pairs.",
        "A spatial representation is necessary to define how the object is situated within a dimensional space, providing information about the relative distances between object components, edges, and corners.",
        "With such information provided by a spatial representation, the generation of part-whole expressions, such as \"the pompom with the tinsel on the outside\", is possible.",
        "This also allows for the generation of size modifiers (\"big\", \"small\") without the need for crisp measurements, for example, by comparing the difference in overall height of the target object with other objects in the scene, or against a stored prototype (discussed below).",
        "Relative size comparisons across different dimensions would also be possible, used to generate size modifiers such as \"wide\" and \"thick\" that refer to one dimensional axis.",
        "A feature-based and a spatial representation may also play a role in analogies.",
        "When we use analogies, as in \"the pipe-cleaner that looks like a caterpillar\", we use world knowledge about items that are not themselves visible.",
        "Such an expression draws on similarity that does not link the referent with a particular object, but with a general type of object: the pipe-cleaner is caterpillar-like.",
        "To generate these kinds of expressions, an REG algorithm would first need a knowledge base with prototypes listing prototypical values of attributes.",
        "For example, a banana prototype might have a prototypical CO LOR of yellow.",
        "With prototypes in the knowledge base, the REG algorithm would need to calculate similarity of a target referent to other known items.",
        "This would allow a piece of yellow cloth, for example, to be described as being the color of a banana.",
        "Implementing such similarity measures in an REG algorithm will be challenging.",
        "One difficulty is that prototype values may be different depending on what is known about an item; a prototypical unripe banana may be green, or a prototypical rotten banana brown.",
        "Another difficulty will be in determining when a referent is similar enough to a prototype to warrant an analogy.",
        "Additional research is needed to explore how these properties can be reasoned about.",
        "A knowledge base containing prototypes opens up the possibility of generating many other kinds of natural references.",
        "In particular, such knowledge would allow the algorithm to compute which properties a given kind of referent may be expected to have, and which properties may be unexpected.",
        "Unexpected properties may therefore stand out as particularly salient.",
        "For example, a dog missing a leg may be described as a \"three-legged dog\" because the prototypical dog has four legs.",
        "We believe that this perspective, which hinges on the unexpectedness of a property, suggests a new approach to attribute selection.",
        "Unlike the Incremental Algorithm, the Preference Order that determines the order in which attributes are examined would not be fixed, but would depend on the nature of the referent and what is known about it.",
        "Approaching REG in this way follows work in cognitive science and neurophysiology that suggests that expectations about objects' visual and spatial characteristics are derived from stored representations of object 'prototypes' in the inferior temporal lobe of the brain (Logothetis and - A spatial representation (depicting size, interrelations between component parts) - A non-spatial, prepositional representation (describing color, texture, orientation, etc.)",
        "- A knowledge base with stored prototypical object prepositional and spatial representations",
        "Sheinberg, 1996; Riesenhuber and Poggio, 2000; Palmeri and Gauthier, 2004).",
        "Most formal theories of object perception posit some sort of category activation system (Kosslyn, 1994), a system that matches input properties of objects to those of stored prototypes, which then helps guide expectations about objects in a top-down fashion.This appears to be a neurological correlate of the knowledge base we propose to underlie analogies.",
        "Such a system contains information about prototypical objects' component parts and where they are placed relative to one another, as well as relevant values for material, color, etc.",
        "This suggests that the spatial and non-spatial feature-based representations proposed for visible objects could be used to represent prototype objects as well.",
        "Indeed, how we view and refer to objects appears to be influenced by the interaction of these structures: Expectations about an object's spatial properties guide our attention towards expected object parts and non-spatial, feature-based properties throughout the scene (Kosslyn, 1994; Itti and Koch, 2001).",
        "This affects the kinds of things we are most likely to generate language about (Itti and Arbib, 2005).",
        "We can now outline some general requirements for an algorithm capable of generating naturalistic reference to objects in a visual scene: Input to such an algorithm should include a feature-based representation, which we will call a propositional representation, with values for color, texture, etc., and a spatial representation, with symbolic information about objects' size and the spatial relationships between components.",
        "A system that generates naturalistic reference must also use a knowledge base storing information about object prototypes, which may be represented in terms of their own propositional/spatial representations."

        "We have explored the interaction between viewing objects in a three-dimensional, spatial domain and referring expression generation.",
        "This has led us to propose structures that may be used to connect vision in a spatial modality to naturalistic reference.",
        "The proposed structures include a spatial representation, a propositional representation, and a knowledge base with representations for object prototypes.",
        "Using structures that define the prepositional and spatial content of objects fits well with work in psycholinguistics, cognitive science and neurophysiology, and may provide the basis to generate a variety of natural-sounding references from a system that recognizes objects.",
        "It is important to note that any naturalistic experimental design limits the kinds of conclusions that can be drawn about reference.",
        "A study that elicits reference to objects in a visual scene provides insight into reference to objects in a visual scene; these conclusions cannot easily be extended to reference to other kinds of phenomena, such as reference to people in a novel.",
        "We therefore make no claims about reference as a whole in this paper; generalizations from this research can provide hypotheses for further testing in different modalities and with different sorts of referents.",
        "Our data leave open many areas for further study, and we hope to address these in future work.",
        "Experiments designed specifically to elicit relative size modifiers, reference to object components, and reference to objects that are like other things would help further detail the form our proposed structures take.",
        "What is clear from our data is that both a spatial understanding and a non-spatial feature-based understanding appear to play a role in reference to objects in a visual scene, and further, reference in such a setting is bolstered by a knowledge base with stored prototypical object representations.",
        "Utilizing structures representative of these phenomena, we may be able to extend object recognition research into object reference research, generating natural-sounding reference in everyday settings."
