        "In the past decade, a new area of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has emerged: the automated generation of expository dialogue, also often referred to as scripted, authored or fictive dialogue.",
        "Research in this area began with the seminal study by Andre et al.",
        "(2000), which explored generation of dialogues between a virtual car buyer and seller from technical data on a car.",
        "This strand of work was developed further in the NECA project (van Deemter et al., 2008) and has since been extended to other domains, including explanation of medical histories (Williams et al., 2007), patient information leaflets (Piwek et al., 2007) and Wall Street Journal articles (Hernault et al., 2008).",
        "Systems for generating expository dialogue have explored different inputs (databases, knowledge representations and text), generation methods (e.g., rule versus constraint-based approaches) and outputs (from dialogue scripts in text form to audio and computer-animated dialogue).",
        "A common trait of all these systems is, however, that at some point in the generation process, they produce a dialogue script, a text file which specifies what the interlocutors say, possibly enriched with mark-up for dialogue acts, speech and gestures - see, e.g., Piwek et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "These systems are different from conventional dialogue systems in that the system does not engage in a dialogue with the user; rather, the system generates a dialogue between two or more fictitious characters for the user/audience to view and learn from.",
        "In other words, the dialogue is used to deliver information to the user or audience, rather than between the interlocutors.",
        "Piwek (2008) discusses several empirical studies that identify benefits of the use of expository dialogue for education and persuasion.",
        "In this paper, we take a step towards addressing two shortcomings of the work so far.",
        "Firstly, all the work cited has relied on hand-crafted resources (typically rules) for creating the dialogue.",
        "With the resources being created by non-expert dialogue authors (e.g., academic researchers), generated dialogues based on these resources may not be optimal; for instance, Williams et al.",
        "(2007) found that generated dialogues can be too information-dense, requiring conversational padding.",
        "Secondly, the resources for creating dialogue are tied to a specific domain, making it hard to redeploy a system in new domains.",
        "We propose to address the first issue by automatically creating dialogue generation resources from a corpus of dialogues written by known effective dialogue authors.",
        "This fits in with a trend in dialogue modelling and generation to create resources from empirical data (Oh and Rudnicky, 2002; DeVault et al., 2008; Henderson et al., 2008; Belz and Kow, 2009).",
        "The second issue is addressed by specifying dialogue generation rules at a level of detail that abstracts over the particulars of the domain and fits in with existing NLG architectures.",
        "The reference architecture of Reiter and Dale (2000) identifies three principal NLG tasks: Document Planning (DP), Microplanning and Realisation.",
        "DP is primarily non-linguistic: it concerns selection of information and organization of this information into a coherent whole.",
        "The latter is achieved by making sure that the information is tied together by Rhetorical Relations such as Contrast, Elaboration and Explanation, in other words, it is part of a Rhetorical Structure.",
        "We propose that dialogue generation rules interface with Rhetorical Structure and map to a Sequence of Dialogue Acts.",
        "Interestingly, the interface between DP and Microplanning has also been identified as a place where decisions and preferences regarding style take an effect (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985).",
        "A question that we explore in this paper is whether dialogue styles exist at the highly abstract level we focus on in this paper.",
        "We concentrate on style in the sense of '[t]he manner of expression characteristic of a particular writer'.",
        "The remainder of this paper is set up as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce the corpus that we use to extract dialogue generation resources.",
        "Section 3 examines the dialogues in the corpus for prima facie evidence for stylistic differences between authors at the dialogue level.",
        "In Section 4, we describe our approach to extracting high-level dialogue generation rules from the corpus.",
        "Next, in Section 5 we analyse the resulting rules, looking for further evidence of different dialogue styles.",
        "We also compare the rules that were harvested from our corpus with handcrafted rules in terms of content and variety.",
        "Finally, Section 6 contains our conclusions and a discussion of avenues for further research."

        "(extract of445 turns) and Yuri Gure-vich's 'Evolving Algebras' (extract of 89 turns).",

        "In this paper, we have introduced a new approach to creating resources for automatically generating expository dialogue.",

        "We extracted 167 distinct rules and discussed the three types of rules: null, simple and complex (depending on the number of RST relation in the LHS: 0, 1 or more).",
        "We found differences between authors in several respects, specifically:",
        "• number of turns per simple rule",
        "• number of dialogue acts per simple rule",
        "• combination of speaker roles and dialogue acts",
        "A detailed comparison between our automatically extracted attribution rule and the hand-crafted rules used by Hernault et al.",
        "showed up a number of differences.",
        "Apart from the fact that the corpus yielded many more rules than the two manually created ones, there were differences in which interlocutor presented particular information and which dialogue acts were being used.",
        "The current work has focussed on high-level mapping rules which can be used both for generation from databases and knowledge representations and also for generation from text.",
        "In future work, we will focus on mapping text (in monologue form) to dialogue.",
        "For this we need to combine the highlevel rules with rules for paraphrasing the text in the monologue with text for the dialogue acts that express the same information in dialogue form.",
        "For automatically extracting these surface level mappings we will draw on the approach to learning paraphrases from a corpus that is described in Barzilay and McKeown (2001).",
        "An important component of our future effort will be to evaluate whether automatically generating dialogues from naturally-occurring monologues, following the approach described here, results in dialogues that are fluent and coherent and preserve the information from the input monologue."
