        "The basic principle of maximum entropy models is to minimize assumptions, while imposing constraints such that the expected feature value is equal to the observed feature value in the training data.",
        "In its canonical form, the probability of a certain event (y) occurring in the context (x) is a loglinear combination of features and feature weights, where Z(x) is a normalization over all events in context x (Berger et al., 1996):",
        "The training process estimates optimal feature weights, given the constraints and the principle of maximum entropy.",
        "In fluency ranking the input (e.g. a dependency structure) is a context, and a realization of that input is an event within that context.",
        "Features can be hand-crafted or generated automatically using very general feature templates.",
        "For example, if we apply a template rule that enumerates the rules used to construct a derivation tree to the partial tree in figure 1 the rule(maxjcp(np)) and rule(npAetJi) features will be created.",

        "The advantage of this approach is that it requires little human labor, and generally gives good ranking performance.",

        "Feature selection is a process that tries to extract S C F from a set of features F, such that the model using S performs comparably to the model using F. Such a compression of a feature set can be obtained if there are features: that occur sporadically; that correlate strongly with other features (features that show the same behavior within events and contexts); or have values with little or no correlation to the classification or ranking.",
        "Features that do have no correlation to the classification can be removed from the model.",
        "For a set of highly-correlating features, one feature can be selected to represent the whole group.",
        "Initially it may seem attractive to perform fluency selection by training a model on all features, selecting features with relatively high weights.",
        "However, if features overlap, weight mass will usually be divided over these features.",
        "For instance, suppose that /1 alone has a weight of 0.5 in a given model.",
        "If we retrain the model, after adding the features /2../s that behave identically to /i , the weight may be distributed evenly between giving each feature the weight 0.1.",
        "In the following sections, we will give a short overview of previous research in feature selection, and will then proceed to give a more detailed description of three feature selection methods.",

        "This method excludes models that do not perform competitively to other models or that do not perform better than one of its submodels.",

        "In the fluency ranking literature, the use of a frequency cut-off (Velldal and Oepen, 2006) and l1regularization (Cahill et al., 2007) is prevalent.",
        "We are not aware of any detailed studies that compare feature selection methods for fluency ranking.",

        "In the variant he and Malouf and Van Noord (2004) discuss, all features that change within more than n contexts are included in the model.",
        "While frequency-based selection helps selecting features that are discriminative, it cannot account for feature overlap.",
        "Discriminative features that have a strong correlation to features that were selected previously may still be added.",
        "To detect overlap, we calculate the correlation of a candidate feature and exclude the feature if it shows a high correlation with features selected previously.",
        "To estimate Pearson's correlation of two features, we calculate the sample correlation coefficient,",
        "where / x is the average feature value of /x, and Sfx is the sample standard deviation of /x.",
        "Of course, correlation can only indicate overlap, and is in itself not enough to find effective features.",
        "In our experiments with correlation-based selection we used frequency-based selection as described in 2.3, to make an initial ranking of feature effectiveness.",
        "Correlation-based selection can detect overlap, however, there is yet another spurious type of feature that may reduce its effectiveness.",

        "Not only does this feature change very often, its correlation with other features will also be weak.",
        "Such a feature may seem attractive from the point of view of a frequency or correlation-based method, but is useless in practice.",
        "To account for both problems, we have to measure the effectiveness of features in terms of how much their addition to the model can improve prediction of the training sample.",
        "Or in other words: does the log-likelihood of the training data increase?",
        "We have modified the Selective Gain Computation (SGC) algorithm described by Zhou et al.",
        "(2003) for ranking tasks rather than classification tasks.",
        "This method builds upon the maximum entropy feature selection method described by Berger et al.",
        "(1996).",
        "In this method features are added iteratively to a model that is initially uniform.",
        "During each step, the feature that provides the highest gain as a result of being added to the model, is selected and added to the model.",
        "In maximum entropy modeling, the weights of the features in a model are optimized simultaneously.",
        "However, optimizing the weights of the features in model psj for every candidate feature / is computationally intractable.",
        "As a simplification, it is assumed that the weights of features that are already in the model are not affected by the addition of a feature /.",
        "As a result, the optimal weight a of / can be found using a simple line search method.",
        "However, as Zhou et al.",
        "(2003) note, there is still an inefficiency in that the weight of every candidate feature is recalculated during every selection step.",
        "They observe that gains of remaining candidate features rarely increase as the result of adding a feature.",
        "If it is assumed that this never happens, a list of candidate features ordered by gain can be kept.",
        "To account for the fact that the topmost feature in that list may have lost its effectiveness as the result of a previous addition of a feature to the model, the gain of the topmost feature is recalculated and reinserted into the list according to its new gain.",
        "When the topmost feature retains its position, it is selected and added to the model.",
        "Since we use feature selection with features that are not binary, and for a ranking task, we modified the recursive forms of the model to:",
        "Another issue that needs to be dealt with is the calculation of context and event probabilities.",
        "In the literature two approaches are prevalent.",
        "The first approach divides the probability mass uniformly over contexts, and the probability of events within a context is proportional to the event score (Osborne,",
        "where \\ X\\ is the number of contexts.",
        "The second approach puts more emphasis on the contexts that contain relatively many events with high scores, by making the context probability dependent on the scores of events within that context (Malouf and van",

        "Eyex score(x,y)",
        "In our experiments, the second definition of context probability outperformed the first by such a wide margin, that we only used the second definition in the experiments described in this paper.",

        "In the selection method of Berger et al.",
        "(1996), the weight and gain of each candidate feature is re-estimated during each selection step.",
        "We can exploit the changes in gains to detect overlap between a selected feature /n, and the candidates for /n+1.",
        "If the gain of a feature changed drastically in the selection of /n+1 compared to that of /n, this feature has overlap with /n.",

        "As expected, the frequency-based method fared worse than maximum entropy selection.",
        "Initially some very useful features, such as the n-gram models are selected, but improvement of accuracy quickly stagnates.",
        "We expect this to be caused by overlap of newly selected features with features that were initially selected.",
        "Even after selecting 5000 features, this method does not reach the same accuracy as the maximum entropy selection method had after selecting only a few hundred features.",
        "The correlation-based selection method fares better than the frequency-based method without overlap detection.",
        "This clearly shows that feature overlap is a problem.",
        "However, the correlation-based method does not achieve good accuracy as quickly as the maximum entropy selection method.",

        "First, there may be noisy features that are frequent, and since they show no overlap with selected features they are good candidates according to the correlation-based method.",
        "Second, less frequent features that overlap with a frequent feature in a subset of contexts may show a low correlation.",

        "It is possible to refine the correlation-based method to deal with the second class of problems.",

        "In the extreme case, we could have two very distinctive features /1 and /2 that behave exactly the same in any event.",
        "While adding /2 after adding /1 does not improve the model, frequency-based selection cannot detect this.",
        "To support this argumentation empirically, we analyzed the first 100 selected features to find good examples of this overlap.",
        "Initially, the frequency-based selection chooses three distinctive features that are also selected by the maximum entropy selection method: the two n-gram language models, and a preference for topical-ized NP subjects.",
        "After that, features that indicate whether the vp-argjv(np) rule was used change very frequently within a context.",
        "However, this aspect of the parse tree is embodied in 13 successively selected features.",

        "Our conclusion after performing experiments with feature selection is twofold.",
        "First, fluency models can be compressed enormously by applying feature selection, without losing much in terms of accuracy.",
        "Second, we only need a small number of targeted features to perform fluency ranking.",
        "The maximum entropy feature selection method",
        "Table 2: The first 10 features returned by maximum entropy feature selection, including the weights estimated by this feature selection method.",
        "shows a high accuracy after selecting just a few features.",
        "The commonly used frequency-based selection method fares far worse, and requires addition of many more features to achieve the same performance as the maximum entropy method.",
        "By experimenting with a correlation-based selection method that uses the frequency method to make an initial ordering of features, but skips features that show a high correlation with previously selected features, we have shown that the ineffectiveness of frequency-based selection can be attributed partly to feature overlap.",
        "However, the maximum entropy method was still more effective in our experiments.",
        "In the future, we hope to evaluate the same techniques to parse disambiguation.",
        "We also plan to compare the feature selection methods described in this paper to selection by imposing a l1 prior.",
        "The feature selection methods described in this paper are usable for feature sets devised for ranking and classification tasks, especially when huge sets of automatically extracted features are used.",
        "An open source implementation of the methods described in this paper is available, and is optimized to work on large data and feature sets.",
