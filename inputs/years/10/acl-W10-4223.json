        "Text-to-text generation is an increasingly studied subfield in natural language processing.",
        "In contrast with the typical natural language generation paradigm of converting concepts to text, in text-to-text generation a source text is converted into a target text that approximates the meaning of the source text.",
        "Text-to-text generation extends to such varied tasks as summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), question-answering (Lin and Pan-tel, 2001), machine translation, and paraphrase generation.",
        "Sentential paraphrase generation (SPG) is the process of transforming a source sentence into a target sentence in the same language which differs in form from the source sentence, but approximates its meaning.",
        "Paraphrasing is often used as a subtask in more complex NLP applications to allow for more variation in text strings presented as input, for example to generate paraphrases of questions that in their original form cannot be answered (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Riezler et al., 2007), or to generate paraphrases of sentences that failed to translate (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "Paraphrasing has also been used in the evaluation of machine translation system output (Russo-Lassner et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Zhou et al., 2006).",
        "Adding certain constraints to paraphrasing allows for additional useful applications.",
        "When a constraint is specified that a paraphrase should be shorter than the input text, paraphrasing can be used for sentence compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003) as well as for text simplification for question answering or subtitle generation (Daelemans et al., 2004).",
        "We regard SPG as a monolingual machine translation task, where the source and target languages are the same (Quirk et al., 2004).",
        "However, there are two problems that have to be dealt with to make this approach work, namely obtaining a sufficient amount of examples, and a proper evaluation methodology.",
        "As Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2008) argue, automatic evaluation of paraphrasing is problematic.",
        "The essence of SPG is to generate a sentence that is structurally different from the source.",
        "Automatic evaluation metrics in related fields such as machine translation operate on a notion of similarity, while paraphrasing centers around achieving dissimilarity.",
        "Besides the evaluation issue, another problem is that for an data-driven MT account of paraphrasing to work, a large collection of data is required.",
        "In this case, this would have to be pairs of sentences that are paraphrases of each other.",
        "So far, paraphrasing data sets of sufficient size have been mostly lacking.",

        "In this study we explore the use of a large, automatically acquired aligned paraphrase corpus.",

        "An example of such a cluster is given in Figure 1.",
        "For each pair of headlines in a cluster, we calculate the Cosine similarity over the word vectors of the two headlines.",
        "If the similarity exceeds a defined upper threshold it is accepted; if it is below a defined lower threshold it is rejected.",
        "In the case that it lies between the thresholds, the process is repeated but then with word vectors taken from a snippet from the corresponding news article.",
        "This method, described in earlier work Wubben et al.",
        "(2009), was reported to yield a precision of 0.76 and a recall of 0.41 on clustering actual Dutch paraphrases in a headline corpus.",

        "If we pick a random sentence from the reference set and score it against the rest of the set, we obtain similar scores.",
        "This means that this score can be regarded as an upper bound score for paraphrasing: we can not expect our paraphrases to be better than those produced by humans.",
