        "For situated interaction, an intelligent system needs methods for relating entities in the world, its representation of the world, and the natural language references exchanged with its user.",
        "Human natural language processing and algorithmic approaches alike have been extensively studied for application domains restricted to small visual scenes and other small-scale surroundings.",
        "Still, rather little research has addressed the specific issues involved in establishing reference to entities outside the currently visible scene.",
        "The challenge that we address here is how the focus of attention can shift over the course of a discourse if the domain is larger than the currently visible scene.",
        "The generation of referring expressions (GRE) has been viewed as an isolated problem, focussing on efficient algorithms for determining which information from the domain must be incorporated in a noun phrase (NP) such that this NP allows the hearer to optimally understand which referent is meant.",
        "The domains of such approaches usually consist of small, static domains or simple visual scenes.",
        "In their seminal work Dale and Reiter (1995) present the Incremental Algorithm (IA) for GRE.",
        "Recent extensions address some of its shortcomings, such as negated and disjoined properties (van Deemter, 2002) and an account of salience for generating contextually appropriate shorter REs (Krahmer and Theune, 2002).",
        "Other, alternative GRE algorithms exist (Horacek, 1997; Bateman, 1999; Krahmer et al., 2003).",
        "However, all these algorithms rely on a given domain of discourse constituting the current context (or focus of attention).",
        "The task of the GRE algorithm is then to single out the intended referent against the other members of the context, which act as potential distractors.",
        "As long as the domains are such closed-context scenarios, the intended referent is always in the current focus.",
        "We address the challenge of producing and understanding of references to entities that are outside the current focus of attention, because they have not been mentioned yet and are beyond the currently observable scene.",
        "Our approach relies on the dichotomy between small-scale space and large-scale space for human spatial cognition.",
        "Large-scale space is \"a space which cannot be perceived at once; its global structure must be derived from local observations over time\" (Kuipers, 1977).",
        "In everyday situations, an office environment, one's house, or a university campus are large-scale spaces.",
        "A tabletop or a part of an office are examples of small-scale space.",
        "Despite large-scale space being not fully observable, people can nevertheless have a reasonably complete mental representation of, e.g., their domestic or work environments in their cognitive maps.",
        "Details might be missing, and people might be uncertain about particular things and states of affairs that are known to change frequently.",
        "Still, people regularly engage in a conversation about such an environment, making successful references to spatially located entities.",
        "It is generally assumed that humans adopt a partially hierarchical representation of spatial organization (Stevens and Coupe, 1978; McNamara, 1986).",
        "The basic units of such a representation are topological regions (i.e., more or less clearly bounded spatial areas) (Hirtle and Jonides, 1985).",
        "Paraboni et al.",
        "(2007) are among the few to address the issue of generating references to entities outside the immediate environment, and present an algorithm for context determination in hierar-",

        "(b) Illustration of the TA principle: starting from the attentional anchor (a), the smallest sub-hierarchy containing both a and the intended referent (r) is formed incrementally.",
        "chically ordered domains.",
        "However, since it is mainly targeted at producing textual references to entities in written documents (e.g., figures and tables in book chapters), they do not address the challenges of physical and perceptual situated-ness.",
        "Large-scale space can be viewed as a hierarchically ordered domain.",
        "To keep track of the referential context in such a domain, in our previous work we propose the principle of topological abstraction (TA, summarized in Fig. 1) for context extension (Zender et al., 2009a), similar to Ancestral Search (Paraboni et al., 2007).",
        "In (Zender et al., 2009b), we describe the integration of the approach in an NLP system for situated human-robot dialogues and present two algorithms instantiating the TA principle for GRE and resolving referring expressions (RRE), respectively.",
        "It relies on two parameters: the location of the intended referent r, and the attentional anchor a.",
        "As discussed in our previous works, for single utterances the anchor is the physical position where it is made (i.e., the utterance situation (Devlin, 2006)).",
        "Below, we propose models for attentional anchor-progression for longer discourses about large-scale space, and evaluate them against real-world data."

      "heading": "2. The Models",
      "text": [
        "In order to account for the determination of the attentional anchor a, we propose a model called anchor-progression A.",
        "The model assumes that each exophoric reference serves as attentional anchor for the subsequent reference.",
        "It is based on observations on \"principles for anchoring resource situations\" by Poesio (1993), where the expression of movement in the domain determines the updated current mutual focus of attention.",
        "a and r are then passed to the TA algorithm.",
        "Taking into account the verbal behavior observed in our experiment, we also propose a refined model of anchor-resetting R, where for each new turn (e.g., a new instruction), the anchor is reset to the utterance situation.",
        "R leads to the inclusion of navigational information for each first RE in a turn, thus reassuring the hearer of the focus of attention."

        "We use the data to evaluate the utility of the A and R models.",
        "We specifically evaluate them against the traditional (global) model G in which the indented referent must be singled out from all entities in the domain.",
        "The cover story for the experiment was to record spoken instructions to help improve a speech recognition system for robots.",
        "The participants were asked to imagine an intelligent service robot capable of understanding natural language and familiar with its environment.",

        "The use of color terms to identify objects was discouraged by telling the participants that the robot is unable to perceive color.",
        "The stimuli consisted of 8 corresponding scenes of the tabletop and the domestic setting (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "2).",
        "In order to preclude the specific phenomena of collaborative, task-oriented dialogue (cf., e.g., (Garrod and Pickering, 2004)), the participants had to instruct an imaginary recipient of orders.",
        "The choice of a robot was made to rule out potential social implications when imagining, e.g., talking to a child, a butler, or a friend.",
        "The SSS scenes show a bird's-eye view of the table including the robot's position (similar to (Fu-nakoshi et al., 2004)).",
        "The way the objects are arranged allows to refer to their location with respect to the corners of the table, with plates as additional landmarks.",
