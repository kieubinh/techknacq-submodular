        "The proposed system follows a pipelined architecture (each module processes the information provided by the previous one).",
        "First, a Part of Speech (POS) tagger is applied to the corpus.",
        "Then, the combination of words and POS tags are used by a CRF classifier to detect Named Entities (NE).",
        "Next, logical rules based on combination of POS tags, words and NE labels are used to detect pronouns related to persons.",
        "Finally, an algorithm identifies, among the person entities that have been detected, the ones that co-refer and cluster them.",
        "At the end, all collected information is aggregated in a XML file conform to GRÉC-NÉR specifications.",
        "The part of speech labeling is done with the English version of Treetagger.",
        "It is completed by a step where every NAM tag associated to a first nname is replaced by a FNAME tag, using a lexical resource of first names (see table 2, column POS Tag).",
        "The first name tag improves the NE detection model while it improves the estimation of conditional probabilities for words describing a person, encountered by a NER system.",
        "The Named Entity Recognition (NER) system is an implementation of the CRF based system (Bechet and Charton, 2010) that has been used in the French NER evaluation campaign ESTER 2 (Galliano et al., 2009).",
        "For the present task, training of the NER tool is fully unsupervised as it does not use the GREC training corpus.",
        "It is trained in English with an automatically NE annotated version of the Wikipedia Corpus (the full system configuration is described in (Charton and",

        "Following the NE detection process, detection rules are used to label each personal pronoun with the PERS tag.",
        "Boolean AND rules are applied to triples [word, POS tag, NE tag}, where word = [he, him, she, her ...}, POS tag=NN, and NE tag=UNK .",
        "This rule structure is adopted to avoid the PERS labeling of pronouns included in an expression or in a previously tagged NE (i.e a music album or a movie title, using word She, and previously labeled with PROD NE tag).",
        "Finally, each PERS labeled entity is numbered by order of apparition and is associated with the sentences reference number where it appears (consecutive PERS labeled words, not separated by punctuation mark, receive the same index number).",
        "In the final stage, our system determines which entities co-refer.",
        "First, a clustering process is achieved.",
        "The principle of the algorithm is as follows: entities characteristics (words, POS tags, sentence position) are indexed in a stack, ordered according to their chronological apparition in the text (the entity at the top of the stack is the first one that has been detected in the document).",
        "At the beginning of the process, the entity that is at the top of the stack is removed and constitutes the first item of a cluster.",
        "This entity is compared sequentially, by using similarity rules, with every other entities contained in the stack.",
        "When there is a match, entity is transfered to the currently instantiated cluster and removed from the stack.",
        "When the end of the stack is reached, remaining entities are reordered and the process iterates form the beginning.",
        "This operation is repeated until the stack is empty.",
        "Comparison of entities in the stack is done in two ways according to the nature of the entity.",
        "We consider a candidate entity Ec from stack S. According to iteration k, the current cluster is Ck.",
        "Each element of the sequence Ec (i.e Chester FNAME Carton NAM) is compared to the sequences previously transfered in Ck during the exploration process of the stack.",
        "If Ec ç |J Ck, it is included in cluster Ck and removed from S. Finally inclusion of pronouns from S in Ec is done by resolving the anaphora, according to the Hobbs algorithm, as described in (Jurafsky et al., 2000)."
