        "The baseline system is based on the following linguistic features of REF elements: SEMCAT (Semantic Category), SYNCAT (Syntactic Category) and SYNFUNC (Syntactic Function) (Anja Belz, 2010) and the following linguistic features of REFEX elements: REG08-TYPE (Entity type) and CASE (Case marker).",
        "The baseline system has been separately trained on the training set data for the three domains: chefs, composers and inventors.",
        "The system has been tested on each development set by identifying the most probable REFEX element among the possible alternatives based on the REF element feature combination.",

        "It has been observed that many times the most probable REFEX element as identified from the training set is not present among the alternative REFEX elements.",
        "In these cases the system assigns the next highest probable REFEX element learnt from the training set that matches with one of the REFEX elements among the alternatives.",

        "In these cases, the REFEX element that occurs earlier in the alternative set is assigned.",
