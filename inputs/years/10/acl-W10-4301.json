        "Speakers in dialogue produce speech in a piecemeal fashion and on-line as the dialogue progresses.",
        "When starting to speak, dialogue participants typically do not have a complete plan of how to say something or even what to say.",
        "Yet, they manage to rapidly integrate information from different sources in parallel and simultaneously plan and realize new dialogue contributions.",
        "Moreover, interlocutors continuously self-monitor the actual production processes in order to facilitate self-corrections (Levelt, 1989).",
        "Contrary to this, most spoken dialogue systems use a silence threshold to determine when the user has stopped speaking.",
        "The user utterance is then processed by one module at a time, after which a complete system utterance is produced and realised by a speech synthesizer.",
        "This paper has two purposes.",
        "First, to present an initial step towards a model of speech generation that allows a dialogue system to incrementally interpret spoken input, while simultaneously planning, realising and self-monitoring the system response.",
        "The model has been implemented in a general dialogue system framework.",
        "This is described in Section 2 and 3.",
        "The second purpose is to evaluate the usefulness of incremental speech generation in a Wizard-of-Oz setting, using the proposed model.",
        "This is described in Section 4.",
        "A non-incremental dialogue system waits until the user has stopped speaking (using a silence threshold to determine this) before starting to process the utterance and then produce a system response.",
        "If processing takes time, for example because an external resource is being accessed, this may result in a confusing response delay.",
        "An incremental system may instead continuously build a tentative plan of what to say as the user is speaking.",
        "When it detects that the user's utterance has ended, it may start to asynchronously realise this plan while processing continues, with the possibility to revise the plan if needed.",
        "There are many potential reasons for why dialogue systems may need additional time for processing.",
        "For example, it has been assumed that ASR processing has to be done in real-time, in order to avoid long and confusing response delays.",
        "Yet, if we allow the system to start speaking before input is complete, we can allow more accurate (and time-consuming) ASR processing (for example by broadening the beam).",
        "In this paper, we will explore incremental speech generation in a Wizard-of-oz setting.",
        "A common problem in such settings is the time it takes for the Wizard to interpret the user's utterance and/or decide on the next system action, resulting in unacceptable response delays (Fraser & Gilbert, 1991).",
        "Thus, it would be useful if the system could start to speak as soon as the user has finished speaking, based on the Wizard's actions so far.",
        "Incremental speech generation has been studied from different perspectives.",
        "From a psycholinguistic perspective, Levelt (1989) and others have studied how speakers incrementally produce utterances while self-monitoring the output, both overtly (listening to oneself speaking) and covertly (mentally monitoring what is about to be said).",
        "As deviations from the desired output is detected, the speaker may initiate self-repairs.",
        "If the item to be repaired has already been spoken, an overt repair is needed (for example by using an editing term, such as \"sorry\").",
        "If not, the utterance plan may be altered to accommodate the repair, a so-called covert repair.",
        "Central to the concept of incremental speech generation is that the realization of overt speech can be initiated before the speaker has a complete plan of what to say.",
        "An option for a speaker who does not know what to say (but wants to claim the floor) is to use hesitation phenomena such as filled pauses (\"eh\") or cue phrases such as \"let's see\".",
        "A dialogue system may not need to self-monitor its output for the same reasons as humans do.",
        "For example, there is no risk of articulatory errors (with current speech synthesis technology).",
        "However, a dialogue system may utilize the same mechanisms of self-repair and hesitation phenomena to simultaneously plan and realise the spoken output, as there is always a risk for revision in the input to an incremental module (as described in Section 2.1).",
        "There is also another aspect of self-monitoring that is important for dialogue systems.",
        "In a system with modules operating asynchronously, the dialogue manager cannot know whether the intended output is actually realized, as the user may interrupt the system.",
        "Also, the timing of the synthesized speech is important, as the user may give feedback in the middle of a system utterance.",
        "Thus, an incremental, asynchronous system somehow needs to self-monitor its own output.",
        "From a syntactic perspective, Kempen & Hoenkamp (1987) and Kilger & Finkler (1995) have studied how to syntactically formulate sentences incrementally under time constraints.",
        "Dohsaka & Shimazu (1997) describes a system architecture for incremental speech generation.",
        "However, there is no account for revision of the input (as discussed in Section 2.1) and there is no evaluation with users.",
        "Skantze & Schlangen (2009) describe an incremental system that partly supports incremental output and that is evaluated with users, but the domain is limited to number dictation.",
        "In this study, the focus is not on syntactic construction of utterances, but on how to build practical incremental dialogue systems within limited domains that can handle revisions and produce convincing, flexible and varied speech output in on-line interaction with users."

        "In this model, a system consists of a network of processing modules.",
        "Each module has a left buffer, a processor, and a right buffer, where the normal mode of processing is to receive input from the left buffer, process it, and provide output in the right buffer, from where it is forwarded to the next module's left buffer.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Modules exchange incremental units (IUs), which are the smallest 'chunks' of information that can trigger connected modules into action (such as words, phrases, communicative acts, etc).",
        "IUs are typically part of larger units: individual words are parts of an utterance; concepts are part of the representation of an utterance meaning.",
        "This relation of being part of the same larger unit is recorded through same-level links.",
        "In the example below, IU2 has a same-level link to IUi of type PREDECESSOR, meaning that they are linearly ordered.",

        "As the speech recogniser receives more input, it might need to revise its previous output, which might cause a chain of revisions in all subsequent modules.",
        "To cope with this, modules have to be able to react to three basic situations: that IUs are added to a buffer, which triggers processing; that IUs that were erroneously hypothesized by an earlier module are revoked, which may trigger a revision of a module's own output; and that modules signal that they commit to an IU, that is, won't revoke it anymore.",
        "Jindigo implements an efficient model for communicating these updates.",

        "At each timestep, a new update message is sent to the consuming module.",

        "In order for user and system utterances to be interpreted and produced incrementally, they need to be decomposed into smaller units of processing (IUs).",
        "This decomposition is shown in Figure 3.",
        "Using a standard voice activity detector (VAD) in the ASR, the user's speech is chunked into Utterance-units.",
        "The Utterance boundaries determine when the ASR hypothesis is committed.",
        "However, for the system to be able to respond quickly, the end silence threshold of these Utterances are typically too long.",
        "Therefore smaller units of the type UtteranceSegment (US) are detected, using a much shorter silence threshold of about 50ms.",
        "Such short silence thresholds allow the system to give very fast responses (such as backchannels).",
        "Information about US boundaries is sent directly from the ASR to the Vocalizer.",
        "As Figure 3 illustrates, the grounded-in links can be followed to derive the timing of IUs at different levels of processing.",
        "The system output is also modelled using IUs at different processing levels.",
        "The widest-spanning IU on the output side is the SpeechPlan.",
        "The rendering of a SpeechPlan will result in a sequence of SpeechSegment's, where each SpeechSegment represents a continuous audio rendering of speech, either as a synthesised string or a pre-recorded audio file.",
        "For example, the plan may be to say \"okay, a red doll, here is a nice doll\", consisting of three segments.",
        "Now, there are two requirements that we need to meet.",
        "First, the output should be varied: the system should not give exactly the same response every time to the same request.",
        "But, as we will see, the output in an incremental system must also be flexible, as speech plans are incrementally produced and amended.",
        "In order to relieve the Action Manager of the burden of varying the output and making time-critical adjustments, we model the SpeechPlan as a directed graph, where each edge is associated with a SpeechSegment, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "Thus, the Action Manager may asynchronously plan (a set of possible) responses, while the Vocalizer selects the rendering path in the graph and takes care of time-critical synchronization.",
        "To control the rendering, each SpeechSegment has the properties optional, committing, selfDelay and otherDelay, as described in the next section.",
        "It must also be possible for an incremental system to interrupt and make self-repairs in the middle of a SpeechSegment.",
        "Therefore, each",
        "SpeechSegment may also be decomposed into an array of SpeechUnit's, where each SpeechUnit contains pointers to the audio rendering in the SpeechSegment.",
        "The SpeechPlan does not need to be complete before the system starts to speak.",
        "An example of this is shown in Figure 4.",
        "As more words are recognised by the ASR, the Action Manager may add more SpeechSegment's to the graph.",
        "Thus, the system may start to say \"it costs\" before it knows which object is being talked about.",
        "Figure 4: The right buffer of an ASR (top) and the SpeechPlan that is incrementally produced (bottom).",
        "Vertex s1 is associated with w1, s3 with w3, etc.",
        "Optional, non-committing SpeechSegment's are marked with dashed outline.",
        "The SpeechPlan has a pointer called finalVertex.",
        "When the Vocalizer reaches the finalVertex, the SpeechPlan is completely realised.",
        "If finalVertex is not set, it means that the SpeechPlan is not yet completely constructed.",
        "The SpeechSegment property optional tells whether the segment needs to be realised or if it could be skipped if the finalVertex is in sight.",
        "This makes it possible to insert floor-keeping SpeechSegment's (such as \"eh\") in the graph, which are only realised if needed.",
        "The Vocalizer also keeps track of which SpeechSegment's it has realised before, so that it can look ahead in the graph and realise a more varied output.",
        "Each SpeechSegment may carry a semantic representation of the segment (a Concept).",
        "This is sent by the Vocalizer to the Contextualizer as soon as the segment has been realised.",
        "The SpeechSegment properties selfDelay and otherDelay regulate the timing of the output (as illustrated in Figure 3).",
        "They specify the number of milliseconds that should pass before the Vocalizer starts to play the segment, depending on the previous speaker.",
        "By setting the otherDelay of a segment, the Action Manager may delay the response depending on how certain it is that it is appropriate to speak, for example by considering pitch and semantic completeness.",
        "(See Raux & Eskenazi (2008) for a study on how such dynamic delays can be derived using machine learning.)",
        "If the user starts to speak (i.e., a new UtteranceSegment is initiated) as the system is speaking, the Vocalizer pauses (at a SpeechUnit boundary) and waits until it has received a new response from the Action Manager.",
        "The Action Manager may then choose to generate a new response or simply ignore the last input, in which case the Vocalizer continues from the point of interruption.",
        "This may happen if, for example, the UtteranceSegment was identified as a backchannel, cough, or similar.",
        "As Figure 3 shows, a SpeechPlan may be grounded in a user CA (i.e., it is a response to this CA).",
        "If this CA is revoked, or if the SpeechPlan is revised, the Vocalizer may initialize a self-repair.",
        "The Vocalizer keeps a list of the SpeechSegment's it has realised so far.",
        "If the SpeechPlan is revised when it has been partly realised, the Vocalizer compares the history with the new graph and chooses one of the different repair strategies shown in Table 2.",
        "In the best case, it may smoothly switch to the new plan without the user noticing it (covert repair).",
        "In case of a unit repair, the Vocalizer searches for a zero-crossing point in the audio segment, close to the boundary pointed out by the SpeechUnit.",
        "covert segment repair segment repair",
        "Table 2: Different types of self-repairs.",
        "The shaded boxes show which SpeechUnit's have been realised, or are about to be realised, at the point of revision.",
        "The SpeechSegment property committing tells whether it needs to be repaired if the SpeechPlan is revised.",
        "For example, a filled pause such as \"eh\" is not committing (there is no need to insert an editing term after it), while a request or an assertion usually is.",
        "If (parts of) a committing segment has already been realised and it cannot be part of the new plan, an overt repaired is made with the help of an editing term (e.g., \"sorry\").",
        "When comparing the history with the new graph, the Vocalizer searches the graph and tries to find a path so that it may avoid making an overt repair.",
        "For example if the graph in Figure 4 is replaced with a corresponding one that ends with \"60 crowns\", and it has so far partly realised \"it costs\", it may choose the corresponding path in the new SpeechPlan, making a covert repair."

        "In order to compare the incremental and non-incremental versions of the system, we conducted an experiment with 10 participants, 4 male and 6 female.",
        "The participants were given a mission: to buy three items (with certain characteristics) in DEAL at the best possible price from the shop-keeper.",
        "The participants were further instructed to evaluate two different versions of the system, System A and System B.",
        "However, they were not informed how the versions differed.",
        "The participants were lead to believe that they were interacting with a fully working dialogue system and were not aware of the Wizard-of-Oz set up.",
        "Each participant interacted with the system four times, first two times with each version of the system, after which a questionnaire was completed.",
        "Then they interacted with the two versions again, after which they filled out a second questionnaire with the same questions.",
        "The order of the versions was balanced between subjects.",
        "The mid-experiment questionnaire was used to collect the participants' first opinions of the two versions and to make them aware of what type of characteristics they should consider when interacting with the system the second time.",
        "When filling out the second questionnaire, the participants were asked to base their ratings on their overall experience with the two system versions.",
        "Thus, the analysis of the results is based on the second questionnaire.",
        "In the questionnaires, they were requested to rate which one of the two versions was most prominent according to 8 different dimensions: which version they preferred; which was more human-like, polite, efficient, and intelligent; which gave a faster response and better feedback; and with which version it was easier to know when to speak.",
        "All ratings were done on a continuous horizontal line with System A on the left end and System B on the right end.",
        "The centre of the line was labelled with \"no difference\".",
        "The participants were recorded during their interaction with the system, and all messages in the system were logged.",
        "Figure 7 shows the difference in response time between the two versions.",
        "As expected, the incremental version started to speak more quickly (M=0.58s, SD=1.20) than the non-incremental version (M=2.84s, SD=1.17), while producing longer utterances.",
        "It was harder to anticipate whether it would take more or less time for the incremental version to finish utterances.",
        "Both versions received the final input at the same time.",
        "On the one hand, the incremental version initiates utterances with speech segments that contain little or no semantic information.",
        "Thus, if the system is in the middle of such a segment when receiving the complete input from the Wizard, the system may need to complete this segment before producing the rest of the utterance.",
        "Moreover, if an utterance is initiated and the Wizard alters the input, the incremental version needs to make a repair which takes additional time.",
        "On the other hand, it may also start to produce speech segments that are semantically relevant, based on the incremental input, which allows it to finish the utterance more quickly.",
        "As the figure shows, it turns out that the average response completion time for the incremental version (M=5.02s, SD=1.54) is about 600ms faster than the average for non-incremental version (M=5.66s, SD=1.50), (t(704)=5.56, p<0.001).",
        "start end length",
        "Figure 7: The first two column pairs show the average time from the end of the user's utterance to the start of the system's response, and from the end of the user's utterance to the end of the system's response.",
        "The third column pair shows the average total system utterance length (end minus start).",
        "In general, subjects reported that the system worked very well.",
        "After the first interaction with the two versions, the participants found it hard to point out the difference, as they were focused on solving the task.",
        "The marks on the horizontal continuous lines on the questionnaire were measured with a ruler based on their distance from the midpoint (labelled with \"no difference\") and normalized to a scale from 1 to 1, each extreme representing one system version.",
        "A Wil-coxon Signed Ranks Test was carried out, using these rankings as differences.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "As the table shows, the two versions differed significantly in three dimensions, all in favour of the incremental version.",
        "Hence, the incremental version was rated as more polite, more efficient, and better at indicating when to speak.",
        "Table 4: The results from the second questionnaire.",
        "All differences are positive, meaning that they are in favour of the incremental version.",
        "A well known phenomena in dialogue is that of entrainment (or adaptation or alignment), that is, speakers (in both human-human and humancomputer dialogue) tend to adapt the conversational behaviour to their interlocutor (e.g., Bell, 2003).",
        "In order to examine whether the different versions affected the user's behaviour, we analyzed both the user utterance length and user response time, but found no significant differences between the interactions with the two versions."

        "This paper has presented a first step towards incremental speech generation in dialogue systems.",
        "The results are promising: when there are delays in the processing of the dialogue, it is possible to incrementally produce utterances that make the interaction more efficient and pleasant for the user.",
        "As this is a first step, there are several ways to improve the model.",
        "First, the edges in the SpeechPlan could have probabilities, to guide the path planning.",
        "Second, when the user has finished speaking, it should (in some cases) be possible to anticipate how long it will take until the processing is completed and thereby choose a more optimal path (by taking the length of the SpeechSegment's into consideration).",
        "Third, a lot of work could be done on the dynamic generation of SpeechSegment's, considering syntactic and pragmatic constraints, although this would require a speech synthesizer that was better at convincingly produce conversational speech.",
        "The experiment also shows that it is possible to achieve fast turn-taking and convincing responses in a Wizard-of-Oz setting.",
        "We think that this opens up new possibilities for the Wizard-of-",
        "Oz paradigm, and thereby for practical development of dialogue systems in general."
