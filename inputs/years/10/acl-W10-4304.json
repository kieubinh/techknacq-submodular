        "This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting user satisfaction transitions during a dialogue only from the ratings given to entire dialogues, with the aim of reducing the cost of creating reference ratings for utterances/dialogue-acts that have been necessary in conventional approaches.",
        "In our approach, we first train hidden Markov models (HMMs) of dialogue-act sequences associated with each overall rating.",
        "Then, we combine such rating-related HMMs into a single HMM to decode a sequence of dialogue-acts into state sequences representing to which overall rating each dialogue-act is most related, which leads to our rating predictions.",
        "Experimental results in two dialogue domains show that our approach can make reasonable predictions; it significantly outperforms a baseline and nears the upper bound of a supervised approach in some evaluation criteria.",
        "We also show that introducing states that represent dialogue-act sequences that occur commonly in all ratings into an HMM significantly improves prediction accuracy."

        "In recent years, there has been intensive work on the automatic evaluation of dialogues (Walker et al., 1997; Moller et al., 2008).",
        "Automatic evaluation makes it possible to predict the performance of dialogue systems without the costly process of performing surveys with human subjects, leading to a rapid improvement cycle for dialogue systems.",
        "It is also useful for detecting problematic situations in an ongoing dialogue (Walker et al., 2002; Herm et al., 2008; Kim, 2007).",
        "In these studies, the typical approach is to train a prediction model, such as a regression or classification model, using features representing the whole or a part of a dialogue together with human reference labels (e.g., reference ratings).",
        "However, creating such reference labels by hand can be extremely costly when we want to predict user satisfaction transitions during a dialogue because we need to create reference labels after each utterance/dialogue-act in the training data (Engelbrecht et al., 2009).",
        "This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting user satisfaction transitions during a dialogue only from the dialogues with overall ratings.",
        "The approach makes it possible to avoid creating reference labels for utterances/dialogue-acts and only requires a single reference label for each dialogue.",
        "More specifically, we predict the user satisfaction rating after each dialogue-act in a dialogue only by using dialogues with dialogue-level (overall) user satisfaction ratings as training data.",
        "Our basic approach is to train hidden Markov models (HMMs) of dialogue-act sequences associated with each overall rating and combine such rating-related HMMs into a single HMM.",
        "We use this combined HMM to decode a sequence of dialogue-acts by the Viterbi algorithm (Rabiner, 1990) into state sequences that indicate from which rating-related HMM each dialogue-act is most likely to have been generated, leading to our rating predictions for the dialogue-acts.",
        "This paper experimentally examines the validity of our approach and explores several model topologies for possible improvement.",

        "Our basic idea is to train HMMs representing dialogue-act sequences of dialogues for each overall rating and combine these rating-related HMMs into a single HMM that can assign ratings for dialogue-acts by estimating from which HMM each dialogue-act has most likely to have been generated by the Viterbi decoding.",
        "We use HMMs because they can deal with sequences that evolve over time and have been successfully utilized to model and evaluate dialogue-act sequences (Shi-rai, 1996; Isomura et al., 2009; Engelbrecht et al., 2009).",
        "The generative feature of an HMM is also useful when we want to build a probabilistic dialogue manager that produces the most likely dialogue-act sequences (Hori et al., 2008) or that aims to maximize a reward function in partially observable Markov decision processes (Williams and Young, 2007; Minami et al., 2009).",
        "When there are K levels of user satisfaction as overall ratings, we create K HMMs each of which is trained using the dialogue-act sequences in dialogues Dk c D,where Dk = {\\/di, \\r(di)= k}.",
        "We use the EM-algorithm to train HMMs.",
        "Here, we assume that each HMM has two states, each of which emits dialogue-acts of one of the conversational participants.",
        "This type of HMM is called a speaker HMM (SHMM) and has been successfully utilized to model two-party conversation (Meguro et al., 2009).",
        "As an illustrative example, Fig. 1 shows two SHMMs for ratings 1 and 2 that are connected ergodically.",
        "We can simply use these connected SHMMs (namely, states 1, 2, 3, and 4) to decode a sequence of dialogue-acts into state sequences and thereby obtain rating predictions.",
        "For example, if the optimal state sequence obtained by the Viterbi decoding is {4, 2, 1, 3, 2}, we can convert it into ratings <2, 1,1,2, 1> using the ratings associated with the states.",
        "Figure 2: SHMMs with an additional SHMM trained from all dialogues.",
        "Introducing Common States: The simple ergodic model may not be sufficient for appropriately assigning ratings to input dialogue-act sequences because it is often the case that there are dialogue-act sequences, such as greetings and question-answer pairs, that commonly occur in every dialogue.",
        "If we forcefully assign a rating for such dialogue-act sequences, it may result in degrading the prediction accuracy.",
        "Therefore, in addition to the simple ergodic model, we introduce another SHMM that represents dialogue-act sequences of dialogues for all ratings (see Fig. 2).",
        "This additional SHMM models dialogue-act sequences that occur commonly in all dialogues and it can simply be trained using all dialogues.",
        "Hence, we call the states in this SHMM common states.",
        "When this SHMM is added to the ergodic model, it may be possible to reduce the possibility of our having to forcefully assign inappropriate scores to common dialogue-act sequences.",
        "In this model, when the optimal state sequence is {1,4, 5, 6, 2}, the predicted ratings become <1, 2, 0, 0, 1>.",
        "Here, we assume that the SHMM for all ratings corresponds to rating 0, which is reasonable because common dialogue-acts should not affect ratings.",
        "The obtained ratings can also be interpreted as < 1, 2, 2, 2, 1 > when we assume that the rating of a dialogue-act is taken over from the previous turn.",
        "Using Concatenated Training: We have so far presented two model topologies, one with K SHMMs connected ergodically and the other with K + 1 SHMMs having an additional SHMM representing all ratings.",
        "However, we still have a problem; that is, we need to find optimal transition probabilities between the SHMMs ofdifferent ratings.",
        "Our solution is to use concatenated training (Lee, 1989).",
        "The procedure for concatenated training is illustrated in Fig. 3 and has the following three steps.",

        "JRatingsJ \\j Train",
        "{Vdi\\r(di) = k},and an SHMM M0 using all dialogues; i.e., D. Here, K means the maximum level of user satisfaction and r(di) the rating assigned to di.",

        "step 3 Merge all models Mk+0 (1 < k < K) to produce one concatenated HMM (Mcancat ).",
        "Here, the output probabilities of the copies of M0 are averaged over K when all models are merged to create a combined model.",
        "If the fitting of all Mk+0 models has converged against the training data, exit this procedure; otherwise, go to step 2 by connecting a copy of M0 and Mk for all k. Here, the transition probabilities from M0 to Mi (l = k) are summed and equally distributed between the copied M0's self-loop and transitions to the states in Mk.",
        "In concatenated training, the transition and output probabilities can be optimized between M0and Mk, meaning that the output probabilities of dialogue-act sequences that are common and also found in Mk can be moved from Mk to M0.",
        "This makes the distribution of Mk sharp (not broad/uniform), making it likely to output only the dialogue-acts specific to a rating k.As regards M0, its distribution of output probabilities can also be sharpened for dialogue-acts that occur commonly in all ratings.",
        "This sharpening of distributions is likely to be helpful in assigning appropriate ratings to dialogue-act sequences.",

        "For example, rating 1 in human-human dialogue is quite rare; however, predicting it is very important for detecting problematic situations in a dialogue.",

        "where K is the maximum user satisfaction rating (i.e. 7 in this experiment), R and H denote the sequentially concatenated reference/hypothesis rating sequences of the entire dialogues, and P(*,r) denotes the occurrence probability that a rating r is found in an arbitrary rating sequence.",
        "• Match Rate per rating (MR/r)",
        "Table 1: The match rate (MR), mean absolute error (MAE), Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL), match rate per rating (MR/r) and mean absolute error per rating (MAE/r) for our proposed HMMs, the random baseline, and the upper bound (supervised) for the AD domain.",
        "'e0-e2', 'c1-c2', and 'r' indicate the statistical significance (p<0.01) over ergodic0-2, concatl-2, and random, respectively.",
        "Bold font indicates the best value within each row (except for 'supervised').",
        "where Ri and Hi denote ratings at i-th positions.",
        "• Mean Absolute Error per rating (MAE/r)",
        "Tables 1 and 2 show the evaluation results for the AD and AL domains, respectively.",
        "The MR and MAE values are averaged over all dialogues.",
        "To compare the means of the MR and MAE, we performed a non-parametric multiple comparison test [Steel-Dwass test (Dwass, I960)].",
        "We did notperform a statistical test for other criteria because it was difficult to perform sample-wise comparison for distributions.",
        "Naturally, 'supervised' is the best performing model for all criteria in both domains.",
        "Therefore, we focus on how much our proposed models differ from the baseline (random) and the upper bound (supervised).",
        "In the AD domain, we find that ergodic0 and er-godic1 performed rather poorly and concat1 and concat2 performed fairly well, significantly outperforming the random baseline.",
        "However, it is also clear that we still need a great deal of improvement for our models to reach the level of 'supervised'.",
        "A promising sign is that concat2 is not significantly different from 'supervised' in smoothness.",
        "Here, ergodic0 and ergodic1 returned the exact same results.",
        "This means that the state transition paths did not go through the common states at all in ergodic1, suggesting that the common states in ergodic1 have very broad output distributions and the optimal path could not go through the common states, instead preferring other states having sharper distributions.",
        "However, this phenomenon was rightly avoided by introducing more common states as seen in the results for ergodic2; nonetheless, as the results for concat1 and concat2 indicate, the transition probabilities have to be trained appropriately to obtain better results.",
        "In the AL domain, although the tendency of the evaluation results is the same as that for the AD domain, concat2 is clearly the best performing model.",
        "It outperformed other models in almost all cases except for \"Good Listener\" for which concat1 performed better.",
        "In fact, the MR/r and MAE/r of concatl are quite close to those of 'supervised', suggesting the potential of our approach.",
        "Overall, although we still need further improvement in order for our models to be closer to the upper bound, we showed that we can, to some extent, predict user satisfaction transitions in a dialogue only from overall ratings of dialogues using our proposed HMMs.",
        "We also showed that model topologies and learning methods can make significant differences.",
        "Especially, we found the introduction of common states to be crucial in making appropriate models for prediction.",
        "Since our models, especially concat2, significantly outperformed the baseline, we believe that our approach can be one of the viable options for automatically predicting user satisfaction transitions when there exist only overall rating data."
