        "Since B's calculations are based on mentions, singletons are taken into account.",
        "However, a problematic issue arises when system mentions have to be dealt with: B assumes the mentions in the key and in the response to be identical.",

        "This is due to the credit Ball takes from unresolved singleton twinless system mentions (i.e. mention i, j, k in System 2).",
        "Since the metric is expected to evaluate the end-to-end coreference system performance rather than the mention tagging quality, it is not satisfying to observe that Ball s numbers actually fluctuate when the system is exposed to different mention taggers.",

        "While it avoids the problem with singleton twinless system mentions, B3&n still suffers from the problem dealing with twinless key mentions, as illustrated in Table 2.",

        "We put all twinless key mentions into the response as singletons which enables Bsys to penalize non-resolved coreferent key mentions without penalizing non-resolved singleton key mentions, and also avoids the problem Balland B&n have as shown in Table 2.",
        "All twinless system mentions which were deemed not coref-erent (hence being singletons) are discarded.",
        "To calculate Bsys precision, all twinless system mentions which were mistakenly resolved are put into the key since they are spurious resolutions (equivalent to the assignment operations in Ball), which should be penalized by precision.",
