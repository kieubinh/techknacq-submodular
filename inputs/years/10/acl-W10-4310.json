        "We aim to investigate the association between discourse relations and the way in which references to entities are realized.",
        "In our work, we employ features related to entity realization to automatically identify discourse relations in text.",
        "We focus on implicit relations that hold between adjacent sentences in the absence of discourse connectives such as \"because\" or \"but\".",
        "Previous studies on this task have zeroed in on lexical indicators of relation sense: dependencies between words (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; BlairGoldensohn et al., 2007) and the semantic orientation of words (Pitler et al., 2009), or on general syntactic regularities (Lin et al., 2009).",
        "The role of entities has also been hypothesized as important for this task and entity-related features have been used alongside others (Corston-Oliver, 1998; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008).",
        "Corpus studies and reading time experiments performed by Wolf and Gibson (2006) have in fact demonstrated that the type of discourse relation linking two clauses influences the resolution of pronouns in them.",
        "However, the predictive power of entity-related features has not been studied independently of other factors.",
        "Further motivation for studying this type of features comes from new corpus evidence (Prasad et al., 2008), that about a quarter of all adjacent sentences are linked purely by entity coherence, solely because they talk about the same entity.",
        "Entity-related features would be expected to better separate out such relations.",
        "We present the first comprehensive study of the connection between entity features and discourse relations.",
        "We show that there are notable differences in properties of referring expressions across the different relations.",
        "Sense prediction can be done with results better than random baseline using only entity realization information.",
        "Their performance, however, is lower than a knowledge-poor approach using only the words in the sentences as features.",
        "The addition of entity features to these basic word features is also not beneficial.",
