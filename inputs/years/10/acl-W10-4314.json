        "A recent series of shared task evaluation challenges proposed a framework with standardized sets of temporal analysis tasks, including identifying the temporal entities mentioned in text, such as events and time expressions, as well as identifying the temporal relations that hold between those temporal entities (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009).",

        "A preliminary evaluation showed the effectiveness of our approach.",
        "In this paper, we extend our previous work and conduct a more rigorous evaluation, focusing on the impact of joint optimization of the features and the effectiveness of the lexical relation features for modeling temporal relations."

        "To isolate the potential effects of global constraints, we first compare the accuracies of the Full and the NoLex model, averaged from a tenfold cross validation on the training data before global constraints are added.",
        "Full achieves relative 12% and 3% improvements over NoLex for temporal relation between events and time expressions (ET) and between two main events (MM), respectively.",
        "The improvement for MM was statistically significant (p<0.05) from a two-tailed paired t-test.",
