        "The reference task in a dialogue system is two-fold.",
        "On the one hand the system has to interpret the referring expressions (RE) produced by the user in his utterances.",
        "On the other hand the system has to generate the REs for the objects it aims to refer to.",
        "We present in this paper a framework that considers that reference interpretation and generation are two sides of the same coin, hence avoiding any potential misunderstanding arising from the two modules discrepancies.",
        "Reference Domain Theory (RDT) (Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2000; Salmon-Alt and Romary, 2001) proposes to represent the diversity of referring acts by the diversity of constraints they impose on their context of use.",
        "The reversibility then lies in the possibility to express these constraints independently of the considered task.",
        "In (Denis, 2010) we described the generation side of RDT in the context of the GIVE-2 challenge (Koller et al., 2010) which is an evaluation of instruction generation systems in a 3D maze.",
        "In this paper we propose the interpretation counterpart and show the required modeling to consider the dynamic, asymmetric and multimodal context of GIVE.",
        "We first present the reference model in section 2 and 3, discuss the interpretation problems in GIVE in section 4, detail an example in section 5 and present evaluation results in section 6."

        "A rich contextual structure is required to give an account for the different kinds of discrimination we observe in REs such as semantic discrimination (e.g. \"the blue button\"), focus discrimination (e.g. \"this button\") and salience discrimination (e.g. \"this one\").",
        "We introduce here the structure of reference domain which is a local context supporting these different discriminations.",
        "We assume that Props is the set of unary predicate names e.g. {blue, left,...}, Types is the set of types of predicates e.g. {color, position, ...}, and val is the function val : Types – 2Props which maps a type on the predicates names.",
        "Finally, E is the set of all objects and V the set of ground predicates e.g. {blue(b1),...}.",
        "A reference domain D is then a tuple",
        "where GD Ç E is the set of objects of the domain, called the ground of the domain ; SD Ç Props is the semantic description of the domain, satisfied by all elements of the ground; <rD G N is the salience of the domain.",

        "A RE impose some constraints on the context in which it can be uttered, that is in which RD the interpretation has to be made.",
        "The constraints are represented as underspecified domains (UD), specifying the structure of the suitable RD in terms of ground, salience or partition.",
        "The explicit definitions of the UDs makes possible to share these definitions between the interpretation and the generation modules, hence allowing the implementation of a type B reversible reference module (Klarner, 2005), that is a module in which both directions share the same resources.",
        "The different types of UDs are presented in table 1.",
        "Each UD is a parametric conjunction of constraints on a RD, noted U(N,t), where t is the intended referent and N Ç Props is a semantic description.",
        "N stands for the extension of N, and msd(D) stands for most salient description, that is, there is no more or equally salient domain than D in the current RS with a different description.",
        "Each UD is associated to a wording combining a determiner and a wording of the semantic description, for instance \"the N\" is a shortcut for a definite expression whose head noun and modifiers are provided by the wording of N. Finally we say that an UD matches a RD if all the constraints of the UD are satisfied by the RD.",
        "Interpretation and generation can now be defined in terms of UD.",
        "The two processes are illustrated in figure 1 and the algorithms are presented in figure 2.",
        "The interpretation algorithm consists in finding or creating a RD from the input UD, U(N,.)",
        "created from the input RE type and description N. The algorithm then iterates through the RS in salience order, and through all the individuals t of the tested domain to retrieve the first one matching U(N, t).",
        "If a matching domain D is found, a restructuring operation is applied and the referent t is focused in the partition of D. On the other hand, if no domain is found, the UD is accommodated, that is a new domain and a new referent satisfying the constraints of U(N, t) are created.",
        "According to the task, this accommodation may not be possible for all REs, but for sake of simplicity we assume here this operation is always possible.",
        "The generation side is the opposite, that is it finds an UD from an input RD.",
        "It first selects a RD containing the target referent to generate t, assuming here that the most salient domain has to be preferred.",
        "The description N used to instantiate the UDs is composed of the description of the domain and the description of the referent in the partition (line 2).",
        "It then iterates through the",

        "different UDs by Givenness order (Gundel et al., 1993) and selects the first one that matches.",
        "A restructuring operation is applied and the found UD is returned, eventually providing the RE.",
        "The restructuring operation, detailed in (Denis, 2010), aims to restrict the current context by creating a new domain around the referent in the referential space or by increasing the salience of the domain containg the referent.",

        "Following (DeVault and Stone, 2007), these alternative contexts can persist across time and further referring expressions may reject one or the other hypothesis as illustrated in section 5.",
        "The second required mechanism is the proper handling of the multimodal dynamic focus, that is the combination of the linguistic focus resulting from RE, and the visual focus.",
        "It is possible to have two referential spaces for the linguistic or visual context as in (Kelleher et al., 2005; Byron et al., 2005), or to have two foci in a partition.",
        "We can also model interleaved focus, that is, only one focus per domain but that dynamically corresponds to the linguistic focus or the visual focus.",
        "The idea is that after each RE, the referent receives the focus as described in algorithm 1, but whenever the visual context changes, the focus is updated to the visible objects.",
