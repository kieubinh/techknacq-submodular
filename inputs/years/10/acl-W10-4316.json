        "When a feature-specific query utterance is submitted by a user (as exemplified in Figure 3), our linguistic parser will generate a hierarchical structure for the utterance, which encodes the syntactic and semantic structure of the utterance and, especially, identifies the feature-related topics.",
        "A feature-specific key-value pair (e.g., \"specialty: martinis\") is then created from the hierarchical parsing structure, with which the system can filter the database and retrieve the entities that satisfy the constraints.",

        "In previous work (Liu and Seneff, 2009), we proposed a method for calculating a sentiment score for each opinion-expressing adjective or adverb (e.g., 'bad': 1.5, 'good': 3.5, 'great': 4.0, on a scale of 1 to 5).",

        "After corresponding entities are retrieved from the database based on the user's query, the language generation component will create recommendations by expanding the summary lists of the retrieved database entries into natural language utterances.",
        "Most spoken dialogue systems use predefined templates to generate responses.",
        "However, manually defining templates for each specific linguistic pattern is tedious and non-scalable.",
        "For example, given a restaurant with \"nice jazz music, best breakfast spot, great vibes\", three templates have to be edited for three different topics (e.g., \"<restaurant> plays <adjective> music\"; '^restaurant is <adjective> breakfast spot\"; \"<restaurant> has <adjective> vibes\").",
        "To avoid the human effort involved in the task, corpus-based approaches (Oh and Rudnicky, 2000; Rambow et al., 2001) have been developed for more efficient language generation.",
        "In this paper, we propose a corpus-based probabilistic approach which can automatically learn the linguistic patterns (e.g., predicate-topic relationships) from a corpus and generate natural sentences by probabilistically selecting the best-matching pattern for each topic.",
        "The proposed approach consists of three stages: 1) plant seed topics in the context-free grammar; 2) identify semantic structures associated with the seeds; 3) extract association pairs of linguistic patterns and the seeds, and calculate the probability of each association pair.",
        "First, we extract all the nouns and noun phrases that occur in the review summaries as the seeds.",
        "As aforementioned, our context-free grammar can parse each sentence into a hierarchical structure.",
        "We modify the grammar such that, when parsing a sentence which contains one of these seed topics, the parser can identify the seed as an \"active\" topic (e.g., \"vibes\", \"jazz music\", and \"breakfast spot\").",
        "The second stage is to automatically identify all the linguistic patterns associated with each seed.",
        "To do so, we use a large corpus as the resource pool and parse each sentence in the corpus for linguistic analysis.",
        "We modify our parser such that, in a preprocessing step, the predicate and clause structures that are semantically related to the seeds will be assigned with identifiable tags.",
        "For example, if the subject or the complement of the clause (or the object of the predicate) is an \"active\" topic (i.e., a seed), an \"active\" tag will be automatically assigned to the clause (or the predicate).",
        "In this way, when examining syntactic hierarchy of each sentence in the corpus, the system can encode all the linguistic patterns of clauses or predicate-topic relationships associated with the seeds with \"active\" tags.",
        "Based on these tags, association pairs of \"active\" linguistic patterns and \"active\" topics can be extracted automatically.",
        "For each seed topic, we calculate the probability of its co-occurrence with each of its associated patterns by:",
        "v J ' J Xicount(Patterni> see^ k)",
        "every linguistic pattern associated with .",
        "The probability of for is the percentage of the co-occurrences of and among all the occurrences of in the corpus.",
        "This is similar to a bigram language model.",
        "A major difference is that the linguistic pattern is not necessarily the word adjacent to the seed.",
        "It can be a long distance from the seed with strong semantic dependencies, and it can be a semantic chunk of multiple words.",
        "The long distance semantic relationships are captured by our linguistic parser and its hierarchical encoding structure; thus, it is more reliable than pure co-occurrence statistics or bigrams.",
        "Figure 5 shows some probabilities learned from a review corpus.",
        "For example, \"is\" has the highest probability (0.57) among all the predicates that co-occur with \"breakfast spot\"; while \"have\" is the best-match for \"jazz music\".",
        "Figure 5.",
        "Partial table of probabilities of association pairs (VP: verb phrase; PP: preposition phrase).",
        "Given these probabilities, we can define pattern selection algorithms (e.g., always select the pattern with the highest probability for each topic; or rotates among different patterns from high to low probabilities), and generate response utterances based on the selected patterns.",
        "The only domain-dependent part of this approach is the selection of the seeds.",
        "The other steps all depend on generic linguistic structures and are domain-independent.",
        "Thus, this probabilistic method can be easily applied to generic domains for customizing language generation."
