        "Conversational systems can be classified into two distinct classes: goal-directed and casual chatting.",
        "For goal-directed systems, the system is usually more \"knowledgeable\" than the user, and it attempts to satisfy user-specified goals.",
        "The system's conversational strategies seek the most efficient path to reach closure and end the conversation (Smith, Hipp, & Biermann, 1995).",
        "An essential commonality among different goal-directed applications is that, at the end of a successful conversation, the system presents the user with a \"goal\" entity, be it a flight itinerary, a route path, or a shopping order.",
        "Different conversations result from different properties of the goal entities and different constraints set by the knowledge sources.",
        "The properties define the necessary and/or relevant information, such as flight numbers in the flight itinerary.",
        "Constraints specify the means to obtain such information.",
        "For examples fields \"source\", \"destination\" and \"date\" are required to search for a flight.",
        "Once the properties and constraints are known, dialogue rules can easily map to dialogue actions.",
        "This paper introduces a dialogue management framework for goal-directed conversation based on entity and knowledge source specification.",
        "The user is viewed as a collaborator with the dialogue manager, instead of a problem-raiser.",
        "The dialogue manager follows a set of definitions and constraints, and eventually realizes the goal entity.",
        "It also incorporates a simple statistical engine to handle certain decisions."

        "In recent years, statistical methods have gained popularity in dialogue system research.",
        "Partially Observable Markov decision processes have been the focus of a number of papers (Levin, Pieraccini, & Eckert, 1997; Scheffler & Young, 2001; Frampton & Lemon, 2006; Williams & Young, 2007).",
        "These approaches turn the dialogue interaction strategy into an optimization problem.",
        "The dialogue manager selects actions prescribed by the policy that maximizes the reward function (Lemon & Pietquin, 2007).",
        "This machine learning formulation of the problem automates system development, thus freeing the developers from hand-coded rules.",
        "Other researchers have continued research on rule-based frameworks, in part because they are easier to control and maintain.",
        "One common approach is to allow developers to specify the tasks, either using a conditioned sequential script (Zue, et al., 2000; Seneff, 2002), or using a task hierarchy (Hochberg, Kambhatla, & Roukos, 2002).",
        "In (Bohus & Rudnicky, 2003)'s work, a tree of dialogue agents, each of which handles different dialogue actions, is specified to control the dialogue progress.",
        "The knowledge has also been specified either by first order logic (Bühler & Minker, 2005) or ontology information (Milward & Beveridge, 2004)."

        "Each KS handles one or more sub-domains.",
        "For example, a date/time KS can resolve a date expression such as \"next Tuesday\" to a unique date; a flight database can provide flight information.",
        "The KSes are provided by the developer.",
        "They can be local (a library) or external (a separate executable).",
        "Within this architecture, the user is viewed as a special KS, who understands and speaks a natural language, so that the whole architecture is completely DM-centered, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "An external language understanding system parses the original input into an E-form, and an external language generation component converts the output E-form into the desired natural language.",
        "Each particular communication with the user is analogous to other communications with the various KSes.",

        "If no other KS can provide the information, the DM asks the user for the departure city.",
        "Our framework uses an entity-based declarative domain specification.",
        "Instead of providing the action sequence in the domain, the developer provides the desired form of the goal entity, and the relationships among all relevant entities.",
        "The specification is decomposed into two parts.",
        "The first part is the declaration of the knowledge sources.",
        "Each KS may contain one or more subdomains, and an associated \"nation\" defines the language processing parameters.",
        "The second part is the entity type definition.",
        "For a particular domain, there is one goal entity type, and an arbitrary number of other entity types, e.g., two entity types are defined in the flight reservation system: \"itinerary\" and \"flight.\"",
        "The definition of an entity type consists of a set of members, including their names, types and knowledge domain.",
        "A logical expression states the conditions under which the entity can be regarded as completed; e.g., a completed itinerary must contain one or more flights.",
        "The entity definition can also include optional elements such as comparative/superlative modifiers or customized command-action and task-action mappings, described in more detail later.",
        "The entity-based specification has an advantage over an action-based specification in two aspects.",
        "First, it is easier to define all the entities in a dialogue domain than to list all the possible actions, so the specification is more compact and readable.",
