        "In spoken dialogue systems research, modelling dialogue as a (Partially Observable) Markov Decision Process ((PO)MDP) and using reinforcement learning techniques for optimising dialogue policies has proven to be an effective method for developing robust systems (Singh et al., 2000; Levin et al., 2000).",
        "However, since this kind of optimisation requires a simulated user to generate a sufficiently large number of interactions to learn from, this effectiveness depends largely on the quality of such a user simulator.",
        "An important requirement for a simulator is for it to be realistic, i.e., it should generate behaviour that is similar to that of real users.",
        "Trained policies are then more likely to perform better on real users, and evaluation results on simulated data are more likely to predict results on real data more accurately.",
        "* This research was partly funded by the UK EPSRC under grant agreement EP/F013930/1 and by the EU FP7 Programme under grant agreement 216594 (CLASSiC project: www.classic-project.org).",
        "This is one of the reasons why learning user simulation models from data on real user behaviour has become an important direction of research (Scheffler and Young, 2001; Cuayahuitl et al., 2005; Georgila et al., 2006).",
        "However, the data driven user models developed so far lack the complexity required for training high quality policies in task domains where user behaviour is relatively complex.",
        "Handcrafted models are still the most effective in those cases.",
        "This paper presents an agenda-based user simulator which is handcrafted for a large part, but additionally can be trained with data from real users (Section 2).",
        "As a result, it generates behaviour that better reflects the statistics of real user behaviour, whilst preserving the complexity and rationality required to effectively train dialogue management policies.",
        "The trainable part is formed by a set of random decision points, which, depending on the context, may or may not be encountered during the process of receiving a system act and deciding on a response act.",
        "If such a point is encountered, the simulator makes a random decision between a number of options which may directly or indirectly influence the resulting output.",
        "The options for each random decision point are reasonable in the context in which it is encountered, but a uniform distribution of outcomes might not reflect real user behaviour.",
        "We will describe a sample-based method for estimating the parameters that define the probabilities for each possible decision, using data on real users from a corpus of human-machine dialogues (Section 3).",

        "formation application, but is sufficiently generic to accommodate slot-filling applications in any do-main.",
        "The user goal consists ofthe type ofvenue, for example hotel, bar or restaurant, a list of constraints in the form of slot value pairs, such as food=Italian or area=east, and a list of slots the user wants to know the value of, such as the address (addr), phone number (phone), or price information (price) of the venue.",
        "The user goals for the simulator are randomly generated from the domain ontology describing which combinations of venue types and constraints are allowed and what are the possible values for each slot.",
        "The agenda is a stack-like structure containing planned user acts.",
        "When the simulator receives a system act, the status of the user goal is updated as well as the agenda, typically by pushing new acts onto it.",
        "In a separate step, the response user act is selected by popping one or more items off the agenda.",
        "Although the agenda-based user simulator introduced by Schatzmann et al.",
        "(2007a) was entirely handcrafted, it was realistic enough to successfully test a prototype POMDP dialogue manager and train a dialogue policy that outperformed a handcrafted baseline (Young et al., 2009).",
        "A method to train an agenda-based user simulator from data was proposed by Schatzmann et al.",
        "(2007b).",
        "In this approach, operations on the agenda are controlled by probabilities learned from data using a variation of the EM algorithm.",
        "However, this approach does not readily scale to more complex interactions in which users can, for example, change their goal midway through a dialogue.",
        "Each time the user simulator receives a system act, a complex, twofold process takes place involving several decisions, made on the basis of both the nature of the incoming system act and the information state of the user, i.e., the status of the user goal and agenda.",
        "The first phase can be seen as an information state update and involves actions like filling requested slots or checking whether the provided information is consistent with the user goal constraints.",
        "In the second phase, the user decides which response act to generate, based on the updated agenda.",
        "Many of the decisions involved are deterministic, allowing only one possible option given the context.",
        "Other decisions allow for some degree of variation in the user behaviour and are governed by probability distributions over the options allowed in that context.",
        "For example, if the system has offered a venue that matches the user's goal, the user can randomly decide to either change his goal or to accept the venue and ask for additional information such as the phone number.",
        "The non-deterministic part of the simulator is formalised in terms of a set of random decision points (RDPs) embedded in the decision process.",
        "If an RDP is encountered (depending on the context), a random choice between the options defined for that point is made by sampling from a probability distribution.",
        "Most of the RDPs are controlled by a multinomial distribution, such as deciding whether or not to change the goal after a system offer.",
        "Some RDPs are controlled by a geometric distribution, like in the case where the user is planning to specify one of his constraints (with an inform act popped from the agenda) and then repeatedly adds an additional constraint to the act (by combining it with an additional inform act popped from the agenda) until it randomly decides not to add any more constraints (or runs out of constraints to specify).",
        "The parameter for this distribution thus controls how cautious the user is in providing information to the system.",
        "Hence, the user simulator can be viewed as a 'decision network', consisting of deterministic and random decision points.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 1 for the simplified case of a network with only four RDPs; the actual simulator has 23 RDPs, with 27 associated parameters in total.",
        "Each time the simulator receives a system act, it follows a path through the network, which is partly determined by that system act and the user goal and agenda, and partly by random decisions made according to the probability distributions for each random decision point i given by its parameters"

        "The parameterisation of the user simulator as described in Section 2.1 forms the basis for a method for training the simulator with real user data.",
        "The parameters describing the probability distributions for each RDP are estimated in order to generate user behaviour that fits the user behaviour in the corpus as closely as possible.",
        "In order to do so, a sample based maximum likelihood approach is taken, in which the simulator is run repeatedly against the system acts in the corpus, and the random decisions that lead to simulated acts matching the true act in the corpus are recorded.",
        "The parameters are then estimated using the counts for each of the random decision points.",
        "Figure 1: User simulator viewed as a 'decision network': square nodes indicate deterministic decision points; round nodes indicate random decision points, and have associated parameters Oi; the loop on one of the nodes indicates it has a geometric distribution associated with it.",
        "Before starting the process of matching simulated acts with true acts and collecting counts for the RDPs, the parameters are initialised to values corresponding to uniform distributions.",
        "Then, the simulator is run against all dialogues in the corpus in such a way that for each turn in a dialogue (consisting of a system act and a user act), the user simulator is provided with the system act and is run repeatedly to generate several simulated user response acts for that turn.",
        "For the first turn of a dialogue, the simulator is initialised with the correct user state (see Section 3.2).",
        "For each response, the simulator may make different random decisions, generally leading to different user acts.",
        "The decisions that lead to a simulated act that matches the true act are recorded as successful.",
        "By generating a sufficiently large number of simulated acts, all possible combinations of decisions are explored to find a matching act.",
        "Given the high complexity of the simulator, this sampling approach is preferred over directly enumerating all decision combinations to identify the successful ones.",
        "If none of the combinations are successful, then either a) the processing of the dialogue is ended, or b) the correct context is set for the next turn and processing is continued.",
        "Whereas the former approach aims at matching sequences of turns, the latter only aims at matching each user turn separately.",
        "In either case, after all data is processed, the parameters are estimated using the resulting counts of successful decisions for each of the RDPs.",
        "For each RDP i, let DPi represent the decision taken, and dij the j 'th possible decision.",

        "c{DPl = djj)",
        "Random decision points that are controlled by geometric distributions involve potentially multiple random decisions between two options (Bernoulli trials).",

        "where bik is the number of Bernoulli trials required at the k'th time decision point i was encountered.",
        "In terms of the decision network, this estimate is correlated with the average number of times the loop of the node was taken.",
        "In order to be able to set the correct user goal state in any given turn, a set of update rules is used to infer the user's goals from a dialogue beforehand, on the basis of the entire sequence of system acts and 'true' user acts (see Section 4.1) in the corpus.",
        "These update rules are based on the notion of dialogue act preconditions, which specify conditions of the dialogue context that must hold for a dialogue agent to perform that act.",
        "For example, a precondition for the act inform(area=central) is that the speaker wants a venue in the centre.",
        "The user act model of the HIS dialogue manager is designed according to this same notion (Keizer et al., 2008).",
        "In this model, the probability of a user act in a certain dialogue context (the last system act and a hypothesis regarding the user goal) is determined by checking the consistency of its preconditions with that context.",
        "This contributes to updating the system's belief state on the basis of which it determines its response action.",
        "For the user goal inference model, the user act is given and therefore its preconditions can be used to directly infer the user goal.",
        "So, for example, in the case of observing the user act inform(area=central ), the constraint (area=central ) is added to the user goal.",
        "In addition to using the inferred user goals, the agenda is corrected in cases where there is a mismatch between real and simulated user acts in the previous turn.",
        "In using this offline goal inference model, our approach takes a position between (Schatzmann et al., 2007b), in which the user's goal is treated as hidden, and (Georgila et al., 2006), in which the user's goal is obtained directly from the corpus annotation."

        "In the evaluation, the following parameter settings were compared: 1) non-informative, uniform parameters (UNIF); 2) handcrafted parameters (HDC); 3) parameters estimated from data (TRA); and 4) deterministic parameters (DET), in which for each RDP the probability of the most probable decision according to the estimated parameters is set to 1, i.e., at all times, the most likely decision according to the estimated parameters is chosen.",
        "For both trained and deterministic parameters, a distinction is made between the two approaches to matching user acts during parameter estimation.",
        "Recall that in the turn-based approach, in each turn, the simulator is run with the corrected context to find a matching simulated act, whereas in the sequence-based approach, the matching process for a dialogue is stopped in case a turn is encountered which cannot be matched by the simulator.",

        "There is little difference in performance between policies POL-TRA1 and POL-TRA2, which can be explained by the fact that the two trained parameter settings are quite similar, in contrast to the handcrafted parameters.",
        "The policy that was trained on the deterministic parameters (POL-DET) is competitive with the other policies when evaluated on UM-DET (see Figure 4), but performs significantly worse on the other parameter settings which generate the variation in behaviour that the dialogue manager did not encounter during training of POL-DET.",
        "In addition to comparing the policies when evaluated on each simulator separately, another comparison was made in terms of the average performance across all simulators.",
        "For each policy and each simulator, we first computed the difference between the policy's performance and the 'maximum' performance on that simulator as achieved by the policy that was also trained on that simulator, and then averaged over all simulators.",
        "To avoid biased results, only one of the trained simulators was included.",
        "The results in Figure 5 show that the POL-TRA2 policy is more robust than POL-DET, and has similar robustness as POL-HDC.",
        "Similar results are obtained when including",
        "UM-TRA1 only.",
        "Given that the results of Section 4.2 show that the dialogues generated by the trained simulator more closely match real corpus data, and given that the above simulation results show that the POL-TRA policies are at least as robust as the other policies, it seems likely that policies trained using the trained user simulator will show improved performance when evaluated on real users.",
        "However, this claim can only be properly demonstrated in a real user evaluation of the dialogue system containing different dialogue management policies.",
        "Such a user trial would also be able to confirm whether the results from evaluations on the trained simulator can more accurately predict the actual performance expected with real users."

        "In this paper, we presented an agenda-based user simulator extended to be trainable on real user data whilst preserving the necessary rationality and complexity for effective training and evaluation of dialogue manager policies.",
        "The extension involved the incorporation of random decision points in the process of receiving and responding to a system act in each turn.",
        "The decisions made at these points are controlled by probability distributions defined by a set of parameters.",
        "A sample-based maximum likelihood approach to estimating these parameters from real user data in a corpus of human-machine dialogues was discussed, and two kinds of evaluations were presented.",
        "When comparing the statistics of real versus simulated user behaviour in terms of a selection of different metrics, overall, the estimated parameters were shown to give better results than the handcrafted baselines.",
        "When evaluating dialogue management policies trained on the simulator with different parameter settings, it was shown that: 1) policies trained on a particular parameter setting outperform other policies when evaluated on the same parameters, and in particular, 2) a policy trained on the trained simulator outperforms other policies on a trained simulator.",
        "With the general goal of obtaining a dialogue manager that performs better in practice, these results are encouraging, but need to be confirmed by an evaluation of the policies on real users.",
        "Additionally, there is still room for improving the quality of the simulator itself.",
        "For example, the variation in user behaviour can be improved by adding more random decision points, in order to achieve better corpus coverage.",
        "In addition, since there is no clear consensus on what is the best metric for evaluating user simulations, additional metrics will be explored in order to get a more balanced indication of the quality of the user simulator and how the various metrics are affected by modifications to the simulator.",
        "Perplexity (related to the log likelihood, see (Georgila et al., 2005)), accuracy (related to precision/recall, see (Zuker-man and Albrecht, 2001; Georgila et al., 2006)), and Cramer-von Mises divergence (comparing dialogue score distributions, see (Williams, 2008)) are some of the metrics worth considering."
