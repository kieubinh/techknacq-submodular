        "Discourse relations such as cause, contrast or elaboration are considered critical for text interpretation, as they signal in what way parts of a text relate to each other to form a coherent whole.",
        "For this reason, the discourse structure of a text can be seen as an intermediate representation, over which an automatic summarizer can perform computations in order to identify important spans of text to include in a summary (Ono et al., 1994; Marcu, 1998; Wolf and Gibson, 2004).",
        "In our work, we study the content selection performance of different types of discourse-based features.",
        "Discourse relations interconnect units of a text and discourse formalisms have proposed different resulting structures for the full text, i.e. tree (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and graph (Wolf and Gibson, 2005).",
        "This structure is one source of information from discourse which can be used to compute the importance of text units.",
        "The semantics of the discourse relations between sentences could be another indicator of content importance.",
        "For example, text units connected by \"cause\" and \"contrast\" relationships might be more important content for summaries compared to those conveying \"elaboration\".",
        "While previous work have focused on developing content selection methods based upon individual frameworks (Marcu, 1998; Wolf and Gibson, 2004; Uzda et al., 2008), little is known about which aspects of discourse are actually correlated with content selection power.",
        "In our work, we separate out structural and semantic features and examine their usefulness.",
        "We also investigate whether simpler intermediate representations can be used in lieu of discourse.",
        "More parsimonious, easy to compute representations of text have been proposed for summarization.",
        "For example, a text can be reduced to a set of highly descriptive topical words, the presence of which is used to signal importance for content selection (Lin and Hovy, 2002; Conroy et al., 2006).",
        "Similarly, a graph representation of the text can be computed, in which vertices represent sentences, and the nodes are connected when the sentences are similar in terms of word overlap; properties of the graph would then determine the importance of the nodes (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005) and guide content selection.",
        "We compare the utility of discourse features for single-document text summarization from three frameworks: Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988), Graph Bank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005), and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "We present a detailed analysis of the predictive power of different types of discourse features for content selection and compare discourse-based selection to simpler non-discourse methods.",
        "We use a collection of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles manually annotated for discourse information according to three discourse frameworks.",
        "The Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and Graph Bank (GB) corpora are relatively small compared to the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) annotations that cover the 1 million word WSJ part of the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "Our evaluation requires gold standard summaries written by humans, so we perform our experiments on a subset of the overlapping documents for which we also have human summaries available.",
        "RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988) proposes that coherent text can be represented as a tree formed by the combination of text units via discourse relations.",
        "The RST corpus developed by Carlson et al.",
        "(2001) contains discourse tree annotations for 385 WSJ articles from the Penn Treebank corpus.",
        "The smallest annotation units in the RST corpus are sub-sentential clauses, also called elementary discourse units (EDUs).",
        "Adjacent EDUs combine through rhetorical relations into larger spans such as sentences.",
        "The larger units recursively participate in relations with others, yielding one hierarchical tree structure covering the entire text.",
        "The discourse units participating in a RST relation are assigned either nucleus or satellite status; a nucleus is considered to be more central, or important, in the text than a satellite.",
        "Relations composed of one nucleus and one satellite are called mononuclear relations.",
        "On the other hand, in multinuclear relations, two or more text units participate, and all are considered equally important.",
        "The RST corpus is annotated with 53 mononuclear and 25 multinuclear relations.",
        "Relations that convey similar meaning are grouped, resulting in 16 classes of relations: Cause, Comparison, Condition, Contrast, Attribution, Background, Elaboration, Enablement, Evaluation, Explanation, Joint, Manner-Means, Topic-Comment, Summary, Temporal and Topic-Change.",
        "Sometimes, texts cannot be described in a tree structure as hypothesized by the RST.",
        "For example, crossing dependencies and nodes with multiple parents appear frequently in texts and do not allow a tree structure to be built (Lee et al., 2008).",
        "To address this problem, general graph representation was proposed by Wolf and Gibson (2005) as a more realistic model of discourse structure.",
        "Graph annotations of discourse are available for 135 documents (105 from AP Newswire and 30 from the WSJ) as part of the Graph Bank corpus (Wolf and Gibson, 2005).",
        "Clauses are the basic discourse segments in this annotation.",
        "These units are represented as the nodes in a graph, and are linked with one another through 11 different rhetorical relations: Cause-effect, Condition, Violated expectation, Elaboration, Example, Generalization, Attribution, Temporal sequence, Similarity, Contrast and Same.",
        "The edge between two nodes representing a relation is directed in the case of asymmetric relations such as Cause and Condition and undirected for symmetric relations like Similarity and Contrast.",
        "The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) is theory-neutral and does not make any assumptions about the form of the overall discourse structure of text.",
        "Instead, this approach focuses on local and lexically-triggered discourse relations.",
        "Annotators identify explicit signals such as discourse connectives: 'but', 'because', 'while' and mark the text spans which they relate.",
        "The relations between these spans are called explicit relations.",
        "In addition, adjacent sentences in a discourse are also semantically related even in the absence of explicit markers.",
        "In the PDTB, these are called implicit relations and are annotated between adjacent sentences in the same paragraph.",
        "For both implicit and explicit relations, senses are assigned from a hierarchy containing four top-level categories: Comparison (contrast, pragmatic contrast, concession, pragmatic concession), Contingency (cause, pragmatic cause, condition, pragmatic condition), Expansion (conjunction, instantiation, restatement, alternative, exception, list) and Temporal (asynchronous, synchronous).",
        "The top level senses are divided into types and subtypes that represent more fine grained senses â€“ the second level senses are listed in parentheses above.",
        "PDTB also provides annotations for the text spans of the two arguments (referred to Arg1 and Arg2) involved in a relation.",
        "In explicit relations, the argument syntactically bound to the discourse connective is called Arg2.",
        "The other argument is referred to as Arg1.",
        "For implicit relations, the argument occurring first in the text is named Arg1, the one appearing later is called Arg2.",
        "Human summaries are available for some of the WSJ articles.",
        "These summaries are extractive: human judges identified and extracted important text units from the source articles and used them as such to compose the summary.",
        "The RST corpus contains summaries for 150 documents.",
        "Two annotators selected the most important EDUs from these documents and created summaries that contain about square root of the number of EDUs in the source document.",
        "For convenience, we adopt sentences as the common unit for comparison across all frameworks.",
        "So, we mapped the summary EDUs to the sentences which contain them.",
        "Two variable length summaries for each document were obtained in this way.",
        "In some documents, it was not possible to align EDUs automatically with gold standard sentence boundaries given by the Penn Treebank and these were not used in our work.",
        "We perform our experiments on the remaining 124 document-summary pairs.",
        "These documents consisted of 4,765 sentences in total, of which 1,152 were labeled as important sentences because they contained EDUs selected by at least one annotator.",
        "The Graph Bank corpus also contains human summaries.",
        "However, only 15 are for documents for which RST and PDTB annotations are also available.",
        "These summaries were created by fifteen human annotators who ranked the sentences in each document on a scale from 1 (low importance) to 7 (very important for a summary).",
        "For each document, we ordered the sentences according to the average rank from the annotators, and created a summary of 100 words using the top ranked sentences.",
        "The number of summary (important) sentences is 67, out of a total of 308 sentences from the 15 documents."

        "The depth of the tree from the highest promotion is assigned as the score for that EDU.",
        "Hence, the closer to the root an EDU is promoted, the better its score.",

        "We have analyzed the contribution of different types of discourse features-structural and semantic.",
        "Our results provide strong evidence that discourse structure is the most useful aspect.",
        "Both tree and graph representations of discourse can be used to compute the importance of text units with very good results.",
        "On the other hand, sense information from discourse does not provide strong indicators of good content but some constraints as to which content should not be included in a summary.",
        "These sense features complement structure information leading to improved performance.",
        "Further, both these types of discourse features are complementary to standardly used non-discourse features for content selection.",
        "However, building automatic parsers for discourse information has proven to be a hard task overall (Marcu, 2000; Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Wellner et al., 2006; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008; Pitler et al., 2009) and the state of current parsers might limit the benefits obtainable from discourse.",
        "Moreover, discourse-based structure is only as useful for content selection as simpler text structure built using lexical similarity.",
        "Even with gold standard annotations, the performance of structural features based on the RST and Graph Bank representations is not better than that obtained from automatically computed lexical graphs.",
        "So, even if robust discourse parsers exist to use these features on other test sets, it is not likely that discourse features would provide better performance than lexical similarity.",
        "Therefore, for content selection in summarization, current systems can make use of simple lexical structures to obtain similar performance as discourse features.",
        "But it should be remembered that summary quality does not depend on content selection performance alone.",
        "Systems should also produce linguistically well formed summaries and currently systems perform poorly on this aspect.",
        "To address this problem, discourse information is vital.",
        "The most comprehensive study of text quality of automatically produced summaries was performed by Otterbacher et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "A collection of 15 automatically produced summaries was manually edited in order to correct any problems.",
        "The study found that discourse and temporal ordering problems account for 34% and 22% respectively of all the required revisions.",
        "Therefore, we suspect that for building summarization systems, most benefits from discourse can be obtained with regard to text quality compared to the task of content selection.",
        "We plan to focus on this aspect of discourse use for our future work.",
        "This appendix provides the results from statistical tests for identifying predictive features from the different classes (RST-based structural features-Table 5, Non-discourse features-Table 6 and PDTB-based sense features-Table 7).",
        "For real-valued features, we performed a two sided t-test between the corresponding feature values for important versus non-important sentences.",
        "For features which turned out significant in each set, the value of the test statistic and significance levels are reported in the tables.",
        "For binary features, we report results from a chi-square test to measure how indicative a feature is for the class of important or non-important sentences.",
        "For results from the chi-square test, a (+/-) sign is enclosed within parentheses for each significant feature to indicate whether the observed number of times the feature was true in important sentences is greater (+) than the expected value (indication that this feature is frequently associated with important sentences).",
