        "Spoken language interaction between humans and robots in natural environments will necessarily involve communication about space and distance.",

        "In the present study we examine this question in the context of formulating route instructions given to robots.",
        "For practical purposes, we are also interested in understanding how presentation format affects such language.",
        "Instructions given in a physical space might differ from those given in a virtual world, which in turn may differ from those given when only a schematic representation (e.g., a map or drawing) is available.",
        "There is general agreement that landmarks play an important role in spatial language (Daniel and Denis, 2004; Klippel and Winter, 2005; Lovelace et al., 1999; MacMahon, 2007; Michon and Denis, 2001; Nothegger et al., 2004; Raubal and Winter, 2002; Weissensteiner and Winter, 2004).",
        "However, landmarks might not necessarily be used uniformly in instructions across presentation formats.",
        "For example, people may use objects in the environment as landmarks more often when they do not have a good sense of distance in the environment.",
        "Behaviors related to spatial language may change based on the complexity of the route that a robot must take.",
        "This could be due to a combination of factors, including ease of use and personal assessment of a robot's ability to interpret specific distances over landmarks.",

        "The participant's task was to move Mok to the target destination using spoken instructions.",
        "Participants were told to act as if they were an observer of the scene but that were themselves not present in the scene; put otherwise, the robots could hear participants but not see them (and thus the participant could not figure in the instructions).",

        "The robots did not move in the experiments.",

        "Since we collected an equal number of route instructions in the two virtual scene conditions (i.e., with and without being told about the distance in the environment), we directly compared properties of these instructions.",
        "In Sections 6.2 and 6.3, absolute steps, relative steps, word count (log-10 transformed), and thinking timing (log-10 transformed) were the dependent measures in mixed-effects models of analysis of variance (for significance testing).",

        "We are interested in the population from which participants were drawn.",
        "Landmark use was affected by participants' awareness of scale.",
        "The fewer scale cues available, the greater the number of references to landmarks.",

        "We did not inform participants of scale in the real-world condition.",
        "Interestingly, their absolute/relative mix was closer to the no-scale conditions even though they were observing an actual scene and could presumably make inferences about distances.",
        "Figure 4 shows that presentation format also affected participants' use of instructions that were entirely absolute in nature.",
        "There were fewer mixed instructions (i.e., instructions where absolute instructions were supported by landmarks) in conditions where participants had a sense of scale.",
        "Though distances may be self-evident in real-world scenarios, they often are not in virtual environments.■ Absolute ■ Relative ■ Mixed",
        "Participants behaved differently from real-world scenarios when we presented a non-trivial indication of scale.",
        "Participants' instructions were dominated by absolute instructions when they had a sense of scale in a virtual environment.",
        "This suggests that despite similarities in scale awareness, people formulate spatial language instructions differently when they cannot for themselves determine a sense of distance in an environment.",

      "text": [
        "We presented a study that examines people's close-range spoken language route instructions for robots and how the presentation format and the complexity of the route influenced the content of instructions.",
        "Across all presentation formats, people preferred providing instructions that were absolute in nature (i.e., metric-based).",
        "Despite this preference, landmarks were used on occasion.",
        "When they were, participants' use of them was influenced by the presentation format (schematic, virtual or natural).",
        "When participants had a general sense of distance in scenes, they were much more acclimated to using specific distances to give route instructions to a robot.",
        "Our results indicate that the goal location can influence participant effort (i.e., time to formulate) and the pattern (absolute/relative) in spoken language route instructions to robots.",
        "Several of these were predictable (e.g., least effort when goal location was closest to moving robot).",
        "When participants viewed these configurations in virtual environments, there were clear differences in their instructions based on whether or not they were given a sense of scale.",
        "We compared the natural language instructions from the real-world condition to those from virtual stimuli.",
        "Figure 3 shows that in general, real-world participants' instructions contained similar proportions of landmarks to the 3d no-dist (virtual) condition.",
        "However, there was a greater preference to use absolute steps in the real-world than in the virtual world; participants apparently access their own sense of scale when formulating these instructions.",
        "With respect to spatial language instructions, participants tended to treat virtual environments much like real-world environments.",
        "This study provides useful information about methodology in the study of spatial language and also suggests principles for the design of spatial language understanding capabilities for robots in human environments.",
        "Specifically, virtual world representations, under suitable conditions, elicit language similar to that found under real-world situations, although the more information people have about the metric properties of the environment the more likely they are to use them.",
        "But even in the absence of unambiguous metrics people seem to want to use such language in the instructions that they produce.",
        "These observations can be used to inform the design of spatial language understanding for robot systems as well as guide the development of requirements for a spatial reasoning component."
