        "One of the main problems for a spoken dialogue system is to determine the user's goal (e.g. plan suitable meeting times or find a good Indian restaurant nearby) under uncertainty, and thereby to compute the optimal next system dialogue action (e.g. offer a restaurant, ask for clarification).",
        "Recent research in statistical spoken dialogue systems (SSDS) has successfully addressed aspects of these problems through the application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approaches (Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010).",
        "However POMDP SSDS are currently limited by an impoverished representation of user goals adopted to enable tractable learning.",
        "Current POMDP SSDS state approximations make it impossible to represent some plausible user goals, e.g. someone who wants to know about nearby cheap restaurants and high-quality ones further away, or wants to schedule a meeting anytime this week except monday afternoon (also see Examples in Tables 1-3).",
        "This renders dialogue management suboptimal and makes it impossible to deal adequately with the following types of user utterance: \"I'm looking for French or Italian food\", or \"Not Italian, unless it's expensive\".",
        "User utterances with negations and disjunctions of various sorts are very natural, and exploit the full power of natural language input.",
        "Moreover, work in dialogue system evaluation, e.g. (Walker et al., 2004; Lemon et al., 2006), shows that real user goals are generally sets of items with different features, rather than a single item.",
        "People like to explore possible trade offs between features of items.",
        "A central challenge for the field of spoken dialogue systems is therefore to: develop realistic large-scale statistical approaches with an accurate, extended representation of user goals.",
        "In this paper we propose that the independence assumptions that have guided POMDP SSDS design to date should be relaxed, user goal sets should be introduced and that the subsequent explosion in the size of the state space should be dealt with by employing Automatic Belief Compression (ABC) techniques."

        "Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are Markov Decision Processes where the system's state is only partially observable, i.e. there is uncertainty as to what the true state is.",
        "The ability to account for uncertainty is crucial for spoken dialogue systems because their knowledge about the state is uncertain due to speech recognition errors and the fact that the user's goals are not directly observable.",
        "In POMDP models of spoken dialogue (Williams and Young, 2005; Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010) the dialogue policy (what the system should say next) is based not on a single view of the current state of the conversation, but on a probability distribution over all possible states of the conversation.",

        "Given 8 food types, 8 city areas, 3 price ranges and 3 quality ratings, coupled with 7 user actions and a 3 dialogue progress indicator then the dialogue state space contains 8 x 8 x 3 x 3 x 7 x 3 = 326, 592 states.",
        "A POMDP belief space is a probability distribution over all these dialogue states, i.e. a 326, 592 dimensional real valued (R) space.",
        "In order to render such large belief spaces tractable, the current state of the art in POMDP SSDS uses a variety of handcrafted compression techniques, such as making several types of independence assumption.",
        "For example, by assuming that users are only ever interested in one type of food or one location, and that their interests in food type, price range, quality, etc.",
        "are independent, the 326, 592 real valued state space can be reduced to a much smaller \"summary space\" (Williams and Young, 2005) consisting of, say, 4 x R values.",

        "The tight coupling between some dialogue states and actions (e.g. a user's goal state travei-from-London and system act",
        "confirm-from-London) has led some researchers to conclude that compression techniques, such as state aggregation, are not useful in the dialogue domain (Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "However, such tight coupling may not exist for all states, indeed VDC has already been applied to a small spoken dialogue system problem (Poupart, 2005) where it was shown that compressions could be found without losing any information.",
        "Further, for POMDP approaches the state is not the dialogue state but the belief distribution over dialogue states.",
        "Incompressibility at the dialogue state level does not rule out compressibility of belief distributions.",
        "Finally, our introduction of sets for user goals should provide additional possibilities for compression.",

        "POMDP SSDS to handle the much larger state spaces that are required to achieve the expressiveness which we believe will be a real benefit to users.",
