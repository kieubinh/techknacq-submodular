        "The ability to identify stressed speech would be very valuable to Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs), especially in \"stressful\" applications such as search-and-rescue robots.",
        "Speech recognizers are usually trained on normal speech, and so can struggle badly on other speech.",
        "Techniques exist for making ASR robust to noise/stress (Hansen and Patil, 2007), but knowing when to apply them will in general require the ability to detect stressed speech.",
        "This ability is clearly also needed when the user's stress level should affect how the SDS responds.",
        "An SDS should sometimes generate stressed speech itself – for example, to impart a sense of urgency on the user.",
        "This paper investigates spectral-based acoustic indicators of stress in human-human, task-oriented dialogues in which stress is induced in the latter stages by the unexpected introduction of time-pressure.",
