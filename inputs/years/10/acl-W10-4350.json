        "We present our Multi Point Of vieW Evaluation Refinement Studio (MPOWERS), an application framework for Spoken Dialogue System evaluation that implements design conventions in a user-friendly interface.",
        "It ensures that all evaluator-users manipulate a unique shared corpus of data with a shared set of parameters to design and retrieve their evaluations.",
        "It therefore answers both the need for convergence among the evaluation practices and the consideration of several analytical points of view addressed by the evaluators involved in Spoken Dialogue System projects.",
        "After introducing the system architecture, we argue the solution's added value in supporting a both data-driven and goal-driven process.",
        "We conclude with future works and perspectives of improvement upheld by human processes."

      "text": [
        "The evaluation of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) is a twofold issue.",
        "On the one hand, the lack of convention on evaluation criteria and the many different evaluation needs and situations along with SDS projects lead to nomadic evaluation setups and interpretations.",
        "We inventoried seven job families contributing to these projects: the marketing people, the business managers, the technical and ergonomics experts, the hosting providers, the contracting owners as well as the actual human operators which integrate SDS in their activity (Laurent et al., 2010).",
        "Various experimental protocols for data collection and analytical data processing flourish in the domain.",
        "On the other hand, however they may not share evaluation needs and methods, the various potential evaluators need to cooperate inside and across projects.",
        "This claims for a convergence of evaluation practices toward standardized methodologies.",
        "The domain has put a lot of efforts toward the definition of commensurable metrics (Paek, 2007) for comparative evaluations and improved transparency over communications on systems' performances.",
        "Nonetheless, we believe that no one-size-fits-all solution may cover all evaluation needs (Laurent and Bretier, 2010).",
        "We therefore work onto the rationalization - not the standardization - of evaluation practices.",
        "By rationalization, we refer to the definition of common norms to describe the evaluation protocols; common thinking models and vocabulary, for evaluators to make their procedures explicit.",
        "Our Multi Points Of VieW Evaluation Refinement Studio (MPOWERS) facilitates the design, from a unique corpus of parameters, of personalized evaluations adapted to the particular contexts.",
        "It does not compete with workbenches like MeMo (Möller et al., 2006) or WITcHCRafT (Schmitt et al., 2010) for which the overall evaluation process is predefined within the tool.",
        "The following section details the solution architecture.",
        "Then, we present the MPOWERS's purposes, emphasizing on its added value for evaluators.",
        "Last, we explain the technical and process-related aspects that must support the system."

      "text": [
        "The application is built on a classical Business Intelligence (BI) solution that aims to provide decision makers with personalized information (See Fig. 1).",
        "We store, in a single datamart, parameters retrieved from heterogeneous sources: interaction logs, user questionnaires and third-party annotations relative to the evaluation campaigns arranged on the evaluated system(s).",
        "Then, data are cleaned, transformed and aggregated into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).",
        "It guarantees that the indicators used across teams and projects are defined, calculated and maintained in the same place.",
        "On the upper layer, evaluators define and retrieve personalized reports and dashboards.",
        "We use the Let's Go! System corpus shared by the Carnegie Mellon University.",
        "It contains log files generated since from 2003 from the Pittsburgh's telephone-based bus information system log files, one per module composing the system, and a summary HTML file.",
        "At our stage of the project the html summary allows the calculation of a satisfying number of parameters to support the system development and refinement.",
        "We compute the dialogue duration, the number of system and user turns, the number of barge-ins, the ratio between user and system turn number, the number of help requests and of no-matches per call and the ratio of successful interactions.",
        "The application relies on the SpagoBI 2.6 open source solution.",
        "Once parametrized, it enables non-technical stakeholders to retrieve personalized KPIs reports based on shared resources.",
        "For now, it delivers basic dashboards for two user profiles.",
        "One focuses on the service monitoring for marketing people and business managers and the other one provides the development team with usability-related performance figures (see fig. 4).",
        "The unique datamart guarantees all users to work from similar data.",
        "Its population requires parsing routines to identify and extract the relevant data."

        "By automating tractable tasks, MPOWERS supports the evaluator-users in their evaluation process driven by decision-making objectives.",
        "As sketched in figure 2, our application-supported process is slightly modified from the one defined by Stufflebeam (1980): a process through which one defines, obtains and delivers useful pieces of information that enable to settle between the alternative possible decisions.",

        "As data may originates from diverse sources, it arrays in different formats and often displays different parameters.",
