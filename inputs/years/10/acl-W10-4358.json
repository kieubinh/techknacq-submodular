        "However, agents cannot produce their intended effects when the smooth flow of interaction is disturbed.",
        "To fully exploit the promise of agents, we need to achieve smooth interaction between human users and agents.",
        "Although various types of modalities have been used in human-computer interfaces, speech has drawn a great deal of interest because it is one of the most pervasive communication methods in our daily lives and we usually perform it without any special effort (Nass and Brave, 2005).",
        "In this paper, we are interested in smooth spoken dialogues between users and agents.",
        "A spoken dialogue is a joint activity among participants (Clark, 1996).",
        "For such a joint activity to be smooth and successful, participants need to coordinate their communicative behaviors in various ways.",
        "In human dialogues, participants agree on lexical choices to refer to objects (Brennan and Clark, 1996) and coordinate eye gaze (Richardson and Dale, 2005) and whose turn it is to speak (Sacks et al., 1974).",
        "They become more similar to their partners as the dialogue proceeds in many aspects such as pitch, speech rate, and pause structure (Burgoon et al., 1995; Hayashi et al., 2009).",
        "Such coordination serves to make conversation flow easily and intelligibly (Garrod and Pickering, 2004).",
        "The coordination of communicative behaviors also plays a crucial role in smooth human-agent interaction.",
        "Previous work addressed human behavior adaptation to agents (Oviatt et al., 2004), agent behavior adaptation to human partners (Mit-sunaga et al., 2005; Tapus and Mataric, 2007), and the mutual adaptation of human and agent behavior (Breazeal, 2003).",
        "In this paper, which addresses smooth spoken interaction between human users and agents, we focus on the adaptation of agent communicative behavior to individual users in spoken dialogues with flexible turn-taking.",
        "We present a method for user-adaptive coordination of agent communicative behavior to reduce the discomfort perceived by individual users during the interaction and show experimental results that evaluate how the method influences agent communicative behavior and improves its relevance as perceived by users.",
        "For evaluation purposes, we used a quizstyle multi-party spoken dialogue system (Minami et al., 2007; Dohsaka et al., 2009).",
        "A quiz-style dialogue is a kind of thought-evoking dialogue that can stir user thinking and activate communication (Higashinaka et al., 2007a; Dohsaka et al., 2009).",
        "This characteristic is expected to be advantageous for evaluation experiments since it encourages involvement in the dialogue.",
        "Our method adapts agent communicative behavior based on policy gradient reinforcement learning (Sutton et al., 2000; Kohl and Stone, 2004).",
        "The policy gradient method has been used for robot communicative behavior adaptation (Mitsunaga et al., 2005; Tapus and Mataric, 2007).",
        "However, both studies dealt with scenario-based interaction in which a user and a robot acted with predetermined timing.",
        "In contrast, we focus on spoken dialogues in which users and agents can speak with more flexible timing.",
        "In addition, we allow for two-and three-party interactions among a user and two agents.",
        "It remains unclear whether the policy gradient method can successfully adapt agent communicative behavior to a user in two-or three-party spoken dialogues with flexible turn-taking.",
        "Although this paper focuses on agent behavior adaptation to human users, we believe that our investigation of the agent behavior adaptation mechanism in flexible spoken interaction will contribute to conversational interfaces where human users and agents can mutually adapt their communicative behaviors.",
        "As agent communicative behavior to be adapted, this paper focuses on the pause duration preceding agent utterances and the agent gaze duration.",
        "In conversation, the participant pause duration is influenced by partners, and the coordination of pause structure leads to smooth communication (Burgoon et al., 1995; Hayashi et al., 2009).",
        "Without pause structure coordination, undesired speech overlaps or utterance collisions are likely to occur between users and agents, which may disturb smooth communication.",

        "proposed a method to prevent undesired speech overlaps in human-robot speech interactions by using a robot's subtle expressions produced by a blinking LED attached to its chest (Funakoshi et al., 2008).",
        "In their method, a blinking light notifies users about such internal states of the robot as processing or busy and helps users identify the robot pause structures; however we are concerned with the adaptation of robot pause structures to users.",
        "Gaze coordination is causally related to the success of communication (Richardson and Dale, 2005), and the amount of gaze influences conversational turn-taking (Vertegaal and Ding, 2002).",
        "The relevant control of agent gaze duration is thus essential to the smooth flow of conversation.",
        "Moreover, since the amount of gaze is related to specific interpersonal attitudes among participants and is also subject to such individual differences as personalities (Argyle and Cook, 1976), agent gaze duration must be adapted to individual users.",

        "The hints are automatically created from the biographical facts of people in Wikipedia and ranked based on the difficulty of solving the quizzes experienced by users (Higashinaka et al., 2007b).",

        "In the sample dialogue, spon identifies spontaneous and res identifies responsive utterances.",
        "Quizmaster agent Master makes spontaneous utterances such as presenting hints (lines 1 and 5), indicating the quiz difficulty, and addressing listeners.",
        "It also makes such responsive utterances as evaluating the other's answers (lines 3, 9, and 11).",
        "Peer agent Peer makes such spontaneous utterances as showing its own difficulty (line 4), giving an answer (line 8), giving feedback when its own or the other's answer is right (line 12), and addressing listeners.",

        "In this paper, addressing smooth spoken interaction between human users and conversational agents, we presented a method for user-adaptive coordination of agent communicative behavior and experimentally evaluated how it can adapt agent behavior to individual users in spoken dialogues with flexible turn-taking.",
        "The method coordinates agent pause and gaze duration based on policy gradient reinforcement learning to reduce the discomfort perceived by individual users during interaction.",
        "We experimentally evaluated the method in a setting where the users performed two-and three-party quiz-style dialogues and signified their discomfort by pressing buttons held in their hands.",
        "Our experimental results showed a statistically significant tendency: the agent pause and gaze duration converged during interaction with the method in both two-or three-party dialogues.",
        "The method also significantly improved the perceived relevance of the agent communicative behavior in both two-and three-party dialogues.",
        "These results indicate that in spoken dialogues with flexible turn-taking, the policy-gradient-based method can adapt agent communicative behavior to individual users.",
        "Many directions for future work remain.",
        "First, we will analyze how users adapt their communicative behaviors with our method.",
        "Second, we need to automatically estimate user discomfort or satisfaction based on such user behaviors as pause structure, prosody, eye gaze, and body posture.",
        "Third, we will extend the adaptation method to regulate agent behavior based on dialogue states, since one limitation of the current method is its inability to recognize them.",
        "Fourth, we are interested in the adaptation of additional higher-level actions like the relevant choice of dialogue topics based on the level of user interest."
