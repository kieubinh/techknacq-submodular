        "In contrast to other methods which use transcribed content and prosodic features (such as pitch, loudness etc), the method used in this comparison employs only the duration of the prosodic units themselves as the basis for dialogue representation.",
        "A concept of Vocalisation Horizon (VH) allows us to treat segmentation as a classification task where each instance to be classified is represented by the duration of a talk spurt, pause or speech overlap event in the dialogue.",
        "We report on the results this method yielded in segmentation of medical meetings, and on the implications of the results of further experiments on a larger corpus, the Augmented Multiparty Meeting corpus, to our ongoing efforts to support data collection and information retrieval in medical team meetings."

        "As computer mediated communication becomes more widespread, and data gathering devices start to make their way into the meeting rooms and the workplace in general, the need arises for modelling and analysis of dialogue and human communicative behaviour in general (Banerjee et al., 2005).",
        "The focus of our interest in this area is the study of multi-party interaction at Multidisciplinary Medical Team Meeting (MDTMs), and the eventual recording of such meetings followed by indexing and structuring for integration into electronic health records.",
        "MDTMs share a number of characteristics with more conventional business meetings, and with the meeting scenarios targeted in recent research projects (Renals et al., 2007).",
        "However, MDTMs are better structured than these meetings, and more strongly influenced by the time pressures placed upon the medical professionals who take part in them (Kane and Luz, 2006).",
        "In order for meeting support and review systems to be truly effective, they must allow users to efficiently browse and retrieve information of interest from the recorded data.",
        "Browsing in these media can be tedious and time consuming because continuous media such as audio and video are difficult to access since they lack natural reference points.",
        "A good deal of research has been conducted on indexing recorded meetings.",
        "From a user's point of view, an important aspect of indexing continuous media, and audio in particular, is the task of structuring the recorded content.",
        "Banerjee et al.",
        "(2005), for instance, showed that users took significantly less time to retrieve answers when they had access to discourse structure annotation than in a control condition in which they had access only to unan-notated recordings.",
        "The most salient discourse structure in a meeting is the topic of conversation.",
        "The content within a given topic is cohesive and should therefore be viewed as a whole.",
        "In MDTMs, the meeting consists basically of successive patient case discussions (PCDs) in which the patient's condition is discussed among different medical specialists with the objective of agreeing diagnoses, making patient management decisions etc.",
        "Thus, the individual PCDs can be regarded as the different \"topics\" which make up an MDTM (Luz, 2009).",
        "In this paper we explore the use of a contentfree approach to the representation of vocalisation events for segmentation of MDTM dialogues.",
        "We start by extending the work of Luz (2009) on a small corpus of MDTM recordings, and then test our approach on a larger dataset, the AMI (Augmented Multi-Party Interaction) corpus (Carletta, 2007) .",
        "Our ultimate goal is to analyse and apply the insights gained on the AMI corpus to our work on data gathering and representation in MDTMs."

        "Topic segmentation and detection, as an aid to meeting information retrieval and meeting indexing, has attracted the interest of many researchers in recent years.",
        "The objective of topic segmentation is to locate the beginning and end time of a cohesive segment of dialogue which can be singled out as a \"topic\".",
        "Meeting topic segmentation has been strongly influenced by techniques developed for topic segmentation in text (Hearst, 1997), and more recently in broadcast news audio, even though it is generally acknowledged that dialogue segmentation differs from text and scripted speech in important respects (Gruenstein et al., 2005).",
        "In early work (Galley et al., 2003), meeting annotation focused on changes that produce high inter-annotator agreement, with no further specification of topic label or discourse structure.",
        "Current work has paid greater attention to discourse structure, as reflected in two major meeting corpus gathering and analysis projects: the AMI project (Renals et al., 2007) and the ICSI meeting project (Morgan et al., 2001).",
        "The AMI corpus distinguishes top-level and functional topics such as \"presentation\", \"discussion\", \"opening\", \"closing\", \"agenda\" which are further specified into subtopics (Hsueh et al., 2006).",
        "Gruenstein et al.",
        "(2005) sought to annotated the ICSI corpus hierarchically according to topic, identifying, in addition, action items and decision points.",
        "In contrast to these more general types of meetings, MDTMs are segmented into better defined units (i.e. PCDs) so that inter-annotator agreement on topic (patient case discussion) boundaries is less of an issue, since PCDs are collectively agreed parts of the formal structure of the meetings.",
        "Meeting transcripts (either done manually or automatically) have formed the basis for a number of approaches to topic segmentation (Galley et al., 2003; Hsueh et al., 2006; Sherman and Liu, 2008) .",
        "The transcript-based meeting segmentation described in (Galley et al., 2003) adapted the unsupervised lexical cohesion method developed for written text segmentation (Hearst, 1997).",
        "Other approaches have employed supervised machine learning methods with textual features (Hsueh et al., 2006).",
        "Prosodic and conversational features have also been integrated into text-based representations, often improving segmentation accuracy (Galley et al., 2003; Hsueh and Moore, 2007).",
        "However, approaches that rely on transcription, and sometimes higher-level annotation on transcripts, as is the case of (Sherman and Liu, 2008), have two shortcomings which limit their applicability to MDTM indexing.",
        "First, manual transcription is unfeasible in a busy hospital setting, and automatic speech recognition of unconstrained, noisy dialogues falls short of the levels of accuracy required for good segmentation.",
        "Secondly, the contents of MDTMs are subject to stringent privacy and confidentiality constraints which limit access to training data.",
        "Regardless of such application constraints, some authors (Malioutov et al., 2007; Shriberg et al., 2000) argue for the use of prosodic features and other acoustic patterns directly from the audio signal for segmentation.",
        "The approach investigated in this paper goes a step further by representing the data solely through what is, arguably, the simplest form of content-free representation, namely: duration of talk spurts, silences and speech overlaps, optionally complemented with speaker role information (e.g. medical speciality)."

        "There is more to the structure (and even the semantics) of a dialogue than the textual content of the words exchanged by its participants.",
        "The role of prosody in shaping the illocution-ary force of vocalisations, for instance, is well documented (Holmes, 1984), and prosodic features have been used for automatic segmentation of broadcast news data into sentences and topics (Shriberg et al., 2000).",
        "Similarly, recurring audio patterns have been employed in segmentation of recorded lectures (Malioutov et al., 2007).",
        "Works in the area of social psychology have used the simple conversational features of duration of vocalisations, pauses and overlaps to study the dynamics of group interaction.",

        "These works provided the initial motivation for our content-free representation scheme and the topic segmentation method proposed in this paper.",
        "It is easy to verify by inspection of both the corpus of medical team meetings described in Section 4 and the AMI corpus that pauses and vocalisations vary significantly in duration and position on and around topic boundaries.",
        "Table 1 shows the mean durations of vocalisations that initiate new topics or PCDs in MDTMs and the scenario-based AMI meetings, as well as the durations of pauses and overlaps that surround it (within one vocalisation event to the left and right).",
        "In all cases the differences were statistically significant.",
        "These results agree with those obtained by Oliveira (2002) for discourse topics, and suggest that an approach based on representing the duration of vocalisations, pauses and overlaps in the immediate context of a vocalisation might be effective for automatic segmentation of meeting dialogues into topics or PCDs.",

        "A meeting can be pre-segmented into separate vocalisations (i.e.",
        "talk spurts uttered by meeting participants) and silences, and such basic units (henceforth referred to as vocalisation events) can then be classified as to whether they signal a topic transition.",
        "The basic defining features of a vocalisation event are the identity of the speaker who uttered the vocalisation (or speakers, for events containing speech overlap) and its duration, or the duration of a pause, for silence events.",
        "However, identity labels and interval durations by themselves are not enough to enable segmentation.",
        "As we have seen above, some approaches to meeting segmentation complement these basic data with text (keywords or full transcription) uttered during vocalisation events, and with prosodic features.",
        "Our proposal is to retain the content-free character of the basic representation by complementing the speaker and duration information for an event with data describing its preceding and succeeding events.",
        "We thus aim to capture an aspect of the dynamics of the dialogue by representing snapshots of vocalisation sequences.",
        "We call this general representation strategy Vocalisation Horizon (VH).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the basic idea.",
        "Vocalisation events are placed on a time line and combine utterances produced by the speakers who took part in the meeting.",
        "These events can be labelled with nominal attributes (s\\, s2,...) denoting the speaker (or some other symbolic attribute, such as the speaker's role in the meeting).",
        "Silences (gaps) and group talk (overlap) can either be assigned reserved descriptors (such as \"Floor\" and \"Group\") or regarded as separate annotation layers.",
        "The general data representation scheme for, say, segment v would involve a data from its left context (vj, vj,vj,...) and its right context (vi, v2, v3,...) in addition to the data for v itself.",
        "These can be a combination of symbolic labels (in Figure 1, for instance, s1 for the current speaker, S3, s2, s1,... for the preceding events and s3, s2, s3,... for the following events), durations (d, (Â£3,^2, d3,... etc) and gaps or overlaps 91,91,93, â¢ â¢ â¢, 9i,92,93,â¢â¢â¢ etc).",

        "We tested two variants of the representation: Vpdthat discriminated between pause types (pauses, switching pauses, group pauses, and group switching pauses), as in (Dabbs and Ruback, 1987), and Vsp which labelled all pauses equally.",
        "The evaluation metrics employed include the standard classification metrics of accuracy (A), the proportion of correctly classified segments, boundary precision (P), the proportion of correctly assigned boundaries among all events marked as topic boundaries, boundary recall (R), the proportion of target boundaries correctly assigned, and the F\\ score, the harmonic mean of P and R.",
        "Although these standard metrics provide an initial approximation to segmentation effectiveness, they have been criticised as tools for evaluating segmentation because they are hard to interpret and are not sensitive to near misses (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002).",
        "Furthermore, due to the highly unbalanced nature of the classification task (boundary vocalisation events are only 3-3% of all instances), accuracy scores tend to produce overoptimistic results.",
        "Therefore, to give a fairer picture of the effectiveness of our method, we also report values for two error metrics proposed specifically for segmentation: Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff, or WD, (Pevzner and",
        "Hearst, 2002).",
        "The Pk metric gives the probability that two vocalisation events occurring k vocalisations apart and picked otherwise randomly from the dataset are incorrectly identified by the algorithm as belonging to the same or to different topics.",
        "Pk is computed by sliding two pairs of pointers over the reference and the hypothesis sequences and observing whether each pair of pointers rests in the same or in different segments.",
        "An error is counted if the pairs disagree (i.e. if they point to the same segment in one sequence and to different segments in the other).",
        "WD is as an estimate of inconsistencies between reference and hypothesis, obtained by sliding a window of length equal k segments over the time line and counting disagreements between true and hypothesised boundaries.",
        "Like the standard IR metrics, Pk and WD range over the [0,1] interval.",
        "Since they are error metrics, the greater the value, the worse the segmentation.",
        "Table 2 shows the results for segmentation of MDTMs into PCDs under the representational variants mentioned above and two different thresholding strategies: maximum a posteriori hypothesis (MAP) and proportional threshold.",
        "The latter is a strategy that varies the threshold probability above which an event is marked as a boundary according to the generality of boundaries found in the training set.",
        "The motivation for testing proportional thresholds is illustrated by Figure 4, which shows a step plot of MAP hypothesis (h) superimposed on the true segmentation (peaks represent boundaries) and the corresponding values for p(b\\v).",
        "It is clear that a number of false positives would be removed if the threshold were set above the MAP level with no effect on the number of false negatives.",
        "Another possible improvement suggested by Figure 4 is the filtering of adjacent boundary hypotheses.",
        "Wider peaks, such as the ones on instances 14 and 172 indicate that two or more boundaries were hypothesised in immediate succession.",
        "Since this is clearly impossible, a straightforward improvement of the segmentation hypothesis can be achieved by choosing a single boundary marker among a cluster of adjacent ones.",
        "This has been done as a post-processing step by choosing a single event with maximal estimated probability within a cluster of adjacent boundary hypotheses as the new hypothesis.",
        "Figure 4: Segmentation profile showing true boundaries (r), boundaries hypothesised by a MAP classifier (h) and probabilities (dotted line).",
        "The results suggest that both proportional thresholding and filtering improve segmentation.",
        "As expected, accuracy figures were generally high (an uninformative) reflecting the great imbalance in favour of negative instances and the conservative nature of the classifier.",
        "Precision, recall and Fi (for positive instances only) were also predictably low, with Vsp under a proportional threshold attaining the best results.",
        "However, in meeting browsing marking the topic boundary precisely is far less important than retrieving the right text is in information retrieval or text categorisation, since the user can easily scan the neighbouring intervals with a slider (Banerjee et al., 2005).",
        "Therefore, Pk and WD are the most appropriate measures of success in this task.",
        "Here our results seem quite encouraging, given that they all represent great improvements over the (rather reasonable) baselines of Pk = .46 and WD = .51 estimated by Monte Carlo simulation as in (Hsueh et al., 2006) by hypothesising the same proportion of boundaries found in the training set.",
        "Our results also compare favourably with some of the best results reported in the meeting segmentation literature to date, namely Pk = 0.32 and WD = 0.36, for alex-ical cohesion algorithm on the ICSI corpus (Galley et al., 2003), and Pk = 0.34 and WD = 0.36, for a maximum entropy approach combining lexical, conversational and video features on the AMI corpus (Hsueh et al., 2006).",
        "Although these results are promising, they pose a question as regards data representation.",

        "It seems that the various and more specialised speaker roles found in medical meetings can be good predictors of PCD boundaries.",
        "For example: a typical pattern at the start of a PCD is the recounting of the patient's initial symptoms and clinical findings by the registrar in a narrative style.",
        "In AMI, on other hand, the roles are much fewer, being only acted out by the participants as part of the given scenario, which might explain the irrelevance of these roles for segmentation.",
        "MDTM segmentation differs from topic segmentation of the AMI meetings in that PCDs are more regular in their occurrence than meeting topics proper.",
        "Speaker role information was also found to help MDTM segmentation, which was expected since there are many more very distinct active speaker roles in MDTM (10 specialties, in total).",
        "Furthermore, Vsp and Vpd represent pauses and overlaps as reserved roles, so that the information encoded in Vg and Va as separate variables appear in the speaker role horizon of Vsp and Vpd.",
        "It is possible that the finer-grained timing annotation of the AMI corpus (including detailed overlap and pause information unavailable in the MDTM data) contributed to the relatively good segmentation performance achieved on AMI even in the absence of speaker role cues.",
        "It would be interesting to investigate whether finer pause and overlap timings can also improve MDTM segmentation.",
        "This suggests some requirements for MDTM data collection and pre-processing, such as the use of individual close-talking and the use of a speech recogniser to derive word-level timings.",
        "We plan on conducting further experiments in that regard.",
