        "This is particularly true in the context of life sciences, where large quantities of biomedical articles are published on a daily basis.",
        "To support tasks such data mining, search and visualization, there is a clear need for structured representations of the knowledge these articles convey.",
        "This is indicated by a large number of public databases with content ranging from simple protein-protein interactions to complex pathways.",
        "To increase coverage of such databases, and to keep up with the rate of publishing, we need to automatically extract structured representations from biomedical text – a process often referred to as biomedical text mining.",
        "One major focus of biomedical text mining has been the extraction of named entities, such genes or gene products, and of flat binary relations between such entities, such as protein-protein interactions.",
        "However, in recent years there has also been an increasing interest in the extraction of biomedical events and their causal relations.",
        "This gave rise to the BioNLP 2009 and 2011 shared tasks which challenged participants to gather such events from biomedical text (Kim et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011).",
        "Notably, these events can be complex and recursive: they may have several arguments, and some of the arguments may be events themselves.",
        "Current state-of-the-art event extractors follow the same architectural blueprint and divide the extraction process into a pipeline of three stages (Björne et al., 2009; Miwa et al., 2010c).",
        "First they predict a set of candidate event trigger words (say, tokens 2, 5 and 6 in figure 1), then argument mentions are attached to these triggers (say, token 4 for trigger 2).",
        "The final stage decides how arguments are shared between events – compare how one event subsumes all arguments of trigger 6 in figure 1, while two events share the three arguments of trigger 4 in figure 2.",

        "However, besides not being as accurate as their pipelined competitors, mostly because they do not yet exploit the rich set of features used by also suffer from the complexity of inference.",
        "For example, to remain tractable, the best joint system so far (Poon and Vanderwende, 2010) works with a simplified representation of the problem in which certain features are harder to capture, employs local search without certificates of optimality, and furthermore requires a 32-core cluster for quick train-test cycles.",
        "Existing joint models also rely on heuristics when it comes to deciding which arguments share the same event.",
        "Contrast this with the best current pipeline (Miwa et al., 2010c; Miwa et al., 2010b) which uses a classifier for this task.",
        "We present a family of event extraction models that address the aforementioned problems.",

        "Notably, the highest scoring event structure under this model can be found efficiently in O (mn) time where m is the number of trigger candidates, and n the number of argument candidates.",
        "This is only slightly slower than the O (m'n) runtime of a pipeline, where m' is the number of trigger candidates as filtered by the first stage.",
        "We achieve these guarantees through a novel algorithm that jointly picks best trigger label and arguments on a per-token basis.",
        "Remarkably, it takes roughly as much time to train this model on one core as the model of Poon and Vanderwende (2010) on 32 cores, and leads to better results.",
        "The second model enforces additional constraints that ensure consistency between events in hierarchical regulation structures.",
        "While inference in this model is more complicated, we show how dual decomposition (Komodakis et al., 2007; Rush et al., 2010) can be used to efficiently find exact solutions for a large fraction of problems.",
        "Our third model includes the first two, and explicitly captures which arguments are part in the same event – the third stage of existing pipelines.",
        "Due to a complex coupling between this model and the first two, inference here requires a projected version of the sub-gradient technique demonstrated by Rush et al.",
