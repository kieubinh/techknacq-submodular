        "IT support or DSLR cameras).",
        "With the advent of Web 2.0, there has been an explosion of web authorship in this area, and forums are now widely used in various areas such as customer support, community development, interactive reporting and online eduction.",
        "In addition to providing the means to interactively participate in discussions or obtain/provide answers to questions, the vast volumes of data contained in forums make them a valuable resource for \"support sharing\", i.e. looking over records of past user interactions to potentially find an immediately applicable solution to a current problem.",
        "On the one hand, more and more answers to questions over a wide range of domains are becoming available on forums; on the other hand, it is becoming harder and harder to extract and access relevant information due to the sheer scale and diversity of the data.",
        "This research aims at enhancing information access and support sharing, by mining the discourse structure of troubleshooting-oriented web user forum threads.",
        "Previous research has shown that simple thread structure information (e.g. reply-to structure) can enhance tasks such as forum information retrieval (Seo et al., 2009) and post quality assessment (Lui and Baldwin, 2009).",
        "We aim to move beyond simple threading, to predict not only the links between posts, but also show the manner of each link, in the form of the discourse structure of the thread.",
        "In doing so, we hope to be able to perform richer visualisation of thread structure (e.g. highlighting the key posts which appear to have led to a successful resolution to a problem), and more finegrained weighting of posts in threads for search purposes.",

        "We return to explore this effect in Section 6.4.",
        "Third, although the Initiator feature does not have much effect on CRFSGD, it affects the performance of MaltParser significantly.",
        "Further experiments shown that the combination of Initiator and UserProf is sufficient to achieve a competitive result (i.e. 0.731).",
        "It therefore seems that MaltParser is more robust than CRF-SGD, whose performance relies crucially on userlevel features which must be learned from the training data (i.e. UserProf).",
        "Looking to the thread-level F-scores, we observe some interesting divergences from the post-level F-score results.",
        "First, with no features (Dummy), CRFSGD significantly outperforms both the baseline and MaltParser.",
        "This appears to be because CRFSGD performs particularly well over short threads (e.g. of length 3 and 4), but worse over longer threads.",
        "Second, the best thread-level Fscores from CRFSGD (i.e. 0.587) and MaltParser (i.e. 0.578) are not significantly different, despite the discrepancy in post-level F-score (where CRFSGD is markedly superior in this case).",
        "With the extra features, the performance of MaltParser on short threads appears to pick up noticeably, and the difference in post-level predictions is over longer threads.",
        "If we evaluate the two models over DA superclasses only (ignoring mismatches at the subclass level for Question and Answer), the post-level F-scores for joint classification with ALL features for CRFSGD and MaltParser are 0.803 and 0.787, respectively.",

        "From the results, we can see that both CRFSGD and MaltParser are very robust when applied to partial threads, to the extent that we actually achieve higher results over shortened versions of the thread than over the complete thread in some instances, although the only difference that is statistically significant is over [1, 8] for CRFSGD, where the prediction over the partial thread is actually superior to that over the complete thread.",
