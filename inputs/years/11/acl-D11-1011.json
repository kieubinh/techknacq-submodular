        "Many natural language processing applications use and rely on semantic knowledge resources.",
        "Since manually built lexical repositories such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) cover a limited amount of knowledge and are tedious to maintain over time, researchers have developed algorithms for automatic knowledge extraction from structured and unstructured texts.",
        "There is a substantial body of work on extracting is-a relations (Etzioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008), part-of relations (Girju et al., 2003; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) and general facts (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Davidov and Rappoport, 2009; Jain and Pantel, 2010).",
        "The usefulness of the generated resources has been shown to be valuable to information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999), question answering (Katz et al., 2003) and textual entailment (Zanzotto et al., 2006) systems.",
        "Among the most common knowledge acquisition approaches are those based on lexical patterns (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005; Kozareva et al., 2008) and clustering (Lin and Pantel, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2008).",
        "While clustering can find instances and classes that are not explicitly expressed in text, they often may not generate the granularity needed by the users.",
        "In contrast, pattern-based approaches generate highly accurate lists, but they are constraint to the information matched by the pattern and often suffer from recall.",
        "(Pasxa, 2004; Snow et al., 2006; Kozareva and Hovy, 2010) have shown that complete lists of semantic classes and instances are valuable for the enrichment of existing resources like WordNet and for taxonomy induction.",
        "Therefore, researchers have focused on the development of methods that can automatically augment the initially extracted class-instance pairs.",
        "(Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009) fused information from pattern-based and distributional systems using an ensemble method and a rich set of features derived from query logs, web-crawl and Wikipedia.",
        "(Talukdar et al., 2008) improved class-instance extractions exploring the relationships between the classes and the instances to propagate the initial class-labels to the remaining unlabeled instances.",
        "Later on (Talukdar and Pereira, 2010) showed that class-instance extraction with label propagation can be further improved by adding semantic information in the form of instance-attribute edges derived from independently developed knowledge base.",
        "Similarly to (Talukdar et al., 2008) and (Talukdar and Pereira, 2010), we are interested in enriching class-instance extractions with label propagation.",
        "However, unlike the previous work, we model the relationships between the instances themselves to propagate the initial set of class labels to the remaining unlabeled instances.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the connections between instances for the task of class-label propagation.",
        "Our work addresses the following question: Is it possible to effectively explore the structure of the text-mined instance-instance networks to enhance an incomplete set of class labels?",
        "Our intuition is that if an instance like bear belongs to a semantic class carnivore, and the instance bear is connected to the instance fox, then it is more likely that the unlabeled instance fox is also of class carnivore.",
        "To solve this problem, we propose two graph-based approaches that use the structure of the instance-instance graph to propagate the class labels.",
        "Our methods are agnostic to the sources of semantic instances and classes.",
        "In this work, we carried out experiments with a state-of-the-art instance extraction system and conducted a comparative study between the original and the enhanced class-instance pairs.",
        "The results show that this labeling procedure can begin to bridge the gap between the extraction power of the pattern-based approaches and the desired recall by finding class-instance pairs that are not explicitly mentioned in text.",
        "The contributions of the paper are as follows:",
        "• We use only the relationships between the instances themselves to propagate class labels.",
        "• We observe how often labels are propagated along the edges of our semantic network, and propose two ways to extend an initial set of class labels to all the instance nodes in the network.",
        "The first approach uses a linear system to compute the network centrality relative to the initially labeled instances.",
        "The second approach uses a regularization framework with respect to a random walk on the network.",
        "• We evaluate the proposed approaches and show that they discover many new class-instance pairs compared to state-of-the-art knowledge",
        "harvesting algorithm, while still maintaining high accuracy.",
        "• We conduct a comparative study between class-instance and instance-instance graphs used to propagate class labels.",
        "The experiments show that considering relationships between instances achieves higher accuracy.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we review related work.",
        "Section 3 describes the Web-based knowledge harvesting algorithm used to extract the instance network and the class-instance pairs necessary for our experimental evaluation.",
        "Section 4 describes the two graph-theoretic methods for class label propagation using an instance-instance network.",
        "Section 5 shows a comparative study between the proposed graph algorithms and different baselines.",

When we extend this intuition to all the in-neighbors, we say that the score of each node is proportional to the sum of the scores of its in-neighbors scaled by the edge weights: l (v) = (uv)eE l(u)w(u,v).",

        "This study verifies our intuition that using the relationships between the instances to extend a class label to the remaining unlabeled nodes is an effective approach to enhancing an incomplete set of initial labels.",
        "The objective of our work is given a set of initially labeled nodes L, to assign to each node a score that indicates how likely it is to belong to L. The simplest way to do this using the edges of the instance network is to say that a node that has more in-neighbors that have a certain label is more likely to have this label.",

        "Table 4 shows the accuracy at rank R calculated as the number of correctly labeled instances with class C at rank R divided by the total number of instances with class C at rank R. Due to space limitation, we show detailed ranking only for three of the classes.",
