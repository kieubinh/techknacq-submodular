        "With the rapidly expanding e-commerce, most retail Web sites encourage consumers to write reviews to express their opinions on various aspects of products.",
        "Huge collections of consumer reviews are now available on the Web.",
        "These reviews have become an important resource for both consumers and firms.",
        "Consumers commonly seek quality information from online consumer reviews prior to purchasing a product, while many firms use online reviews as an important resource in their product development, marketing, and consumer relationship management.",
        "However, the reviews are disorganized, leading to the difficulty in information navigation and knowledge acquisition.",
        "It is impractical for user to grasp the overview of consumer reviews and opinions on various aspects of a product from such enormous reviews.",
        "Among hundreds of product aspects, it is also inefficient for user to browse consumer reviews and opinions on a specific aspect.",
        "Thus, there is a compelling need to organize consumer reviews, so as to transform the reviews into a useful knowledge structure.",
        "Since the hierarchy can improve information representation and accessibility (Cimiano, 2006), we propose to organize the aspects of a product into a hierarchy and generate a hierarchical organization of consumer reviews accordingly.",
        "Towards automatically deriving an aspect hierarchy from the reviews, we could refer to traditional hierarchy generation methods in ontology learning, which first identify concepts from the text, then determine the parent-child relations between these concepts using either pattern-based or clustering-based methods (Murthy et al., 2010).",
        "However, pattern-based methods usually suffer from inconsistency of parent-child relationships among the concepts, while clustering-based methods often result in low accuracy.",
        "Thus, by directly utilizing these methods to generate an aspect hierarchy from consumer reviews, the resulting hierarchy is usually inaccurate, leading to unsatisfactory review organization.",
        "On the other hand, domain knowledge of products is now available on the Web.",
        "For example, there are more than 248,474 product specifications in the product selling Web site CNet.com (Beckham, 2005).",
        "These product specifications cover some product aspects and provide coarse-grained parent-child relations among these aspects.",
        "Such domain knowledge is useful to help organize the product aspects into a hierarchy.",
        "However, the initial hierarchy obtained from domain knowledge usually cannot fit the review data well.",
        "For example, the initial hierarchy is usually too coarse and may not cover the specific aspects commented in the reviews, while some aspects in the hierarchy may not be of interests to users in the reviews.",
        "Motivated by the above observations, we propose in this paper to organize the product aspects into a hierarchy by simultaneously exploiting the domain knowledge (e.g., the product specification) and consumer reviews.",
        "With derived aspect hierarchy, we generate a hierarchical organization of consumer reviews on various aspects and aggregate consumer opinions on these aspects.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a sample of hierarchical review organization for the product \"iPhone 3G\".",
        "With such organization, users can easily grasp the overview of product aspects as well as conveniently navigate the consumer reviews and opinions on any aspect.",
        "For example, users can find that 623 reviews, out of 9,245 reviews, are about the aspect \"price\", with 241 positive and 382 negative reviews.",
        "Given a collection of consumer reviews on a specific product, we first automatically acquire an initial aspect hierarchy from domain knowledge and identify the aspects from the reviews.",
        "Based on the initial hierarchy, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach to construct an aspect hierarchy to contain all the identified aspects.",
        "Our approach incrementally inserts the aspects into the initial hierarchy based on inter-aspect semantic distance, a metric used to measure the semantic relation among aspects.",
        "In order to derive reliable semantic distance, we propose to leverage external hierarchies, sampled from WordNet and Open Directory Project, to assist semantic distance learning.",
        "With resultant aspect hierarchy, the consumer reviews are then organized to their corresponding aspect nodes in the hierarchy.",
        "We then perform sentiment classification to determine consumer opinions on these aspects.",
        "Furthermore, we apply the hierarchy to the task of implicit aspect identification.",
        "This task aims to infer implicit aspects of the reviews that do not explicitly express those aspects but actually comment on them.",
        "For example, the implicit aspect of the review \"It is so expensive\" is \"price.\"",
        "Most existing aspect identification approaches rely on the appearance of aspect terms, and thus are not able to handle implicit aspect problem.",
        "Based on our aspect hierarchy, we can infer the implicit aspects by clustering the reviews into their corresponding aspect nodes in the hierarchy.",
        "We conduct experiments on 11 popular products in four domains.",
        "More details of the corpus are discussed in Section 4.",
        "The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",
        "The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:",
        "1) We propose to hierarchically organize consumer reviews according to an aspect hierarchy, so as to transfer the reviews into a useful knowledge structure.",
        "2) We develop a domain-assisted approach to generate an aspect hierarchy by integrating domain knowledge and consumer reviews.",
        "In order to derive reliable semantic distance between aspects, we propose to leverage external hierarchies to assist semantic distance learning.",
        "3) We apply the aspect hierarchy to the task of implicit aspect identification, and achieve satisfactory performance.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Our approach is elaborated in Section 2 and applied to implicit aspect identification in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 presents the evaluations, while Section 5 reviews related work.",

      "text": [
        "Our approach consists of four components, including initial hierarchy acquisition, aspect identification, semantic distance learning, and aspect hierarchy generation.",
        "Next, we first define some preliminary and notations and then elaborate these components.",
        "Preliminary 1.",
        "An aspect hierarchy is defined as a tree that consists of a set of unique aspects A and a set of parent-child relations R between these aspects.",
        "Given the consumer reviews of a product, let A = [a\\, • • • , ak} denotes the product aspects commented in the reviews.",
        "H°(A°, R°) denotes the initial hierarchy derived from domain knowledge.",
        "It contains a set of aspects A and relations R. Our task is to construct an aspect hierarchy H (A, R), to cover all the aspects in A and their parent-child relations R, so that the consumer reviews are hierarchically organized.",
        "Note that H° can be empty.",
        "As aforementioned, product specifications on product selling websites cover some product aspects and coarse-grained parent-child relations among these aspects.",
        "Such domain knowledge is useful to help organize aspects into a hierarchy.",
        "We here employ the approach proposed by Ye and Chua (2006) to automatically acquire an initial aspect hierarchy from the product specifications.",
        "The method first identifies the Web page region covering product descriptions and removes the irrelevant contents from the Web page.",
        "It then parses the region containing the product information to identify the aspects as well as their structure.",
        "Based on the aspects and their structure, it generates an aspect hierarchy.",
        "To identify aspects in consumer reviews, we first parse each review using the Stanford parser .",
        "Since the aspects in consumer reviews are usually noun or noun phrases (Liu, 2009), we extract the noun phrases (NP) from the parse tree as aspect candidates.",
        "While these candidates may contain much noise, we leverage Pros and Cons reviews (see Figure 2), which are prevalent in forum Web sites, to assist identify aspects from the candidates.",
        "It has been shown that simply extracting the frequent noun terms from the Pros and Cons reviews can get high accurate aspect terms (Liu el al., 2005).",
        "Thus, we extract the frequent noun terms from Pros and Cons reviews as features, then train a one-class SVM (Manevitz et al., 2002) to identify aspects from the candidates.",
        "While the obtained aspects may contain some synonym terms, such as \"earphone\" and \"headphone\", we further perform synonym clustering to get unique aspects.",
        "Specifically, we first expand each aspect term with its synonym terms obtained from the synonym terms Web site , then cluster them to obtain unique aspects based on unigram feature.",
        "Our aspect hierarchy generation approach is essentially based on the semantic relations among aspects.",
        "We here define a metric, Semantic Distance, d(ax, ay), to quantitatively measure the semantic relation between aspects ax and ay.",
        "We formulate d(ax, ay) as the weighted sum of some underlying features, where Wj is the weight for j-th feature function",
        "fj(•).",
        "Next, we first introduce the linguistic features used in our work and then present the semantic distance learning algorithm that aims to find the optimal weights in Eq.",
        "(1).",
        "Given two aspects ax and ay, a feature is defined as a function generating a numeric score f (ax, ay) or a vector of scores.",
        "The features include Contextual, Co-occurrence, Syntactic, Pattern and Lexical features (Yang and Callan, 2009).",
        "These features are generated based on auxiliary documents collected from Web.",
        "Specifically, we issue each aspect term and aspect term pair as queries to Google and Wikipedia, respectively, and collect the top 100 returned documents of each query.",
        "We then split the documents into sentences.",
        "Based on these documents and sentences, the features are generated as follows.",
        "Contextual features.",
        "For each aspect, we collect the documents containing the aspect as context to build a unigram language model without smoothing.",
        "Given two aspects, the KL-divergence between their language models is computed as the Global-Context feature between them.",
        "Similarly, we collect the left two and right two words surrounding each aspect as context and build a unigram language model.",
        "The KL-divergence between the language models of two aspects is defined as the Local-Context feature.",
        "Co-occurrence features.",
        "We measure the cooccurrence of two aspects by Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI): PMI(ax,ay)=log(Count(ax,ay)/ Count(ax) Count(ay)), where Count(-) stands for the number of documents or sentences containing the aspect(s), or the number of Google document hits for the aspect(s).",
        "Based on different definitions of Count(-), we define the features of Document PMI, Sentence PMI, and Google PMI, respectively.",
        "Syntactic features.",
        "We parse the sentences that contain each aspect pair into syntactic trees via the Stanford Parser.",
        "The Syntactic-path feature is defined as the average length of the shortest syntactic path between the aspect pair in the tree.",
        "In addition, for each aspect, we collect a set of sentences containing it, and label the semantic role of the sentences via ASSERT parser .",
        "Given two aspects, the number of the Subject terms overlaps between their sentence sets is computed as the Subject Overlap feature.",
        "Similarly, for other semantic roles, such as objects, modifiers, and verbs, we define the features of Object Overlap, Modifier Overlap, and Verb Overlap, respectively.",
        "Pattern features.",
        "46 patterns are used in our work, including 6 patterns indicating the hypernym relations of two aspects (Hearst, 1992), and 40 patterns measuring the part-of relations of two aspects (Girju et al., 2006).",
        "These pattern features are asymmetric, and they take the parent-child relations among the aspects into consideration.",
        "All the patterns are listed in Appendix A (submitted as supplementary material).",
        "Based on these patterns, a 46-dimensional score vector is obtained for each aspect pair.",
        "A score is 1 if two aspects match a pattern, and 0 otherwise.",
        "Lexical features.",
        "We take the word length difference between two aspects, as Length Difference feature.",
        "In addition, we issue the query \"define:aspect\" to Google, and collect the definition of each aspect.",
        "We then count the word overlaps between the definitions of two aspects, as Definition Overlap feature.",
        "This section elaborates the learning algorithm that optimizes the semantic distance metric, i.e., the weighting parameters in Eq.(1).",
        "Typically, we can utilize the initial hierarchy as training data.",
        "The ground-truth distance between two aspects dP (ax, ay) is generated by summing up all the edge distances along the shortest path between ax and ay, where every edge weight is assumed as 1.",
        "The distance metric is then obtained by solving the following optimization problem, where m is the dimension of linguistic feature, n is a tradeoff parameter.",
        "Eq.",
        "(2) can be rewrote to its matrix form as, where vector d contains the ground-truth distance of all the aspect pairs.",
        "Each element corresponds to the distance of certain aspect pair, and f is the corresponding feature vector.",
        "The optimal solution of w is given as where I is the identity metric.",
        "The above learning algorithm can perform well when sufficient training data (i.e., aspect (term) pairs) is available.",
        "However, the initial hierarchy is usually too coarse and thus cannot provide sufficient information.",
        "On the other hand, abundant handcrafted hierarchies are available on the Web, such as WordNet and Open Directory Project (ODP).",
        "We here propose to leverage these external hierarchies to assist semantic distance learning.",
        "A distance metric wo is learned from the external hierarchies using the above algorithm.",
        "Since w0 might be biased to the characteristics of the external hierarchies, directly using w0 in our task may not perform well.",
        "Alternatively, we use w0 as prior knowledge to assist learning the optimal distance metric w from the initial hierarchy.",
        "The learning problem is formulated as follows,",
        "where n and y are tradeoff parameters.",
        "The optimal solution of w can be obtained as",
        "As a result, we can compute the semantic distance between each two aspects according to Eq.",

        "Inspired by Yang and Callan (2009), we adopt a multi-criteria optimization approach to incrementally insert the aspects into appropriate positions in the hierarchy based on multiple criteria.",
        "Before going to the details, we first introduce an information function to measure the amount of information carried in a hierarchy.",
        "An information function Info(H) is defined as the sum of the semantic distances of all the aspect pairs in the hierarchy (Yang and Callan, 2009).",

        "Semantic Inconsistency is introduced to quantify the inconsistency between the semantic distance estimated via the hierarchy and that computed from the feature functions.",
        "We assume that a good hierarchy should precisely reflect the semantic distance between aspects.",
        "For two aspects, their semantic distance reflected by the hierarchy is computed as the sum of adjacent distances along the shortest path between them,",
        "Based on this information function, we then introduce the following three criteria for aspect insertion:",
        "where SP (ax, ay) is the shortest path between the aspects (ax,ay), (ap,aq) are the adjacent nodes along the path.",
        "We then define the following criteria to find the hierarchy with minimum semantic inconsistency, where d(ax, ay) is the distance computed based on the feature functions in Section 2.4.",
        "Through integrating the above criteria, the multi-criteria optimization framework is formulated as, obj = arg min(Ai • obji + A2 • obj2 + A3 • obj3) Ai + A2 + A3 = 1; 0 < Ai, A2, A3 < 1.",
        "where A1, A2, A3 are the tradeoff parameters.",
        "To summarize, our aspect hierarchy generation process starts from an initial hierarchy and inserts the aspects into it one-by-one until all the aspects are allocated.",
        "Each aspect is inserted to the optimal position found by Eq.(14).",
