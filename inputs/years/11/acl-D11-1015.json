        "As an important task of sentiment analysis, polarity classification is critically affected by discourse structure (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006).",
        "Previous research developed discourse schema (Asher et al., 2008) (Somasundaran et al., 2008) and proved that the utilization of discourse relations could improve the performance of polarity classification on dialogues (Somasundaran et al., 2009).",
        "However, current state-of-the-art methods for sentence-level polarity classification are facing difficulties in ascertaining the polarity of some sentences.",
        "For example:",
        "(a) [Although Fujimori was criticized by the international community], [he was loved by the domestic population], [because people hated the corrupted ruling class].",
        "(f√ºll*",
        "Example (a) is a positive sentence holding a Contrast relation between first two segments and a Cause relation between last two segments.",
        "The polarity of \"criticized\", \"hated\" and \"corrupted\" are recognized as negative expressions while \"loved\" is recognized as a positive expression.",
        "Example (a) is difficult for existing polarity classification methods for two reasons: (1) the number of positive expressions is less than negative expressions; (2) the importance of each sentiment expression is unknown.",
        "However, consider Figure 1, if we know that the polarity of the first two segments holding a Contrast relation is determined by the nucleus (Mann and Thompson, 1988) segment and the polarity of the last two segments holding a Cause relation is also determined by the nucleus segment, the polarity ofthe sentence will be determined by the polarity of \"[he...population]\".",
        "Thus, the polarity of Example (a) is positive.",
        "Statistics showed that 43% of the opinionated sentences in NTCIR MOAT (Multilingual Opinion Analysis Task) Chinese corpus are ambiguous.",
        "Existing sentence-level polarity classification methods ignoring discourse structure often give wrong results for these sentences.",
        "We implemented state-of-the[because...class] J",
        "Contrast",
        "art method (Xu and Kit, 2010) in NTCIR-8 Chinese MOAT as the baseline polarity classifier (BPC) in this paper.",
        "Error analysis of BPC showed that 49% errors came from ambiguous sentences.",
        "In this paper, we focused on the automation of recognizing intra-sentence level discourse relations for polarity classification.",
        "Based on the previous work of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988), a discourse scheme with discourse constraints on polarity was defined empirically (see Section 3).",
        "The scheme contains 5 relations: Contrast, Condition, Continuation, Cause and Purpose.",
        "From a raw corpus, a small set of cue-phrase-based patterns were used to collect discourse instances.",
        "These instances were then converted to semantic sequential representations (SSRs).",
        "Finally, an unsupervised SSR learner was adopted to generate, weigh and filter high quality new SSRs without cue phrases.",

        "There was little research focusing on the automatic recognition of intra-sentence level discourse relations for sentiment analysis in the literature.",
        "Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) argued that valence calculation is critically affected by discourse structure.",
        "Asher et al.",
        "(2008) proposed a shallow semantic representation using a feature structure and use five types of rhetorical relations to build a finegrained corpus for deep contextual sentiment analysis.",
        "Nevertheless, they did not propose a computational model for their discourse scheme.",
        "Snyder and Barzilay (2007) combined an agreement model based on contrastive RST relations with a local aspect model to make a more informed overall decision for sentiment classification.",
        "Nonetheless, contrastive relations were only one type of discourse relations which may help polarity classification.",
        "Sadamitsu et al.",
        "(2008) modeled polarity reversal using HCRFs integrated with inter-sentence discourse structures.",
        "However, our work is on intra-sentence level and our purpose is not to find polarity reversals but trying to adapt general discourse schemes (e.g., RST) to help determine the overall polarity of ambiguous sentences.",
        "The most closely related works were (Somasun-daran et al., 2008) and (Somasundaran et al., 2009), which proposed opinion frames as a representation of discourse-level associations on dialogue and modeled the scheme to improve opinion polarity classification.",
        "However, opinion frames was difficult to be implemented because the recognition of opinion target was very challenging in general text.",
        "Our work differs from their approaches in two key aspects: (1) we distinguished nucleus and satellite in discourse but opinion frames did not; (2) our method for discourse discovery was unsupervised while their method needed annotated data.",
        "Most research works about discourse classification were not related to sentiment analysis.",
        "Supervised discourse classification methods (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Duverle and Prendinger, 2009) needed manually annotated data.",
        "Marcu and Echi-habi (2002) presented an unsupervised method to recognize discourse relations held between arbitrary spans of text.",
        "They showed that lexical pairs extracted from massive amount of data can have a major impact on discourse classification.",

        "P [he...population]",
        "were usually costly and impractical when dealing with large scale of text.",

        "Since not all of the discourse relations in RST would help eliminate polarity ambiguities, the discourse scheme defined in this paper was on a much coarser level.",

        "We found that 13 relations from RST occupied about 70% of the annotated discourse relations which may help eliminate polarity ambiguities.",

        "Cue-phrase-based patterns could find only limited number of discourse instances with high precision (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",
        "Therefore, we could not rely on cue-phrase-based patterns alone.",
        "Moreover, there was no annotated corpus similar to Penn Discourse TreeBank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004) in other languages such as Chinese.",
        "Thus, we proposed a language independent unsupervised method to identify discourse relations without cue phrases while maintaining relatively high precision.",
        "For each discourse relation, we started with several cue-phrase-based patterns and collected a large number of discourse instances from raw corpus.",

        "Table 1 listed some examples of cue phrases for each discourse relation.",
        "Some cue phrases were singleton (e.g. \"although\" and \"as a result\") and some were used as a pair (e.g. \"not only, but also\").",

        "Note that we did not distinguish satellite from nucleus for Continuation in this paper because the polarity could be determined by either segment.",

        "To simplify the problem of discourse segmentation, we split compound sentences into discourse segments using commas and semicolons.",
        "Although we collected discourse instances from compound sentences only, the number of instances for each discourse relation was large enough for the proposed unsupervised method.",
        "Note that we only collected instances containing at least one sentiment word in each segment.",
        "In order to incorporate lexical and semantic information in our method, we represented each word in a discourse instance using a part-of-speech tag, a semantic label and a sentiment tag.",
        "Then, all discourse instances were converted to SSRs.",

        "Consider Table 3, in common SSRs, full matches were preserved, partial matches were replaced by part of speech tags and mismatches were replaced by '*'s.",
        "The common SSRs generated during the calculation of match(di, dj) consisted of two parts.",

        "that di and dj could generate a common SSR if and only if the orders of nucleus segment and satellite segment were the same.",
        "In order to guarantee relatively high quality common SSRs, we empirically set the upper threshold of the number of mismatches as 0.5 (i.e., < 1/2 of the number of words in the generated SSR).",
        "It's not difficult to figure out that the number of mismatches generated in Table 3 satisfied this requirement.",
        "As a result, for each discourse relation rn, a corresponding common SSR set Sn could be obtained by adopting match(di, dj) where i = j for all discourse instances.",
        "An advantage of match(d1,d2) was that the generated common SSRs preserved the sequential structure of original discourse instances.",
        "And common SSRs allows us to build high precision discourse classifiers (See Section 5).",
        "Weighing and filtering common SSRs",
        "A problem of match(di, dj) was that it ignored some important information by treating different mismatches equally.",
        "For example, the adverb \"very\" in \"very brilliant\" of D1 was not important for discourse recognition.",
        "In other words, the number of mismatches in match(di, dj) could not precisely reflect the confidence of the generated common SSRs.",
        "Therefore, it was needed to weigh different mismatches for the confidence calculation of common",
        "SSRs.",
        "Intuitively, if a partial match or a mismatch (denoted by um) occurred very frequently in the generation of common SSRs, the importance of um tends to diminish.",
        "Inspired by the tf-idf model, given ssriESn, we utilized the following equation to estimate the weight (denoted by wm) of um.",
        "Wm = ‚Äì ufm ' log (lSn|/ssrf m ) where uf m denoted the frequency of um during the generation of ssri, |Sn| denoted the size of Sn and ssrfm denoted the number of common SSRs in Sn containing um .",
        "All weights were normalized to [ ‚Äì 1, 0).",
        "Nouns (except for named entities) and verbs were most representative words in discourse recognition (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).",
        "In addition, adjectives and adverbs appearing in sentiment lexicons were important for polarity classification.",
        "Therefore, for these 4 kinds of words, we utilized ‚Äì 1.0 for a mismatch and ‚Äì 0.50 for a partial match.",
        "As we had got the weights for all partial matches and mismatches, the confidence of ssrieSn could be calculated using the cumulation of weights of partial matches and mismatches in ssri[1] and ssri[2].",
        "Recall Table 3, conf (ssr^]) and conf (ssr[2]) represented the confidence scores of match(di[1], dj[i]) and match(di[2], dj[2]), respectively.",

        "The value of minconf was tuned using the development data.",

        "Moreover, since many of the SSRs were duplicated, we ranked all the generated SSRs according to their occurrences and dropped those appearing only once in order to preserve common SSRs.",
