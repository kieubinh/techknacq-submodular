        "Statistical topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) provide a powerful framework for representing and summarizing the contents of large document collections.",
        "In our experience, however, the primary obstacle to acceptance of statistical topic models by users the outside machine learning community is the presence of poor quality topics.",
        "Topics that mix unrelated or loosely-related concepts substantially reduce users' confidence in the utility of such automated systems.",
        "In general, users prefer models with larger numbers of topics because such models have greater resolution and are able to support finer-grained distinctions.",
        "Unfortunately, we have observed that there is a strong relationship between the size of topics and the probability of topics being nonsensical as judged by domain experts: as the number of topics increases, the smallest topics (number of word tokens assigned to each topic) are almost always poor quality.",
        "The common practice of displaying only a small number of example topics hides the fact that as many as 10% of topics may be so bad that they cannot be shown without reducing users' confidence.",
        "The evaluation of statistical topic models has traditionally been dominated by either extrinsic methods (i.e., using the inferred topics to perform some external task such as information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006)) or quantitative intrinsic methods, such as computing the probability of held-out documents (Wallach et al., 2009).",
        "Recent work has focused on evaluation of topics as semantically-coherent concepts.",
        "For example, Chang et al.",
        "(2009) found that the probability of held-out documents is not always a good predictor of human judgments.",
        "Newman et al.",
        "(2010) showed that an automated evaluation metric based on word co-occurrence statistics gathered from Wikipedia could predict human evaluations of topic quality.",
        "AlSumait et al.",
        "(2009) used differences between topic-specific distributions over words and the corpus-wide distribution over words to identify overly-general \"vacuous\" topics.",
        "Finally, Andrzejewski et al.",
        "(2009) developed semi-supervised methods that avoid specific user-labeled semantic coherence problems.",
        "The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) To identify distinct classes of low-quality topics, some of which are not flagged by existing evaluation methods; (2) to introduce a new topic \"coherence\" score that corresponds well with human coherence judgments and makes it possible to identify specific semantic problems in topic models without human evaluations or external reference corpora; (3) to present an example of a new topic model that learns latent topics by directly optimizing a metric of topic coherence.",
        "With little additional computational cost beyond that of LDA, this model exhibits significant gains in average topic coherence score.",
        "Although the model does not result in a statistically-significant reduction in the number of topics marked \"bad\", the model consistently improves the topic coherence score of the ten lowest-scoring topics (i.e., results in bad topics that are \"less bad\" than those found using LDA) while retaining the ability to identify low-quality topics without human interaction."

        "LDA is a generative probabilistic model for documents W = , w(2),..., To generate a word token wffl in document d, we draw a discrete topic assignment from a document-specific distribution over the T topics 6d (which is itself drawn from a Dirichlet prior with hyperparameter a), and then draw a word type for that token from the topic-specific distribution over the vocabulary 4> (d. The inference task in topic models is generally cast as inferring the document-topic proportions {01}6D} and the topic-specific distributions {4>1..., 4>T}.",
        "The multinomial topic distributions are usually drawn from a shared symmetric Dirichlet prior with hyperparameter ß, such that conditioned on {4>t}J=1and the topic assignments z(2),..., z(D)}, the word tokens are independent.",
        "In practice, however, it is common to deal directly with the \"collapsed\" distributions that result from integrating over the topic-specific multinomial parameters.",
        "The resulting distribution over words for a topic t is then a function of the hyperparameter ß and the number of words of each type assigned to that topic, Nw|t.",
        "This distribution, known as the Dirichlet compound multinomial (DCM) or Polya distribution (Doyle and Elkan, 2009), breaks the assumption of conditional independence between word tokens given topics, but is useful during inference because the conditional probability of a word w given topic t takes a very simple form: P(w 11, ß) = N+lv/ff, where Nt = w Nwi\\t and |V| is the vocabulary size.",
        "The process for generating a sequence of words from such a model is known as the simple Polya urn model (Mahmoud, 2008), in which the initial probability of word type w in topic t is proportional to ß, while the probability of each subsequent occurrence of w in topic t is proportional to the number of times w has been drawn in that topic plus ß.",
        "Note that this unnormalized weight for each word type depends only on the count of that word type, and is independent of the count of any other word type w'.",
        "Thus, in the DCM/Polya distribution, drawing word type w must decrease the probability of seeing all other word types w' = w. In a later section, we will introduce a topic model that substitutes a generalized Polya urn model for the DCM/Polya distribution, allowing a draw of word type w to increase the probability of seeing certain other word types.",
        "For real-world data, documents W are observed, while the corresponding topic assignments Z are unobserved and may be inferred using either varior MCMC methods (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "Here, we use MCMC methods – specifically Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984), which involves sequentially resampling each topic assignment z>nd from its conditional posterior given the documents W, the hyperparameters a and ß, and Z\\d,n (the current topic assignments for all tokens other than the token at position n in document d)."

        "The experts first categorized each topic as one of three types: \"research\", \"grant mechanisms and publication types\" or \"general\".",
        "The quality of each topic (\"good\", \"intermediate\", or \"bad\") was then evaluated using criteria specific to the type of topic.",

        "Additionally, each \"research\" topic was only considered to be \"good\" if, in addition to representing a single coherent concept, the aggregate content of the set of documents with appreciable allocations to that topic clearly contained text referring to the concept inferred from the topic words.",
        "Finally, for each topic marked as being either \"intermediate\" or \"bad\", one or more of the following problems (defined by the domain experts) was identified, as appropriate:",

        "For example, a topic whose top three words are \"acids\", \"fatty\" and \"nucleic\" consists of two distinct concepts (i.e., acids produced when fats are broken down versus the building blocks of DNA and RNA) chained via the word \"acids\".",
        "• Intruded: either two or more unrelated sets of related words, joined arbitrarily, or an otherwise good topic with a few \"intruder\" words.",
        "• Random: no clear, sensical connections between more than a few pairs of words.",
        "• Unbalanced: the top words are all logically connected to each other, but the topic combines very general and specific terms (e.g., \"signal",
        "transduction\" versus \"notch signaling\").",
        "Examples of a good general topic, a good research topic, and a chained research topic are in Table 1.",
        "The experts annotated the topics independently and then aggregated their results.",
        "Interestingly, no topics were ever considered \"good\" by one expert and \"bad\" by the other – when there was disagreement between the experts, one expert always believed the topic to be \"intermediate.\"",

        "Although the topic coherence metric defined above provides an accurate way of assessing topic quality, preventing poor quality topics from occurring in the first place is preferable.",
        "Our results in the previous section show that we can identify low-quality topics without making use of external supervision; the training data by itself contains sufficient information at least to reject poor combinations of words.",
        "In this section, we describe a new topic model that incorporates the corpus-specific word co-occurrence information used in our coherence metric directly into the statistical topic modeling framework.",
        "It is important to note that simply disallowing words that never co-occur from being assigned to the same topic is not sufficient.",
        "Due to the power-law characteristics of language, most words are rare and will not co-occur with most other words regardless of their semantic similarity.",
        "It is rather the degree to which the most prominent words in a topic do not co-occur with the other most prominent words in that topic that is an indicator of topic incoherence.",
        "We therefore desire models that guide topics towards semantic similarity without imposing hard constraints.",
        "As an example of such a model, we present a new topic model in which the occurrence of word type w in topic t increases not only the probability ofseeing that word type again, but also increases the probability of seeing other related words (as determined by co-document frequencies for the corpus being modeled).",
        "This new topic model retains the document-topic component of standard LDA, but replaces the usual Polya urn topic-word component with a generalized Polya urn framework (Mahmoud, 2008).",
        "A sequence of i.i.d.",
        "samples from a discrete distribution can be imagined as arising by repeatedly drawing a random ball from an urn, where the number of balls of each color is proportional to the probability of that color, replacing the selected ball after each draw.",
        "In a Polya urn, each ball is replaced along with another ball ofthe same color.",
        "Samples from this model exhibit the \"burstiness\" property: the probability of drawing a ball of color w increases each time a ball of that color is drawn.",
        "This process represents the marginal distribution of a hierarchical model with a Dirichlet prior and a multinomial likelihood, and is used as the distribution over words for each topic in almost all previous topic models.",
        "In a generalized Polya urn model, having drawn a ball of color w, Avw additional balls of each color v G {1,... ,W} are returned to the urn.",
        "Given W and Z, the conditional posterior probability of word w in topic t implied by this generalized model is where A is a W x W real-valued matrix, known as the addition matrix or schema.",
        "The simple Polya urn model (and hence the conditional posterior probability of word w in topic t under LDA) can be recovered by setting the schema A to the identity matrix.",
        "Unlike the simple Polya distribution, we do not know of a representation of the generalized Polya urn distribution that can be expressed using a concise set of conditional independence assumptions.",
        "A standard graphical model with plate notation would therefore not be helpful in highlighting the differences between the two models, and is not shown.",
        "Algorithm 1 shows pseudocode for a single Gibbs sweep over the latent variables Z in standard LDA.",

        "support a generalized Polya urn model: rather than subtracting exactly one from the count of the word given the old topic, sampling, and then adding one to the count of the word given the new topic, we subtract a column of the schema matrix from the entire count vector over words for the old topic, sample, and add the same column to the count vector for the new topic.",
        "As long as A is sparse, this operation adds only a constant factor to the computation.",
        "Another property of the generalized Polya urn model is that it is nonexchangeable – the joint probability of the tokens in any given topic is not invariant to permutation of those tokens.",
        "Inference of Z given W via Gibbs sampling involves repeatedly cycling through the tokens in W and, for each one, resampling its topic assignment conditioned on W and the current topic assignments for all tokens other than the token of interest.",
        "For LDA, the sampling distribution for each topic assignment is simply the product of two predictive probabilities, obtained by treating the token of interest as if it were the last.",
        "For a topic model with a generalized Polya urn for the topic-word component, the sampling distribution is more complicated.",
        "Specifically, the topic-word component of the sampling distribution is no longer a simple predictive distribution – when sampling a new value for , the implication of each possible value for subsequent tokens and their topic assignments must be considered.",
        "Unfortunately, this can be very computationally expensive, particularly for large corpora.",
        "There are several ways around this problem.",
        "The first is to use sequential Monte Carlo methods, which have been successfully applied to topic models previously (Canini et al., 2009).",
        "The second approach is to approximate the true Gibbs sampling distribution by treating each token as if it were the last, ignoring implications for subsequent tokens and their topic assignments.",
        "We find that this approximate method performs well empirically.",
        "Inspired by our evaluation metric, we define A as where each element is scaled by a row-specific weight Xv and each column is normalized to sum to 1.",
        "Normalizing columns makes comparison to standard LDA simpler, because the relative effect of smoothing parameter ß = 0.01 is equivalent.",
        "We set Xv = log (D / D(v)), the standard IDF weight used in information retrieval, which is larger for less frequent words.",
        "The column for word type w can be interpreted as word types with significant association with w. The IDF weighting therefore has the effect of increasing the strength of association for rare word types.",
        "We also found empirically that it is helpful to remove off-diagonal elements for the most common types, such as those that occur in more than 5% of documents (IDF < 3.0).",
        "Including nonzero off-diagonal values in A for very frequent types causes the model to disperse those types over many topics, which leads to large numbers of extremely similar topics.",
        "To measure this effect, we calculated the Jensen-Shannon divergence between all pairs of topic-word distributions in a given model.",
