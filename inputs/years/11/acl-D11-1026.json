        "That is why improved quality of text segmentation can benefit other language-processing tasks.",

        "The original AP algorithm considerably improved exemplar-based clustering both in terms of speed and the quality of solutions.",

        "Each iteration considers all similarities - takes into account all available information.",
        "An iteration includes sending at most O(N) messages.",
        "For the majority of realistic segmentation tasks, however, the upper bound is O(MN) messages, where M is a constant.",
        "This is more computationally expensive than the requirements of locally informed segmentation algorithms such as those based on HMM or CRF (see Section 2), but for a globally-informed algorithm the requirements are very reasonable.",

        "Such Minimum Cut segmentation resembles APS the most among others mentioned in this paper.",

        "Such methods output segment boundaries and suggest lexical distribution associated with each segment.",
        "Generative models tend to perform well, but are less flexible than the similarity-based models when it comes to incorporating new kinds of information.",
        "Globally informed models generally perform better, especially on more challenging datasets such as speech recordings, but they have - unsurprisingly higher memory and CPU time requirements.",
        "The APS algorithm described in this paper combines several desirable properties.",
        "It is unsupervised and, unlike most other segmenters, does not require specifying the desired number of segments as an input parameter.",
        "On each iteration it takes into account the information about a large portion of the document (or all of it).",
        "Because APS operates on a precompiled matrix of pairwise sentence similarities, it is easy to incorporate new kinds ofinformation, such as synonymy or adjacency.",

        "It scales linearly in the number of input sentences, performs competitively with the state-of-the-art and is easy to implement.",
        "We also provide a Java implementation of the APS segmenter.",
        "We consider two main directions for future work: using more informative similarity metrics and making the process of segmentation hierarchical.",
        "We chose to use cosine similarity primarily to allow fair comparison and to judge the algorithm itself, in isolation from the information it uses.",
        "Cosine similarity is a very simple metric which cannot provide an adequate picture of topic fluctuations in documents.",
        "It is likely that dictionary-based or corpus-based similarity measures would yield a major improvement in performance.",
        "Reliance on descriptive segment centres may handicap APS's performance when looking for coarse-grained segments.",
        "One possible remedy is to look for shorter segments first and then merge them.",
        "One can also modify the algorithm to perform hierarchical segmentation: consider net similarity with low-level segment centres as well as with high-level ones.",

        "It is computed by sliding a window through reference and through segmentation output and, at each window position, comparing the number of reference breaks to the number of breaks inserted by the segmenter (hypothetical breaks).",
        "It is a penalty measure which reports the number of windows where the reference and hypothetical breaks do not match, normalized by the total number of windows.",
