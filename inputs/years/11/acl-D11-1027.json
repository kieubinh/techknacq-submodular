        "An important part of text understanding arises from understanding the semantics of events described in the narrative, such as identifying the events that are mentioned and how they are related semantically.",
        "For instance, when given a sentence \"The police arrested him because he killed someone.",
        "\", humans understand that there are two events, triggered by the words \"arrested\" and \"killed\", and that there is a causality relationship between these two events.",
        "Besides being an important component of discourse understanding, automatically identifying causal relations between events is important for various natural language processing (NLP) applications such as question answering, etc.",
        "In this work, we automatically detect and extract causal relations between events in text.",
        "Despite its importance, prior work on event causality extraction in context in the NLP literature is relatively sparse.",

        "In this paper, given a text document, we first identify events and their associated arguments.",

        "To do this, we develop a minimally supervised approach using focused distributional similarity methods, such as co-occurrence counts of events collected automatically from an unannotated corpus, to measure and predict existence of causality relations between event pairs.",
        "Then, we build on the observation that discourse connectives and the particular discourse relation they evoke in context provide additional information towards determining causality between events.",
        "For instance, in the example sentence provided at the beginning of this section, the words \"arrested\" and \"killed\" probably have a relatively high apriori likelihood of being casually related.",
        "However, knowing that the connective \"because\" evokes a contingency discourse relation between the text spans \"The police arrested him\" and \"he killed someone\" provides further evidence towards predicting causality.",
        "The contributions of this paper are summarized below:",
        "• Our focus is on identifying causality between event pairs in context.",
        "Since events are often triggered by either verbs (e.g. \"attack\") or nouns (e.g. \"explosion\"), we allow for detection of causality between verb-verb, verb-noun, and noun-noun triggered event pairs.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this formulation of the task is novel.",
        "• We developed a minimally supervised approach for the task using focused distributional similarity methods that are automatically collected from an unannotated corpus.",
        "We show that our approach achieves better performance than two approaches: one based on a frequently used metric that measures association, and another based on the effect-control-dependency (ECD) metric described in a prior work (Riaz",
        "and Girju, 2010).",
        "• We leverage on the interactions between event causality prediction and discourse relations prediction.",
        "We combine these knowledge sources through a global inference procedure, which we formalize via an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework as a constraint optimization problem (Roth and Yih, 2004).",

Examples of predicates could be verbs such as \"attacked\", \"employs\", nouns such as \"explosion\", \"protest\", etc., and examples of the arguments of \"attacked\" could be its subject and object nouns.",
        "To measure the causality association between a pair of events ei and ej (in general, ei and ej could be extracted from the same or different documents), we should use information gathered about their predicates and arguments.",
