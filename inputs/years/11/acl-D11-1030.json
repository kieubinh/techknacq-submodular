      "text": [
        "Over the past several decades, researchers in the natural language processing community have focused most of their efforts on developing text processing tools and techniques for English (Bender, 2009), a morphologically simple language.",
        "Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the wide variety of other languages of the world.",
        "Most of these languages still pose severe difficulties, due to (i) their lack of annotated textual data, and (ii) the fact that they exhibit linguistic structure not found in English, and are thus not immediately susceptible to many traditional NLP techniques.",
        "Consider the example of nominal part-of-speech analysis.",
        "The Penn Treebank defines only four English noun tags (Marcus et al., 1994), and as a result, it is easy to treat the words bearing these tags as completely distinct word classes, with no internal morphological structure.",
        "In contrast, a comparable tagset for Hungarian includes 154 distinct noun tags (Erjavec, 2004), reflecting Hungarian's rich inflectional morphology.",
        "When dealing with such languages, treating words as atoms leads to severe data sparsity problems.",
        "Because annotated resources do not exist for most morphologically rich languages, prior research has focused on unsupervised methods, with a focus on developing appropriate inductive biases.",
        "However, inductive biases and declarative knowledge are notoriously difficult to encode in well-founded models.",
        "Even putting aside this practical matter, a universally correct inductive bias, if there is one, is unlikely to be be discovered by a priori reasoning alone.",
        "In this paper, we argue that languages for which we have gold-standard morphological analyses can be used as effective guides for languages lacking such resources.",
        "In other words, instead of treating each language's morphological analysis as a de novo induction problem to be solved with a purely hand-coded bias, we instead learn from our labeled languages what linguistically plausible morphological analyses looks like, and guide our analysis in this direction.",
        "More formally, we recast morphological induction as a new kind of supervised structured prediction problem, where each annotated language serves as a single training example.",
        "Each language's noun lexicon serves as a single input x, and the analysis of the nouns into stems and suffixes serves as a complex structured label y.",
        "Our first step is to define a universal morphological feature space, into which each language and its morphological analysis can be mapped.",
        "We opt for a simple and intuitive mapping, which measures the sizes of the stem and suffix lexicons, the entropy of these lexicons, and the fraction of word forms which appear without any inflection.",
        "Because languages tend to cluster into well defined morphological groups, we cast our learning and prediction problem in the nearest neighbor framework (Cover and Hart, 1967).",
        "In contrast to its typical use in classification problems, where one can simply pick the label of the nearest training example, we are here faced with a structured prediction problem, where locations in feature space depend jointly on the input-label pair (x, y).",
        "Finding a nearest neighbor thus consists of searching over the space of morphological analyses, until a point in feature space is reached which lies closest to one of the labeled languages.",
        "See Figure 1 for an illustration.",
        "To provide a measure of empirical validation, we applied our approach to eight languages with inflectional nominal morphology, ranging in complexity from very simple (English) to very complex (Hungarian).",
        "In all but one case, our approach yields substantial improvements over a comparable monolingual baseline (Goldsmith, 2005), which uses the minimum description length principle (MDL) as its inductive bias.",
        "On average, our method increases accuracy by 11.8 percentage points, corresponding to a 42% decrease in error relative to a supervised upper bound.",
        "Further analysis indicates that accuracy improves as the number of training languages increases."

        "In this section, we briefly review prior work on unsupervised morphological induction, as well as multilingual analysis in NLP.",
        "Unsupervised Morphological Induction: Unsupervised morphology remains an active area of research (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Goldsmith, 2005; Adler and Elhadad, 2006; Creutz and La-gus, 2005; Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Creutz and La-gus, 2007; Poon et al., 2009).",
        "Many existing algorithms derive morpheme lexicons by identifying recurring patterns in words.",
        "The goal is to optimize the compactness of the data representation by finding a small lexicon of highly frequent strings, resulting in a minimum description length (MDL) lexicon and corpus (Goldsmith, 2001; Goldsmith, 2005).",
        "Later work cast this idea in a probabilistic framework in which the the MDL solution is equivalent to a MAP estimate in a suitable Bayesian model (Creutz and Lagus, 2005).",
        "In all these approaches, a locally optimal segmentation is identified using a task-specific greedy search.",
        "Multilingual Analysis: An influential line of prior multilingual work starts with the observation that rich linguistic resources exist for some languages but not others.",
        "The idea then is to project linguistic information from one language onto others via parallel data.",
        "Yarowsky and his collaborators first developed this idea and applied it to the problems of part-of-speech tagging, noun-phrase bracketing, and morphology induction (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000; Yarowsky et al., 2000; Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), and other researchers have applied the idea to syntactic and semantic analysis (Hwa et al., 2005; Padö and Lapata, 2006) In these cases, the existence of a bilingual parallel text along with highly accurate predictions for one of the languages was assumed.",
        "Another line of work assumes the existence of bilingual parallel texts without the use of any supervision (Dagan et al., 1991; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997).",
        "This idea has been developed and applied to a wide variety tasks, including morphological analysis (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008b; Snyder and Barzi-lay, 2008a), part-of-speech induction (Snyder et al., and grammar induction (Snyder et al., 2009a; Blun-som et al., 2009; Burkett et al., 2010).",
        "An even more recent line of work does away with the assumption of parallel texts and performs joint unsupervised induction for various languages throughthe use of coupled priors in the context of grammar induction (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).",
        "In contrast to these previous approaches, the method proposed in this paper does not assume the existence of any parallel text, but does assume that labeled data exists for a wide variety oflanguages, to be used as training examples for our test language."

This scoring function is trained using the n labeled-language examples: (x, y)i,..., (x, y)n, and the resulting prediction rule for unlabeled input x is given by:",

        "Consider the word utiskom in Serbian, meaning impression with the instrumental case marking.",

        "More generally, as we define it, a morphological analysis of a word type w consists of (i) a stem t, (ii), a suffix f, and (iii) a deletion rule d. Either or both of the suffix and deletion rule can be NULL.",
        "We allow three types of deletion rules on stems: deletion of final vowels (..V# – ..#), deletion of penultimate vowels (..VC# – ..C#), and removals and additions of final accent marks (e.g. ..a# – ..a#).",
        "We require that stems be at least three characters long and that suffixes be no more than four.",
        "And, of course, we require that after (1) applying deletion rule d to stem t, and (2) adding suffix f to the result, we obtain word w.",
        "Universal Feature Space: We employ a fairly simple and minimal set of features, all of which could plausibly generalize across a wide range of languages.",

        "Our first three features simply count the sizes of these three sets.",
        "These counting features consider only the raw number of unique morphemes (and phonological rules) being used, but not their individual frequency or distribution.",
        "Our next set of features considers the empirical entropy of these occurrences as distributed across the lexicon of words x by analysis y.",
        "Figure 1: Structured Nearest Neighbor Search: The inference procedure for unlabeled test language x, when trained with three labeled languages, (xi, yi), (x2, y2), (x3, y3).",
        "Our search procedure iteratively attempts to find labels for x which are as close as possible in feature space to each of the training languages.",
        "After convergence, the label which is closest in distance to a training language is predicted, in this case being the label near training language (x3, y3).",
        "For example, if the (x, y) pair consists of the analyzed words {kiss, kisses, hug}, then the empirical distributions over stems, suffixes, and deletion rules would be:",
        "The three entropy features are defined as the shannon entropies of these stem, suffix, and deletion rule probabilities: H(t),H(f),H(d).",
        "Finally, we consider two simple percentage features: the percentage of words in x which according to y are left unsegmented (i.e. have the null suffix, 2/3 in the example above), and the percentage of segmented words which employ a deletion rule (0 in the example above).",
        "Thus, in total, our model employs 8 universal morphological features.",
        "All features are scaled to the unit interval and are assumed to have equal weight.",
        "The main algorithmic challenge for our model lies in efficiently computing the best morphological analysis y for each language-specific word set x, according to Equation 1.",
        "Exhaustive search through the set of all possible morphological analyses is impossible, as the number of such analyses grows exponentially in the size of the vocabulary.",
        "Instead, we develop a greedy search algorithm in the following fashion (the search procedure is visually depicted in Figure 1).",

        "At a high level, this search procedure alternates between individual analyses of words (keeping the set of stems and suffixes fixed), aggregate discoveries of new stems (keeping the suffixes fixed), and aggregate discoveries of new suffixes (keeping stems fixed).",
        "As input, we consider the test words x in our new language, and we run the search in parallel for each training language (xe,ye).",
        "For each such test-train language pair, the search consists of the following stages:",
        "Stage 0: Initialization",
        "We initially analyze each word w G x according to peaks in successor frequency.",
        "If w's n-character prefix w:n has successor frequency > 1 and the surrounding prefixes, w:n_i and w:n+1 both have successor frequency = 1, then we analyze w as a stem-suffix pair: (w:n, wn+1:).",
        "Otherwise, we initialize w as an unsuffixed stem.",
        "As this procedure tends to produce an overly large set of suffixes F, we further prune F down to the number of suffixes found in the training language, retaining those which appear with the largest number of stems.",
        "This initialization stage is carried out once, and afterwards the following three stages are repeated until convergence.",
        "Stage 1: Reanalyze each word",
        "In this stage, we reanalyze each word (in random order).",
        "We use the set of stems T and suffixes F obtained from the previous stage, and don't permit the addition of any new items to these lists.",
        "Instead, we focus on obtaining better analyses of each word, while also building up a set of phonological deletion rules D. For each word w G x, we consider all possible segmentations of w into a stemsuffix pair (t, f ), for which f G F, and where either t G T or some t' G T such that t is obtained from t' using a deletion rule d (e.g. by deleting a final or penultimate vowel).",
        "For each such possible analysis y', we compute the resulting location in feature space f (x, y'), and select the analysis that brings us closest to our target training language: y = argmin^, || f (x,y') - f (xe,ye) || .",
        "Stage 2: Find New Stems",
        "In this stage, we keep our set of suffixes F and deletion rules D from the previous stage fixed, and attempt to find new stems to add to T through an aggregate analysis of unsegmented words.",
        "For every string s, we consider the set of words which are currently unsegmented, and can be analyzed as a stem-suffix pair (s, f ) for some existing suffix f G F, and some deletion rule d G D. We then consider the joint segmentation of these words into a new stem s, and their respective suffixes.",
        "As before, we choose the segmentation if it brings us closer in feature space to our target training language.",
        "Stage 3: Find New Suffixes",
        "This stage is exactly analogous to the previous stage, except we now fix the set of stems T and seek to find new suffixes.",
        "In order to provide a plausible upper bound on performance, we also formulate a supervised monolingual morphological model, using the structured per-ceptron framework (Collins, 2002).",
        "Here we assume that we are given some training sequence of inputs and morphological analyses (all within one language): (xi,yi ), (x2,y2),..., (xn,yn).",

        "languages in turn as the test language, with the other seven serving as training examples.",
        "For each test language, we iterate the search procedure for each training language (performed in parallel), until convergence.",
        "The number of required iterations varies from 6 to 36 (depending on the test-training language pair), and each iteration takes no more than 30 seconds of runtime on a 2.4GHz Intel Xeon E5620 processor.",
        "We also consider two variants of our method.",
        "In the first (Self (oracle)), we train each test language to minimize the distance to its own gold standard feature values.",
        "In the second variant (Avg.",
        "), we average the feature values of all seven training languages into a single objective.",
        "As a plausible upper bound on performance, we implemented the structured perceptron described in Section 3.2.",
        "For each language, we train the perceptron on a randomly selected set of 80% of the nouns, and test on the remaining 20%.",
        "The prediction accuracy for all models is calculated as the fraction of word types with correctly predicted suffixes.",
        "See Table 2 for the results.",
        "For all languages other than English (which is a morphological loner in our group of languages), our model improves over the baseline by a substantial margin, yielding an average increase of 11.8 absolute percentage points, and a reduction in error relative to the supervised upper bound of 42%.",
        "Some of the most striking improvements are seen on Serbian and Slovene.",
        "These languages are closely related to one another, and indeed our model discovers that they are each others' nearest neighbors.",
        "By guiding their morphological analyses towards one another, our model achieves a 21 percentage point increase in the case of Slovene and a 15 percentage point increase in the case of Slovene.",
        "Perhaps unsurprisingly, when each language's gold standard feature values are used as its own target (Self (oracle) in Table 2), performance increases even further, to an average of 81.1%.",
        "By the same token, the resulting distance in universal feature space between training and test analyses is cut in half under this variant, when compared to the non-oracular nearest neighbor method.",
        "The remaining errors may be due to limitations of the search procedure (i.e. getting caught in local minima), or to the coarseness of the feature space (i.e. incorrect analyses might map to the same feature values as the correct analysis).",
        "Finally, we note that minimizing the distance to the average feature values of the seven training languages (Avg.",
        "in Table 2) yields subpar performance and very large distances between between predicted analyses and target feature values (4.14 compared to 0.40 for nearest neighbor).",

        "The original 8-dimensional feature space was reduced to two dimensions using Multidimensional Scaling.",
        "result may indicate that the average feature point between training languages is simply unattainable as an analysis of a real lexicon of nouns.",
        "Visualizing Locations in Feature Space: Besides assessing our method quantitatively, we can also visualize the the eight languages in universal feature space according to (i) their gold standard analyses, (ii) the predictions of our model and (iii) the predictions of Linguistica.",
        "To do so, we reduce the 8-dimensional features space down to two dimensions while preserving the distances between the predicted and gold standard feature vectors, using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).",
        "The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 2.",
        "With the exception of English, our model's analyses lie closer in feature space to their gold standard counterparts than those of the baseline.",
        "It is interesting to note that Serbian and Slovene, which are very similar languages, have essentially swapped places under our model's analysis, as have Estonian and Hungarian (both highly inflected Uralic languages).",
        "English has (unfortunately) been pulled towards Bulgarian, the second least inflecting language in our set.",
        "Learning Curves: We also measured the performance of our method as a function of the number of languages in the training set.",
        "For each target language, we consider all possible training sets of sizes ranging from 1 to 7 and select the predictions which bring our test language closest in distance to one of the languages in the set.",
        "We then average the resulting accuracy over all training sets of each size.",
        "Figure 3 shows the resulting learning curves averaged over all test languages (left), as well as broken down by test language (right).",
        "The overall trend is clear: as additional languages are added to the training set, test performance improves.",
        "In fact, with only one training language, our method performs worse (on average) than the Linguistica baseline.",
        "However, with two or more training languages available, our method achieves superior results.",

        "Distance: We can gain some insight into these learning curves if we consider the relationship between accuracy (of the test language analysis) and distance to the training language (of the same predicted analysis).",

        "The dotted line indicates the average performance of the baseline.",

        "It thus stands to reason that a strong (negative) correlation between distance and accuracy would lead to increased accuracy with larger training sets.",
        "In order to assess this correlation, we considered all 56 test-train language pairs and collected the resulting accuracy and distance for each pair.",
        "We separately scaled accuracy and distance to the unit interval for each test language (as some test languages are inherently more difficult than others).",
        "The resulting plot, shown in Figure 4, shows the expected correlation: When our test language can be guided very closely to the training language, the resulting predictions are likely to be good.",
        "If not, the predictions are likely to be bad."
