        "The critical first step in the reconstruction of an ancient language is the recovery of related cognate words in its descendants.",
        "Unfortunately, this process has largely been a manual, linguistically-intensive undertaking for any sizable number of descendant languages.",
        "The traditional approach used by linguists – the comparative method – iterates between positing putative cognates and then identifying regular sound laws that explain correspondences between those words (Bloomfield, 1938).",
        "Successful computational approaches have been developed for large-scale reconstruction of phylogenies (Ringe et al., 2002; Daumé III and Campbell, 2007; Daumé III, 2009; Nerbonne, 2010) and ancestral word forms of known cognate sets (Oakes, 2000; Bouchard-Cote et al., 2007; Bouchard-Cote et al., 2009), enabling linguists to explore deep historical relationships in an automated fashion.",
        "However, computational approaches thus far have not been able to offer the same kind of scale for identifying cognates.",
        "Previous work in cognate identification has largely focused on identifying cognates in pairs of languages (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994; Oakes, 2000; Kondrak, 2001; Mulloni, 2007), with a few recent exceptions that can find sets in a handful of languages (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Hall and Klein, 2010).",
        "While it may seem surprising that cognate detection has not successfully scaled to large numbers of languages, the task poses challenges not seen in reconstruction and phylogeny inference.",
        "For instance, morphological innovations and irregular sound changes can completely obscure relationships between words in different languages.",
        "However, in the case of reconstruction, an unexplainable word is simply that: one can still correctly reconstruct its ancestor using words from related languages.",
        "In this paper, we present a system that uses two generative models for large-scale cognate identification.",
        "Both models describe the evolution of words along a phylogeny according to automatically learned sound laws in the form of parametric edit distances.",
        "The first is an adaptation of the generative model of Hall and Klein (2010), and the other is a new generative model called PARSIM with connections to parsimony methods in computational biology (Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, 1965; Fitch, 1971).",
        "Our model supports simple, tractable inference via message passing, at the expense of being unable to model some cognacy relationships.",
        "To help correct this deficiency, we also describe an agglomerative inference procedure for the model of Hall and Klein (2010).",
        "By using the output of our system as input to this system, we can find cognate groups that PARSIM alone cannot recover.",
        "We apply these models to identifying cognate groups from two language families using the Aus-tronesian Basic Vocabulary Database (Greenhill et al., 2008), a catalog of words from about 40% of the Austronesian languages.",
        "We focus on data from two subfamilies of Austronesian: Formosan and",
        "Oceanic.",
        "The datasets are by far the largest on which automated cognate recovery has ever been attempted, with 18 and 271 languages respectively.",
        "On the larger Oceanic data, our model can achieve cluster purity scores of 91.8%, while maintaining pairwise recall of 62.1%.",
        "We also analyze the mistakes of our system, where we find that some of the erroneous cognate groups our system finds may not be errors at all.",
        "Instead, they may be previously unknown cognacy relationships that were not annotated in the data."

        "For far more detailed coverage of the Austronesian languages, we direct the interested reader to Blust (2009)'s comprehensive monograph.",
        "The Austronesian language family is one of the largest in the world, comprising about one-fifth of the world's languages.",
        "Geographically, it stretches from its homeland on Formosa (Taiwan) to Madagascar in the west, and as far as Hawai'i and (at one point) the Easter Islands to the east.",
        "Until the advent of European colonialism spread Indo-European languages to every continent, Austronesian was the most widespread of all language families.",
        "Linguistically, the language family is as diverse as it is large, but a few regularities hold.",
        "From a phonological perspective, two features stand out.",
        "First, the phoneme inventories of these languages are typically small.",
        "For example, it is well-known that Hawaiian has only 13 phonemes.",
        "Moreover, the phonotactics of these languages are often restrictive.",
        "Sticking with the same example, Hawaiian only allows (C)V syllables: consonants clusters are forbidden, and no syllable may end with a consonant.",
        "The Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database (ABVD) (Greenhill et al., 2008) is an ambitious, ongoing effort to catalog the lexicons and basic facts about all of the languages in the Austronesian language family.",
        "It also contains manual reconstructions for select ancestor languages produced by linguists.",
        "The sample we use – from Bouchard-Cote et al.",
        "(2009) – contains about 50,000 words across 471 languages spanning all the major divisions of Aus-tronesian.",
        "These words are grouped into cognate groups and arranged by gloss.",
        "For instance, there are 37 distinct cognate groups for the gloss \"tail.\"",
        "One of these groups includes the words /ekor/, /ingko/, /igkot/, /kiikiPu/, and /PiPina/, among others.",
        "Most of these words have been transcribed into the International Phonetic Alphabet, though it appears that some words are transcribed using the Roman alphabet.",
        "For instance, the second word in the example is likely /ivjko/, which is a much more likely sequence than what is transcribed.",
        "In this sample, there are 6307 such cognate groups and 210 distinct glosses.",
        "The data is somewhat sparse: fewer than 50% of the possible gloss/language pairs are present.",
        "Moreover, there is some amount of homoplasy – that is, languages with a word from more than one cognate group for a given gloss.",
        "Finally, it is important to note that the ABVD is still a work in progress: they have data from only 50% of extant Austronesian languages.",
        "In this paper we focus on two branches of the Aus-tronesian language family, one as a development set and one as a test set.",
        "For our development set, we use the Formosan branch.",
        "The languages in this group are exclusively found on the Austronesian homeland of Formosa.",
        "The family encompasses a substantial portion of the linguistic diversity of Aus-tronesian: Blust (2009) argues that Formosan contains 9 of the 10 first-order splits of the Austronesian family.",
        "Formosan's diversity is surprising since it contains a mere 18 languages.",
        "Thus, Formosan is a smaller development set that nevertheless is representative of larger families.",
        "For our final test set, we use the Oceanic subfamily, which includes almost 50% of the languages in the Austronesian family, meaning that it represents around 10% of all languages in the world.",
        "Oceanic also represents a large fraction of the geographic diversity of Austronesian, stretching from New Zealand in the south to Hawai'i in the north.",
        "Our sample includes 21863 words from 218 languages in the Oceanic family."

        "PARSIM is related to the parsimony principle from computational biology (Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, 1965; Fitch, 1971), where it is used to search for phylogenies.",
        "When using parsimony, a phylogeny is scored according to the derivation that requires the fewest number of changes of state, where a state is typically thought of as a gene or some other trait in a species.",
        "These genes are typically called \"characters\" in the computational biology literature, and two species would have the same value for a character if they share the same property that that state represents.",
        "When inducing phylogenies of languages, a natural choice for characters are glosses from a restricted vocabulary like a Swadesh list, and two words are represented as the same value for a character if they are cognate (Ringe et al., 2002).",
        "Other features can be used (Daumé III and Campbell, 2007; Daumé III, 2009), but they are not relevant to our discussion.",
        "Consider the small example in Figure 3a with just four languages.",
        "Here, cognacy is encoded using characters.",
        "In this example, at least two changes of state are required to explain the data: both C and B must have evolved from A.",

        "Of course, there is no reason why all changes should be equally likely.",
        "For instance, it might be extremely likely that B changes into both A and C, but that A never changes into B or C, and so weighted variants of parsimony might be necessary (Sankoff and Cedergren, 1983).",
        "With this in mind, PARSIM can be thought of a weighted variant of parsimony, with two differences.",
        "First, the characters do not indicate ahead of time which words are related.",
        "Instead, the characters are the words themselves.",
        "Second, the transitions between different states (words) are not uniform.",
        "Instead, they are weighted by the log probability of one word changing into another, including both mutations and innovations.",
        "Thus, the task of inference in PARSIM is to find the most \"parsimonious\" explanation for the words we have observed, which is the same as finding the most likely derivation.",

        "On the other hand, HK10 can recover this relationship (Figure 3d), but this power is precisely what makes it intractable.",
        "There are two reasons this kind of homoplasy could arise.",
        "The first is that there were indeed two words in the parent language for this gloss, or that there were two words with similar meanings and the two meanings drifted together.",
        "Second, the tree could be an inadequate model of the evolution in this case.",
        "For instance, there could have been a certain amount of borrowing between two of these languages, or there was not a single coherent parent language, but rather a language continuum that cannot be explained by any tree.",
