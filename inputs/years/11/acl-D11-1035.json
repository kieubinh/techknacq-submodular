        "The dominant framework of machine translation (MT) today is statistical machine translation (SMT) (Hutchins, 2007).",
        "At the core of the system is the decoder, which performs the actual translation.",
        "The decoder is parameterized, and estimating the optimal set of parameter values is of paramount importance in getting good translations.",
        "In SMT, the parameter space is explored by a tuning algorithm, typically MERT (Minimum Error Rate Training) (Och, 2003), though the exact method is not important for our purpose.",
        "The tuning algorithm carries out repeated experiments with different decoder parameter values over a development data set, for which reference translations are given.",
        "An automatic MT evaluation metric compares the output of the decoder against the reference(s), and guides the tuning algorithm towards iteratively better decoder parameters and output translations.",
        "The quality of the automatic MT evaluation metric therefore has an immediate effect on the whole system.",
        "The first automatic MT evaluation metric to show a high correlation with human judgment is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "Together with its close variant the NIST metric, they have quickly become the standard way of tuning statistical machine translation systems.",
        "While BLEU is an impressively simple and effective metric, recent evaluations have shown that many new generation metrics can outperform BLEU in terms of correlation with human judgment (Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010).",
        "Some of these new metrics include METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), TER (Snover et al., 2006), MAXSIM (Chan and Ng, 2008; Chan and Ng, 2009), and TESLA (Liu et al., 2010).",
        "Given the close relationship between automatic MT and automatic MT evaluation, the logical expectation is that a better MT evaluation metric would lead to better MT systems.",
        "However, this linkage has not yet been realized.",
        "In the SMT community, MT tuning still uses BLEU almost exclusively.",
        "Some researchers have investigated the use ofbet-ter metrics for MT tuning, with mixed results.",
        "Most notably, Padó et al.",
        "(2009) reported improved human judgment using their entailment-based metric.",
        "However, the metric is heavy weight and slow in practice, with an estimated runtime of 40 days on the NIST MT 2002/2006/2008 dataset, and the authors had to resort to a two-phase MERT process with a reduced n-best list.",
        "As we shall see, our experiments use the similarly sized WMT 2010 dataset, and most of our runs take less than one day.",
        "Cer et al.",
        "(2010) compared tuning a phrase-based",
        "SMT system with BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER, and concluded that BLEU and NIST are still the best choices for MT tuning, despite the proven higher correlation of METEOR and TER with human judgment.",
        "In this work, we investigate the effect of MERT using BLEU, TER, and two variants of TESLA, TESLA-M and TESLA-F, on Joshua (Li et al., 2009), a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based empirical study is carried out in the context ofWMT 2010, for the French-English, Spanish-English, and German-English machine translation tasks.",
        "We show that Joshua responds well to the change of evaluation metric, in that a system trained on metric M typically does well when judged by the same metric M. We further evaluate the different systems with manual judgments and show that the TESLA family of metrics (both TESLA-M and TESLA-F) significantly outperforms BLEU when used to guide the MERT search.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the four evaluation metrics used.",
        "Section 3 outlines our experimental set up using the WMT 2010 machine translation tasks.",
        "Section 4 presents the evaluation results, both automatic and manual.",
        "Finally, we discuss our findings in Section 5, future work in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7."

        "This section describes the metrics used in our experiments.",
        "We do not seek to explain all their variants and intricate details, but rather to outline their core characteristics and to highlight their similarities and differences.",
        "In particular, since all our experiments are based on single references, we omit the complications due to multiple references and refer our readers instead to the respective original papers for the details.",
        "BLEU is fundamentally based on n-gram match precisions.",
        "Given a reference text R and a translation candidate T, we generate the bag of all n-grams contained in R and T for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and denote them as BNGR and BNGT respectively.",
        "The n-gram precision is thus defined as",
        "p = |BNGR n BNGTI n = |BNGT|",
        "To compensate for the lack of the recall measure, and hence the tendency to produce short translations, BLEU introduces a brevity penalty, defined as where the | • | operator denotes the size of a bag or the number of words in a text.",
        "The metric is finally defined as",
        "BLEU is a very simple metric requiring neither training nor language-specific resources.",
        "Its use of the brevity penalty is however questionable, as subsequent research on n-gram-based metrics has consistently found that recall is in fact a more potent indicator than precision (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Zhou et al., 2006; Chan and Ng, 2009).",
        "As we shall see, despite the BP term, BLEU still exhibits a strong tendency to produce short translations.",
        "TER is based on counting transformations rather than n-gram matches.",
        "The metric is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to change a candidate translation T to the reference R, normalized by the length of the reference, i.e.,",
        "One edit is defined as one insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single word, or the shift of a contiguous sequence of words, regardless of size and distance.",
        "Minimizing the edit distance so defined has been shown to be NP-complete, so the evaluation is carried out in practice by a heuristic greedy search algorithm.",
        "TER is a strong contender as the leading new generation automatic metric and has been used in major evaluation campaigns such as GALE.",
        "Like BLEU, it is simple and requires no language specific resources.",
        "TER also corresponds well to the human intuition of an evaluation metric.",
        "TESLA is a family of linear programming-based metrics proposed by Liu et al.",
        "(2010) that incorporates many newer ideas.",
        "The simplest variation is TESLA-M, based on matching bags of n-grams (BNG) like BLEU.",
        "However, unlike BLEU, TESLA-M formulates the matching process as a real-valued linear programming problem, thereby allowing the use of weights.",
        "An example weighted BNG matching problem is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Two kinds of weights are used in TESLA-M. First, the metric emphasizes the content words by discounting the weight of an n-gram by 0.1 for every function word it contains.",
        "Second, the similarity between two n-grams is a function dependent on the lemmas, the WordNet synsets (Fellbaum, 1998), and the POS tag of every word in the n-grams.",
        "Each node in Figure 1 represents one weighted n-gram.",
        "The four in the top row represent one BNG, and the three at the bottom represent the other BNG.",
        "The goal of the linear programming problem is to assign weights to the links between the two BNGs, so as to maximize the sum of the products of the link weights and their corresponding similarity scores.",
        "Good morning morning , , sir sir .",
        "Hello , , Querrien Querrien .",
        "(a) The matching problem",
        "The constraints of the linear programming problem are: (1) all assigned weights must be nonnegative, and (2) the sum of weights assigned to all links connecting a node cannot exceed the node's weight.",
        "Intuitively, we allow splitting n-grams into fractional counts, and match them giving priority to the pairs with the highest similarities.",
        "The linear programming formulation ensures that the matching can be solved uniquely and efficiently.",
        "Once the solution is found and let the maximized objective function value be S, the precision is computed as S over the sum of weights of the translation candidate n-grams.",
        "Similarly, the recall is S over the sum of weights of the reference n-grams.",
        "The precision and the recall are then combined to form the F-0.8 measure:",
        "F Precision x Recall",
        "This F-measure gives more importance to the recall, reflecting its closer correlation with human judgment.",
        "Fn for n = 1, 2, 3 are calculated and averaged to produce the final score.",

        "Aeeording to the system-level eorrelation with human judgments (Tables 1 and 2), it ranks top for the out-of-English task and very elose to the top for the into-English task (Callison-Bureh et al., 2010).",
        "TESLA-F builds on top of TESLA-M.",

        "French-English task, BLEU and TER produced different translations for only 760 sentences, or 31%.",
        "Similarly, TESLA-F and TESLA-M gave different outputs for only 857 sentences, or 34%.",
        "In contrast, BLEU and TESLA-M gave different translations for 2248 sentences, or 90%.",
        "It is interesting to find that BLEU and TER should be so similar, considering that they are based on very different principles.",
        "As a metric, TESLA-M is certainly much more similar to BLEU than TER is, yet they behave very differently when used as a tuning metric.",
        "We also observe that TESLA-F and TESLA-M tend to produce much longer sentences than do BLEU and TER.",
        "The average sentence lengths of the TESLA-F-and TESLA-M-tuned systems across all three language pairs are 26.5 and 26.6 words respectively, whereas those for BLEU and TER are only 22.4 and 21.7 words.",
        "Comparing the translations from the two groups, the tendency of BLEU and TER to pick shorter paraphrases and to drop function words is unmistakable, often to the detriment of the translation quality.",
        "Some typical examples from the French-English task are shown in Figure 4.",
        "Interestingly, the human translations average only 22 words, so BLEU and TER translations are in fact much closer on average to the reference lengths, yet their translations often feel too short.",
        "In contrast, manual inspections reveal no tendency for TESLA-F and TESLA-M to produce overly long translations.",
        "These observations suggest that the brevity penalty of BLEU is not aggressive enough.",
        "Neither is TER, which penalizes insertions and deletions equally.",
        "Interestingly, by placing much more emphasis on the recall, TESLA-M and TESLA-F produce translations that are statistically too long, but feel much more 'correct' lengthwise.",
        "Another major difference between TESLA-",
        "M/TESLA-F and BLEU/TER is that the TESLAs heavily discount n-grams with function words.",
        "One might thus expect the TESLA-tuned systems to be less adept at function words; yet they translate them surprisingly well, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "One explanation is of course the sentence length effect we have discussed.",
        "Another reason may be that since the metric does not care much about function words, the language model is given more freedom to pick function words as it sees fit, without the fear of large penalties.",
        "Paradoxically, by reducing the weights of function words, we end up making better translations for them.",
        "TER is the only metric that allows cheap block movements, regardless of size or distance.",
        "One might reasonably speculate that a TER-tuned system should be more prone to reordering phrases.",
        "However, we find no evidence that this is so.",
        "The relative performance of TESLA-M vs TESLA-F is unsurprising.",
        "TESLA-F, being heavier and slower, produces somewhat better results than its minimalist counterpart, though the margin is far less pronounced than that between TESLA-M and the conventional BLEU and TER.",
        "Since extra resources including bitexts are needed in using TESLA-F, TESLA-M emerges as the MT evaluation metric of choice for tuning SMT systems."
