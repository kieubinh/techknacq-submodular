        "At its core, the implied dichotomy of approaches alludes to differences in the interpretation of the parsing task.",
        "Its abstract goal, on the one hand, could be preprocessing of the linguistic signal, to enable subsequent stages of analysis.",

        "Stereotypically, one expects corresponding differences in the choice of interface representations, ranging from various levels of syntactic analysis to logical-form representations of semantics.",
        "In this paper, we seek to probe aspects of variation in automated linguistic analysis.",
        "We make the assumption that an integral part of many (albeit not all) applications of parsing technology is the recovery of structural relations, i.e. dependencies at the level of interpretation.",
        "We suggest a selection of ten linguistic phenomena that we believe (a) occur with reasonably high frequency in running text and (b) have the potential to shed some light on the depths oflinguis-tic analysis.",
        "We quantify the frequency of these constructions in the English Wikipedia, then annotate 100 example sentences for each phenomenon with gold-standard dependencies reflecting core properties of the phenomena of interest.",
        "This gold standard is then used to estimate the recall of these dependencies by seven commonly used parsers, providing the basis for a qualitative discussion of the state of the art in parsing for English.",
        "In this work, we answer the call by Rimell et al.",
        "(2009) for \"construction-focused parser evaluation\", extending and complementing their work in several respects: (i) we investigate both local and non-local dependencies which prove to be challenging for many existing state-of-the-art parsers; (ii) we investigate a wider range of linguistic phenomena, each accompanied with an in-depth discussion of relevant properties; and (iii) we draw our data from the 50-million sentence English Wikipedia, which is more varied and a thousand times larger than the venerable WSJ corpus, to explore a more level and ambitious playing field for parser comparison."

        "All parsing systems embody knowledge about possible and probable pairings of strings and corresponding linguistic structure.",
        "Such linguistic and probabilistic knowledge can be hand-coded (e.g., as grammar rules) or automatically acquired from labeled or unlabeled training data.",
        "A related dimension ofvari-ation is the type of representations manipulated by the parser.",
        "We briefly review some representative examples along these dimensions, as these help to position the parsers we subsequently evaluate.",
        "Source of linguistic knowledge At one end of this dimension, we find systems whose linguistic knowledge is encoded in hand-crafted rules and lexical entries; for English, the ParGram XLE system (Rie-zler et al., 2002) and delph-in English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger (2000)) – each reflecting decades of continuous development – achieve broad coverage of open-domain running text, for example.",
        "At the other end of this dimension, we find fully unsupervised approaches (Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2004), where the primary source of linguistic knowledge is co-occurrence patterns of words in unannotated text.",
        "As Haghighi and Klein (2006) show, augmenting this knowledge with handcrafted prototype \"seeds\" can bring strong improvements.",
        "Somewhere between these poles, a broad class of parsers take some or all of their linguistic knowledge from annotated treebanks, e.g. the Penn Treebank (PTB), which encodes \"surface grammatical analysis\" (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Such approaches include those that directly (and exclusively) use the information in the treebank (e.g. Charniak (1997), Collins (1999), Petrov et al.",
        "(2006), inter alios) as well as those that complement treebank structures with some amount of hand-coded linguistic knowledge (e.g. O'Donovan et al.",
        "(2004), Miyao et al.",
        "(2004), Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007), inter alios).",
        "Another hybrid in terms of its acquisition of linguistic knowledge is the RASP system of Briscoe et al.",
        "(2006), combining a hand-coded grammar over PoS tag sequences with a probabilistic tagger and statistical syntactic disambiguation.",
        "Design of representations Approaches to parsing also differ fundamentally in the style of representation assigned to strings.",
        "These vary both in their formal nature and the \"granularity\" of linguistic information (i.e. the number of distinctions assumed), encompassing variants of constituent structure, syntactic dependencies, or logical-form representations of semantics.",
        "Parser interface representations range between the relatively simple (e.g. phrase structure trees with a limited vocabulary of node labels as in the PTB, or syntactic dependency structures with a limited vocabulary of relation labels as in Johansson and Nugues (2007)) and the relatively complex, as for example elaborate syntactico-semantic analyses produced by the ParGram or delph-in grammars.",
        "There tends to be a correlation between the methodology used in the acquisition of linguistic knowledge and the complexity of representations: in the creation of a mostly hand-crafted treebank like the PTB, representations have to be simple enough for human annotators to reliably manipulate.",
        "Deriving more complex representations typically presupposes further computational support, often involving some hand-crafted linguistic knowledge – which can take the form of mappings from PTB-like representations to \"richer\" grammatical frameworks (as in the line of work by O'Donovan et al.",
        "(2004), and others; see above), or can be rules for creating the parse structures in the first place (i.e. a computational grammar), as for example in the treebanks of",
        "In principle, one might expect that richer representations allow parsers to capture complex syntactic or semantic dependencies more explicitly.",
        "At the same time, such \"deeper\" relations may still be recoverable (to some degree) from comparatively simple parser outputs, as demonstrated for unbounded dependency extraction from strictly local syntactic dependency trees by Nivre et al.",

        "In this section we summarize the ten phenomena we explore and our motivations for choosing them.",
        "Our goal was to find phenomena where the relevant dependencies are relatively subtle, such that more linguistic knowledge is beneficial in order to retrieve them.",
        "Though this set is of course only a sampling, these phenomena illustrate the richness of structure, both local and non-local, involved in the mapping from English strings to their meanings.",
        "We discuss the phenomena in four sets and then briefly review their representation in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Three of our phenomena can be classified as involving long-distance dependencies: finite that-less relatives clauses ('barerel'), tough adjectives ('tough') and right node raising ('rnr').",
        "These are illustrated in the following examples:",
        "(1) barerel: This is the second time in a row Australia has lost their home tri-nations' series.",
        "(2) tough: Original copies are very hard to find.",
        "(3) rnr: IlUvatar, as his names imply, exists before and independently of all else.",
        "While the majority of our phenomena involve local dependencies, we include these long-distance dependency types because they are challenging for parsers and enable more direct comparison with the work of Rimell et al.",
        "(2009), who also address right node raising and bare relatives.",
        "Our barerel category corresponds to their \"object reduced relative\" category with the difference that we also include adverb relatives, where the head noun functions as a modifier within the relative clause, as does time in (1).",
        "In contrast, our rnr category is somewhat narrower than Rimell et al.",
        "(2009)'s \"right node raising\" category: where they include raised modifiers, we restrict our category to raised complements.",
        "Part of the difficulty in retrieving long-distance dependencies is that the so-called extraction site is not overtly marked in the string.",
        "In addition to this baseline level of complication, these three construction types present further difficulties: Bare relatives, unlike other relative clauses, do not carry any lexical cues to their presence (i.e., no relative pronouns).",
        "Tough adjective constructions require the presence of specific lexical items which form a subset of a larger open class.",
        "They are rendered more difficult by two sources of ambiguity: alternative subcatego-rization frames for the adjectives and the purposive adjunct analysis (akin to in order to) for the infinitival VP.",
        "Finally, right node raising often involves coordination where one of the conjuncts is in fact not a well-formed phrase (e.g., independently of in (3)), making it potentially difficult to construct the correct coordination structure, let alone associate the raised element with the correct position in each conjunct.",
        "Two of our phenomena crucially look for the lack of dependencies.",
        "These are it expletives ('itexpl') and verb-particle constructions ('vpart'):",
        "(4) itexpl: Crew negligence is blamed, and it is suggested that the flight crew were drunk.",
        "(5) vpart: He once threw out two baserunners at home in the same inning.",
        "The English pronoun it can be used as an ordinary personal pronoun or as an expletive: a placeholder for when the language demands a subject (or occasionally object) NP but there is no semantic role for that NP.",
        "The expletive it only appears when it is licensed by a specific construction (such as extraposition, (4)) or selecting head.",
        "If the goal of parsing is to recover from the surface string the dependencies capturing who did what to whom, expletive it should not feature in any of those dependencies.",
        "Likewise, instances of expletive it should be detected and discarded in reference resolution.",
        "We hypothesize that detecting expletive it requires encoding linguistic knowledge about its licensers.",
        "The other non-dependency we explore is between the particle in verb-particle constructions and the direct object.",
        "Since English particles are almost always homophonous with prepositions, when the object of the verb-particle pair follows the particle, there will always be a competing analysis which analyses the sequence as V+PP rather than V+particle+NP.",
        "Furthermore, since verb-particle pairs often have non-compositional semantics (Sag et al., 2002), misanalyzing these constructions could be costly to downstream components.",
        "Our next category concerns modifier phrases:",
        "(6) ned: Light colored glazes also have softening effects when painted over dark or bright images.",
        "(7) absol: The format consisted of 12 games, each team facing the other teams twice.",
        "The first, ('ned'), is a pattern which to our knowledge has not been named in the literature, where a noun takes the typically verbal -ed ending, is modified by another noun or adjective, and functions as a modifier or a predicate.",
        "We believe this phenomenon to be interesting because its unusual morphology is likely to lead PoS-taggers astray, and because the often-hyphenated Adj+N-ed constituent has productive internal structure constraining its interpretation.",
        "The second phrasal modifier we investigate is the absolutive construction.",
        "An absolutive consists of an",
        "NP followed by a non-finite predicate (such as could appear after the copula be).",
        "The whole phrase modifies a verbal projection that it attaches to.",
        "Absolu-tives may be marked with with or unmarked.",
        "Here, we focus on the unmarked type as this lack of lexical cue can make the construction harder to detect.",
        "Our final three phenomena involve ways in which verbal arguments can be more difficult to identify than in ordinary finite clauses.",
        "These include detecting the arguments of verbal gerunds (' vger'), the interleaving of arguments and adjuncts ('argadj') and raising/control ('control') constructions.",
        "(8) vger: Accessing the website without the \"www\" subdomain returned a copy of the main site for \"EP.net\".",
        "(9) argadj: The story shows, through flashbacks, the different histories of the characters.",
        "(10) control: Alfred \"retired\" in 1957 at age 60 but continued to paint full time.",
        "In a verbal gerund, the -ing form a verb retains verbal properties (e.g., being able to take NP complements, rather than only PP complements) but heads a phrase that fills an NP position in the syntax (Malouf, 2000).",
        "Since gerunds have the same morphology as present participle VPs, their role in the larger clause is susceptible to misanalysis.",
        "The argadj examples are of interest because English typically prefers to have direct objects directly adjacent to the selecting verb.",
        "Nonetheless, phenomena such as parentheticals and heavy-NP shift (Arnold et al., 2000), in which \"heavy\" constituents appear further to the right in the string, allow for adjunct-argument order in a minority of cases.",
        "We hypothesize that the relative infrequency of this construction will lead parsers to prefer incorrect analyses (wherein the adjunct is picked up as a complement, the complement as an adjunct or the structure differs entirely) unless they have access to linguistic knowledge providing constraints on possible and probable complementation patterns for the head.",
        "Finally, we turn to raising and control verbs ('control') (e.g., Huddleston and Pullum (2002, ch.",
        "14)).",
        "These verbs select for an infinitival VP complement and stipulate that another of their arguments (subject or direct object in the examples we explore) is identified with the unrealized subject position of the infinitival VP.",
        "Here it is the dependency between the infinitval VP and the NP argument of the \"upstairs\" verb which we expect to be particularly subtle.",
        "Getting this right requires specific lexical knowledge about which verbs take these complementation patterns.",
        "This lexical knowledge needs to be represented in such a way that it can be used robustly even in the case of passives, relative clauses, etc.",
        "We investigated the representation of these 10 phenomena in the PTB (Marcus et al., 1993) in two steps: First we explored the PTB's annotation guidelines (Bies et al., 1995) to determine how the relevant dependencies were intended to be represented.",
        "We then used Ghodke and Bird's (2010) Treebank Search to find examples of the intended annotations as well as potential examples of the phenomena annotated differently, to get a sense of the consistency of the annotation from both precision and recall perspectives.",
        "In this study, we take the phrase structure trees of the PTB to represent dependencies based on reasonable identification of heads.",
        "The barerel, vpart, and absol phenomena are completely unproblematic, with their relevant dependencies explicitly and reliably represented.",
        "In addition, the tough construction is reliably annotated, though one of the dependencies we take to be central is not directly represented: The missing argument is linked to a null wh head at the left edge of the complement of the tough predicate, rather than to its subject.",
        "Two further phenomena (rnr and vger) are essentially correctly represented: the representations of the dependencies are explicit and mostly but not entirely consistently applied.",
        "Two out of a sample of 20 examples annotated as containing rnr did not, and two out of a sample of 35 non-rnr-annotated coordinations actually contained rnr.",
        "For vger the primary problem is with the PoS tagging, where the gerund is sometimes given a nominal tag, contrary to PTB guidelines, though the structure above it conforms.",
        "The remaining four constructions are more problematic.",
        "In the case of object control, while the guide-distinguishing between raising and control requires further lexical knowledge and is another example of a \"non-dependency\" (in the raising examples).",
        "We do not draw that distinction in our annotations.",
        "lines specify an analysis in which the shared NP is attached as the object of the higher verb, the PTB includes not only structures conforming to that analysis but also \"small clause\" structures, with the latter obscuring the relationship of the shared argument to the higher verb.",
        "In the case of itexpl, the adjoined (s(-none- *exp*)) indicating an expletive use of it is applied consistently for extraposition (as prescribed in the guidelines).",
        "However, the set of lexical licensers of the expletive is incomplete.",
        "For ar-gadj we run into the problem that the PTB does not explicitly distinguish between post-verbal modifiers and verbal complements in the way that they are attached.",
        "The guidelines suggest that the function tags (e.g., pp-loc, etc.)",
        "should allow one to distinguish these, but examination of the PTB itself suggests that they are not consistently applied.",
        "Finally, the ned construction is not mentioned in the PTB guidelines nor is its internal structure represented in the treebank.",
        "Rather, strings like gritty-eyed are left unsegmented and tagged as jj.",
        "We note that the PTB representations of many of these phenomena (barerel, tough, rnr, argadj, control, itexpl) involve empty elements and/or function tags.",
        "Systems that strip these out before training, as is common practice, will not benefit from the information that is in the PTB.",
        "Our purpose here is not to criticize the PTB, which has been a tremendously important resource to the field.",
        "Rather, we have two aims: The first is to provide context for the evaluation of PTB-derived parsers on these phenomena.",
        "The second is to highlight the difficulty of producing consistent annotations of any complexity as well as the hurdles faced by a hand-annotation approach when attempting to scale a resource to more complex representations and/or additional phenomena (though cf. Vadas and Curran (2008) on improving PTB representations)."

        "Most closely related are the latter two of the above, as we adopt their \"construction-focused parser evaluation methodology\".",
        "There are several methodological differences between our work and that of Rimell et al.",
        "First, we draw our evaluation data from a much larger and more varied corpus.",
        "Second, we automate the comparison of parser output to the gold standard, and we distribute the evaluation scripts along with the annotated corpus, enhancing replicability.",
        "Third, where Rimell et al.",
        "extract evaluation targets on the basis of PTB annotations, we make use of a linguistically precise broad-coverage grammar to identify candidate examples.",
        "This allows us to include both local and non-local dependencies not represented or not reliably encoded in the PTB, enabling us to evaluate parser performance with more precision over a wider range of linguistic phenomena.",
        "These methodological innovations bring two empirical results.",
        "The first is qualitative: Where previous work showed that overall Parseval numbers hide difficulties with long-distance dependencies, our results show that there are multiple kinds of reasonably frequent local dependencies which are also difficult for the current standard approaches to parsing.",
        "The second is quantitative: Where Rimell et al.",
        "found two phenomena which were virtually un-analyzed (recall below 10%) for one or two parsers each, we found eight phenomena which were virtually unanalyzed by at least one system, including two unanalyzed by five and one by six.",
        "Every system had at least one virtually unanalyzed phenomenon.",
        "Thus we have shown that the dependencies being missed by typical modern approaches to parsing are more varied and more numerous than previously thought.",
        "8 Conclusion",
        "We have presented a detailed construction-focused evaluation of seven parsers over 10 phenomena, with 1000 examples drawn from English Wikipedia.",
        "Gauging recall of such \"deep\" dependencies, in our view, can serve as a proxy for downstream processing involving semantic interpretation of parser outputs.",
        "Our annotations and automated evaluation script are provided in the supplementary materials, for full replicability.",
        "Our results demonstrate that significant opportunities remain for parser improvement, and highlight specific challenges that remain invisible in aggregate parser evaluation (e.g. Parse-val or overall dependency accuracy).",
        "These results suggest that further progress will depend on training data that is both more extensive and more richly annotated than what is typically used today (seeing, for example, that a large part of more detailed PTB annotation remains ignored in much parsing work).",
        "There are obvious reasons calling for diversity in approaches to parsing and for different trade-offs in, for example, the granularity of linguistic analysis, average accuracy, cost of computation, or ease of adaptation.",
        "Our proposal is not to substitute construction-focused evaluation on Wikipedia data for widely used aggregate metrics and reference corpora, but rather to augment such best practices in the spirit of Rimell et al.",
        "(2009) and expand the range of phenomena considered in such evaluations.",
        "Across frameworks and traditions (and in principle languages), it is of vital importance to be able to evaluate the quality of parsing (and grammar induction) algorithms in a maximally informative manner."
