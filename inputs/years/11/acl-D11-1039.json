        "Conversational interactions provide significant opportunities for autonomous learning.",
        "A well-defined goal allows a system to engage in remediations when confused, such as asking for clarification, rewording, or additional explanation.",
        "The user's response to such requests provides a strong, if often indirect, signal that can be used to learn to avoid the original confusion in future conversations.",
        "In this paper, we show how to use this type of conversational feedback to learn to better recover the meaning of user utterances, by inducing semantic parsers from unannotated conversational logs.",
        "We believe that this style of learning will contribute to the long term goal of building self-improving dialog systems that continually learn from their mistakes, with little or no human intervention.",
        "Many dialog systems use a semantic parsing component to analyze user utterances (e.g., Allen et al., 2007; Litman et al., 2009; Young et al., 2010).",
        "For example, in a flight booking system, the sentence",
        "Sent: I want to go to Seattle on Friday might be mapped to the logical form (LF) meaning representation above, a lambda-calculus expression defining the set of flights that match the user's desired constraints.",
        "This LF is a representation of the semantic content that comes from the sentence, and would be input to a context-dependent understanding component in a full dialog system, for example to find the date that the symbol FRI refers to.",
        "To induce semantic parsers from interactions, we consider user statements in conversational logs and model their meaning with latent variables.",
        "We demonstrate that it is often possible to use the dialog that follows a statement (including remediations such as clarifications, simplifications, etc.)",
        "to learn the meaning of the original sentence.",
        "For example, consider the first user utterance in Figure 1, where the system failed to understand the user's request.",
        "To complete the task, the system must use a remediation strategy.",
        "Here, it takes the initiative by asking for and confirming each flight constraint in turn.",
        "This strategy produces an unnatural conversation but provides supervision for learning the meaning of the original utterance.",
        "We can easily record representations of the meanings the system intended to convey at each step, as seen in Figure 1, and use this indirect supervision for learning.",
        "Learning from this weak signal is challenging.",
        "In any specific conversation, the system's remediations can fail to recover aspects of the original user meaning and can introduce spurious constraints, for example when users change their goals mid conversation.",
        "To learn effectively, the model must accumulate evidence from many interactions to best recover the meaning of each specific sentence.",
        "We will learn semantic parsers defined by probabilistic Combinatory Categorial Grammars (PC-CGs), which include both a lexicon and a weighted linear model for parse selection.",
        "The lexicon specifies the meanings of individual words and phrases, while the parameters of a parsing model define how to best combine word-and phrase-level meanings to analyze complete sentences.",
        "To learn without labeled meaning representations, we make use of a variant of the loss-sensitive Perceptron algorithm (Singh-Miller and Collins, 2007).",
        "We define loss functions to provide a rough measure of (1) how well a candidate meaning for a utterance matches the conversation that follows it and (2) how well the candidate matches our expectations about the types of things that are often said in the dialog's domain.",
