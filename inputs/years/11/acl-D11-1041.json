        "What happens when you see a picture?",
        "The most natural thing would be to describe it using words: using speech or text.",
        "This description of an image is the output of an extremely complex process that involves: 1) perception in the Visual space, 2) grounding to World Knowledge in the Language Space and 3) speech/text production (see Fig. 1).",
        "Each of these components are challenging in their own right and are still considered open problems in the vision and linguistics fields.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that attempts to integrate these",
        "t indicates equal contribution.",
        "components together.",
        "Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that natural images accurately reflect common everyday scenarios which are captured in language.",
        "For example, knowing that boats usually occur over water will enable us to constrain the possible scenes a boat can occur and exclude highly unlikely ones - street, highway.",
        "It also enables us to predict likely actions (Verbs) given the current object detections in the image: detecting a dog with a person will likely induce walk rather than swim, jump, fly.",
        "Key to our approach is the use of a large generic corpus such as the English Gigaword [Graff, 2003] as the semantic grounding to predict and correct the initial and often noisy visual detections of an image to produce a reasonable sentence that succinctly describes the image.",
        "In order to get an idea of the difficulty of this task, it is important to first define what makes up",
        "Figure 2: Illustration of various perceptual challenges for sentence generation for images.",
        "(a) Different images with semantically the same content.",
        "(b) Pose relates ambiguously to actions in real images.",
        "See text for details.",
        "a description of an image.",
        "Based on our observations of annotated image data (see Fig. 4), a descriptive sentence for an image must contain at minimum: 1) the important objects (Nouns) that participate in the image, 2) Some description of the actions (Verbs) associated with these objects, 3) the scene where this image was taken and 4) the preposition that relates the objects to the scene.",
        "That is, a quadruplet of T = {n, v, s,pj (Noun-Verb-Scene-Preposition) that represents the core sentence structure.",
        "Generating a sentence from this quadruplet is obviously a simplification from state of the art generation work, but as we will show in the experimental results (sec.",
        "4), it is sufficient to describe images.",
        "The key challenge is that detecting objects, actions and scenes directly from images is often noisy and unreliable.",
        "We illustrate this using example images from the Pascal-Visual Object Classes (VOC) 2008 challenge [Everingham et al., 2008].",
        "First, Fig. 2(a) shows the variability of images in their raw image representations: pixels, edges and local features.",
        "This makes it difficult for state of the art object detectors [Felzenszwalb et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2009] to reliably detect important objects in the scene: boat, humans and water - average precision scores reported in [Felzenszwalb et al., 2010] manages around 42% for humans and only 11% for boat over a dataset of almost 5000 images in 20 object categories.",
        "Yet, these images are semantically similar in terms of their high level description.",
        "Second, cognitive studies [Urgesi et al., 2006; Kourtzi, 2004] have proposed that inferring the action from static images (known as an \"implied action\") is often achieved by detecting the pose of humans in the image: the position of the limbs with respect to one another, under the assumption that a unique pose occurs for a unique action.",
        "Clearly, this assumption is weak as 1) similar actions may be represented by different poses due to the inherent dynamic nature of the action itself: e.g. walking a dog and 2) different actions may have the same pose: e.g. walking a dog versus running (Fig.",
        "2(b)).",
        "The missing component here is whether the key object (dog) under interaction is considered.",
        "Recent works [Yao and Fei-Fei, 2010; Yang et al., 2010] that used poses for recognition of actions achieved 70% and 61% accuracy respectively under extremely limited testing conditions with only 5-6 action classes each.",
        "Finally, state of the art scene detectors [Oliva and Torralba, 2001; Torralba et al., 2003] need to have enough representative training examples of scenes from predefined scene classes for a classification to be successful with a reported average precision of 83.7% tested over a dataset of 2600 images.",
        "Addressing all these visual challenges is clearly a formidable task which is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "Our focus instead is to show that with the addition of language to ground the noisy initial visual detections, we are able to improve the quality of the generated sentence as a faithful description of the image.",
        "In particular, we show that it is possible to avoid predicting actions directly from images - which is still unreliable - and to use the corpus instead to guide our predictions.",
        "Our proposed strategy is also generic, that is, we make no prior assumptions on the image domain considered.",
        "While other works (sec.",
        "2) depend on strong annotations between images and text to ground their predictions (and to remove wrong sentences), we show that a large generic corpus is also able to provide the same grounding over larger domains of images.",
        "It represents a relatively new style of learning: distant supervision [Liang et al., 2009; Mann and Mc-callum, 2007].",
        "Here, we do not require \"labeled\" data containing images and captions but only separate data from each side.",
        "Another contribution is a computationally feasible way via dynamic programming to determine the most likely quadruplet T* = {n*,v*, s*,p* j that describes the image for generating possible sentences."

        "Recently, approaches for generation have focused on formal specification inputs, such as the output of theorem provers [McKeown, 2009] or databases [Gol-land et al., 2010].",
        "Most of the effort in those approaches has focused on selection and realization.",
        "We address a tangential problem that has not received much attention in the generation literature: how to deal with noisy inputs.",

        "To simplify our notations, as we are concerned with object pairs we will write NN as the hidden states for all ni ,n2 pairs and nn as the corresponding emissions (detections); and all object+verb pairs as hidden states NV.",
        "The hidden states are therefore denoted as: {NN, NV, S, p} with values taken from their respective word classes from Table 1.",
        "The emission states are {nn, s} with binary values: 1 if the detections occur or 0 otherwise.",
        "The full HMM is summarized in Fig. 8.",
        "The rationale for using a HMM is that we can reuse all previous computation of the probabilities at each level to compute the required probabilities at the current level.",
        "From START, we assume all object pair detections are equiprobable: Pr(nn|START) = +i)where we have added an additional NULL value for objects (at most 1).",
        "At each NN, the HMM emits a detection from the image and by independence we have: Pr(nn|NN) = Pr(m|J)Pr(n2|1).",
        "After NN, the HMM transits to the corresponding verb at state NV with Pr(nv|nn) = Pr(v|ni,n2) obtained from the corpus statistic.",
        "As no action detections are performed on the image, NV has no emissions.",
        "The HMM then transits from NV to S with Pr(s|nv) = Pr(s|n,v) computed from the corpus which emits the scene detection score from the image: Pr (s|S) = Pr (s|1 ).",
        "From S, the HMM transits to P with Pr(p|S) = Pr(p|s) before reaching the END state.",
        "Comparing the HMM with eq.",
        "(2), one can see that all the corpus and detection probabilities are accounted for in the transition and emission probabilities respectively.",
        "Optimizing T is then equivalent to finding the best (most likely) path through the HMM given the image observations using the Viterbi algorithm which can be done in O(10) time which is significantly faster than the naive approach.",
        "We show in Fig. 9 (right-upper) examples of the top viterbi paths that produce T* for four test images.",
        "Note that the proposed HMM is suitable for generating sentences that contain the core components defined in T which produces a sentence of the form NP-VP-PP, which we will show in sec. 4 is sufficient for the task of generating sentences for describing images.",
        "For more complex sentences with more components: such as adjectives oradverbs, the HMM can be easily extended with similar computations derived from the corpus.",
        "Given the selected sentence structure T = {ni , n2, v, s, p}, we generate sentences using the",
        "{aeroplane ,f ly,ai rport,at} the aeroplane is flying at the airport.",
        "{person, motorbike, ride,field, in} the person is riding the motorbike in the field.",

        "When several possible choices are available, a random choice is made that depends on the object detection scores: the is preferred when we are confident of the detections while an, a is preferred otherwise.",
        "2) We predict the most likely preposition inserted between the verbs and nouns learned from the Giga-word corpus via Pr(p|v, n) during sentence generation.",
        "For example, our method will pick the preposition at between verb sit and noun table.",
        "3) The verb v is converted to a form that agrees with in number with the nouns detected.",
        "The present gerund form is preferred such as eating, drinking, walking as it conveys that an action is being performed in the image.",
        "4) The sentence structure is therefore of the form: NP-VP-PP with variations when only one object or multiple detections of the same objects are detected.",
        "A special case is when no objects are detected (below the predefined threshold).",
        "No verbs can be predicted as well.",

        "As a baseline, we simply generated T* directly from images without using the corpus.",
        "There are two variants of this baseline where we seek to determine if listing all objects in the image is crucial for scene description.",
        "7bi is a baseline that uses all possible objects and scene detected: Tk = {ni, n2, • • • , nm, s} and our sentence will be of the form: {Object 1, object 2 and object 3 are IN the scene.}",
        "and we simply selected IN as the only admissible preposition.",
        "For the second baseline, T&2, we limit the number of objects to just any two: Tb2 = {ni,n2, s} and the sentence generated will be of the form {Object 1 and object 2 are IN the scene}.",

        "The third experiment produces the full T* with transition probabilities learned from the corpus.",
        "All experiments were performed on the 100 unseen testing images from the UIUC dataset and we used only the most likely (top) sentence generated for all evaluation.",
        "We use two evaluation metrics as a measure of the accuracy of the generated sentences: 1) ROUGE-1 [Lin and Hovy, 2003] precision scores and 2) Relevance and Readability of the generated sentences.",
        "ROUGE-1 is a recall based metric that is commonly used to measure the effectiveness of text summarization.",
        "In this work, the short descriptive sentence of an image can be viewed as summarizing the image content and ROUGE-1 is able to capture how well this sentence can describe the image by comparing it with the human annotated ground truth of the UIUC dataset.",
        "Due to the short sentences generated, we did not consider other ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-2, ROUGE-SU4) which captures fluency and is not an issue here.",
        "Table 3: Sentence generation evaluation results with human gold standard.",
        "Human R1 scores are averaged over the 5 sentences using a leave one out procedure.",
        "Values in bold are the top scores.",
        "A main shortcoming of using ROUGE-1 is that the generated sentences are compared only to a finite set of human labeled ground truth which obviously does not capture all possible sentences that one can generate.",
        "In other words, ROUGE-1 does not take into account the fact that sentence generation is innately a creative process, and a better recall metric will be to ask humans to judge these sentences.",
        "The second evaluation metric: Relevance and Readability is therefore proposed as an empirical measure of how much the sentence: 1) conveys the image content (relevance) in terms of the objects, actions and scene predicted and 2) is grammatically correct (readability).",
        "We engaged the services of Amazon Mechanical Turks (AMT) to judge the generated sentences based on a discrete scale ranging from 1-5 (low relevance/readability to high relevance/readability).",
        "The averaged results of ROUGE-1, Ri and mean length of the sentences with the Relevance+Readability scores for all experiments are summarized in Table 3.",
        "For comparison, we also asked the AMTs to judge the ground truth sentences as well.",
        "The results reported in Table 3 reveals both the strengths and some shortcomings of the approach which we will briefly discuss here.",
        "Firstly, the Ri scores indicate that based on a purely summarization (unigram-overlap) point of view, the proposed approach of using the HMM to predict T* achieves the best results compared to all other approaches with Ri = 0.44.",
        "This means that our sentences are the closest in agreement with the human annotated ground truth, correctly predicting the sentence structure components.",
        "In addition sentences generated by T* are also succinct: with an average length of 6.9 words per sentence.",
        "However, we are still some way off the human gold standard since we do not predict other parts-of-speech such as adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Given this fact, our proposed approach performance is comparable to other state of the art summarization work in the literature [Bonnie and Dorr, 2004].",
        "Next, we consider the Relevance+Readability metrics based on human judges.",
        "Interestingly, the first baseline, Ti is considered the most relevant description of the image and the least readable at the same time.",
        "This is most likely due to the fact that this recall oriented strategy will almost certainly describe some objects but the lack of any verb description; and longer sentences that average 8.2 words per sentence, makes it less readable.",
        "It is also possible that humans tend to penalize less irrelevant objects compared to missing objects, and further evaluations are necessary to confirm this.",
        "Since T2 is limited to two objects just like the proposed HMM, it is a more suitable baseline for comparison.",
        "Clearly, the results show that adding the HMM to predict the optimal sentence structure increases the relevance of the produced sentence.",
        "Finally, in terms of readability, T* generates the most readable sentences, and this is achieved by leveraging on the corpus to guide our predictions of the most reasonable nouns, verbs, scenes and prepositions that agree with the detections in the image."

        "There are, however, instances where our strategy fails to predict the appropriate verbs or nouns (see Fig. 9).",
