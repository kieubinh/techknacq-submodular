        "Semantic relations in electronic medical records (EMRs) capture important meaning about the associations between medical concepts.",
        "Knowledge about how concepts such as medical problems, treatments, and tests are related can be used to improve medical care by speeding up the retrieval of relevant patient information or alerting doctors to critical information that may have been overlooked.",
        "When doctors write progress notes and discharge summaries they include information about how treatments (e.g., aspirin, stent) were administered for problems (e.g. pain, lesion) along with the outcome, such as an improvement or deterioration.",
        "Additionally, a doctor will describe the tests (e.g., x-ray, blood sugar level) performed on a patient and whether the tests were conducted to investigate a known problem or revealed a new one.",
        "These textual descriptions written in a patient's record encode important information about the relationships between the problems a patients has, the treatments taken for the problems, and the tests which reveal and investigate the problems.",
        "The ability to accurately detect semantic relations in EMRs, such as Treatment-Administered-for-Problem, can aid in querying medical records.",
        "After a preprocessing phase in which the relations are detected in all records they can be indexed and retrieved later as needed.",
        "A doctor could search for all the times that a certain treatment has been used on a particular problem, or determine all the treatments used for a specific problem.",
        "An additional application is the use of the relational information to flag situations that merit further review.",
        "If a patient's medical record indicates a test that was found to reveal a critical problem but no subsequent treatment was performed for the problem, the patient's record could be flagged for review.",
        "Similarly, if a Treatment-Worsens-Problem relation is detected previously in a patient's record, that information can be brought to the attention of a doctor who advises such a treatment in the future.",
        "By considering all of the relations present in a corpus, better medical ontologies could be built automatically or existing ones can be improved by adding additional connections between concepts that have a relation in text.",
        "Given the large size of EMR repositories, we argue that it is quite important to have the ability to perform relation discovery between medical concepts.",
        "Relations between medical concepts benefit translational medicine whenever possible relations are known.",
        "Uzuner et al.",
        "(2011) show that supervised methods recognize such relations with high accuracy.",
        "However, large sets of annotated relations need to be provided for this purpose.",
        "To address both the problem of discovering unknown relations between medical concepts and the related problem of generating examples for known relations, we have developed an unsupervised method.",
        "This approach has the advantages of not requiring an expensive annotation effort to provide training data for semantic relations, which is particularly difficult for medical records, characterized by many privacy concerns.",
        "Our analysis shows a high level of overlap between the manually annotated relations and those that were discovered automatically.",

        "Previous methods for unsupervised relation discovery have also relied on clustering techniques.",
        "One technique uses the context of entity arguments to cluster, while another is to perform a postprocessing step to cluster relations found using an existing relation extraction system.",
        "The approaches most similar to ours have taken features from the context of pairs of entities and used those features to form a clustering space.",
        "In Hasegawa et al.",
        "(2004), those features are tokens found within a context window of the entity pair.",
        "Distance between entity pairs is then computed using cosine similarity.",
        "In another approach, Rosenfeld and Feldman (2007) use hierarchical agglomerative clustering along with features based on token patterns seen in the context, again compared by cosine similarity.",
        "Other approaches to unsupervised relation discovery have relied on a two-step process where a number of relations are extracted, usually from a predicate-argument structure.",
        "Then similar relations are clustered together since synonymous predicates should be considered the same relation (e.g. \"acquire\" and \"purchase\").",
        "Yates (2009) considers the output from an open information extraction system (Yates et al., 2007) and clusters predicates and arguments using string similarity and a combination of constraints.",
        "Syed and Viegas (2010) also perform a clustering on the output of an existing relation extraction system by considering the number of times two relations share the same exact arguments.",
        "Similar relations are expected to have the same pairs of arguments (e.g. \"Ford produces cars\" and \"Ford manufactures cars\").",
        "These approaches and others (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Pantel and Pennac-chiotti, 2006) rely on an assumption that relations are context-independent, such as when a person is born, or the capital of a nation.",
        "Our method will discover relations that can depend on the context as well.",
        "For instance, \"penicillin\" may be causally related to \"allergic reaction\" in one patient's medical record but not in another.",
        "The relation between the two entities is not globally constant and should be considered only within the scope of one patient's records.",
        "Additionally, these two-step approaches tend to rely on predicate-argument structures such as subject-verb-object triples to detect arbitrary relations (Syed and Viegas, 2010; Yates et al., 2007).",
        "Such approaches can take advantage of the large body of research that has been done on extracting syntactic parse structure and semantic role information from text.",
        "However, these approaches can overlook relations in text which do not map easily onto those structures.",
        "Unlike these approaches, our model can detect relations that are not expressed as a verb, such as \"[cough] + [green sputum]\" to express a conjunction or \"[Cl] 119 mEq / L [High]\" to express that a test reading is indicating a problem.",
        "The 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge (Uzuner et al., 2011) developed a set of annotations for medical concepts and relations on medical progress notes and discharge summaries.",
        "One task at the challenge involved developing systems for the extraction of eight types of relations between concepts.",
        "We use this data set to compare our unsupervised method with others.",
        "The advantage of our work over existing unsupervised approaches is the simultaneous clustering of both argument words and relation trigger words.",
        "These broad clusters handle: (i) synonyms, (ii) arguCluster 1 Words: secondary, due, likely, patient, disease, liver, abdominal, cancer, pulmonary, respiratory, elevated, volume, chronic, edema, related \"Correct\" instances: [Metastatic colon cancer] with [abdominal carcinomatosis]; [symptoms] were due to [trauma] \"Incorrect\" instances: [mildly improving symptoms] , plan will be to continue with [his current medicines]; [prophylaxis] against [peptic ulcer disease] Cluster 2:",

        "A simple approach to discovering relations between medical entities in clinical texts uses a clustering approach, e.g.",
        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "We start with an assumption that relations exist between two entities, which we call arguments, and may be triggered by certain words between those entities which we call trigger words.",
        "For example, given the text \"[x-ray] revealed [lung cancer]\", the first argument is x-ray, the second argument is lung cancer, and the trigger word is revealed.",
        "We further assume that the arguments must belong to a small set of semantic classes specific to the relation.",
        "For instance, x-ray belongs to a class of medical tests, whereas lung cancer belongs to a class of medical problems.",
        "While relations may exist between distant entities in text, we focus on those pairs of entities in text which have no other entities between them.",
        "This increases the likelihood of a relation existing between the entities and minimizes the number of context words (words between the entities) that are not relevant to the relation.",
        "With these assumptions we build a baseline relation discovery using LDA.",
        "LDA is used as a baseline because of its similarities with our own generative model presented in the next section.",
        "Each consecutive pair of entities in text is extracted, along with the tokens found between them.",
        "Each of the entities in a pair is split into tokens which are taken along with the context tokens to form a single pseudodocument.",
        "When the LDA is processed on all such pseudo-documents, clusters containing words which co-occur are formed.",
        "Our assumption that relation arguments come from a small set of semantic classes should lead to clusters which align with relations since the two arguments of a relation will co-occur in the pseudo-documents.",
        "Furthermore, those argument tokens should co-occur with relation trigger words as well.",
        "This LDA-based approach was examined on electronic medical records from the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge data set (Uzuner et al., 2011).",
        "The data set",
        "Figure 1: Two clusters found by examining the most likely words under two LDA topics.",
        "The instances are pseudo-documents whose probability of being assigned to that cluster was over 70% contains manually annotated medical entities which were used to form the pairs of entities needed.",
        "For example, Figure 1 illustrates examples of two clusters out of 15 discovered automatically using LDA on the corpus.",
        "The first cluster appears to contain words which indicate a relation whose two arguments are both medical problems (e.g. \"disease\", \"cancer\", \"edema\").",
        "The trigger words seem to indicate a possible causal relation (e.g., \"due\", \"related\", \"secondary\").",
        "The second cluster contains words relevant to medical tests (e.g. \"examination\", \"culture\") and their findings (\"revealed\", \"showed\", \"positive\").",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, some of the context words are not necessarily related to the relation.",
        "The word \"patient\" for instance is present in both clusters but is not a trigger word because it is likely to be seen in the context of any relation in medical text.",
        "The LDA-based model treats all words equally and cannot identify which words are likely trigger words and which ones are general words, which merely occur frequently in the context of a relation.",
        "In addition, while the LDA approach can detect argument words which co-occur with trigger words (e.g., \"examination\" and \"showed\"), the clusters produced with LDA do not differentiate between contextual words and words which belong to the arguments of the relation.",
        "An approach which models arguments separately from context words could learn the semantic classes of those arguments and thus better model relations.",
        "Considering the examples from Figure 1, a model which could cluster \"examination\", \"exam\", \"cultures\", and \"culture\" into one medical test cluster and \"disease\", \"cancer\" and \"edema\" into a medical problem cluster separate from the relation trigger words and general words should model relations more accurately by better reflecting the implicit structure of the text.",
        "Because of these limitations many relations discovered in this way are not accurate, as can be seen in Figure 1.",
        "The limitations identified in the LDA-based approach are solved by a novel relation discovery model (RDM) which jointly models relation argument semantic classes and considers them separately from the context words.",
        "Relations triggered by pairs of medical entities enable us to consider three observable features: (A1) the first argument; (A2) the second argument; and (CW) the context words found between A1 and A2.",
        "For instance, in sentence S1 the arguments are A1=\"some air hunger\" and A2=\"his tidal volume\" while the context words are \"last\", \"night\", \"when\", \"I\", and \"dropped\".",
        "S1 : He developed [some air hunger]prob last night when I dropped [his tidal volume]treat from 450 to 350.",
        "In the RDM, the contextual words are assumed to come from a mixture model with 2 mixture components: a relation trigger word (x = 0), or a general word (x = 1), where x is a variable representing which mixture component a word belongs to.",
        "In sentence S1 for example, the word \"dropped\" can be seen as a trigger word for a Treatment-Causes-Problem relation.",
        "The remaining words are not trigger words and hence are seen as general words.",
        "Under the RDM's mixture model, the probability of a context word is:",
        "Where wC is a context word, the variable tr is the relation type, and z is the general word class.",
        "The variable x chooses whether a context word comes from a relation-specific distribution of trigger words, or from a general word class.",
        "In the RDM, the two argument classes are modeled jointly as P(c,c\\tr), where c and c are two semantic classes associated with a relation of type tr.",
        "However the assignment ofclasses to arguments depends on a directionality variable d. If d = 0, then the first argument is assigned semantic class c and the second is assigned class c. When d = 1 however, the class assignments are swapped.",
        "This models the fact that a relation's arguments do not come in a fixed order, \"[MRI] revealed [tumor]\" is the same type of relation as \"[tumor] was revealed by [x-ray]\".",

        "The relation and argument clusters determined by the RDM provide a better unsupervised relation discovery method than the baselines.",

        "The analysis shows that words highly indicative of relations are detected and clustered automatically, without the need for prior annotation of relations or even the choice of a predetermined set of relation types.",
        "The discovered relations can be interpreted by a human or labeled automatically using a technique such as the one presented in Pantel and Ravichandran (2004).",
        "The fact that the discovered relations and argument classes align well with those chosen by annotators on the same data justify our assumptions about relations being present and discoverable by the way they are expressed in text.",

        "In addition to modeling trigger words, a joint distribution on argument semantic classes is also incorporated.",
        "This allows the model to determine a relation type even in the absence of triggers.",
        "For example, consider the entity pair \"[lung cancer] [XRT]\", where XRT stands for external radiation therapy.",
        "By determining the semantic classes for the arguments (lung cancer is a Problem, and XRT is a test), the set of possible relations between the arguments can be narrowed down.",
        "For instance, XRT is unlikely to be in a causal relationship with a problem, or to make a problem worse.",
        "A further aid is the fact that the learned relationships may be specialized.",
        "For instance, there may be a learned relation type such as \"Cancer treatment addresses cancer problem\".",
