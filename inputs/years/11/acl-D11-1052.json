        "Recently, there has been a surge of interest in sentiment analysis of Twitter messages.",
        "Many researchers (e.g., Bollen et al.",
        "2011; Kivran-Swaine and Naaman 2011) are interested in studying structure and interactions in social networks, where sentiment can play an important role.",
        "Others use Twitter as a barometer for public mood and opinion in diverse areas such as entertainment, politics and economics.",
        "For example, Diakopoulos and Shamma (2010) use Twitter messages posted in conjunction with the live presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain to gauge public opinion, Bollen et al.",
        "(2010) measure public mood on Twitter and use it to predict upcoming stock market fluctuations, and O'Connor et al.",
        "(2010) connect public opinion data from polls to sentiment expressed in Twitter messages along a timeline.",
        "A prerequisite of all such research is an effective method for measuring the sentiment of a post or tweet.",
        "Due to the extremely informal nature of the medium, and the length restriction, the language and jargon which is used in Twitter varies significantly from that of commonly studied text corpora.",
        "In addition, Twitter is a quickly evolving domain, and new terms are constantly being introduced.",
        "These factors pose difficulties to methods designed for conventional domains, such as news.",
        "One solution is to use human annotation.",
        "For example, Kivran-Swaine and Naaman (2011) use manual coding of tweets in several emotion categories (e.g., joy, sadness) for their research.",
        "Diakopoulos and Shamma (2010) use crowd sourcing via Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",
        "Manual encoding usually offers a deeper understanding and correspondingly higher accuracy than shallow automatic methods.",
        "However, it is expensive and labor intensive and cannot be applied in real time.",
        "Crowd-sourcing carries additional caveats of its own, such as issues of annotator expertise and reliability (see Diakopoulos and Shamma 2010).",
        "The automatic approach to sentiment analysis is commonly used for processing data from social networks and microblogs, where there is often a huge quantity of information and a need for low latency.",
        "Many automatic approaches (including all those used in the work mentioned above) have at their core a sentiment lexicon, containing a list of words labeled with specific associated emotions (joy, happiness) or a polarity value (positive, neutral, negative).",
        "The overall sentiment of a piece of text is calculated as a function of the labels of the component words.",
        "Because Twitter messages are short, shallow approaches are sometimes considered sufficient (Bermingham and Smeaton, 2010).",
        "There are also approaches that use deeper machine learning techniques to train sentiment classifiers on examples that have been labeled for sentiment, either manually or automatically, as described above.",
        "Recent examples of this approach are Barbosa and Feng (2010) and Pak and Paroubek (2010).",
        "Most established sentiment lexicons (e.g., Wilson et al.",
        "2005, see Section 5) were created for a general domain, and suffer from limited coverage and inaccuracies when applied to the highly informal domain of social networks communication.",
        "By creating a sentiment lexicon which is specifically tailored to the microblogging domain, or adapting an existing one, we can expect to achieve higher accuracy and increased coverage.",
        "Recent work in this area includes Velikovich et al.",
        "(2010), who developed a method for automatically deriving an extensive sentiment lexicon from the web as a whole.",
        "The resulting lexicon has greatly increased coverage compared to existing dictionaries and can handle spelling errors and web-specific jargon.",
        "Bollen et al.",
        "(2010) expand an existing well-vetted psychometric instrument - Profile of Mood States (POMS) (Mc-Nair et al., 1971) that associates terms with moods (e.g. calm, happy).",
        "The authors use co-occurrence information from the Google n-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) to enlarge the original list of 72 terms to 964.",
        "They use this expanded emotion lexicon (named GPOS) in conjunction with the lexicon of Wilson et al.",
        "(2005) to estimate public mood from Twitter posts.",
        "The method we present in this paper leverages a phenomenon that is specific to informal social communication to enable the extension of an existing lexicon in a domain specific manner."

        "Prosodic indicators (such as high pitch, prolonged duration, intensity, vowel quality, etc.)",
        "have long been know (Bolinger, 1965) as ways for a speaker to emphasize or accent an important word.",
        "The ways in which they are used in speech are the subject of ongoing linguistic research (see, for example, Calhoun 2010).",
        "In written text, many of these indicators are lost.",
        "However, there exist some orthographic conventions which are used to mark or substitute for prosody, including punctuation and typographic styling (italic, bold, and underlined text).",
        "In purely text-based domains, such as Twitter, styling is not always available, and is replaced by capitalization or other conventions (e.g., enclosing the word in asterisks).",
        "Additionally, the informal nature of the domain leads to an orthographic style which is much closer to the spoken form than in other, more formal, domains.",
        "In this work, we hypothesize that the commonly observed phenomenon of lengthening words by repeating letters is a substitute for prosodic emphasis (increased duration or change of pitch).",
        "As such, it can be used as an indicator of important words and, in particular, ones that bear strong indication of sentiment.",
        "Our experiments are designed to analyze the phenomenon of lengthening and its implications to sentiment detection.",
        "First, in Experiment I, we show the pervasiveness of the phenomenon in our dataset, and measure the potential gains in coverage that can be achieved by considering lengthening when processing Twitter data.",

        "In the first part of Experiment III we demonstrate the implications of this connection for the purpose of sentiment detection using an existing sentiment lexicon.",
        "In the second part, we present an unsupervised method for using the lengthening phenomenon to expand an existing sentiment lexicon and tailor it to our domain.",

        "This indicates that the strategy of choosing the most frequent form as the canonical one is reliable and highly accurate (> 97%).",
        "Implications for NLP To examine the effects of lengthening on analyzing Twitter data, we look at the difference in coverage of a standard English dictionary when we explicitly handle lengthened words by mapping them to the canonical form.",

        "The canonical form for 2,037 word-sets are identified by our dictionary.",
        "We searched for occurrences of these words which were lengthened by two or more characters, meaning they would not be identified using standard lemmatization methods or spell-correction techniques that are based on edit distance.",
        "We detected 25,101 occurrences of these, appearing in 22,064 (4.4%) tweets.",
