        "Recent years have seen rapid growth in user-generated opinions online.",
        "Many of them are user reviews: a best-seller or a popular restaurant can get over 1000 reviews on top review sites like Amazon or Yelp.",
        "A large quantity of them also come in the form of user comments on blogs or news articles.",
        "Most notably, during the short period of time for which a major event is active, news stories on one single event can easily attract over ten thousand comments on a popular online news site like Yahoo!",
        "News.",
        "One question becomes immediate: how can we help people consume such gigantic amount of opinionated information?",
        "One possibility is to take the summarization route.",
        "Briefly speaking (see Section 2 for a more detailed discussion), previous work has largely formulated review summarization as automatically or manually identify ratable aspects, and present overall sentiment polarity for each aspect (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008).",
        "A related line of research looked into predicting helpfulness of reviews in the hope of promoting those with better quality, where helpfulness is usually defined as some function over the percentage of users who found the review to be helpful (Kim et al., 2006; Liu et al., short, the focus of previous work has been on distilling subjective information for an average user.",
        "Whether opinion consumers are looking for quality information or just wondering what other people think, each may have different purposes or preferences that is not well represented by a generic average user.",
        "If we think about how we deal with information content overflow on the Web, there have been two main frameworks to identify relevant information for each person.",
        "One is search.",
        "Indeed many top review sites allow users to search within reviews for a given entity.",
        "But this is only useful when users have explicit information needs that can be formulated as queries.",
        "The other paradigm is recommendation: based on what users have liked or disliked in the past, the system will automatically recommend new items.",
        "Can we provide similar recommendation mechanisms to help users consume large quantities of subjective information?",
        "Many commenting environments allow users to mark \"like\" or \"dislike\" over existing comments (e.g., Yahoo!",
        "News comments, Facebook posts, or review sites that allow helpfulness votes).",
        "Can we learn from users' past preferences, so that when a user is reading a new article, we have a system that automatically ranks its comments according to their likelihood of being liked by the user?",
        "This can be used directly to create personalized presentation of comments (e.g., into a \"like\" column and a \"dislike\" column), as well as enabling downstream applications such as personalized summarization.",
        "Recommending textual information has recently attracted more attention.",
        "So far, the focus has been mainly on recommending news articles (Ahn et al., 2007; Das et al., 2007).",
        "Our task differs in several aspects.",
        "Intuitively, recommending news articles is largely about identifying the topics of interest to a given user, and it is conceivable that unigram representation of full-length articles can reasonably capture that information.",
        "In our case, most comments for an article a user is reading are already of interest to that user topically.",
        "Which ones the user ends up liking may depend on several non-topical aspects of the text: whether the user agrees with the viewpoint expressed in the comment, whether the comment is convincing and well-written, etc.",
        "Previous work has shown that such analysis can be more difficult than topic-based analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008), and we have the additional challenge that comments are typically much shorter than full-length articles.",
        "However, the difficulty in analyzing the textual information in comments can be alleviated by additional contextual information such as author identities.",
        "If between a pair of users one consistently likes or dislikes the other, then at least for the heavy users, this authorship information alone could be highly informative.",
        "Indeed, previous work in collaborative filtering has usually found no additional gain from leveraging content information when entity-level preference information is abundant.",
        "In this paper, we present a principled way of utilizing multiple sources of information for the task of recommending user comments, which significantly outperforms strong baseline methods, as well as previous methods proposed for text recommendation.",
        "While using authorship information alone tends to provide stronger signal than using textual information alone, to our surprise, even for heavy users, adding textual information to the authorship information yields additional improvements."

        "There are two main bodies of related work: our problem formulation is closer to collaborative filtering, while the nature of the text we are dealing with has more in common with opinion mining and sentiment analysis.",
        "Our approach is related to a large body of work in collaborative filtering.",
        "While a proper survey is not possible here, we describe some of the approaches that are germane.",
        "Classical approaches in collaborative filtering are based on item-item/user-user similarity, these are nearest-neighbor methods where the response for a user-item pair is predicted based on a local neighborhood mean (Sarwar et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2006).",
        "In general, neighborhoods are defined by measuring similarities between users/items through correlation measures like Pearson, cosine similarities, etc.",
        "Better approaches to estimate similarities have also been proposed in Koren (2010).",
        "However, modern methods based on matrix factorization have been shown to outperform nearest neighbor methods (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008a,b; Bell et al., 2007).",
        "Generalizations of matrix factorization to include both features and past ratings have been proposed (Agarwal and Chen, 2009; Stern et al., 2009).",
        "The approach in this paper is an extension where in addition to interactions among users and items (comments in our case), we also consider the authorship information.",
        "Three-way interactions were recently studied for personalized tag recommendation (Rendle and Lars, 2010).",
        "Their model was based on the sum of two-way interactions, and was trained by using pairwise tag preferences for each (user, item) pair.",
        "However, no features were considered, which is an important consideration for us.",
        "We show using both text and authorship provides the best performance.",
        "Our work is also related to news personalization that has received increasing attention in the last few years.",
        "For instance, Billsus and Pazanni (2007) describes an approach to build user profile models for adaptive personalization in the context of mobile content access.",
        "Their approach is based on a hybrid model that combines content-based approaches with similarity methods used in recommender systems.",
        "This is further exemplified in the work by Ahn et al.",
        "(2007) where text processing techniques are used to build content profiles for users to recommend personalized news.",
        "In our experiments, we show that such approaches are inferior to our method.",
        "A content agnostic approach based on collaborative filtering techniques was proposed by Das et al.",
        "(2007); cold-start for new items/users was not their focus, but is important for our task â€“ candidate comments for recommendation are often not in training data.",
        "As discussed in Section 1, previous work in opinion mining and sentiment analysis has addressed the information consumption challenge via review summarization.",
        "Discussion of early work in that direction can be found in Pang and Lee (2008).",
        "In this line of work, opinions for each given aspect are usually summarized as the average sentiment polarity associated with that aspect.",
        "Related to that, people have looked into predicting review helpfulness given the textual information in reviews, where helpfulness is either defined as the percentage of users who have voted the review to be helpful (Kim et al., 2006), or labeled by annotators according to a set of criteria (Liu et al., 2007).",
        "Our goal differs in that we look for personalized ranking (what a specific user might like) rather than generic quality (what an average user might like).",
        "Subsequently, there has been work that tried to predict similarly defined helpfulness scores using meta-information over the reviewer.",
        "For instance, whether the author has used his/her true name or where the user is from (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2009), as well as graph structure in the social network between reviewers (Lu et al., 2010).",
        "In this work, we simply use author identity to provide more context to the short text; in future work, additional metainformation over users can easily be incorporated via our model.",
        "As discussed in Section 1, whether a rater likes a comment or not may depend on whether they agree with the viewpoint expressed in the text and quality of the text.",
        "While previous work has not looked into the reader-comments relationship, there has been related work on identifying political orientations or viewpoints (Lin and Hauptmann, 2006; Lin et al., 2003); whether a piece of text expresses support or opposition in congressional debates (Thomas et al., 2006) or online debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009, 2010); as well as identifying contrastive relationship (Kawahara et al., 2010).",
        "Note that it is not trivial to use previous work along this line to directly serve as subcomponents in our setting.",
        "For instance, for work on identifying political orientations or viewpoints, the training data consists of text with the desired labels.",
        "In our setting, our labels come in the form of whether users liked or disliked a previous comment.",
        "In the simplest case, we might have pairwise constraints on whether two pieces of text have the same viewpoints (i.e., liked or disliked by the same rater), which would yield a different learning problem akin to the metric learning problem; note, however, the complication that two pieces of text receiving different labels from a given user might not necessarily contain contrasting viewpoints.",
        "Consequently, rather than trying to reduce this problem to a set of known text classification tasks, we address this task via a collaborative filtering framework that incorporates textual features."

        "In this section, we describe our model that predicts rater affinity to comments.",
        "A key strength of our model is the ability to incorporate rater-comment and rater-author interactions simultaneously in a principled fashion.",
        "Our model also provides a seamless mechanism to transition from cold-start (where recommendations need to be made for users or items with no or few past ratings) to warm-start scenarios â€“ with a large amount of data, it fits a per-rater (author) model; with increase in data sparsity, the model applies a small sample size correction through features (in our case, textual features).",
        "The exact formula for such corrections in the presence of sparsity is based on parameter estimates that are obtained by applying an EM algorithm to the training data.",
        "Notation: Let yij denote the rating that user i, called the rater, gives to comment j.",
        "Since throughout, we use suffix i to denote a rater and suffix j to denote a comment, we slightly abuse notation and let xi (of dimension pu) and x j (of dimension pc) denote feature vectors of user i and comment j respectively.",
        "For example, xi can be the bag of words representation (a sparse vector) inferred through text analysis on comments voted positively by user i in the past, and Xj can be the bag of words representation for comment j.",
        "We use a(j) to denote the author of comment j, and use ÃŸij to denote the mean rating by rater i on comment j, i.e., ÃŸij = E (yij ).",
        "Of course it is impossible to estimate ÃŸij empirically since each user i usually rates a comment j at most once.",
        "Model specification: We work in a generalized linear model framework (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) that assumes ÃŸij (or some monotone function h of ÃŸij) is an additive function of (1) the rater bias ai of user i since some users may have a tendency of rating comments more positively or negatively than others, (2) popularity ÃŸj of comment j, which could reflect the quality of the comment in this setting, and (3) the author reputation Yajj) of user a(j) since comments by a reputed author may in general get more positive ratings.",
        "Thus, the overall bias is",
        "In addition to the bias, we include terms that capture interactions among entities (raters, authors, comments).",
        "Indeed, capturing such interactions is a non-trivial part of our modeling procedure.",
        "In our approach, we take recourse to factor models that have been widely used in collaborative filtering applications in recent times.",
        "The basic idea is to attach latent factors to each rater, author and comment.",
        "These latent factors are finite dimensional Euclidean vectors that are unknown and estimated from the data.",
        "They provide a succinct representation of various aspects that are important to explain interaction among entities.",
        "In our case, we use the following factors â€“ (a) user factor vi of dimension rv (> 1) to model rater-author affinity, (b) user factor ui and comment factor Cj of dimension ru(> 1) to model rater-comment affinity.",

        "The overall interaction is v'iva(j) + u!iCj.",
        "Then, the mean rating ÃŸij, or more precisely h(ÃŸij), is modeled as the sum of bias and interaction terms.",
        "Mathematically, we assume:",
        "For numeric ratings, we use the Gaussian distribution denoted by N(mean,var); for binary ratings, we use the Bernoulli distribution.",
        "For Gaussian, h(ÃŸij) = ÃŸij, and for Bernoulli, we assume h (ÃŸj ) = log , which is the commonly used logistic transformation.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the notations for easy references.",
        "We denote the full model specified above as vv+uc since both user-user interaction viva(j) and user-comment interaction uicj are modeled at the same time.",
        "Latent factors: A natural approach to estimate latent factors in Equation 1 is through a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach.",
        "This does not work in our scenario since a large fraction of entities have small sample size.",
        "For instance, if a comment is rated only by one user and ru > 1, the model is clearly overparametrized and the MLE of the comment factor would tend to learn idiosyncrasies in the training data.",
        "Hence, it is imperative to impose constraints on the factors to obtain estimates that generalize well on unseen data.",
        "We work in a Bayesian framework where such constraints are imposed through prior distributions.",
        "The crucial issue is the selection of appropriate priors.",
        "In our scenario, we need priors that provide a good backoff estimate when interacting entities have small sample sizes.",
        "For instance, to estimate latent factors of a user with little data, we provide a backoff estimate that is obtained by pooling data across users with the same user features.",
        "We perform such a pooling through regression, the mathematical specification is given below.",
        "where gPu x and dPc x are regression weight vectors, and GTuXPu and DTuXPc are regression weight matrices.",
        "These regression weights are learnt from data and provide the backoffestimate.",
        "Take the prior distribution of ui for example.",
        "We can rewrite the prior as ui = Gxi + 5i, where 5i â€“ N(0, aU).",
        "If user i has no rating in the training data, ui will be predicted as the prior mean (backoff) Gxi, a linear projection from the feature vector xi through matrix G learnt from data.",
        "This projection can be thought of as a multivariate linear regression problem with weight matrix G, one weight vector per dimension of ui.",
        "However, if user i has many ratings in the training data, we will precisely estimate the peruser residual 5i that is not captured by the regression Gxi.",
        "For sample sizes in between these two extremes, the per user residual estimate is \"shrunk\" toward zero â€“ amount of shrinkage depends on the sample size, past user ratings, variability in ratings on comments rated by the user, and the value of variance components as.",
        "Our full model (vv+uc) includes several existing models explored in collaborative filtering and social networks as special cases.",
        "The matrix factorization model: This model assumes the mean rating of user i on item j is given by h (/j ) = ai + ÃŸj + uicj, and the mean of the prior distributions on ( i, ÃŸj, ui, Cj are zero, i.e., g = d = G = D = 0.",
        "Recent work clearly illustrates that this method obtains better predictive accuracy than classical collaborative filtering techniques based on item-item similarity (Bell et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "The uc model: This is also a matrix factorization model but with priors based on regressions (i.e., non-zero g, d, G, D).",
        "It provides a mechanism to deal with both cold and warm-start scenarios in recommender applications (Agarwal and Chen (2009)).",
        "The vv model: This model assumes h(ÃŸij) = ( i + Ya(j) + viva(j).",
        "It was first proposed by Hoff (2005) to model interactions in social networks.",
        "The model was fitted to small datasets (at most a few hundred nodes) and the goal was to test certain hypotheses on social behavior, out-of-sample prediction was not considered.",
        "The low-rank bilinear regression model: Here, h(ÃŸij) = g'xi + d'xj + xiG'Dxj.",
        "This is a regression model purely based on features with no peruser or per-comment latent factors.",
        "In a more general form, xiG'Dxj can be written as xiAxj, where APuXPc is the matrix of regression weights (Chu and Park, 2009).",
        "However, since xi and xj are typically high dimensional, A can be a large matrix that needs to be learnt from data.",
        "To reduce dimensionality, one can decompose A as A = G'D, where the number of rows in D and G are small.",
        "Thus, instead of learning A, we learn a low-rank approximation of A.",
        "This ensures scalability and provides an attractive method to avoid over-fitting.",
        "Model fitting for our model is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "For ease of exposition and space constraints, we only provide a sketch of the algorithm for the Gaussian case, the logistic model can be fitted along the same lines by using a variational approximation (see Agarwal and Chen (2009)).",
        "Let Y = {yij} denote the set of the observed ratings.",
        "In the EM parlance, this is \"incomplete\" data that gets augmented with the latent factors 0 = {ui, vi, cj} to obtain the \"complete\" data.",

        "Since such marginalization is not available in closed form for our model, we use the EM algorithm.",
        "EM algorithm: The complete data log-likelihood 1(n; Y, 0) for the full model in the Gaussian case (where h(ÃŸij) = ÃŸij) is given by 1(n; Y, 0) = where rU is the dimension of factors ui and cj, and rv is the dimension of vi.",
        "Let n(t) denote the estimated parameter setting at the tth iteration.",
        "The EM algorithm iterates through the following two steps until convergence.",
        "â€¢ E-step: Compute /t(n) = Ee[Z(n; Y, 0) | n(t)] as a function of n, where the expectation is taken over the posterior distribution of (0 | n(t), Y).",
        "Note that here n is the input variable of function ft, but n(t) consists of known quantities (determined in the previous iteration).",
        "â€¢ M-step: Find the n that maximizes the expectation computed in the E-step.",
        "Since the expectation in the E-step is not available in a closed form, we use a Gibbs sampler to compute the Monte Carlo expectation (Booth and Hobert, 1999).",
        "The Gibbs sampler repeats the following procedure L times.",
        "It samples ai, Yi, ÃŸj, ui, vj, and cj sequentially one at a time by sampling from the corresponding full conditional distributions.",
        "The full conditional distributions are all Gaussian, hence they are easy to sample.",
        "Once a Monte Carlo expectation is calculated from the samples, an updated estimate of n is obtained in the M-step.",
        "The optimization of variance components a s in the M-step is available in closed form, the regression parameters are estimated through off-the-shelf linear regression routines.",
        "We note that the posterior distribution of latent factors for known n is multi-modal, we have found the Monte Carlo based EM method to outperform other optimization methods like gradient descent in terms of predictive accuracy."

        "Note that SVMs typically yield the best performance on text classification tasks; a Naive Bayes classifier can be more robust over shorter text spans common in user comments given the high variance.",
        "For fair comparisons, for the three baseline methods, we use a simple way of utilizing author information: the feature space is augmented with author IDs and each xj is augmented with a(j).",
        "In Section 4.3, we only report results using the augmented feature vectors since they yield better performance (though the difference is fairly small).",
        "Performance metrics: We use two types of metrics to measure the performance of a method: (1) A global metric based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and (2) Precision at rank k (P@k).",
        "The former measures the overall correlation of predicted scores for a method with the observed ratings in the test set, while the latter measures the performance of a hypothetical top-k recommendation scenario using the method.",
        "To summarize an ROC curve into a single number, we use the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).",
        "Since random guess yields AUC score of 0.5, regardless of the class distribution, using this measure makes it convenient for us to compare the performance over different subsets of the data (where class distributions could be different).",
        "The P@k of a method is computed as follows: (1) For each rater, rank comments that the rater rated in the test set according to the scores predicted by the method, and compute the precision at rank k for that rater; and then (2) average the per-rater precision numbers over all raters.",
        "To report P@k, for k = 5,10, 20, we only use raters who have at least 50 ratings in the test set.",
        "Statistical significance based on a two-sample t-test across raters is also reported.",
        "We first show the ROC curves of different methods on the test set in Figure 1, and the AUCs and precisions in Table 2.",
        "Results from significance tests are in Table 3.",

        "Note that vv outperforms uc in ROC, AUC and P@20, but is worse than uc in P@5 and P@10; we will take a closer look at this later.",
        "Finally, the full model vv+uc significantly outperforms both vv and uc, achieving 0.83 in AUC, and close to 90% in precision at rank 20.",
        "Next, we investigate model performance in different subsets of the test set.",
        "For succinctness, we use AUC as our performance metric.",
        "In Figure 2(a), we breakdown model performance by different author activity levels.",
        "In Figure 2(b), we breakdown model performance by different voter activity levels.",
        "We also generated similar plots with the y-axis replaced by P@5, P@10 and P@20, and observed the same trend except that vv starts to outperform uc at different user activity thresholds for different metrics.",
        "Table 3: Paired t-test results.",
        "Note that uc is better than bilinear in P@5, but not significant.",
        "The orders of uc and vv are not consistent across different metrics.",
        "Not surprisingly, vv performs poorly for raters or authors with no ratings observed in the training data.",
        "However, once we have a small amount of ratings, it starts to outperform uc, even though intuitively, the textual information in the comment should be more informative than the authorship information alone.",
        "Using paired t-tests with significance level 0.05, we report when vv starts to significantly outperform uc in the following table, which is interpreted as follows â€“ vv is not significantly worse than uc in metric M if the author of a test comment received at least Neq ratings in the training set, and vv significantly outperforms uc in metric M if the author received at least Ngt ratings in the training set.",
        "Recall that our training/test split is by article.",
        "Since we have never observed a rater's preference over the test articles before, it is rather surprising that author information alone can yield 0.8 in AUC score, even for very light authors who have received between 3 and 5 votes in total in the training data.",
        "This suggests that users' viewpoints are quite consistent: a large portion of the ratings can be adequately explained by the pair of user identities.",
        "One interesting observation is that the number of ratings required for vv to outperform uc in P@5 is quite high.",
        "This suggests that to obtain high precision at the top of a recommended list, comment features are important.",
