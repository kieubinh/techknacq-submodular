        "Recently there has been an explosion in the number of people having informal, public conversations on social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter.",
        "This presents a unique opportunity to build collections of naturally occurring conversations that are orders of magnitude larger than those previously available.",
        "These corpora, in turn, present new opportunities to apply data-driven techniques to conversational tasks.",
        "We investigate the problem of response generation: given a conversational stimulus, generate an appropriate response.",
        "Specifically, we employ a large corpus of status-response pairs found on Twitter to create a system that responds to Twitter status posts.",
        "Note that we make no mention of context, intent or dialogue state; our goal is to generate any response that fits the provided stimulus; however, we do so without employing rules or templates, with the hope of creating a system that is both flexible and extensible when operating in an open domain.",
        "Success in open domain response generation could be immediately useful to social media platforms, providing a list of suggested responses to a target status, or providing conversation-aware auto-complete for responses in progress.",
        "These features are especially important on hand-held devices (Has-selgren et al., 2003).",
        "Response generation should also be beneficial in building \"chatterbots\" (Weizenbaum, 1966) for entertainment purposes or companionship (Wilks, 2006).",
        "However, we are most excited by the future potential of data-driven response generation when used inside larger dialogue systems, where direct consideration of the user's utterance could be combined with dialogue state (Wong and Mooney, 2007; Langner et al., 2010) to generate locally coherent, purposeful dialogue.",
        "In this work, we investigate statistical machine translation as an approach for response generation.",
        "We are motivated by the following observation: In naturally occurring discourse, there is often a strong structural relationship between adjacent utterances (Hobbs, 1985).",
        "For example, consider the stimulus-response pair from the data:",
        "Stimulus: I'm slowly making this soup ......and it smells gorgeous!",
        "Response: I'll bet it looks delicious too!",
        "Here \"it\" in the response refers to \"this soup\" in the status by co-reference; however, there is also a more subtle relationship between the \"smells\" and \"looks\", as well as \"gorgeous\" and \"delicious\".",
        "Parallelisms such as these are frequent in naturally occurring conversations, leading us to ask whether it might be possible to translate a stimulus into an appropriate response.",
        "We apply SMT to this problem, treating Twitter as our parallel corpus, with status posts as our source language and their responses as our target language.",
        "However, the established SMT pipeline cannot simply be applied out of the box.",
        "We identify two key challenges in adapting SMT to the response generation task.",
        "First, unlike bilingual text, stimulus-response pairs are not semantically equivalent, leading to a wider range of possible responses for a given stimulus phrase.",
        "Furthermore, both sides of our parallel text are written in the same language.",
        "Thus, the most strongly associated word or phrase pairs found by off-the-shelf word alignment and phrase extraction tools are identical pairs.",
        "We address this issue with constraints and features to limit lexical overlap.",
        "Secondly, in stimulus-response pairs, there are far more unaligned words than in bilingual pairs; it is often the case that large portions of the stimulus are not referenced in the response and vice versa.",
        "Also, there are more large phrase-pairs that cannot be easily decomposed (for example see figure 2).",
        "These difficult cases confuse the IBM word alignment models.",
        "Instead of relying on these alignments to extract phrase-pairs, we consider all possible phrase-pairs in our parallel text, and apply an association-based filter.",
        "We compare our approach to response generation against two Information Retrieval or nearest neighbour approaches, which use the input stimulus to select a response directly from the training data.",
        "We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and perform an evaluation using human annotators from Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",
        "Along the way, we investigate the utility of SMT's BLEU evaluation metric when applied to this domain.",
        "We show that SMT-based solutions outperform IR-based solutions, and are chosen over actual human responses in our data in 15% of cases.",
        "As far as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate the feasibility of SMT's application to generating responses to open-domain linguistic stimuli."

        "There has been a long history of \"chatterbots\" al., 2010), which attempt to engage users, typically leading the topic of conversation.",
        "They usually limit interactions to a specific scenario (e.g. a Rogerian psychotherapist), and use a set of template rules for generating responses.",
        "In contrast, we focus on the simpler task of generating an appropriate response to a single utterance.",
        "We leverage large amounts of conversational training data to scale to our Social Media domain, where conversations can be on just about any topic.",
        "Additionally, there has been work on generating more natural utterances in goal-directed dialogue systems (Ratnaparkhi, 2000; Rambow et al., 2001).",
        "Currently, most dialogue systems rely on either canned responses or templates for generation, which can result in utterances which sound very unnatural in context (Chambers and Allen, 2004).",
        "Recent work has investigated the use of SMT in translating internal dialogue state into natural language (Langner et al., 2010).",
        "In addition to dialogue state, we believe it may be beneficial to consider the user's utterance when generating responses in order to generate locally coherent discourse (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005).",
        "Data-driven generation based on users' utterances might also be a useful way to fill in knowledge gaps in the system (Galley et al., 2001; Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995).",
        "Statistical machine translation has been applied to a smorgasbord of NLP problems, including question answering (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003), semantic parsing and generation (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Wong and Mooney, 2007), summarization (Daum√© III and Marcu, 2009), generating bid-phrases in online advertising (Ravi et al., 2010), spelling correction (Sun et al., 2010), paraphrase (Dolan et al., 2004; Quirk et al., 2004) and query expansion (Rie-zler et al., 2007).",
        "Most relevant to our efforts is the work by Soricut and Marcu (2006), who applied the IBM word alignment models to a discourse ordering task, exploiting the same intuition investigated in this paper: certain words (or phrases) tend to trigger the usage of other words in subsequent discourse units.",
        "As far as we are aware, ours is the first work to explore the use of phrase-based translation in generating responses to open-domain linguistic stimuli, although the analogy between translation and dialogue has been drawn (Leuski and Traum, 2010).",
        "For learning response-generation models, we use a corpus of roughly 1.3 million conversations scraped from Twitter (Ritter et al., 2010; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011).",
        "Twitter conversations don't occur in real-time as in IRC; rather as in email, users typically take turns responding to each other.",
        "Twitter's 140 character limit, however, keeps conversations chat-like.",
        "In addition, the Twitter API maintains a reference from each reply to the post it responds to, so unlike IRC, there is no need for conversation disentanglement (Elsner and Charniak, 2008; Wang and Oard, 2009).",
        "The first message of a conversation is typically unique, not directed at any particular user but instead broadcast to the author's followers (a status message).",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we limit the data set to only the first two utterances from each conversation.",
        "As a result of this constraint, any system trained with this data will be specialized for responding to Twitter status posts."

        "The results of the paired evaluations provide a clear ordering on the automatic systems: Ir-Status is outperformed by Ir-Response, which is in turn outperformed by Mt-Chat.",
        "These results are somewhat surprising.",
        "We had expected that matching status to status would create a more natural and effective IR system, but in practice, it appears that the additional level of indirection employed by Ir-Status created only more opportunity for confusion and error.",
        "Also, we did not necessarily expect Mt-Chat's output to be preferred by human annotators: the SMT system is the only one that generates a completely novel response, and is therefore the system most likely to make fluency errors.",
        "We had expected human annotators to pick up on these fluency errors, giving the the advantage to the IR systems.",
        "However, it appears that Mt-Chat's ability to tailor its response to the status on a fine-grained scale overcame the disadvantage of occasionally introducing fluency errors.",
        "Given Mt-Chat's success over the IR systems, we conducted further experiments to validate its output.",
        "In order to test how close Mt-Chat's responses come to human-level abilities, we compared its output to actual human responses from our dataset.",
        "In some cases the human responses change the topic of conversation, and completely ignore the initial status.",
        "For instance, one frequent type of response we noticed in the data was a greeting: \"How have you been?",
        "I haven't talked to you in a while.\"",
        "For the purposes of this evaluation, we manually filtered out cases where the human response was completely off-topic from the status, selecting 200 pairs at random that met our criteria and using the actual responses as the Human output.",
        "When compared to the actual human-generated response, Mt-Chat loses.",
        "However, its output is preferred over the human responses 15% ofthe time, a fact that is particularly surprising given the very small - by MT standards - amount of data used to train the model.",
        "A few examples where Mt-Chat's output were selected over the human response are listed in Table 5.",
        "We also evaluated the effect of filtering all possible phrase pairs using Fisher's Exact Test, which we did instead of conducting phrase extraction according to the very noisy word alignments.",
        "We altered our Mt-Chat system to use the standard Moses phrase-extraction pipeline, creating the system denoted as Mt-baseline.",
        "We compared this to the complete Mt-chat system.",
        "Note that both systems account for lexical repetition as described in ¬ß4.1.",
        "Mt-Chat's output is preferred 58% of the time over Mt-Baseline, indicating that direct phrase extraction is useful in this conversational setting.",
        "Finally, as an additional baseline, we compared Mt-Chat's output to random responses selected from those observed 2 or more times in the training data.",
        "One might argue that short, common responses are very general, and that a reply like \"lol\" could be considered a good response to almost any status.",
        "However, the human evaluation shows a clear preference for Mt-Chat's output: raters favour responses that are tailored to the stimulus.",
        "The field of SMT has benefited greatly from the existence of an automatic evaluation metric, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which grades an output candidate according to n-gram matches to one or more reference outputs.",
        "To evaluate whether BLEU is an appropriate automatic evaluation measure for response generation, we attempted to measure its agreement with the human judgments.",
        "We calculate BLEU using a single reference derived from our parallel corpus.",
        "We show the smoothed BLEU 1-4 scores for each system on each dataset evaluated in Table 4.",
        "Although these scores are extremely low, the overall BLEU scores agree with overall annotator judgments in all cases except when comparing Mt-Chat and Ir-Response.",
        "It would seem that BLEU has some agreement with human judgments on this task, but perhaps not enough to be immediately useful."

        "We have presented several data-driven approaches, based on information retrial and phrase-based SMT, to the task of automatically responding to opendomain linguistic stimuli.",
        "Our experiments show that SMT techniques are better-suited than IR approaches on the task of response generation.",
        "Our system, Mt-Chat, produced responses which were preferred by human annotators over actual human responses 15% of the time.",
        "Although this is still far from human-level performance, we believe there is much room for improvement: from designing appropriate word-alignment and decoding algorithms that account for the selective nature of response in dialogue, to simply adding more training data.",
        "We described the many challenges posed by adapting phrase-based SMT to dialogue, and presented initial solutions to several, including direct phrasal alignment, and phrase-table scores discouraging responses that are lexically similar to the status.",
        "Finally, we have provided results from an initial experiment to evaluate the BLEU metric when applied to response generation, showing that though the metric as is does not work well, there is sufficient correlation to suggest that a similar, dialogue-focused approach may be feasible.",
        "By generating responses to Tweets out of context, we have demonstrated that the models underlying phrase-based SMT are capable of guiding the construction of appropriate responses.",
        "In the future, we are excited about the role these models could potentially play in guiding response construction for conversationally-aware chat input schemes, as well as goal-directed dialogue systems."
