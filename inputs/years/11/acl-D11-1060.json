        "Noun compounds (NCs) such as malaria mosquito and colon cancer tumor suppressor protein are challenging for text processing since the relationship between the nouns they are composed of is implicit.",
        "NCs are abundant in English and understanding their semantics is important in many natural language processing (NLP) applications.",
        "For example, a question answering system might need to know whether protein acting as a tumor suppressor is a good paraphrase for tumor suppressor protein.",
        "Similarly, a machine translation system facing the unknown noun compound Geneva headquarters might translate it better if it could first paraphrase it as Geneva headquarters of the WTO.",
        "Given a query for \"migraine treatment\", an information retrieval system could use paraphrasing verbs like relieve and prevent for query expansion and result ranking.",
        "Most work on noun compound interpretation has focused on two-word NCs.",
        "There have been two general lines of research: the first one derives the NC semantics from the semantics of the nouns it is made of (Rosario and Hearst, 2002; Moldovan et al., 2004; Kim and Baldwin, 2005; Girju, 2007; Seaghdha, 2009; Tratz and Hovy, 2010), while the second one models the relationship between the nouns directly (Vanderwende, 1994; Lapata, 2002; Kim and Baldwin, 2006; Nakov and Hearst, 2006; Nakov and Hearst, 2008; Butnariu and Veale, 2008).",
        "In either case, the semantics of an NC is typically expressed by an abstract relation like Cause (e.g., malaria mosquito), Source (e.g., olive oil), or Purpose (e.g., migraine drug), coming from a small fixed inventory.",
        "Some researchers however, have argued for a more fine-grained, even infinite, inventory (Finin, 1980).",
        "Verbs are particularly useful in this respect and can capture elements of the semantics that the abstract relations cannot.",
        "For example, while most NCs expressing Make, can be paraphrased by common patterns like be made of and be composed of, some NCs allow more specific patterns, e.g., be squeezed from for orange juice, and be topped with for bacon pizza.",
        "Recently, the idea of using fine-grained paraphrasing verbs for NC semantics has been gaining popularity (Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov, 2008b); there has also been a related shared task at SemEval-2010 (Butnariu et al., 2010).",
        "This interest is partly driven by practicality: verbs are directly usable as paraphrases.",
        "Still, abstract relations remain dominant since they offer a more natural generalization, which is useful for many NLP applications.",
        "one good contribution to this debate would be a direct study of the relationship between fine-grained and coarse-grained relations for NC interpretation.",
        "Unfortunately, the existing datasets do not allow this since they are tied to one particular granularity; moreover, they only contain a few hundred NCs.",
        "Thus, our objective is to build a large-scale dataset of hundreds of thousands of NCs, each interpreted (1) by an abstract semantic relation and (2) by a set of paraphrasing verbs.",
        "Having such a large dataset would also help the overall advancement of the field.",
        "Since there is no universally accepted abstract relation inventory in NLP, and since we are interested in NC semantics from both a theoretical and a practical viewpoint, we chose the set of abstract relations proposed in the theory of Levi (1978), which is dominant in theoretical linguistics and has been also used in NLP (Nakov and Hearst, 2008).",
        "We use a two-step algorithm to jointly harvest NCs and patterns (verbs and prepositions) that interpret them for a given abstract relation.",
        "First, we extract NCs using a small number of seed patterns from a given abstract relation.",
        "Then, using the extracted NCs, we harvest more patterns.",
        "This is repeated until no new NCs and patterns can be extracted or for a pre-specified number of iterations.",
        "our approach combines pattern-based extraction and bootstrapping, which is novel for NC interpretation; however, such combinations have been used in other areas, e.g., named entity recognition (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Curran et al., 2007; Mcintosh and Curran, 2009).",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of related work, Section 3 motivates our semantic representation, Sections 4, 5, and 6 explain our method, dataset and experiments, respectively, Section 7 discusses the results, Section 8 provides error analysis, and Section 9 concludes with suggestions for future work."

        "As we mentioned above, the implicit relation between the two nouns forming a noun compound can often be expressed overtly using verbal and prepositional paraphrases.",
        "For example, student loan is \"loan given to a student\", while morning tea can be paraphrased as \"tea in the morning\".",
        "Thus, many NLP approaches to NC semantics have used verbs and prepositions as a fine-grained semantic representation or as features when predicting coarse-grained abstract relations.",
        "For example, Vanderwende (1994) associated verbs extracted from definitions in an online dictionary with abstract relations.",
        "Lauer (1995) expressed NC semantics using eight prepositions.",
        "Kim and Baldwin (2006) predicted abstract relations using verbs as features.",
        "Nakov and Hearst (2008) proposed a finegrained NC interpretation using a distribution over Web-derived verbs, prepositions and coordinating conjunctions; they also used this distribution to predict coarse-grained abstract relations.",
        "Butnariu and Veale (2008) adopted a similar fine-grained verb-centered approach to NC semantics.",
        "Using a distribution over verbs as a semantic interpretation was also carried out in a recent challenge: SemEval-2010 Task 9 (Butnariu et al., 2009; Butnariu et al., 2010).",
        "In noun compound interpretation, verbs and prepositions can be seen as patterns connecting the two nouns in a paraphrase.",
        "Similar pattern-based approaches have been popular in information extraction and ontology learning.",
        "For example, Hearst (1992) extracted hyponyms using patterns such as X, Y, and/or other Zs, where Z is a hypernym of X and Y. Berland and Charniak (1999) used similar patterns to extract meronymy (part-whole) relations, e.g., parts/NNS of/IN wholes/NNS matches basements ofbuildings.",
        "Unfortunately, matches are rare, which makes it difficult to build large semantic inventories.",
        "In order to overcome data sparseness, pattern-based approaches are often combined with bootstrapping.",
        "For example, Riloff and Jones (1999) used a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm to learn both a semantic lexicon and extraction patterns, e.g., owned by X extracts Company and facilities in X extracts Location.",
        "That is, they learned semantic lexicons using extraction patterns, and then, alternatively, they extracted new patterns using these lexicons.",
        "They also introduced a second level of bootstrapping to retain the most reliable examples only.",
        "While the method enables the extraction of large lexicons, its quality degrades rapidly, which makes it impossible to run for too many iterations.",
        "Recently, Curran et al.",
        "(2007) and Mcintosh and Curran (2009) proposed ways to control degradation using simultaneous learning and weighting.",
        "Bootstrapping has been applied to noun compound extraction as well.",
        "For example, Kim and Baldwin (2007) used it to produce a large number of semantically interpreted noun compounds from a small number of seeds.",
        "in each iteration, the method replaced one component of an NC with its synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms to generate a new NC.",
        "These new NCs were further filtered based on their semantic similarity with the original NC.",
        "While the method acquired a large number of noun compounds without significant semantic drifting, its accuracy degraded rapidly after each iteration.",
        "More importantly, the variation of the sense pairs was limited since new NCs had to be semantically similar to the original NCs.",
        "Recently, Kozareva and Hovy (2010) combined patterns and bootstrapping to learn the selectional restrictions for various semantic relations.",
        "They used patterns involving the coordinating conjunction and, e.g., \"* and John fly to *\", and learned arguments such as Mary/Tom and France/New York.",
        "Unlike in NC interpretation, it is not necessary for their arguments to form an NC, e.g., Mary France and France Mary are not NCs.",
        "Rather, they were interested in building a semantic ontology with a predefined set of semantic relations, similar to YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), where the pattern work for would have arguments like a company/UNICEF."

      "text": [
        "Inspired by (Finin, 1980), Nakov and Hearst (2006) and (Nakov, 2008b) proposed that NC semantics is best expressible using paraphrases involving verbs and/or prepositions.",
        "For example, bronze statue is a statue that is made of, is composed of, consists of, contains, is of, is, is handcrafted from, is dipped in, looks like bronze.",
        "They further proposed that selecting one such paraphrase is not enough and that multiple paraphrases are needed for a fine-grained representation.",
        "Finally, they observed that not all paraphrases are equally good (e.g., is made of is arguably better than looks like or is dipped in for Make), and thus proposed that the semantics of a noun compound should be expressed as a distribution over multiple possible paraphrases.",
        "This line of research was later adopted by SemEval-2010 Task 9 (Butnariu et al., 2010).",
        "It easily follows that the semantics of abstract relations such as Make that can hold between the nouns in an NC can be represented in the same way: as a distribution over paraphrasing verbs and prepositions.",
        "Note, however, that some NCs are para-phrasable by more specific verbs that do not necessarily support the target abstract relation.",
        "For example, malaria mosquito, which expresses Cause, can be paraphrased using verbs like carry, which do not imply direct causation.",
        "Thus, while we will be focusing on extracting NCs for a particular abstract relation, we are interested in building semantic representations that are specific for these NCs and do not necessarily apply to all instances of that relation.",
        "Traditionally, the semantics of a noun compound have been represented as an abstract relation drawn from a small closed set.",
        "Unfortunately, no such set is universally accepted, and mapping between sets has proven challenging (Girju et al., 2005).",
        "Moreover, being both abstract and limited, such sets capture only part of the semantics; often multiple meanings are possible, and sometimes none of the predefined ones suits a given example.",
        "Finally, it is unclear how useful these sets are since researchers have often fallen short of demonstrating practical uses.",
        "Arguably, verbs have more expressive power and are more suitable for semantic representation: there is an infinite number of them (Downing, 1977), and they can capture fine-grained aspects of the meaning.",
        "For example, while both wrinkle treatment and migraine treatment express the same abstract relation Treatment-For-Disease, fine-grained differences can be revealed using verbs, e.g., smooth can paraphrase the former, but not the latter.",
        "In many theories, verbs play an important role in NC derivation (Levi, 1978).",
        "Moreover, speakers often use verbs to make the hidden relation between the noun in a noun compound overt.",
        "This allows for simple extraction and for straightforward use in NLP tasks like textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005) and machine translation (Nakov, 2008a).",
        "Finally, a single verb is often not enough, and the meaning is better approximated by a collection of verbs.",
        "For example, while malaria mosquito expresses Cause (and is paraphrasable using cause), further aspects of the meaning can be captured with more verbs, e.g., carry, spread, be responsible for, be infected with, transmit, pass on, etc."

        "In this theory, noun compounds are derived from underlying relative clauses or noun phrase complement constructions by means of two general processes: predicate deletion and predicate nominalization.",
        "Given a two-argument predicate, predicate deletion removes that predicate, but retains its arguments to form an NC, e.g., pie made of apples – apple pie.",

        "According to Levi, predicate deletion can be applied to abstract predicates, whose semantics can be roughly approximated using five paraphrasing verbs (Cause, Have, Make, Use, and Be) and four prepositions (In, For, From, and About).",
        "Typically, in predicate deletion, the modifier is derived from the object of the underlying relative clause; however, the first three verbs also allow for it to be derived from the subject.",
        "Levi expresses the distinction using indexes.",
        "For example, music box is MakEi (object-derived), i.e., the box makes music, while chocolate bar is Make2 (subject-derived), i.e., the bar is made of chocolate (note the passive).",
        "Due to time constraints, we focused on one relation of Levi's, Make2, which is among the most frequent relations an NC can express and is present in some form in many relation inventories (Warren, 1978; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Rosario and Hearst, 2001; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju",
        "Hendrickx et al., 2010; Tratz and Hovy, 2010).",

        "(c) the head represents human collectives and the modifier specifies their membership, e.g., worker teams.",
        "There are 20 instances of M ake2 in the appendix of (Levi, 1978), and we use them all as seed NCs.",
        "As seed patterns, we use a subset of the human-proposed paraphrasing verbs and prepositions corresponding to these 20 NCs in the dataset in (Nakov, 2008b), where each NC is paraphrased by 25-30 annotators.",
        "For example, for chocolate bar, we find the following list of verbs (the number of annotators who proposed each verb is shown in parentheses):",
        "be made of (16), contain (16), be made from (10), be composed of (7), taste like (7), consist of (5), be (3), have (2), melt into (2), be manufactured from (2), be formed from (2), smell of (2), be flavored with (1), sell (1), taste of (1), be constituted by (1), incorporate (1), serve (1), contain (1), store (1), be made with (1), be solidified from (1), be created from (1), be flavoured with (1), be comprised of (1).",
        "Seed NCs: bronze statue, cable network, candy cigarette, chocolate bar, concrete desert, copper coin, daisy chain, glass eye, immigrant minority, mountain range, paper money, plastic toy, sand dune, steel helmet, stone tool, student committee, sugar cube, warrior castle, water drop, worker team Seed patterns: be composed of, be comprised of, be inhabited by, be lived in by, be made from, be made of, be made up of, be manufactured from, be printed on, consist of, contain, have, house, include, involve, look like, resemble, taste like",
        "As we can see, the most frequent patterns are of highest quality, e.g., be made of (16), while the less frequent ones can be wrong, e.g., serve (1).",

        "We further removed the verb be, which is too general, thus ending up with 18 seed patterns.",
        "Note that some patterns can paraphrase multiple NCs: the total number of seed NC-pattern pairs is 84.",
        "The seed NCs and patterns are shown in Table 1.",

        "The number of extracted patterns is similar for the different methods since we select no more than 20 of them per iteration.",
