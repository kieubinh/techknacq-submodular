        "So far, most research on Twitter has focused on its network structure, the social behavior of its users (Java et al., 2007; Krishnamurthy et al., 2008; Kwak et al., 2010), ranking tweets by relevance for web search (Ramage et al., 2010; Duan et al., 2010), and the analysis of time series for extracting trending news, events and facts (Zhao et al., 2007; Popescu and Pennacchiotti, 2010; Petrovic et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2010).",
        "Only few studies have specifically focused on the linguistic content analysis of tweets, e.g. (Davidov et al., 2010; Barbosa and Feng, 2010).",
        "To date, our paper most closely relates to works on semantic role labeling (SRL) on social media (Liu et al., 2010) and conversation modeling (Ritter et al., 2010).",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2010) present a self-learning SRL system for news tweets, with the goal of addressing low performance caused by the noise and the unstructured nature of the data.",
        "The authors first cluster together tweets that refer to the same news.",
        "Then, for each cluster, they identify the tweets that are well-formed (i.e. copy-pasted from news), and induce role mappings between well-formed and noisy tweets in the same cluster by performing word alignment.",
        "In our paper we are also interested in aligning and grouping tweets, although our goal is to detect redundancy, not to perform SRL.",
        "On a different ground, Ritter et al.",
        "(2010) propose a probabilistic model to discover dialogue acts in Twitter conversations and to classify tweets in a conversation according to those acts.",
        "(A conversation is defined as a set of tweets in the same reply thread.)",
        "The authors define 10 major dialogue acts for Twitter, including status, question, response and reaction, and automatically build a probabilistic transition graph for such acts.",
        "In our paper, we also aim at classifying tweets, but our interest is in information redundancy instead of acts.",
        "In the computational linguistic literature, redundancy detection is studied in multi-document summarization, where the overall document is used to select the most informative sentences or snippets (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",
        "Since tweets are short and tweet sets cannot be considered documents, these methods are hard to apply.",
        "A more convenient setting is paraphrase detection (Dolan et al., 2004) and textual entailment recognition (Dagan et al., 2006) (RTE).",
        "In RTE the task is to recognize if a text called the text T (typically one or two sentences long) entails another text called the hypothesis H. Many approaches have been proposed for this task, mostly based on machine learning.",
        "Three main classes of features have been so far explored in RTE: distance/similarity feature spaces (Corley and Mihal-cea, 2005; Newman et al., 2005; Haghighi et al., 2005; Hickl et al., 2006), entailment trigger feature spaces (de Marneffe et al., 2006; MacCartney et al., 2006), and pair content feature spaces (Zan-zotto et al., 2009).",
        "Distance/similarity feature spaces are more suitable to the paraphrase detection task because they model the similarity between the two texts.",
        "On the other hand, entailment trigger and content feature spaces model complex relations between the texts, taking into account first-order entailment rules, i.e. entailment rules with variables.",
        "In this paper, one of our goals is to explore RTE techniques and features that are usually used for classical texts, and check if they can be successfully adapted to the unstructured, and oftentimes ungrammatical, Twitter language."

        "In order to answer this question we performed an initial editorial study where human editors were asked to annotate pairs of tweets as being either redundant or nonredundant.",
        "The editorial study also serves as a test bed for evaluating our redundancy detection models, as discussed in Section 5.",
        "In the study we focus on 'informative' tweets, i.e. tweets that describe or comment on relevant events/facts.",

        "The rest are spam, status updates and other types of uninformative content.",
        "In order to retain only informative tweets we first extract buzzy snapshots (Popescu and Pennacchiotti, 2010).",
        "A snapshot is defined as a set of tweets that explicitly mention a specific topic within a specified time period.",
        "A buzzy snapshot is defined as a snapshot with a large number of tweets, compared to previous time periods.",
        "For example, given the topic 'Haiti earthquake', the snapshot composed by the tweets mentioning 'Haiti earthquake' on January 12th, 2010, will constitute a buzzy snapshot, since in previous days the topic was not mentioned often.",
        "We use two different topic lists: a celebrity list containing about 104K celebrity names, crawled from Wikipedia, including actors, musicians, politicians, and athletes; and an event list composed of 398 hashtags related to 8 major events that happened between January and July 2010, and listed in Wikipedia: the earthquake in Haiti, the winter Olympics, the earthquake in Chile, the death of the Polish president, the volcano eruption in Iceland, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Greek financial crisis, and the FIFA world cup.",
        "We extract buzzy snapshots for the above two topic lists by following the method described in (Popescu and Pennacchiotti, 2010): we consider time periods of one day, and call buzzy the snapshots that mention a given topic a times more than the average over the previous 2 days.",
        "We set a to 20 and 5 respectively for the celebrity list and the event list.",
        "We further exclude irrelevant and spam snapshots by removing those that have: fewer than 10 tweets; more than 50% of tweets non-English; and an average token overlap between tweets ofmore than 80%, usually corresponding to spam threads.",
        "The extraction is performed on a Twitter corpus containing all tweets posted between July 2009 and August 2010.",

        "Tweet-pairs that contain retweets are excluded.",
        "Dataset annotation.",

        "These parts were marked in the corpus.",
        "Focusing on these parts is in line with potential applications of tweet redundancy detection as tweets are firstly grouped around a topic.",
        "Note that pairs that fall under the entailment or paraphrase relation are redundant, while unrelated, related, and contradictory tweets are non-redundant.",
        "The annotation was performed in a three stage process, since tweets are sometimes hard to understand and hence to annotate (misspellings, usage of slang and abbreviations, lack of discourse context).",

        "In the second step, the annotations were checked by three highly trained experts with background in computational linguistics: each pair was independently checked by two experts.",

        "Given two tweets ii and t2, the goal is to classify the pair (t1,t2) as being either redundant or non-redundant.",
        "In this section we describe different models for redundancy detection, inspired by existing work in RTE.",
        "We adopt a machine learning approach where a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained on a manually annotated training set to classify incoming test examples as either redundant or non-redundant.",
        "An evaluation of the different models adopting for training and testing the dataset described in Section 3, is presented in Section 5.",
        "The bag-of-word model is the most simple approach for detecting redundancy.",
        "It is used as a baseline in our experiment.",
        "The simple intuition of the model is that if two tweets t1 and t2 have a high lexical overlap, then they are likely to express the same information - i.e. they are likely to be redundant.",
        "In this model, the SVM is trained using a single feature that computes the cosine similarity between the bag-of-word vectors of the two tweets.",
        "The bag-of-word vector is built using a classical tf*idf weighting schema over the set of tokens of the pair.",
        "This a very simple baseline as SVM is only learning thresholds using this single feature.",
        "The bag-of-word model is of course a naive approach, since in many cases redundant tweets can have very different lexical content (e.g. the following two tweets: \"Farrah Fawcett left out of Oscar memorial\", \"No Farrah Fawcett's memory at the Academy Awards\"), and non-redundant tweets can have similar lexical content (e.g. the tweets: \"Johnny Deep is dead\", \"Johnny Deep is not dead\").",
        "The second baseline model was first defined in (Cor-ley and Mihalcea, 2005) and since then has been used by many RTE systems.",
        "The model extends BOW by measuring similarity at the semantic level, instead of the lexical level.",
        "For example, consider the tweet pair: \"Oscars forgot Farrah Fawcett\", \"Farrah Fawcett snubbed at Academy Awards\".",
        "This pair is redundant, and, hence, should be assigned a very high similarity.",
        "Yet, BOW would assign a low score, since many words are not shared across the two tweets.",
        "wbow fixes this problem by matching 'Oscar'-'Academy Awards' and 'forgot'-'snubbed' at the semantic level.",
        "To provide these matches, wbow relies on specific word similarity measures over WordNet (Miller, 1995), that allow synonymy and hyper-onymy matches: in our experiments we specifically use Jiang&Conrath similarity (Jiang and Conrath, 1997).",
        "In practice, we implement wbow by using the text similarity measure defined in (Corley and Mi-halcea, 2005) as the single feature in the SVM classifier that, as in bow, learns the threshold on this single feature.",
        "This model and the next ones (SYNT and FOR) explicitly model the content of a tweet pair P = (t1, t2) as a whole.",
        "This is a radically different approach with respect to the similarity-based models explored so far, where the content of t1 and t2 were treated independently (i.e. each tweet with its own bag of words), and the SVM used as the single feature the similarity between the two tweets.",
        "In the lex model we represent the content of the tweet pair in a double bag-of-word vector space.",
        "Each pair P = (t1,t2) is represented by two bag-of-word vectors, (t1 ,t2).",
        "Within this space, we can then define a specific similarity measure between pairs using a kernel function in the SVM learning algorithm.",

        "This feature space models the relations between words syntactically.",
        "Therefore it overcomes the limitations of the lex feature space.",
        "But it also introduces a new limitation: the above feature is in fact also active for the tweet pair (\"GM bought OpeF^Opel owns GM').",
        "This pair is extremely different from the previous one, thus possibly misleading the classifier.",
        "This feature space is not represented explicitly, but it is encoded in a kernel function.",
        "Given two pairs of tweets P(a) and P(b), the synt kernel function is defined as follows:",
        "where cos(-, •) is the cosine similarity between the two vectors.",
        "The lex feature space is simple and can be extremely effective in modeling the content of tweet pairs.",
        "Yet, in principle, it doesn t model the relations among words in the tweet.",
        "Different content feature spaces are then needed to capture these relations.",
        "The SYNT model represents a tweet pair using pairs of syntactic tree fragments from t1 and t2.",
        "Each feature is a pair < fr1,fr2 >, where fr1and f r2 are syntactic tree fragments (see figure below).",
        "As defined in (Collins and Duffy, 2002), a syntactic tree fragment f ri is active in ti when fri is a subtree of the syntactic interpretation of ti.",
        "Therefore, these features represent ground rules connecting the left-hand sides and the right-hand sides of the tweet pair: each feature is active for a pair (t1, t2) when the left-hand side f r1 is activated by the syntactic analysis of t and the right-hand side fr2 is activated by t2.",
        "As an example consider the feature:",

        "The FOR model overcomes the limitations of SYNT, by enriching the space with features representing first-order relations between the two tweets of a pair.",

        "To determine the statistical significance of the difference in the performance of the systems we analyzed, we use the model described in (Yeh, 2000) as implemented in (Pado, 2006).",
        "We pre-process the dataset with the following tools: the Charniak Parser (Charniak, 2000) for parsing sentences, the WordNet similarity package (Pedersen et al., 2004) for computing wbow and for linking the two tweets in a pair, and SVM-light (Joachims, 1999), extended with the syntactic first-order rule kernels described in (Moschitti and Zanzotto, 2007) for creating the SYNT and the for feature spaces.",

        "At first glance, WordNet similarities are not useful: the performance of the WBOW model is indeed comparable and statistically insignificant with respect to the pure token based model BOW.",
        "This seems to be intuitive as the language of the tweets can be far from proper English, i.e. it may contain many out-of-dictionary words that are not present in WordNet, thus impairing the similarity measure used by WBOW.",
        "This trend is also confirmed in the case of content-based systems like lex and synt.",
        "Using bow or WBOW in combination with these features has the same effect on the final performance.",
        "Only the FOR features are positively affected by the WordNet-based distance.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that in the FOR+WBOW system, the WordNet similarity is also used to link words in the two tweets of a pair.",
        "This increases the possibility of finding reasonable and useful first-order rules.",

        "The two syntax based models SYNT and FOR outperform the lexical based models lex between 1 and 2 AROC points.",
        "This is surprising, since the Charniak parser used in the experiments has not been adapted to the Tweet language, and therefore could have produced many interpretation errors, thus impairing the use of syntax.",
        "This seems to suggest that if the interpretations of the part-of speech tags of the unknown words is correct, the syntax of tweets is reasonably similar to the syntax of the generic English language.",
        "The best performing model is FOR+WBOW: firstorder rules successfully emerge in tweets and are positively exploited by the learning system.",
        "In the next section we report examples that support this observation.",

        "The first column represents the editorial gold standard (gs) for the tweet pairs we considered: either redundant (R) or non-redundant (N).",

        "The table reports interesting examples where redundant pairs have very little lexical similarity while the non-redundant pairs have a high lexical similarity.",
        "These are all examples where bow and wbow should typically fail, while FOR+WBOW could capture important syntactic first-order rules to overcome the limitations of the pure similarity-based models.",
        "As a first example, both bow and wbow fail to assign a high rank (i.e. low rank number) to the redundant pair o165: in fact, 'died' does not lexically match 'rip , nor are these two words related in WordNet.",
        "In contrast, FOR+WBOW assigns a high rank to this pair, since it may be able to apply the rule <X died, rip X> that was most probably acquired from examples in the training set (the hoax of somebody s death is pervasive in Twitter, and it is therefore likely to fire the abovementioned rule in our dataset if enough examples are available).",
        "The third and the fourth pairs (o130 and o21) show some commonalities .",
        "According to the WordNet similarity measure we used, 'recognize and 'snub are highly related as well as 'forget and 'snub .",
        "Hence, the two tokens are linked as similar.",
        "For o130, the triggering syntactic rule is <(S (NP X) (VP Y),(VP (V Y) (NP X)> where X and Y are variables.",
        "For o21, the rule is: <(VP (V X) (NP Y),(VP (V X) (NP Y)>.",
        "For the non-redundant pairs (N) at the bottom of the table, the first-order rules are less intuitive.",
        "Yet, it is clear why these pairs have high lexical similarity (and therefore are ranked high by bow and wbow): The two tweets in the pair oe387 share 'volcanic , 'ash , and the hashtag '#ashtag .",
        "Tweets in oe64 share 'Icelandic' and 'eruption' but they are describing different facts.",
        "Tweets in the pair oe43 are similar since they are sharing the three hashtags '#bpoil , '#bp , and '#oilspill .",
        "This example shows that hashtags alone are not very indicative and useful for detecting redundancy in Twitter."
