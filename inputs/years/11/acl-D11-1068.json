        "In contrast we present the first models for discourse relations for Arabic, focusing on explicit connectives.",
        "This focus is partially justified by the fact that this first study for a new language should center on the superficially more straightforward case and that no annotations for implicit relations are yet available for Arabic.",
        "More importantly, however, we make two essential claims (Section 4).",
        "Firstly, Arabic discourse connectives are more ambiguous than their English counterparts, i.e cases such as while which can signal different relations dependent on context (see Example 1 and 2) are far more frequent.",

        "Secondly, discourse relations between adjacent sentences in Arabic tend to be expressed via an explicit connective, at least for the news genre, i.e. cases such as Example 3 are rarer.",

        "We tackle two tasks for explicit Arabic connectives in this paper, which are further discussed in Section 2.",

        "The handling of explicit connectives can be split into three tasks (Pitler and Nenkova, 2009).",
        "The first task of discourse connective recognition distinguishes between the discourse usage and non-discourse usage of potential connectives.",

        "Conjunctions such as j /w/and, j I /aw/or can have discourse usage or just conjoin two non-abstract entities as in OjL.",
        "j jf- /mr w sarh/Omar and Sarah.",
        "The second task is discourse connective interpretation where a discourse connective in context is assigned a discourse relation.",
        "Again, some connectives are largely unambiguous in this respect.",
        "For example, /lkn/but signals almost always a Con-T RA ST relation.",
        "However, there are connectives where this is not the case, such as jl« /mnd/since which has a Causal and a Temporal sense.",
        "The third task is argument identification which identifies the arguments' position and extent.",
