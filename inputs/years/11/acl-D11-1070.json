        "There are special document multi-labeling tasks where the target labels refer to a specific piece of information extractable from the document instead of the overall topic of the document.",
        "In these kinds of tasks the target information is usually an attribute or relation related to the target entity (usually a person or an organisation) of the document in question, but the task is to assign class labels at the document (entity) level.",
        "For example, the smoking habits of the patients are frequently discussed in the textual parts of clinical notes (Uzuner et al., 2008).",
        "In this case the task is to find specific information in the text - i.e. the patient in question is a smoker, past smoker, non-smoker - but at the end an application has to assign labels to the documents(patients).",
        "Similarly, the soccer club names where a sportsman played for are document(sportman)-level labels in Wikipedia articles expressed by the Wikipedia categories.",
        "The target information in these tasks is usually just mentioned in the document and much of the document is irrelevant for this information request in contrast to standard document classification tasks where the goal is to identify the topics of the whole document.",
        "On the other hand, they are not a standard information extraction task as the task is to assign class labels to documents, and the training dataset contains labels just at this level.",
        "These special tasks lie somewhere between information extraction and document classification and require special approaches to solve them.",
        "We will call them Information-oriented document labeling throughout this paper.",
        "There are several application areas where information-oriented document labels are naturally present in an enormous amount like clinical records, Wikipedia categories and usergenerated tags of news.",
        "Previous evaluation campaigns (Uzuner et al., 2008; Pestian et al., 2007; Uzuner, 2009) demonstrated that information-oriented document labeling can be effectively performed by looking up indicator phrases which can be gathered by hand, by corpus statistics or in a hybrid way.",
        "However these campaigns also highlighted that the analysis of the local context of the indicator phrases is crucial.",
        "For instance, in the smoking habit detection task there are a few indicator words (e.g. smokes, cigarette) and the local context of their occurrences in texts should be analysed to see whether their semantic was radically changed (e.g. they are negated or in a past tense), for instance:",
        "The patient has a 20 pack-year smoking history.",
        "The patient denies any smoking history.",
        "He has a greater than 100 pack year smoking history and quit 9 to 10 years ago.",
        "We propose a simple but efficient approach for information-oriented document labeling tasks by addressing the automatic detection of language phenomena for a particular task which alters the sense or information content of the indicator phrase's occurrences.",
        "For example, they may be logical modifiers (e.g. negation) or modal modifiers (e.g. auxiliaries like might and can); they may refer to a subject which differs from the target entity of the task (e.g. clinical notes usually contain information about the family history of the patient); or the semantic content of the shifter may change the role of the target span of a text (e.g. a sportsman can play for or against a particular team).",
        "We call these phenomena content shifters and the task of identifying them content shift detection (CSD).",
        "Existing CSD approaches focus on a particular class of language phenomena (especially negation or hedging) and use hand-crafted rules (Chapman et al., 2007) or a supervised learning approach that exploits corpora manually annotated at the token-level for a particular type of content shifter (Morante et al., 2009).",
        "Moreover higher level applications (like document labeling and information extraction) use a separate CSD module which is developed independently from the target task.",
        "We argue that the nature of content shifters is domain and task dependent, so training corpora (at the token-level) are required for content shifters which are important for a particular task but the construction of such training corpora is expensive.",
        "Here, we propose an alternative approach which uses only document-level labels.",
        "The input of our system is a training corpus labeled on the document level (e.g. a clinical dataset consisting clinical notes and meta-data about patients).",
        "Our approach extracts indicator phrases and trains a CSD jointly.",
        "We focus on local content shifters and we analyse just the sentences of indicator phrase occurrences.",
        "Our chief assumption is that CSD can be learnt by exploiting the false positive occurrences of indicator phrases in the training dataset.",
        "We show that our method performs significantly better than standard document classifiers (which were designed for a slightly different task).",
        "The chief contributions of our work are that (i) we handle the CSD problem in general, so we detect all content shifters instead of focusing on one particular language phenomenon, (ii) we form a single framework for joint CSD and document labeling, (iii) moreover our approach does not require a dedicated annotated training dataset for content shifters."

        "Exploiting these corpora, machine learning models were also developed.",

        "The participants usually followed a supervised sequence labeling approach or used a rule-based system that exploits syntactic patterns.",
        "The approach of classifying identified events into whether they fall under negation or speculation was followed by Sauri and Pustejovsky (2009) and the participants of the BioNLP'09 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2009).",

        "Bergler, 2009; Aramaki et al., 2009).",
        "Our approach differs from the previous works fundamentally.",
        "We deal with the two tasks (information-oriented document classification and content shift detection) together and introduce a co-learning approach for them.",
        "Our approach handles content shifters in a data-driven and generalized way i.e. it is not specialized for a certain class of language phenomena.",
        "Instead it tries to recognize task-specific syntactic and semantic patterns which are responsible for semantic changes or irrelevance.",

        "The effect ofthese two preprocessing steps varied among datasets.",
        "It improved the F-score of the MaxEnt baseline document classifier by 20%, 2% and 3% on the Obesity, CMC and Soccer datasets, respectively (the F-measures of Table 4 are the values we got by employing pre-processing).",

        "In this paper, we dealt with information-oriented document labeling tasks and investigated machine learning approaches for local content shift detectors from document-level labels.",
        "We demonstrated experimentally that a significant amount of false positive matches of indicator phrases can be recognized by trained content shift detectors.",
        "Our trained CSD does not use any task or domain specific knowledge and exploits the false and true positive matches ofin-dicator phrases, i.e. it uses only document-level annotation.",
        "This task-independent approach achieved competitive results with CSDs which were manually fine-tuned for particular datasets.",
        "The empirical results also support the idea of generalized local CSD (false positive removal) opposite to developing independent CSD for particular language phenomena (like negation and speculation).",
        "A co-learning framework for training local content shift detectors and indicator selection was introduced as well.",
        "Our method integrates document classification and CSD learning, which are traditionally used as independent submodules of applications.",
        "Experiments on three information-oriented document-labeling datasets - from two application areas - with simple indicator selection and syntactic parse-based content shifter learning were performed and the results show a clear improvement over the bag-of-word-based document classification baseline approaches.",
        "However, the proposed content shift detector learning approach is tailored for information-oriented document labeling tasks, i.e. it performs well when not too many and reliable indicator phrases are present.",
        "In the future, we plan to investigate and extend the framework for the general document classification task where many indicators with complex relationships among them determine the labels of a document but local content shifters can play an important role."
