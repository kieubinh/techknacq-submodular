        "Many natural language processing tasks can be formalized as a ranking problem, namely to rank a collection of candidate \"objects\" with respect to a \"query\".",
        "For example, intensive studies were devoted to parsing in which multiple possible parsing trees or forests are ranked with respect to a sentence (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008), machine translation in which multiple translation hypotheses are ranked with respect to a source sentence (Och, 2002; Shen et al., 2005), anaphora resolution in which multiple antecedents are ranked with respect to an anaphora (Yang et al., 2008), and question answering in which multiple possible answers are ranked with respect to a question (Ravichandran et al., 2003).",
        "Previous studies mainly focused on improving the ranking performance using one standalone learning algorithm on isolated queries.",
        "Although a wide range of learning algorithms (un-supervised, supervised or semi-supervised) is available, each with its strengths and weaknesses, there",
        "is not a learning algorithm that can work best on all types of data.",
        "In such a situation, it would be desirable to build a \"collaborative\" model by integrating multiple models.",
        "Such an idea forms the basis of ensemble methodology and it is well-known that ensemble methods (e.g., bagging, boosting) can improve the performance of many problems, in which classification is the most intensively studied (Rokach, 2009).",
        "The other situation is related with isolated queries handled by learning algorithms.",
        "The single query may not be formulated with the best terms or the query itself may not contain comprehensive information required for a highperformance ranking algorithm.",
        "Therefore, techniques of query expansion or query reformulation can be introduced and previous research has shown the effectiveness of those techniques in such applications as information retrieval and question answering (Manning et al., 2008; Riezler et al., 2007).",
        "Nevertheless, previous research normally considers query reformulation as a new query for the ranking system, it would be more desirable to form a larger-scale \"collaborative\" group for the query and make a unified decision based on the group.",
        "Inspired from human collaborative learning in which two or more people form a group and accomplish work together, we propose a new ranking scheme, collaborative ranking, which aims to imitate human collaborative learning and enhance system ranking performance.",
        "The main idea is to seek collaborations for each query from two levels:",
        "(1) query-level: search a group of query collaborators, and make the joint decision from the group together with the query using a standalone ranking algorithm.",
        "(2) ranker-level: design a group of multiple rankers, and make the joint decision from the entire group on a single query.",
        "candidate object query collaboration group (a) non-collaborative ranking (b) micro collaborative ranking (c) macro collaborative ranking (d) micro-macro collaborative ranking",
        "Figure 1 presents an intuitive illustration of four ranking approaches, including the traditional non-collaborative ranking and three collaborative ranking forms: micro collaborative ranking (MiCR), macro collaborative ranking (MaCR), and micromacro collaborative ranking (MiMaCR).",
        "Compared with the traditional non-collaborative ranking that only leverages the information contained in a single query and only applies one ranking function (Figure 1 (a)), the three collaborative ranking approaches have the following advantages:",
        "(1) MiCR (corresponding to query-level collaboration) leverages the information contained in the collaborators of a query.",
        "Figure 1 (b) demonstrates that 6 query collaborators together with the query form a query collaboration group.",
        "(2) MaCR (corresponding to ranker-level collaboration) integrates the strengths from two or more rankers.",
        "Figure 1 (c) demonstrates an example of 3 rankers.",
        "(3) MiMaCR combines the advantages from MiCR and MaCR as shown in Figure 1 (d).",
        "In this paper, we will show the efficacy of collaborative ranking on the entity linking task defined in the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track (Ji et al., 2010) at Text Analysis Conference (TAC).",
        "Each query in the task is associated with a name string and its context document.",
        "Traditional approaches for entity linking only made use of the lexical or document level information contained in the query, however, it may not be sufficient for the task.",
        "The intuition why query-level collaboration may work is that it leverages more comprehensive information about the entity mention from multiple \"collaborators\" (related documents containing the name string).",
        "Furthermore, previous work on this task mainly focused on comparing one ranking algorithm with the others, however, each ranking algorithm has its own strengths, and therefore, ranker-level collaboration can potentially improve the performance.",
        "Last, the combination of query-level and ranker-level collaboration can lead to further performance gains."
