        "Pattern based relation acquisition methods rely on lexico-syntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992) for extracting relation instances.",

        "Pattern based methods (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006b; Pa§ca et al., 2006; De Saeger et al., 2009) learn many",
        "* This work was done when all authors were at the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology.",
        "such patterns to extract new instances (word pairs) from the corpus.",
        "However, since extraction patterns are learned using statistical methods that require a certain frequency of observations, pattern based methods fail to capture relations from complex expressions in which the pattern connecting the two words is rarely observed.",
        "Consider the following sentence:",
        "\"Curing hypertension alleviates the deterioration speed of the renal function, thereby lowering the risk of causing intracranial bleeding\"",
        "Humans can infer that this sentence expresses a causal relation between the underlined noun phrases.",
        "But the actual pattern connecting them, i.e., \"Curing X alleviates the deterioration speed of the renal function, thereby lowering the risk ofcausing Y\", is rarely observed more than once even in a 10page Web corpus.",
        "In the sense that the term pattern implies a recurring event, this expression contains no pattern for detecting the causal relation between hypertension and intracranial bleeding.",
        "This is what we mean by \"long tail instances\" – words that co-occur infrequently, and only in sparse extraction contexts.",
        "Yet an important application of relation extraction is mining the Web for so-called unknown unknowns – in the words of D. Rumsfeld, \"things we don't know we don't know\" (Torisawa et al., 2010).",
        "In knowledge discovery applications like risk management and innovation, the usefulness of relation extraction lies in its ability to find many unexpected remedies for diseases, causes of social problems, and so on.",
        "To give an example, our relation extraction system found a blog post mentioning Japanese automaker Toyota as a hidden cause of Japan's deflation.",
        "Several months later the same connection was made in an article published in an authoritative economic magazine.",
        "We propose a semi-supervised relation extraction method that does not rely on direct pattern evidence connecting the two words in a sentence.",
        "We argue that the role of binary patterns can be replaced by a combination of two types of indirect evidence: semantic class information about the target relation and partial patterns, which are fragments or sub-patterns of binary patterns.",
        "The intuition is this: if a sentence like the example sentence above contains some word X belonging to the class of medical conditions and another word Y from the class of traumas, and X matches the partial pattern \"... causing X\", there is a decent chance that this sentence expresses a causal relation between X and Y.",
        "We show that just using this combination of indirect evidence we can pick up semantic relations with roughly 50% precision, regardless of the complexity or frequency of the expression in which the words co-occur.",
        "Furthermore, by combining this idea with a straightforward machine learning approach, the overall performance of our method is on par with state-of-the-art pattern based methods.",
        "However, our method manages to extract a large number of instances from sentences that contain no pattern that can be learned by pattern induction methods.",
        "Our method is a two-stage system.",
        "Figure 1 presents an overview.",
        "In Stage 1 we apply a state-of-the-art pattern based relation extractor to a Web corpus to obtain an initial batch of relation instances.",
        "In Stage 2 a supervised classifier is built from various components obtained from the output of Stage 1.",
        "Given the output of Stage 1 and access to a Web corpus, the Stage 2 extractor is completely self-sufficient, and the whole method requires no supervision other than a handful of seed patterns to start the first stage extractor.",
        "The whole procedure is therefore minimally supervised.",
        "Semantic word classes and partial patterns play a crucial role throughout all steps of the process.",
        "We evaluate our method on three relation acquisition tasks (causation, prevention and material relations) using a 600 million Japanese Web page corpus (Shinzato et al., 2008) and show that our system can successfully acquire relations from both frequent and infrequent patterns.",
        "Our system extracted 100,000 causal relations with 84.6% precision, 50,000 prevention relations with 58.4% precision and 25,000 material relations with 76.1% precision.",
        "In the extreme case, we acquired several thousand word pairs co-occurring only in patterns that appear once in the entire corpus.",
        "We call such patterns single occurrence (SO) patterns.",
        "Word pairs that co-occur only with SO patterns represent the theoretical limiting case of relations that cannot be acquired using existing pattern based methods.",

        "This list becomes the input to Stage 2 of our method, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "We adopted CDP as Stage 1 extractor because, besides having generally good performance, the class dependent patterns provide the two fundamental ingredients for Stage 2 of our method – the target semantic word classes for a given relation (in the form of the semantic class restrictions attached to patterns), and partial patterns.",
        "To obtain fine-grained semantic word classes we used the large scale word clustering algorithm from (Kazama and Torisawa, 2008), which uses the EM algorithm to compute the probability that a word w belongs to class c, i.e., P(c|w).",
        "Probabilistic clustering defines no discrete boundary between members and non-members of a semantic class, so we simply assume w belongs to c whenever P(c|w) > 0.2.",
        "For this work we clustered 10 nouns into 500 classes.",
        "Finally, we adopt the structural representation of patterns introduced in (Lin and Pantel, 2001).",

        "So at least in theory, pattern based methods might be able to acquire all noun pairs obtained by our method by lowering this threshold.",

        "In other words, the main contribution of semantic word classes and partial patterns to our method's performance lies not in the final classification step but seems to occur at earlier stages of the process, in the candidate and training data generation steps."
