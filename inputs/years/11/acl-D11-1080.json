        "For unseen n-grams, one would like to model adjectives as being likely to precede nouns in English, for example.",

        "where, n is the order of the language model, and wjrefers to the subsequence of words (or tags) from positions i to j.",
        "Word language models can be built directly from large text corpora, such as LDC's Gigaword corpus, but POS models require texts that are annotated with POS tags.",
        "Ideally, one would use manually annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), but since those tend to be small, most approaches rely on larger corpora which have been automatically annotated by a POS tagger or a parser (Koehn et al., 2008).",
        "Though automated annotation inevitably contains errors, it is assumed that this is ameliorated by the increased size of annotated data.",
        "The event space of a language models is of size \\V\\n, where V is the vocabulary, and n is the order of the language model.",
        "The vocabulary of POS models, (typically ranging between 40 and 100 tags), is much smaller than the vocabulary of a word model, which can easily approach a million words.",
        "Nevertheless, most POS language modeling approaches apply some form of smoothing to account for unseen events (Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2007).",
        "To deploy POS language models in machine translation, translation candidates need to be annotated with POS tags.",
        "Each target phrase ë in a phrase pair (/, ë) can be associated with a number of POS tag sequences Heeman (1998) shows that using the joint probability leads to improved perplexity for POS models.",
        "For machine translation one can sum over all possible tag sequences, as in Equation 4.",
        "Summing over all possible tag sequences has the disadvantage that it requires one to keep this information during decoding.",
        "Below, we opt for an approximate solution, where each target phrase is annotated with the most likely POS tag sequence given the source and target phrase: ëe = arg maxjp(ë\\ë, /).",
        "Reported results on the effectiveness of POS language models for machine translation are mixed, in particular when translating into languages that are not morphologically rich, such as English.",
        "While they rarely seem to hurt translation quality, there does not seem to be a clear consensus that they significantly improve quality either.",
        "Koehn and Hoang (2007) have reported an increase of 0.86 BLEU points for German-to-English translation for small training data.",
        "After relaxing phrase-matching to include lemma and morphological information on the source side, POS language models lead to a decrease of -0.42 BLEU points.",

        "The impact of POS language models depends among other things on the size of the parallel corpus, the size and order of the word language model, and whether lexicalized distortion models are used.",
        "To gauge the potential effectiveness of POS language models without taking into consideration all these factors, we isolate the contribution of the language model by simulating machine translation output using English data only (Al-Onaizan and Pap-ineni, 2006; Post and Gildea, 2008).",
        "Taking a set of POS-tagged reference translations of the MT04 Arabic-to-English test set, each English sentence is randomly chunked into n-grams of average length three.",
        "The chunks of each sentence, with their corresponding POS tags, are randomly reordered.",
        "This is repeated 500 times for each sentence in the test set.",
        "The smoothed sentence BLEU score (ignoring brevity penalty) is computed for each reordered sentence with respect to all reference translations.",
        "The higher the BLEU score, the more well-formed the reordering is.",
        "As each reordered sentence only contains words from at least one of the reference translations, the uni-gram precision is always 1.0.",
        "The language model probability is then computed for each reordering.",
        "Table 1 shows the average correlations between language model probabilities and BLEU scores.",
        "We can see that the surface language model correlates moderately well with BLEU, explaining about 49% (r = 0.49) of the variation, whereas the POS language model does not correlate with BLEU at all.",
        "On the other hand, local language models alone (as introduced in Section 3) correlate with BLEU only slightly worse than surface models.",
        "The highest correlation is seen when they are interpolated with word models.",
        "The BLEU scores in Table 1 are computed using the 1-best sentences after re-ranking.",
        "These system-agnostic correlation results look promising for our local models and the end-to-end translation results in Section 5 confirm these initial findings."

        "The main goal of this paper is to show that by tying POS language models to lexical items, we get more accurate distributions for specific words.",

        "Factored language models use more general representations, such as POS tags or stems, only during back-off.",
        "Kirchhoff and Yang (2005) applied factored language models to machine translation but the improvements were negligible.",
        "Collins et al.",
        "(2005) proposed a discriminative language modeling approach that uses mixtures of POS and surface information and showed that it leads to a reduction in speech recognition word error rates.",
        "On the other hand, their approach seems more suited for n-best list re-ranking and it is not clear whether those improvements carry over to machine translation.",

      "text": [
        "Though POS language models do not lead to significant improvements over a competitive baseline, we have shown that a competitive phrase-based baseline system can benefit from using POS information by building lexically anchored local models.",
        "Our local model approach does not only lead to more context-specific probability distributions, but also takes advantage of the language model probability of each word being based on all surrounding local models.",
        "The evaluations for Arabic-and Chinese-to-English show that local models lead to statistically significant improvements across different test sets and genres.",
        "Correlating the translation quality of the baseline with the improvements that result from adding local models, further suggests that these improvements are sustainable and should carry over to improved baseline systems.",
