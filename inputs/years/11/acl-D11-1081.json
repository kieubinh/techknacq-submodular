        "Discriminative model (Och and Ney, 2002) can easily incorporate non-independent and overlapping features, and has been dominating the research field of statistical machine translation (SMT) in the last decade.",
        "Recent work have shown that SMT benefits a lot from exploiting large amount of features (Liang et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007; Blunsom et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2009).",
        "However, the training of the large number of features was always restricted in fairly small data sets.",
        "Some systems limit the number of training examples, while others use short sentences to maintain efficiency.",
        "Overfitting problem often comes when training many features on a small data (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2009).",
        "Obviously, using much more data can alleviate such problem.",
        "Furthermore, large data also enables us to globally train millions of sparse lexical features which offer accurate clues for SMT.",
        "Despite these advantages, to the best of our knowledge, no previous discriminative training paradigms scale up to use a large amount of training data.",
        "The main obstacle comes from the complexity of packed forests or n-best lists generation which requires to search through all possible translations of each training example, which is computationally prohibitive in practice for SMT.",
        "To make normalization efficient, contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Poon et al., 2009) introduce neighborhood for unsupervised log-linear model, and has presented positive results in various tasks.",
        "Motivated by these work, we use a translation forest (Section 3) which contains both \"reference\" derivations that potentially yield the reference translation and also neighboring \"non-reference\" derivations that fail to produce the reference translation.However, the complexity of generating this translation forest is up to O(n), because we still need bi-parsing to create the reference derivations.",
        "Consequently, we propose a method to fast generate a subset of the forest.",
        "The key idea (Section 4) is to initialize a reference derivation tree with maximum score by the help of word alignment, and then traverse the tree to generate the subset forest in linear time.",
