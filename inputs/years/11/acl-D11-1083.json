        "The input sequence is often a sentence for NLP applications.",

        "For example, in HMT the Language Model (LM) is a non-local fundamental feature that approximates the adequacy of the translation with the sum of log-probabilities of composing n-grams.",
        "CKY-like BD approaches build candidate trees in a bottom-up fashion, allowing the use of Dynamic Programming techniques to simplify the search space by mering sub-trees with the same state, and also easing application of pruning techniques (such as Cube Pruning, e.g. Chiang (2007), Gesmundo (2010)).",
        "For clarity of presentation and following HMT practice, we will henceforth restrict our focus to binary grammars.",
        "Standard CKY works by building objects known as items (Hopkins and Langmead, 2009).",

        "The postcondition is a string that represents r's head nonterminal label, telling us which rules may be applied.",
        "The carry, k, stores extra information required to correctly score the non-local interactions of the item when it will be linked in a broader context (for HMT with LM the carry consists of boundary words that will form new n-grams).",
        "Items, i = (i1 > r < i2), are scored according to the following formula:",
        "Where: cost(r) is the cost associated to the weighted rule r; cost(i1 ) and cost(i2) are the costs of the two sub-items computed recursively using formula (3); interaction(r, k1; k2) is the interaction cost between the rule instantiation and the two sub-items.",
        "In HMT the interaction cost includes the LM score of new n-grams generated by connecting the childrens' subspans with terminals of r. Notice that formula (3) is equal to formula (2) for items that cover the whole input sequence.",
        "In many TSP applications, the search space is too large to allow an exhaustive search and therefore pruning techniques must be used.",

        "Therefore the item score computed in a bottom-up fashion is an approximation of the score the item has in a broader context.",
        "For example, in HMT the LM score for n-grams that partially overlap the item's span cannot be computed exactly since the surrounding words are not known.",

        "It is possible to reduce search errors using heuristics based on future cost estimation.",

        "The items are created and scored in topological order.",
        "The ordering constraint can be formally stated as: an item covering the span must be processed after items covering sub spans [h,k]\\h > i,k < j.",
        "This ordering constraint implies that full yield information is available when an item is processed, but information about ancestors and siblings is missing.",
        "Therefore non-bottom-up context cannot be used because of the ordering constraint.",
        "Now let us investigate how the decoding algorithm could change if we remove the ordering constraint.",
        "Removing the ordering constraint would lead to the occurrence of cases in which an item is processed before all child items have been processed.",
        "For example, we could imagine to create and score an item, i, with postcondition X and span [i, j], linking the rule instantiation r : X – AB with only the left sub-item, ia, while information for the right sub-item, iB is still missing.",
        "In this case, we can rely on local and partial contextual features to score i.",
        "Afterwards, it is possible to process iB using the parent item, i, as a source of additional information about the parent context and sibling ia yield.",
        "This approach can avoid search errors in cases where pruning at the parent level can be correctly done using only local and partial yield context, while pruning at the child level needs extra non-bottom-up context to make a better pruning decision.",
        "For example, consider the translation of the English sentence \"Irun\" into French using the following synchronous grammar:",
        "Where: r1 is a Glue rule and boxed indexes describe the alignment; r2 translates \"I\" in the corresponding French pronoun; r3 translates \"run\" as a noun; remaining rules translate \"run\" as one of the possible conjugations of the verb \"courir\".",

In our current method, only the best possible parent context is used because it only provides context for ranking candidates, as discussed at the end of this section.",

        "We can notice that for short sentences UD is faster, while for longer sentences UD becomes slower.",
        "To understand this result consider that for simple sentences UD can rely on the advantage of exploring a smaller search space.",
        "While, for longer sentences, the amount of candidates considered during decoding grows exponentially with the size of the sentence, and UD needs to maintain an unique queue whose size is not bounded by the beam size k, as for the queues used in BD's Cube Pruning.",
        "It may be possible to address this issue with more efficient handling of the queue.",
        "In conclusion we can assert that, even if exploring a smaller portion of the search space, UD finds often a translation that is better than the one found with standard BD.",
        "UD's higher accuracy is due to its sophisticated search strategy that allows a more efficient integration of contextual features.",
        "This set of experiments show the validity of the UD approach and empirically confirm our intuition about the BD's inadequacy in solving tasks that rely on fundamental contextual features."
