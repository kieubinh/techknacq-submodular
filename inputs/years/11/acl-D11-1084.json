        "Since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size.",
        "In this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side.",

        "However, there is still a huge performance gap between the state-of-the-art SMT systems and human translators.",
        "Bond (2002) suggested nine ways to improve machine translation by imitating the best practices of human translators (Nida, 1964), with parsing the entire document before translation as the first priority.",
        "However, most SMT systems still treat parallel corpora as a list of independent sentence-pairs and ignore document-level information.",
        "Document-level information can and should be used to help document-level machine translation.",
        "At least, the topic of a document can help choose specific translation candidates, since when taken out of the context from their document, some words, phrases and even sentences may be rather ambiguous and thus difficult to understand.",
        "Another advantage of document-level machine translation is its ability in keeping a consistent translation.",
        "However, document-level translation has drawn little attention from the SMT research community.",
        "The reasons are manifold.",
        "First of all, most of parallel corpora lack the annotation of document boundaries (Tam, 2007).",
        "Secondly, although it is easy to incorporate a new feature into the classical log-linear model (Och, 2003), it is difficult to capture document-level information and model it via some simple features.",
        "Thirdly, reference translations of a test document written by human translators tend to have flexible expressions in order to avoid producing monotonous texts.",
        "This makes the evaluation of document-level SMT systems extremely difficult.",
        "Tiedemann (2010) showed that the repetition and consistency are very important when modeling natural language and translation.",
        "He proposed to employ cache-based language and translation models in a phrase-based SMT system for domain adaptation.",
        "Especially, the cache in the translation model dynamically grows up by adding bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences.",
        "One problem with the dynamic cache is that those initial sentences in a test document may not benefit from the dynamic cache.",
        "Another problem is that the dynamic cache may be prone to noise and cause error propagation.",
        "This explains why the dynamic cache fails to much improve the performance.",
        "This paper proposes a cache-based approach for document-level SMT using a static cache and a dynamic cache.",
        "While such a approach applies to both phrase-based and syntax-based SMT, this paper focuses on phrase-based SMT.",
        "In particular, the static cache is employed to store relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their target counterparts) in the training parallel corpus while the dynamic cache is employed to store bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document.",
        "In this way, our cache-based approach can provide useful data at the beginning of the translation process via the static cache.",
        "As the translation process continues, the dynamic cache grows and contributes more and more to the translation of subsequent sentences.",
        "Our motivation to employ similar bilingual document pairs in the training parallel corpus is simple: a human translator often collects similar bilingual document pairs to help translation.",
        "If there are translation pairs of sentences/phrases/words in similar bilingual document pairs, this makes the translation much easier.",
        "Given a test document, our approach imitates this procedure by first retrieving similar bilingual document pairs from the training parallel corpus, which has often been applied in IR-based adaptation of SMT systems (Zhao et al.2004; Hildebrand et al.2005; Lu et al.2007) and then extracting bilingual phrase pairs from similar bilingual document pairs to store them in a static cache.",
        "However, such a cache-based approach may introduce many noisy/unnecessary bilingual phrase pairs in both the static and dynamic caches.",
        "In order to resolve this problem, this paper employs a topic model to weaken those noisy/unnecessary bilingual phrase pairs by recommending the decoder to choose most likely phrase pairs according to the topic words extracted from the target-side text of similar bilingual document pairs.",
        "Just like a human translator, even with a big bilingual dictionary, is often confused when he meets a source phrase which corresponds to several possible translations.",
        "In this case, some topic words can help reduce the perplexity.",
        "In this paper, the topic words are stored in a topic cache.",
        "In some sense, it has the similar effect of employing an adaptive language model with the advantage of avoiding the interpolation of a global language model with a specific domain language model.",

        "We investigate why the static cache affects the performance.",
        "Basically, it is difficult for the dynamic cache to capture such similar information in the static cache.",
        "In principle, the static cache can both influence the initial and subsequent sentences; however subsequent ones can be affected by multiple caches.",
        "In order to give an insight of the static cache, we evaluate its effectiveness on the first sentence for each test document.",
        "Figure 6 shows the contribution of the static cache on translating these first sentences (y-axis shows BLEU value of the first sentence for each test document).",
        "It notes that the most BLEU scores of them are zeros because of the length limitation of first sentences.",
        "Figure 6: Contribution of the static cache on the first sentence of each test document (i.e. with empty dynamic cache)",
        "Furthermore, we count the hit (matching) frequency of the static cache for each test documents.",
        "Since we use 1 or 0 for the static cache feature, it is easy to retrieve its effect for each test document.",
        "Our statistics shows that the hit frequency on static cache fluctuates between 5 and 18 for each test document.",
        "Without the static cache, the hit frequency of the dynamic cache is 504 on whole test sets, this figure increases to 685 with the static cache.",
        "This means that the static cache significantly enlarges the effectiveness of the dynamic cache by including more relevant phrase pairs to the dynamic cache, largely due to the positive impact of the static cache on the initial sentences of each test document.",
        "Size of topic cache",
        "Table 5 shows the impact of the topic cache when the number of the retained topic words for each topic increases from 500 to 2000.",
        "It shows that too more topic words actually harm the performance, due to the increase of noise.",
        "1000 topic words seem a lot largely due to that we didn't do stemming for our topic modeling since we hope to introduce some tense information of them in the future.",
        "Influenced translations",
        "In order to explore how our cache-based system impacts on translation results, we manually inspected 5 documents respectively which is improved or degraded in translation quality compared to the baseline Moses output.",
        "Those documents have 107 sentences in sum.",
        "The good effectiveness of each kind of cache can be observed by the example 1 and 2 showed in Table 6.",
        "Both the example 1 and 2 come from the same document whose \"BLEU_D\" score exceeds Moses with 8.4 point.",
        "The example 1 benefits from the topic cache which contains the item of \"action\".",
        "The example 2 benefits from the static cache which contains a phrase pair of \"Tpùî^H promised to\" while Moses use \"commitment\" for \"Tpti^ \" , which may be the reason for missing the part of \"prime minister\" in Moses output.",
        "Furthermore, due to the phrase pair of \"WtK the ceasefire agreement\" existing in our static cache, our decoder keeps using \"ceasefire\" to translate \"WtK\" in the whole document while Moses randomly use \"ceasefire\" or \"cease-fire\" for this translation.",
