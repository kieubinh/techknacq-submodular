Dumais, 1996; Vinokourov et al., 2003; Platt et al., 2010; Haghighi et al., 2008).",

        "2).",
        "The strong reliance of these approaches on the covariance matrices leads to problems, especially with the noisy data caused either by the noisy words in a document or the noisy document alignments.",

        "But these techniques extend directly to monolingual covariance matrices, and to different language pairs as well.",
        "The first step in filtering out the noisy word cooccurrences is to use an appropriate measure to compute the strength of word pairs (English and Spanish words).",
        "This is a well studied problem and several association measures have been proposed in the NLP literature (Dunning, 1993; Inkpen and Hirst, 2002; Moore, 2004).",
        "These association measures can be divided into groups based on the statistics they use (Hoang et al., 2009).",
        "Here we explore a few of them for sparsifying the cross-covariance matrix.",
        "The first option is to use the cross-covariance matrix itself.",
        "As noted above, when the data matrix is centered, the cross-covariance of an English word (ei) with a Spanish word (fj) is given by Y^Ik=1 XikYjk.",
        "It measures the strength with which two words co-occur together.",
        "This measure uses information about the occurrence of a word pair in aligned documents and doesn't use other statistics such as 'how often this pair doesn't co-occur together' and so on.",
        "Association measures like covariance and Point-wise Mutual Information, which only use the frequency with which a word pair co-occurs, often overestimate the strength of low frequent words (Moore, 2004).",
        "On the other hand, measures like Log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) and Mutual Information (MI) use other statistics like the marginal probabilities of each of the words.",
        "For any two words, ei and fj, let n11, \"10, \"01and \"00 denote the number of documents in which both the words co-occur, only English word occurs, only Spanish word occurs and none of the words occur.",
        "Then the Mutual Information of this word pair is given by:",
        "where \"i and \"j denote the number of documents in which the English and the Spanish word occurs and \" is the total number of documents.",
        "We treat the occurrence of a word in a document slightly different from others, we treat a word as occurring in a document if it has occurred more than its average frequency in the corpus.",
        "Log-likelihood ratio and the MI differ only in terms of the constant they use, so we use only MI in our experiments.",
        "Yule's u is another popular association measure used in psychology (Reis and Judd, 2000).",
        "It uses same statistics used by Mutual Information but differs in the way in which they are combined.",
        "MI converts the frequencies into probabilities before computing the association measure where as Yule's u uses the observed frequencies directly, and doesn t make any assumptions about the underlying probability distributions.",
        "Given the same interpretation of the variables as introduced in the previous section, the Yule s u is estimated as:",
        "V^oo^ii - v^oi^io ...",
        "This way of combining the frequencies bears similarity with the log-odds ratio.",
        "The above three association measures use the same training data that is available to compute the covariance matrices in CCA.",
        "Thus, their utility in bringing additional information, which is not captured by the covariance matrices, is arguable (our experiments show that they are indeed helpful).",
        "Moreover, they use document level co-occurrence information which is coarse compared to the cooccurrence at sentence level or the translational information provided by a bilingual dictionary.",
        "So, we use bilingual dictionaries as our final resource to weigh the word co-occurrences.",
        "Notice that, using bilingual information brings in information gleaned from an external corpus.",
        "We use translation tables learnt using Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) on Europarl data set.",
        "Since the translation tables are asymmetric, we combine translation tables from both the directions.",
        "We first use a threshold on the conditional probability to filter out the low probability ones and then convert them into joint probabilities before combining.",
        "For each word pair (ei, fj), we compute the score as:",
        "While the first three association measures can also be applied to monolingual data, bilingual dictionary can't be used for weighting monolingual word pairs.",
        "So in this case, we use either of the above mentioned techniques for weighting monolingual word pairs.",
        "The next step after computing association measure for all word pairs is to use them in selecting the pairs that need to be retained.",
        "In this section, we describe some approaches such as thresholding and matching for the word pair selection.",
        "A straight forward way to remove the noisy word co-occurrences is to zero out the entries of the cross-covariance matrix that are lower than a threshold.",
        "To understand the motivation, consider the rewritten objective function of CCA, aTXYTb =",
        "Eij ai bj.",
        "This is linear in terms of the individual components of the cross-covariance matrix.",
        "So, if we want to remove some of the entries of the covariance matrix with minimal change in the value of the objective function, then the optimal choice is to sort the entries of the covariance matrix and filter out the less confident word pairs.",
        "While the thresholding strategy described in the above section is very simple, it is often biased by the frequent words.",
        "Since a frequent word co-occurs with other words often, it naturally tends to have high association with most of the other words.",
        "As a result, absolute thresholding tends to remove all the less frequent word pairs while leaving the cooccurrences of the frequent words untouched.",
        "Eventually, this may lead to zeroing out some of the rows or the columns of the cross-covariance matrix.",
        "To circumvent this, we try thresholding at word level.",
        "For every English word, we choose a few Spanish words that have high association and vice versa.",
        "Since the nearest neighbour property is asymmetric, we take the union of all the selected word pairs.",
        "That is, we retain a word pair, if either the Spanish word is in the top ranked list of the English word or vice versa.",
        "Though relative thresholding overcomes the problem of zeroing out entire rows or columns posed by direct thresholding, it is still biased by the frequent words.",
        "The high association measure of a frequent English word with many Spanish words, makes it a nearest neighbour for lot of Spanish words.",
        "One way to prevent this is to discourage an already selected English word from associating with a new Spanish word.",
        "This requires a global knowledge of all the selected pairs and can not be done by looking at the individual words, as is the case with the greedy strategy employed by the relative thresholding.",
        "We use matching to solve this problem.",
        "We formulate the selection of the word pairs as a network flow problem (Jagarlamudi et al., 2011).",
        "The objective is to select word pairs that have high association measure while constraining each word to be associated with only a few words from other language.",

        "The training phase involves finding projection directions for documents of both the languages.",
        "We compute the covariance matrices using the training data.",
        "Then we use any of the word association measures (Sec.",
        "3.1) along with a selection criteria (Sec.",
        "3.2) to recover the sparseness in either only the cross-covariance or all of the covariance matrices.",

        "Such an interlingual representation is useful in many tasks like cross-lingual text categorization (Bel et al., 2003) multilingual web search (Gao et al., 2009) and so on.",

        "We want each word to be associated with k words from other language, i.e.Y^j Iij = k and Ei Iij = k. Moreover, we want word pairs with high association score to be selected.",

        "The optimal solution of the relaxed problem can be found efficiently using linear programming (Ravin-dra et al., 1993).",
        "The uni-modular nature of the constraints guarantees an integral solution (Schri-jver, 2003), so relaxing the original integer problem doesn't introduce any error in the optimal solution.",
