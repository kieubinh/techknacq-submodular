        "Borrowing is a major type of word formation in Japanese, and numerous foreign words (proper names or neologisms etc.)",
        "are continuously being imported from other languages (Tsujimura, 2006).",
        "Most borrowed words in modern Japanese are transliterations from English and they are referred to as katakana words because transliterated foreign words are primarily spelled by using katakana characters in the Japanese writing system.",
        "Compound-",
        "*Some researchers use the term transcription rather than transliteration (Breen, 2009).",
        "Our terminology is based on studies on machine transliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1998).",
        "ing is another type of word formation that is common in Japanese (Tsujimura, 2006).",
        "In particular, noun compounds are frequently produced by merging two or more nouns together.",
        "These two types of word formation yield a significant amount of katakana noun compounds, making Japanese a highly productive language.",
        "In Japanese as well as some European and Asian languages (e.g., German, Dutch and Korean), constituent words of compounds are not separated by white spaces, unlike in English.",
        "In those languages, it is beneficial for various NLP applications to split such compounds.",
        "For example, compound splitting enables SMT systems to translate a compound on a word-by-word basis, even if the compound itself is not found in the translation table (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Dyer, 2009).",
        "In the context of IR, decompounding has an analogous effect to stemming, and it significantly improves retrieval results (Braschler and Ripplinger, 2004).",
        "In abbreviation recognition, the definition of an abbreviation is often in the form of a noun compound, and most abbreviation recognition algorithms assume that the definition is properly segmented; see e.g., (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Okazakietal.,2008).",
        "This has led NLP researchers to explore methods for splitting compounds, especially noun compounds, in various languages (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Nakazawa et al., 2005; Alfonseca et al., 2008a).",
        "While many methods have been presented, they basically require expensive linguistic resources to achieve high enough accuracy.",
        "For example, Alfonseca et al.",
        "(2008b) employed a word dictionary, which is obviously useful for this task.",
        "Other studies have suggested using bilingual resources such as parallel corpora (Brown, 2002; Koehn and Knight, 2003; Nakazawa et al., 2005).",
        "The idea behind those methods is that compounds are basically split into constituent words when they are translated into English, where the compounded words are separated by white spaces, and hence splitting rules can be learned by discovering word alignments in bilingual resources.",
        "The largest obstacle that makes compound splitting difficult is the existence of out-of-vocabulary words, which are not found in the abovemen-tioned linguistic resources.",
        "In the Japanese case, it is known that katakana words constitute a large source of out-of-vocabulary words (Brill et al., 2001; Nakazawa et al., 2005; Breen, 2009).",
        "As we have discussed, katakana words are very productive, and thus we can no longer expect existent linguistic resources to have sufficient coverage.",
        "According to (Breen, 2009), as many as 20% of katakana words in news articles, which we think include less out-of-vocabulary words than Web and other noisy textual data, are out-of-vocabulary.",
        "Those katakana words often form noun compounds, and pose a substantial difficulty for Japanese text processing (Nakazawa et al., 2005).",
        "To alleviate the errors caused by out-of-vocabulary words, we explored the use of unlabeled textual data for splitting katakana noun compounds.",
        "Since the amount of unlabeled text available is generally much larger than word dictionaries and other expensive linguistic resources, it is crucial to establish a methodology for taking full advantage of such easily available textual data.",
        "While several approaches have already been proposed, their accuracies are still unsatisfactory (section 2.1).",
        "From a broad perspective, our approach can be seen as using paraphrases of noun compounds.",
        "As we will see in section 4 and 5, katakana noun compounds can be paraphrased into various forms that strongly indicate word boundaries within the original noun compound.",
        "This paper empirically demonstrates that splitting accuracy can be significantly improved by extracting such paraphrases from un-labeled text, the Web in our case, and then using that information for constructing splitting models.",
        "Specifically, two types of paraphrases are investigated in this paper.",
        "Section 4 explores monolingual paraphrases that can be generated by inserting certain linguistic markers between constituent words of katakana noun compounds.",
        "Section 5, in turn, explores bilingual paraphrases (specifically, backtransliteration).",
        "Since katakana words are basically transliterations from English, back-transliterating katakana noun compounds is also useful for splitting.",
        "To avoid terminological confusion, monolingual paraphrases are simply referred to as paraphrases and bilingual paraphrases are referred to as back-transliterations hereafter.",
        "We did experiments to empirically evaluate our method.",
        "The results demonstrated that both paraphrase and back-transliteration substantially improved the performance in terms of Fi-score, and the best performance was achieved when they were combined.",
        "We also confirmed that our method outperforms the previously proposed splitting methods by a wide margin.",
        "All these results strongly suggest the effectiveness of paraphrasing and back-transliteration for identifying word boundaries within katakana noun compounds."

        "Recent studies have explored using paraphrase statistics for parsing (Nakov and Hearst, 2005a;",
        "Nakov and Hearst, 2005b; Bansal and Klein, 2011).",
        "Although these studies successfully demonstrated the usefulness of paraphrases for improving parsers, the connection between paraphrases and word segmentation (or noun compound splitting) was not at all discussed.",

        "What most differentiates these studies from our work is that their primary goal is to build a machine transliteration system or to build a bilingual dictionary itself; none of them explored splitting compounds."

        "From the corpora, we extracted 14,966,205 (potential) paraphrases of katakana noun compounds together with their frequencies.",
        "We also extracted 151,195 word-aligned transliteration pairs.",
        "In doing this, we ranged the threshold 9 in { – 10, – 20, • •• – 150} and chose the value that performed the best (9 = – 80).",
        "The results were evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.",
        "Precision is the number of correctly identified words divided by the number of all identified words, recall is the number of correctly identified words divided by the number of all oracle words, the F1-score is their harmonic mean, and accuracy is the number of correctly split katakana noun compounds divided by the number of all the katakana noun compounds.",
        "We compared our system with three frequency-based baseline system, two supervised baselines, and two state-of-the-art word segmentation baselines.",
        "The first frequency-based baseline, UniGRAM, performs compound splitting based on a word 1-gram language model (Schiller, 2005; Alfonseca et al., 2008b):",
        "where p( yi) represents the probability of yi.The second frequency-based baseline, GMF, outputs the splitting option with the highest geometric mean frequency of the constituent words (Koehn and Knight, y * = argmax GMF(y) = argmax yey(x) yey(x)",
        "{n f (yi)}1/|y|.",
        "where f(yi) represents the frequency of yi.The third frequency-based baseline, GMF2, is a modification of Gmf proposed by Nakazawa et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "It is based on the following score instead where C, N,and a are hyperparameters and l is the average length of the constituent words.",
        "Following (Nakazawa et al., 2005), the hyperparameters were set as C = 2500, N = 4, and a = 0.7.",
        "We estimated p(y) and f(y) from the Web corpora.",
        "The first supervised baseline, AP, is the averaged perceptron model trained using only the basic feature set.",
        "The second supervised baseline, AP+GMF2 is a combination of AP and GMF2, which performed the best amongst the frequency-based baselines.",
        "Following (Alfonseca et al., 2008b), GMF2 is integrated into AP as two binary features indicating whether GMF2(y) is larger than any other candidates, and whether GMF2(y) is larger than the non-split candidate.",
        "Although Alfonseca et al.",
        "(2008b) also proposed using (the log of) the geometric mean frequency as a feature, doing so degraded performance in our experiment.",
        "Regarding the two state-of-the-art word segmentation systems, one is JUMAN, a rule-based word segmentation system (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), and the other is MECAB, a supervised word segmentation system based on CRFs (Kudo et al., 2004).",
        "These two baselines were chosen in order to show how well existing word segmentation systems perform this task.",
        "Although the literature states that it is hard for existing systems to deal with katakana noun compounds (Nakazawa et al., 2005), no empirical data on this issue has been presented until now.",
        "Table 5 compares the performance of our system (PROPOSED) with the baseline systems.",
        "First of all, we can see that Proposed clearly improved the performance of AP, demonstrating the effectiveness of using paraphrases and back-transliterations.",
        "Our system also outperformed all the frequency-based baselines (UNIGRAM,GMF,andGMF2).",
        "This is not surprising, since the simple supervised baseline, AP, already outperformed the unsupervised frequency-based ones.",
        "Indeed similar experimental results were also reported by Alfonseca (2008a).",
        "An interesting observation here is the comparison between PROPOSED and AP+GMF2.",
        "It reveals that our approach improved the performance of AP more than the frequency-based method did.",
        "These results indicate that paraphrasing and back-transliteration are more informative clues than the simple frequency of constituent words.",
        "We would like to note that the higher accuracy of PROPOSED in comparison with the baselines is statistically significant (p< 0.01, McNemar's test).",
        "The performance of the two word segmentation baselines (JUMAN and MECAB) is significantly worse in our task than in the standard word segmentation task, where nearly 99% precision and recall are reported (Kudo et al., 2004).",
        "This demonstrates that splitting a katakana noun compound is not at all a trivial task to resolve, even for the state-of-the-art word segmentation systems.",
        "On the other hand, PROPOSED outperformed both JUMAN and MECAB in this task, meaning that our technique can successfully complement the weaknesses of the existing word segmentation systems.",
        "By analyzing the errors, we interestingly found that some of the erroneous splitting results are still acceptable to humans.",
        "For example, while '7 7 7° ü – K (upload)' was annotated as a single word in the test data, our system split it into '77^ (up)' and K (load)'.",
        "Although the latter splitting may be useful in some applications, it is judged as wrong in our evaluation framework.",
        "This implies the importance of evaluating the splitting results in some extrinsic tasks.",
        "We leave it to a future work.",
        "In our test data, 2681 out of the 5286 katakana noun compounds contained at least one out-of-vocabulary word that are not registered in NAIST-jdic.",
        "Table 6 illustrates the results of the supervised systems for those 2681 and the remaining 2605 katakana noun compounds (referred to as w/ OOV and w/o OOV data, respectively).",
        "While the accuracy exceeds 90% for w/o OOV data, it is substantially degraded for w/ OOV data.",
        "This is consistent with our claim that out-of-vocabulary words are a major source of errors in splitting noun compounds.",
        "The three supervised systems performed almost equally for w/o OOV data.",
        "This is because AP trivially performs very well on this subset, and it is difficult to get any further improvement.",
        "On the other hand, we can see that there are substantial performance gaps between the systems for w/ OOV data.",

        "Our test data comprised 7709 constituent words, jdic.",
        "The coverage was significantly improved when using the back-transliteration feature.",
        "We observed that 6216 words (80.6%) are in NAIST-jdic or word-aligned transliteration pairs extracted from the Web text.",
        "This shows that the back-transliteration feature successfully reduced the number of out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "On the other hand, we observed that the paraphrase and back-transliteration features were activated for 79.5% (1926/2423) and 15.5% (376/2423) of the word boundaries in our test data.",
        "Overall, we see that the coverage of these features is reasonably good, although there is still room for further improvement.",
        "It would be beneficial to use larger Web corpora or more paraphrase rules, for example, by having a system that automatically learns rules from the corpora (Barzilay and McKe-own, 2001; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "Finally we investigated the influence of the threshold 9 (Figure 1 and 2).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the system performance in terms of Fi-score for different values of 9.",
        "While the Fi score drops when the value of 9 is too large (e.g., – 20), the F1-score is otherwise almost constant.",
        "This demonstrates it is generally easy to set 9 near the optimal value.",
        "More importantly, the F1-score is consistently higher than Basic irrespective of the value of 9.",

        "In this paper, we explored the idea of using monolingual and bilingual paraphrases for splitting katakana noun compounds in Japanese.",
        "The experiments demonstrated that our method significantly improves the splitting accuracy by a large margin in comparison with the previously proposed methods.",
        "This means that paraphrasing provides a simple and effective way of using unlabeled textual data for identifying implicit word boundaries within katakana noun compounds.",
        "Although our investigation was restricted to katakana noun compounds, one might expect that a similar approach would be useful for splitting other types of noun compounds (e.g., German noun compounds), or for identifying general word boundaries, not limited to those between nouns, in Asian languages.",
        "We think these are research directions worth exploring in the future.",
