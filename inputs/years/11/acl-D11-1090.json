        "Chinese sentences are written in continuous sequence of characters without explicit delimiters such as space characters.",
        "To find the basic language units, i.e. words, segmentation is a necessary initial step for Chinese language processing.",
        "Previous research shows that word segmentation models trained on labeled data are reasonably accurate.",
        "In this paper, we investigate improving supervised word segmentation with unlabeled data.",
        "We distinguish three types of unlabeled data, namely large-scale in-domain data, out-of-domain data and small-scale document text.",
        "Both large-scale in-domain and out-of-domain data is popular for enhancing NLP tasks.",
        "Learning from these two types of unlabeled data normally involves semi-supervised learning.",
        "The difference between them is that out-of-domain data is usually used for domain adaptation.",
        "For a number of NLP tasks, there are relatively large amounts of labeled training data.",
        "In this situation, supervised learning can provide competitive results, and it is difficult to improve them any further by using extra unlabeled data.",
        "Chinese word segmentation is one of this kind of tasks, since several large-scale manually annotated corpora are publicly available.",
        "In this work, we first exploit unlabeled indomain data to improve strong supervised models.",
        "We leave domain adaptation for our future work.",
        "We introduce the third type of unlabeled data with a transductive learning, document-level view.",
        "Many applications of word segmentation involve processing a whole document, such as information retrieval.",
        "In this situation, the text of the current document can provide additional useful information to segment a sentence.",
        "Take the word \"f^lfcM/elastane\" for example.",
        "As a translated terminology word, it lacks compositionality.",
        "Moreover, this word appears rarely in general texts.",
        "As a result, if it does not appear in the training data, it is very hard for statistical models to recognize this word.",
        "Nevertheless, when we deal with an article discussing an elastane company, this word may appear more than once in this article, and the document information can help recognize this word.",
        "This idea is closely related to transductive learning in the sense that the segmentation model knows something about the problem it is going to resolve.",
        "In this work, we are also concerned with enhancing word segmentation with the document information.",
        "We present a unified \"feature engineering\" approach for learning segmentation models from both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "Our method is a simple two-stage process.",
        "First, we use unannotated corpus to extract string and document information, and then we use these information to construct new statistics-based and document-based feature mapping for a discriminative word segmenter.",
        "We are relying on the ability of discriminative learning method to identify and explore informative features, which play central role to boost the segmentation performance.",
        "This simple solution has been shown effective for named entity recognition (Miller et al., 2004) and dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008).",
        "In their implementations, word clusters derived from unlabeled data are imported as features to discriminative learning approaches.",
        "To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) data.",
        "CTB is a collection of documents which are separately annotated.",
        "This annotation style allows us to evaluate our transductive segmentation method.",
        "Our experiments show that both statistics-based and document-based features are effective in the word segmentation application.",
        "In general, the use of unlabeled data can be motivated by two concerns: First, given a fixed amount of labeled data, we might wish to leverage unla-beled data to improve the performance of a supervised model.",
        "Second, given a fixed target performance level, we might wish to use unlabeled data to reduce the amount of annotated data necessary to reach this target.",
        "We show that our approach yields improvements for fixed data sets, even when large-scale labeled data is available.",
        "The new features result in relative error reductions of 13.8% and 15.4% in terms of the balanced F-score and the recall of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words respectively.",
        "By conducting experiments on data sets of varying sizes, we demonstrate that for fixed levels of performance, the new features derived from unlabeled data can significantly reduce the need of labeled data.",

        "The Character-based approach is a dominant word segmentation solution for Chinese text processing.",
        "This approach treats word segmentation as a sequence tagging problem, assigning labels to the characters indicating whether a character locates at the beginning of, inside or at the end of a word.",
        "This character-by-character method was first proposed by (Xue, 2003), and a number of discriminative sequential learning algorithms have been exploited, including structured perceptron (Jiang et al., 2009), the Passive-Aggressive algorithm (Sun, 2010), conditional random fields (CRFs) (Tseng et al., 2005), and latent variable CRFs (Sun et al., 2009).",
        "In this work, we use the Start/End representation to express the position information of every character.",
        "Table 2.1 shows the meaning of each character label.",
        "For example, the target label representation of the book title & MM W m S 0 TÖ/The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang\" is as follows.",
        "& m PH & M W m S 0 TS BIEBESBEBE Key to our approach is to allow informative features derived from unlabeled data to assist the segmenter.",
        "In our experiments, we employed three different feature sets: a baseline feature set which draws upon \"normal\" information from labeled training data, a statistics-based feature set that uses statistical information derived from a large-scale indomain corpus, and a document-based feature set that uses information encoded in the surrounding text.",
        "In this work, to train a good traditional supervised segmenter, our baseline feature templates includes the ones described in (Sun et al., 2009; Sun, 2010).",
        "These features are divided into two types: character features and word type features.",
        "Note that the word type features are indicator functions that fire when the local character sequence matches a word uni-gram or bi-gram.",
        "Dictionary containing word uni-grams and bi-grams is collected from the training data.",
        "To conveniently illustrate, we denote a candidate character token ci with a context ...Cj_iCjCj+i.... We use C[s:e] to express a string that starts at the position s and ends at the position e. For example, C[i:i+1] expresses a character bi-gram CjCj+i.",
        "The character features are listed below.",
        "• Whether cs and cs+1 are identical, for i – 2 < s < i + 2.",
        "• Whether cs and cs+2 are identical, for i – 4 < s < i + 2.",
        "The word type features are listed as follows.",
        "• The identity of the string C[s:i] (i – 6 < s < i), if it matches a word from the list of uni-gram words;",
        "• The identity of the string C[i:e] (i < e < i + 6), if it matches a word; multiple features could be generated.",

        "• The identity of the bi-gram C[s:i]C[i+1:e] (i – 6 < s, e < i + 6), if it matches a word bi-gram; multiple features could be generated.",
        "Idiom In linguistics, idioms are usually presumed to be figures of speech contradicting the principle of compositionality.",
        "As a result, it is very hard to recognize out-of-vocabulary idioms for word segmentation.",
        "Nonetheless, the lexicon of idioms can be taken as a close set, which helps resolve the problem well.",
        "In our previous work (Sun, 2011), we collect 12992 idioms from several free online Chinese dictionaries.",
        "This linguistic resource is publicly avail-able.",

        "• Does Ci locate at the beginning of, inside or at the end of an idiom?",
        "If the string C[s:i] (s < i) matches an item from the idiom lexicon, the feature template receives a string value \"E-IDIOM\".",
        "Similarly, we can define when this feature ought to be set to \"B-IDIOM\" or \"I-IDIOM\".",
        "Note that all idioms are larger than one character, so there is no \"S-IDIOM\" feature here.",
        "In order to distill information from unlabeled data, we borrow ideas from some previous research on unsupervised word segmentation.",
        "The statistical information acquired from a relatively large amount of unlabeled data are designed as features correlated with the position where a character locates in a word token.",

        "If there is a genuine association between x and y, the I(x, y) = log p^py) should be greater than 0.",
        "Some previous work claimed that the larger the mutual information between two consecutive strings, the higher the possibility of the two strings being combined together.",
        "We adopt this idea in our character-based segmentation model.",

        "This principle is introduced as the accessor variety criterion for identifying meaningful Chinese words in (Feng et al., 2004).",
        "This criterion evaluates how independently a string is used, and thus how likely it is that the string can be a word.",
        "Given a string s, which consists of l (1 > 2) characters, we define the left accessor variety of Llav (s) as the number of distinct characters that precede s in a corpus.",
        "Similarly, the right accessor variety Rlav (s) is defined as the number of distinct characters that succeed s.",
        "We first extract all strings whose length are between 2 and 4 from the unlabeled data, and calculate their accessor variety values.",
        "For each character Ci, we then incorporate the following information into our model,",

        "• Accessor variety of strings with length 2:",
        "Punctuation marks are symbols that indicate the structure and organization of written language, as well as intonation and pauses to be observed when reading aloud.",
        "Punctuation marks can be taken as perfect word delimiters, and can be used as anchor words to harvest lexical knowledge.",
        "The preceding and succeeding strings of punctuations carry additional wordbreak information, since punctuations should be segmented as a word.",
        "Note that such information is biased because not all words can appear before or after punctuations.",
        "For example, punctuations can not be followed by particles, such as \"T\", \"3jf\" and \"Ü\" which are indicators of aspects.",
        "Nevertheless, our experiments will show this kind of information is still useful for word segmentation.",
        "When a string appears many times preceding or succeeding punctuations, there tends to be word-breaks succeeding or preceding that string.",
        "To utilize the wordbreak information provided by punctuations, we extract all strings with length 1(2 < l < 4) which precede or succeed punctuations in the unlabeled data.",
        "We define the left punctuation variety of Llpv (s) as the number of times a punctuation precedes s in a corpus.",
        "Similarly, the right punctuation variety R!pv (s) is defined as the number of how many times a punctuation succeeds s. These two variables evaluate how likely a string can be separated at its start or end positions.",
        "We first gather all strings surrounding punctuations in the unlabeled data, and calculate their punctuation variety values.",
        "The length of each string is also restricted between 2 and 4.",

        "In their work, four common HTML tags are successfully used as raw phrase bracketings to improve unsupervised dependency parsing.",
        "The derived information introduced above is all expressed as real values.",
        "The natural way to incorporate these statistics into a discriminative learning model is to directly use them as numeric features.",
        "However, our experiments show that this simple choice does not work well.",
        "The reason is that these statistics actually behave non-linearly to predict character labels.",
        "For each type of statistics, one weight alone cannot capture the relation between its value and the possibility that a string forms a word.",
        "Instead, we represent these statistics as discrete features.",
        "For the mutual information, this is done by rounding down decimal number.",
        "The integer part of each MI value is used as a string feature.",
        "For the accessor variety and punctuation variety information, since their values are integer, we can directly use them as string features.",
        "The accessor variety and punctuation variety could be very large, so we set thresholds to cut off large values to deal with the data sparse problem.",
        "Specially, if an accessor variety value is greater than 50, it is incorporated as a feature \"> 50\"; if the value is greater than 30 but not greater than 50, it is incorporated as a feature \"30 – 50\"; else the value is individually incorporated as a string feature.",
        "For example, if the left accessory variety of a character bi-gram C[i:i+1]is 29, the binary feature \"LIv (c[i:i+1] )=29\" will be set to 1, while other related binary features such as be set to 0.",
        "Similarly, we can discretize the punctuation variety features.",
        "However, we only set one threshold, 30, for this value.",
        "These thresholds can be tuned by using held-out data.",
        "It is meaningless to derive statistics of a document and use it for word segmentation, since most documents are relatively short, and values are statistically unreliable.",
        "Our experiments confirm this idea.",
        "Instead, we propose the following binary features which are based on the string count in the given document that is simply the number of times a given string appears in that document.",
        "For each character Ci, our document-based features include,",
        "• Whether the string count of C[s:i] is equal to that",
        "of C[s:i+1] (i – 3 < s < i).",
        "Multiple features are generated for different string length.",
        "• Whether the string count of C[i:e] is equal to that of C[i_1:e] (i < e < i + 3).",
        "Multiple features are generated for different string length.",
        "The intuition is as follows.",
        "The string counts of C[s:i] and C[s:i+1] being equal means that when C[s:i] appears, it appears inside C[s:i+1].",
        "In this case, C[s:i] is not independently used in this document, and this feature suggests the segmenter not assign a \"S\" or \"E\" label to the character ci.",
        "Similarly, the string counts of C[i:e] and C[i_1:e] being equal means C[i:e] is not independently used in this document, and this feature suggests segmenter not assign a \"S\" or \"B\" label to Ci.",
        "We do not directly use the string counts to prevent a bias towards longer documents."

        "Different from their concern, our focus is general word segmentation.",
        "The \"feature-engineering\" semi-supervised approach has been successfully applied to named entity recognition (Miller et al., 2004) and dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008).",
        "These two papers demonstrated the effectiveness of using word clusters as features in discriminative learning.",
        "Moreover, Turian et al.",
        "(2010) compared different word clustering algorithms and evaluated their effect on both named entity recognition and text chunking.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the feature design is inspired by some previous research on word segmentation.",
        "The accessor variety criterion is proposed to extract word types, i.e. the list of possible words, in (Feng et al., 2004).",
        "Different from their work, our method resolves the segmentation problem of running texts, in which this criterion is used to define features correlated with the character position labels.",
        "Li and Sun (2009) observed that punctuations are perfect delimiters which provide useful information for segmentation.",
        "Their method can be viewed as a self-training procedure, in which extra punctuation information is incorporated to filter out automatically predicted samples.",
        "We use the punctuation information in a different way.",
        "In our method, the counts of the preceding and succeeding strings of punctuations are incorporated directly as features into a supervised model.",
        "In machine learning, transductive learning is a learning framework that typically makes use of un-labeled data.",
        "The goal of transductive learning is to only infer labels for the unlabeled data points in the test set rather than to learn a general classification function that can be applied to any future data sets.",
        "This means that the test data is known as a priori knowledge and can be used to construct better hypotheses.",
        "Although the idea to explore the document-level information in our work is similar to transductive learning, we do not use state-of-the-art transductive learning algorithms which involve learning when they meet the test data.",
        "For real-world applications, our approach is efficient by avoiding re-training."
