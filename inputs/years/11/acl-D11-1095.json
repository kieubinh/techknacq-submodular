        "A variety of verb classifications have been built to support NLP tasks.",
        "These include syntactic and semantic classifications, as well as ones which integrate aspects of both (Grishman et al., 1994; Miller, 1995; Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005; Kipper, 2005; Hovy et al., 2006).",
        "Classifications which integrate a wide range of linguistic properties can be particularly useful for tasks suffering from data sparseness.",
        "One such classification is the taxonomy of English verbs proposed by Levin (1993) which is based on shared (morpho-)syntactic and semantic properties of verbs.",
        "Levin's taxonomy or its extended version in VerbNet (Kipper, 2005) has proved helpful for various NLP application tasks, including e.g. parsing, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, information extraction, question-answering, and machine translation (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Dang, 2004; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Zapirain et al., 2008).",
        "Because verbs change their meaning and behaviour across domains, it is important to be able to tune existing classifications as well to build novel ones in a cost-effective manner, when required.",
        "In recent years, a variety of approaches have been proposed for automatic induction of Levin style classes from corpus data which could be used for this purpose (Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joanis et al., 2008; et al., 2008; O Seaghdha and Copestake, 2008; Vla-chos et al., 2009).",
        "The best of such approaches have yielded promising results.",
        "However, they have mostly focussed on acquiring and evaluating flat classifications.",
        "Levin's classification is not flat, but taxonomic in nature, which is practical for NLP purposes since applications differ in terms of the granularity they require from a classification.",
        "In this paper, we experiment with hierarchical Levin-style clustering.",
        "We adopt as our baseline method a well-known hierarchical method - agglomerative clustering (AGG) - which has been previously used to acquire flat Levin-style classifications (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003) as well as hierarchical verb classifications not based on Levin (Ferrer, 2004; Schulte im Walde, 2008).",
        "The method has also been popular in the related task of noun clustering (Ushioda, 1996; Matsuo et al., 2006; Bassiou and Kotropoulos, 2011).",
        "We introduce then a new method called Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering (HGFC) (Yu et al., 2006).",
        "This graph-based, probabilistic clustering algorithm has some clear advantages over AGG (e.g. it delays the decision on a verb's cluster membership at any level until a full graph is available, minimising the problem of error propagation) and it has been shown to perform better than several other hierarchical clustering methods in recent comparisons (Yu et al., 2006).",
        "The method has been applied to the identification of social network communities (Lin et al., 2008), but has not been used (to the best of our knowledge) in NLP before.",
        "We modify HGFC with a new tree extraction algorithm which ensures a more consistent result, and we propose two novel extensions to it.",
        "The first is a method for automatically determining the tree structure (i.e. number of clusters to be produced for each level of the hierarchy).",
        "This avoids the need to predetermine the number of clusters manually.",
        "The second is addition of soft constraints to guide the clustering performance (Vlachos et al., 2009).",
        "This is useful for situations where a partial (e.g. a flat) verb classification is available and the goal is to extend it.",
        "Adopting a set of lexical and syntactic features which have performed well in previous works, we compare the performance of the two methods on test sets extracted from Levin and VerbNet.",
        "When evaluated on a flat clustering task, HGFC outperforms AGG and performs very similarly with the best flat clustering method reported on the same test set (Sun and Korhonen, 2009).",
        "When evaluated on a hierarchical task, HGFC performs considerably better than AGG at all levels of gold standard classification.",
        "The constrained version of HGFC performs the best, as expected, demonstrating the usefulness of soft constraints for extending partial classifications.",
        "Our qualitative analysis shows that HGFC is capable of detecting novel information not included in our gold standards.",
        "The unconstrained version can be used to acquire novel classifications from scratch while the constrained version can be used to extend existing ones with additional class members, classes and levels of hierarchy."

        "The taxonomy of Levin (1993) groups English verbs (e.g. break, fracture, rip) into classes (e.g. 45.1 Break verbs) on the basis of their shared meaning components and (morpho-)syntactic behaviour, defined in terms of diathesis alternations (e.g. the causative/inchoative alternation, where an NP frame alternates with an intransitive frame: Tony broke the window o The window broke).",
        "It classifies over 3000 verbs in 57 top level classes, some of which divide further into subclasses.",
        "The extended version of the taxonomy in VerbNet (Kipper, 2005) classifies 5757 verbs.",

        "We included this small gold standard in our experiments so that we could compare the flat version of our method against previously published methods.",
        "Following Stevenson and Joanis (2003), we selected 20 verbs from each class which occur at least 100 times in our corpus.",
        "This gave us 260 verbs in total.",

        "2) In order to minimise the problem of polysemy, we assigned each verb to the class which, according to VerbNet, corresponds to its predominant sense in WordNet (Miller, 1995).",
        "3) In order to minimise the sparse data problem with very finegrained classes, we converted the resulting classification into a 3-level representation so that the classes at the 4th and 5th level were combined.",
        "For example, the subclasses of Declare verbs (numbered as 29.4.1.1.",
        "{1,2,3}) were combined into 29.4.1.",
        "4) The classes that have fewer than 5 members were discarded.",
        "The total number of verb senses in the resulting gold standard is 1750, which is 33.2% of the verbs in VerbNet.",
        "T2 has 51 top level, 117 second level, and 133 third level classes.",
        "T3: The third gold standard is a subset of T2 where singular classes (top level classes which do not divide into subclasses) are removed.",
        "This gold standard was constructed to enable proper evaluation of the constrained version of hgfc (introduced in the following section) where we want to compare the impact of constraints across several levels of classification.",
        "T3 provides classification of 357 verbs into 11 top level, 14 second level, and 32 third level classes.",
        "For each verb appearing in T1-T3, we extracted all the occurrences (up to 10,000) from the British National Corpus (Leech, 1992) and North American",
        "Previous works on Levin style verb classification have investigated optimal features for this task (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Li and Brew, 2008; Sun and Korhonen, 2009)).",
        "We adopt for our experiments a set of features which have performed well in recent verb clustering works: A: Subcategorization frames (scfs) and their relative frequencies with individual verbs.",
        "B: A with scfs parameterized for prepositions.",
        "C: B with scfs parameterized for subjects appearing in grammatical relations associated with the verb in parsed data.",
        "D: B with scfs parameterized for objects appearing in grammatical relations associated with the verb in parsed data.",
        "These features are purely syntactic.",
        "Although semantic features - verb selectional preferences proved the best (when used in combination with syntactic features) in the recent work of Sun and Korhonen (2009), we left such features for future work because we noticed that different levels of classification are likely to require semantic features at different granularities.",
        "We extracted the syntactic features using the system of Preiss et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "The system tags, lemma-tizes and parses corpus data using the rasp (Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing toolkit (Briscoe et al., 2006)), and on the basis of the resulting grammatical relations, assigns each occurrence of a verb as a member of one of the 168 verbal scfs.",
        "We parameterized the scfs as described above using the information provided by the system.",
        "We introduce the agglomerative clustering (agg) and Hierarchical Graph Factorization Clustering (hgfc) methods in the following two subsections, respectively.",
        "The subsequent two subsections present our extensions to hgfc: (i) automatically determining the cluster structure and (ii) adding soft constraints to guide clustering performance.",
        "agg is a method which treats each verb as a singleton cluster and then successively merges two closest clusters until all the clusters have been merged into one.",
        "We used the SciPy's implementation (Oliphant, 2007) of the algorithm.",
        "The cluster distance is measured using linkage criteria.",
        "We experimented with four commonly used linkage criteria: Single, Average, Complete and Ward's (Ward Jr., 1963).",
        "Ward's criterion performed the best and was used in all the experiments in this paper.",
        "It measures the increase in variance after two clusters are merged.",
        "The output of agg tends to have excessive number of levels.",
        "Cut-based methods (Wu and Leahy, 1993; Shi and Malik, 2000) are frequently applied to extract a simplified view.",
        "We followed previous verb clustering works and cut the agg hierarchy manually.",
        "agg suffers from two problems.",
        "The first is error propagation.",
        "When a verb is misclassified at a lower level, the error propagates to all the upper levels.",
        "The second is local pairwise merging, i.e. the fact that only two clusters can be combined at any level.",
        "For example, in order to group clusters representing Levin classes 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 into a single cluster representing class 9, the method has to produce intermediate clusters, e.g.",
        "9.",
        "{1,2} and 9.3.",
        "Such clusters do not always have a semantic interpretation.",
        "Although they can be removed using a cut-based method, this requires a predefined cut-off value which is difficult to set (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003).",
        "In addition, a significant amount of information is lost in pairwise clustering.",
        "In the above example, only the clusters 9.",
        "{1,2} and 9.3 are considered, while alternative clusters 9.",
        "{1,3} and 9.2 are ignored.",
        "Ideally, information about all the possible intermediate clusters should be aggregated, but this is intractable in practice.",
        "Our new method HGFC derives a probabilistic bipartite graph from the similarity matrix (Yu et al., 2006).",
        "The local and global clustering structures are learned via the random walk properties of the graph.",
        "The method does not suffer from the above problems with AGG.",
        "Firstly, there is no error propagation because the decision on a verb's membership at any level is delayed until the full bipartite graph is available and until a tree structure can be extracted from it by aggregating probabilistic information from all the levels.",
        "Secondly, the bipartite graph enables the construction of a hierarchical structure without any intermediate classes.",
        "For example, we can group classes 9.",
        "{1,2,3} directly into class 9.",

        "The benefit can now be seen at 3 different levels of hierarchy.",
        "On average, the hgfc outperforms agg 3.5% in nmi and 4.8% in F. The difference between the methods becomes clearer when moving towards the upper levels of the hierarchy.",
        "Table 3 shows the results of both unconstrained and constrained versions of hgfc and those of agg on the test set T3 (where singular classes are removed to enable proper evaluation of the constrained method).",
        "The results are generally generally better on this test set than on T2 - which is to be expected since T3 is a refined subset of T2.",
        "Recall that the constrained version of hgfc learns the upper levels of classification on the basis of soft constraints set at the bottom level, as described earlier in section 3.2.4.",
        "As a consequence, nmi and f are both greater than 90% at the bottom level and the results at the top level are notably lower because the impact of the constraints degrades the further away one moves from the bottom level.",
        "Yet, the relatively high result across all levels shows that the constrained version of hgfc can be employed a useful method to extend the hierarchical structure of known classifications.",

        "We focussed on the top level of 11 clusters (in the evaluation against the hierarchical gold standard, see table 3) as the impact of soft constraints is the weakest for the constrained method at this level.",
        "As expected, the constrained HGFC kept many individual verbs belonging to same Verbnet subclass together (e.g. verbs enjoy, hate, disdain, regret, love, despise, detest, dislike, fear for the class 31.2.1) so that most clusters simply group lower level classes and their members together.",
        "Three nearly clean clusters were produced which only include subclasses of the same class (e.g. 31.2.0 and 31.2.1 which both belong to 31.2 Admire verbs).",
        "However, the remaining 8 clusters group together subclasses (and their members) belonging to unrelated parent classes.",
        "Interestingly, 6 of these make both syntactic and semantic sense.",

        "The verbs included in this cluster share the meaning of specific type of motion and show similar syntactic behaviour.",
        "Thorough Levin style investigation of especially the unconstrained method would require looking at shared diathesis alternations between cluster members.",
        "We left this for future work.",
        "However, the analysis we conducted confirmed that the constrained method could indeed be used for extending known classifications, while the unconstrained method is more suitable for acquiring novel classifications from scratch.",

        "We have introduced a new graph-based method -HGFC - to hierarchical verb clustering which avoids some of the problems (e.g. error propagation, pairwise cluster merging) reported with the frequently used AGG method.",
        "We modified HGFC so that it can be used to automatically determine the tree structure for clustering, and proposed two extensions to it which make it even more suitable for our task.",
        "The first involves automatically determining the number of clusters to be produced, which is useful when this is not known in advance.",

        "The results reported in the previous section are promising.",
        "On a flat test set (T1), the unconstrained version of HGFC outperforms AGG and performs very similarly with the best current flat clustering method (spectral clustering) evaluated on the same dataset.",
        "On the hierarchical test sets (T2 and T3), the unconstrained and constrained versions of HGFC outperform AGG clearly at all levels of classification.",
        "The constrained version of HGFC detects the missing hierarchy from the existing gold standards with high accuracy.",
        "When the number of clusters and levels is learned automatically, the unconstrained method produces a multilevel hierarchy.",
        "Our evaluation against a 3-level gold standard shows that such a hierarchy is fairly accurate.",
        "Finally, the results from our qualitative evaluation show that both constrained and unconstrained versions of HGFC are capable of learning valuable novel information not included in the gold standards.",
        "The previous work on Levin style verb classification has mostly focussed on flat classifications using methods suitable for flat clustering (Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joanis et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Li and Brew, 2008; Korhonen et al., 2008; O Seaghdha and Copestake, 2008; Vlachos et al., 2009).",
        "However, some works have employed hierarchical clustering as a method to infer flat clustering.",
        "For example, Schulte im Walde and Brew (2002) employed AGG to initialize the KMeans clustering for German verbs.",
        "This gave better results than random initialization.",
        "Stevenson and Joanis (2003) used AGG for flat clustering on T1.",
        "They cut the hierarchy at the number of classes in the gold standard and found that it is difficult to automatically determine a good cut-off.",
        "Our evaluation in the previous section shows that HGFC outperforms their implementation of AGG.",
        "AGG was also used by Ferrer (2004) who performed hierarchical clustering of 514 Spanish verbs.",
        "The results were evaluated against a hierarchical gold standard resembling that of Levin's classification in English (Vazquez et al., 2000).",
        "Radj of 0.07 was reported for a 15-way classification which is comparable to the result of Stevenson and Joanis",
        "(2003).",
        "Hierarchical clustering has also been performed for the related task of semantic verb classification.",
        "For example, Basili et al.",
        "(1993) identified the problems of AGG, and applied a conceptual clustering algorithm (Fisher, 1987) to Italian verbs.",
        "They used semi-automatically acquired semantic roles and the concept types as features.",
        "No quantitative results were reported.",
        "The qualitative evaluation shows that the resulting clusters are very fine-grained.",
        "Schulte im Walde (2008) performed hierarchical clustering of German verbs using human verb association as features and AGG as a method.",
        "They focussed on two small collections of 56 and 104 verbs and evaluated the result against flat gold standard extracted from GermaNet (Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002) and German FrameNet (Erk et al., 2003), respectively.",
        "They reported F of 62.69% for the 56 verbs, and F of 34.68% for the 104 verbs.",
        "In the future, we plan to extend this research line in several directions.",
        "First, we will try to determine optimal features for different levels of clustering.",
        "For example, the general syntactic features (e.g. scf) may perform the best at top levels of a hierarchy while more specific or refined features (e.g. scF+pp) may be optimal at lower levels.",
        "We also plan to investigate incorporating semantic features, like verb selectional preferences, in our feature set.",
        "It is likely that different levels of clustering require more or less specific selectional preferences.",
        "One way to obtain the latter is hierarchical clustering of relevant noun data.",
        "In addition, we plan to apply the unconstrained HGFC to specific domains to investigate its capability to learn novel, previously unknown classifications.",
        "As for the constrained version of HGFC, we will conduct a larger scale experiment on the VerbNet data to investigate what kind of upper level hierarchy it can propose for this resource (which currently has over 100 top level classes).",
        "Finally, we plan to compare HGFC to other hierarchical clustering methods that are relatively new to NLP but have proved promising in other fields, including Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (Heller and Ghahramani, 2005; Teh et al., 2008) and the method of Azran and Ghahramani (2006a) based on spectral clustering."
