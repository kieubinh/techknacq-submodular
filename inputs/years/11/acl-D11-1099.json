        "According to Nissim et al.",
        "(2004), a discourse entity can be new, old, or mediated.",
        "Informally, a discourse entity is (1) old to the hearer if it is known to the hearer and has previously been referred to in the dialogue, (2) new if it is unknown to her and has not been previously referred to; and (3) mediated if it is newly mentioned in the dialogue but she can infer its identity from a previously-mentioned entity.",
        "Information status is a subject that has received a lot of attention in theoretical linguistics (Halliday, 1976; Prince, 1981; Hajicova, 1984; Vallduvi, 1992; Steedman, 2000).",
        "Knowing the information status ofdiscourse entities can potentially benefit many NLP applications.",

        "While there is general belief that definite descriptions are mostly anaphoric, Vieira and Poesio (2000) empirically show that only 30% of these NPs are anaphoric.",
        "Without being able to determine whether an NP is anaphoric, an anaphora resolver will attempt to resolve every NP, potentially damaging its precision.",
        "Since new entities are by definition new to the hearer and therefore cannot refer to a previously-introduced NP, knowledge of information status could be used to improve anaphora resolution.",
        "Despite the potential usefulness of information status in NLP tasks, there has been little work on learning the information status of discourse entities.",
        "To investigate the plausibility of learning information status, Nissim et al.",

        "Hence, it would be desirable to augment Nissim's feature set with features that indicate whether an entity is generally known or not.",
        "One way to do this is to (1) create a list of generally known entities, and then (2) create a binary feature that has the value True if and only if the entity under consideration appears in this list.",
        "The question, then, is: how can we obtain the list of generally known entities?",
        "We may manually assemble this list, but this could be a labor-intensive task.",
        "As a result, we propose to acquire this kind of world knowledge automatically from annotated data.",
        "Specifically, we augment Nissim's feature set with the set of unigrams that appear in the training data.",
        "Given a training/test instance (i.e., discourse entity), we compute the values of its unigram features (henceforth lexical features) as follows.",
        "For each unigram, we check if it appears in the string representing the discourse entity.",
        "If so, its feature value is 1; otherwise, its value is 0.",
        "For instance, if the entity is the red hat, then all ofits lexical features except the, red, and hat will have a value of 0.",
        "It should perhaps not be too difficult to see why these lexical features are useful for the informationstatus classifier: these features enable the SVM learner to determine the extent to which a unigram correlates with each class.",
        "For instance, from the annotated data, the learner will learn that any instance of China cannot be labeled as new, and the decision of whether it should be an old entity or a med entity depends on whether it is coreferential with a previously-mentioned entity.",
        "Hence, the use of lexical features allows the learner to implicitly acquire some world knowledge.",
        "We believe that lexicalization is an important step towards building high-performance text-processing systems.",
        "In fact, lexicalized models have demonstrated their effectiveness in other areas of language processing, such as syntactic and semantic parsing.",
        "While lexicalized models may be less portable to new genres and domains than their unlexicalized counterparts, we believe that this issue can be handled via domain adaptation techniques and should not be a reason against lexicalization.",
        "In Nissim's (2006) feature set, there are a couple of features that capture NP-internal information, such as determiner, NP length, and NP type.",
        "However, there is only one feature that captures the syntactic context of an NP, grammatical role, which is computed based on the parse tree in which the NP resides.",
        "This is arguably a very shallow representation of its syntactic context.",
        "We hypothesize that we can train more accurate information-status classifiers if we have access to a richer representation of syntactic context.",
        "This motivates us to employ syntactic parse trees directly as features.",
        "Before describing how this can be done, recall that in a traditional learning setting, the feature set employed by an off-the-shelf learning algorithm typically consists of flat features (i.e., features whose values are discrete-or real-valued, as the ones described in the previous section).",
        "Advanced machine learning algorithms such as SVMs, on the other hand, have enabled the use of structured features (i.e., features whose values are structures such as parse trees), owing to their ability to employ kernels to efficiently compute the similarity between two potentially complex structures.",
        "Perhaps the main advantage of employing structured features is simplicity.",
        "To understand this advantage, consider learning in a setting where we can only employ flat features.",
        "If we want to use information from a parse tree as features in this setting, we will need to design heuristics to extract the desired parse-based features from parse trees.",
        "For certain tasks, designing a good set of heuristics can be time-consuming and sometimes difficult.",
        "On the other hand, SVMs enable a parse tree to be employed directly as a structured feature, obviating the need to design such heuristics.",
        "Given two parse trees (as features), we compute their similarity using a convolution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), which efficiently enumerates the number of common substructures in the two trees via dynamic programming.",
        "Note, however, that while we want to use a parse tree directly as a feature, we do not want to use the entire parse tree as a feature.",
        "Specifically, while using the entire parse tree enables a richer representation of the syntactic context than using a partial parse tree, the increased complexity of the tree also makes it more difficult for the SVM learner to make generalizations.",
        "To strike a better balance between having a rich representation of the context and improving the learner's ability to generalize, we extract a substructure from a parse tree and use it as the value of the structured feature of an instance.",
        "Specifically, given an instance corresponding to discourse entity e, we extract the substructure from the parse tree containing e as follows.",
        "Let n(e) be the root of the subtree that spans all and only the words in e, and let Parent(n(e)) be its immediate parent node.",
        "We (1) take the subtree rooted at Parent (n(e)), (2) replace each leaf node in this subtree with a node labeled X, (3) replace the subtree rooted at n(e) with a leaf node labeled Y, and (4) use the subtree rooted at Parent(n(e)) as the structured feature for the instance corresponding to e. Intuitively, the first three steps aim to provide generalizations by simplifying the tree.",
        "For instance, step (1) allows us to focus on using a small window as the context.",
        "Steps (2) and (3) help generalization by ignoring the words within e and its context.",
        "Note that using two labels, X and Y, enables the kernel to distinguish the discourse entity under consideration from its context within this substructure.",
        "In addition, we simply use a single node (Y) to represent the discourse entity, since any NP-internal information has presumably been captured by the flat features.",
        "We compute these structured features using hand-annotated parse trees.",
        "While structured features have been employed for a multitude of tasks in syntax, semantics, and information extraction such as syntactic parsing (e.g., Collins (2002)), semantic parsing (e.g., Moschitti (2004)), named entity recognition (e.g., Cumby and Roth (2003), and relation extraction (e.g., Zelenko et al.",
        "(2003)), the same is not true for discourse processing tasks.",
        "We hope that our use of structured features for information-status classification can promote their use in discourse processing.",
        "Recall that the flat features are computed using a linear kernel, while the structured features are computed using a tree kernel.",
        "If we want our learner to make use of more than one of these types of features, we need to employ a composite kernel to combine them.",
        "Specifically, we define and employ the following composite kernel:",
        "where Fi and F2 are the full set of features that represent the two entities under consideration, and Kiand K2 are the kernels we are combining.",

        "Hence, the Original Nis-sim results are not directly comparable with those of the other systems.",
        "We show them here just to provide another point of reference.",
        "Second, the results of the remaining three systems were obtained by aggregating the results of three binary SVM classifiers, as described earlier.",
        "Comparing Baseline and Baseline+Lexical, we see that augmenting Nissim's feature set with lexical features improves the F-measure scores on all three classes.",
        "In particular, the F-measure and recall formed rise considerably by 3.0 and 7.8, respectively.",
        "This provides indirect empirical support for our earlier hypothesis that themed class can benefit from the shallow world knowledge that these lexical features help to \"extract\" from annotated data.",
        "Comparing Baseline+Lexical and Baseline+Both, we see that the addition of structured features enables a further boost to performance: F-measure increases by 2.8-3.9 for the three classes.",
        "These results substantiate our hypothesis that employing a richer representation of syntactic context is beneficial to information-status classification.",
        "Comparing Baseline and Baseline+Both, we see that F-measure improves considerably by 5-6.9 for the three classes.",
        "Overall, these results provide suggestive evidence that both types of features are effective at improving an information-status classifier that employs Nissim's features.",
        "For further comparison, we show the classification accuracies of the four systems in the last row of Table 3.",
        "As we can see, adding lexical features to the baseline features improves accuracy by 2.2%, and adding structured features further improves accuracy by 5.9%.",
        "Our two types of features, when used in combination with Nissim's features, improve the baseline substantially by an accuracy of 8.1%.",
        "Note that while our results and Original Nissim's are not directly comparable, the two systems are consistent in terms of the relative performance for the three classes: best for old and worst for new.",
        "The poor performance for new is largely a consequence of its low recall, which can in turn be attributed to its lower representation in the dataset.",
        "Since many new instances are misclassified, a natural question is: are these instances misclassified as old or med?",
        "Similar questions can be raised for old and med, despite their substantially higher recall values than new.",

        "The rows and the columns correspond to the gold tags and the classifier tags, respectively.",
        "As we can see, these numbers seem to suggest the \"in-between\" nature of mediated entities: when an old or new entity is misclassified, it is typically misclassified as med (rows 1 and 3); however, when a med entity is misclassified, it is equally likely to be misclassified as old and new (row 2).",
        "These results are perhaps not surprisingly, since intuitively med entities bear some resemblance to both old and new entities.",
        "For instance, the similarity between med and old stems from the fact that different instances of the same entity (e.g., China) can receive one of these two labels, with the decision dependent on whether the entity was previously mentioned in the dialogue.",

        "They can also be categorized based on whether they are relational or not.",
        "Specifically, relational features capture the relationship between npj and np, whereas non-relational features capture the linguistic property of one of these NPs.",
        "We follow Soon et al.",
        "'s (2001) method for creating training instances.",
        "Specifically, we create (1) a positive instance for each anaphoric NP np and its closest antecedent npj; and (2) a negative instance for np paired with each of the intervening NPs, npj+i, npj+2, nps-i.",
        "The classification associated with a training instance is either positive or negative, depending on whether the two NPs are coreferent.",

        "After training, the classifier is used to identify an antecedent for an NP in a test text.",
        "Specifically, each NP, np, is compared in turn to each preceding NP, npj, from right to left, and selects npj as its antecedent if the pair is classified as coreferent.",
        "The process terminates as soon as an antecedent is found for np or the beginning of the text is reached.",
        "Despite its popularity, the MP model has two major weaknesses.",
        "First, since each candidate antecedent for an NP to be resolved (henceforth an active NP) is considered independently of the others, this model only determines how good a candidate antecedent is relative to the active NP, but not how good a candidate antecedent is relative to other candidates.",
        "So, it fails to answer the critical question of which candidate antecedent is most probable.",
        "Second, it has limitations in its expressiveness: the information extracted from the two NPs alone may not be sufficient for making a coreference decision.",
        "The cluster-ranking (CR) model, proposed by Rahman and Ng (2009), addresses the two weaknesses of the MP model by combining the strengths of the entity-mention model (e.g., Luo et al.",
        "(2004), Yang et al.",
        "(2008)) and the mention-ranking model (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2008)).",
        "Specifically, the CR model ranks the preceding clusters for an active NP so that the highest-ranked cluster is the one to which the active NP should be linked.",
        "Employing a ranker addresses the first weakness, as a ranker allows all candidates to be compared simultaneously.",
        "Considering preceding clusters rather than antecedents as candidates addresses the second weakness, as cluster-level features (i.e., features that are defined over any subset of NPs in a preceding cluster) can be employed.",
        "Since the CR model ranks preceding clusters, a training instance i(cj, NP) represents a preceding cluster Cj and an anaphoric NP np.",
        "Each instance consists of features that are computed based solely on np as well as cluster-level features, which describe the relationship between Cj and np.",
        "Motivated in part by Culotta et al.",
        "(2007), we create cluster-level features from the relational features in our feature set using four predicates: NONE, MOST-false, most-true, and all.",
        "Specifically, for each relational feature X, we first convert X into an equivalent set of binary-valued features if it is multivalued.",
        "Then, for each resulting binary-valued feature Xb, we create four binary-valued cluster-level features: (1) NONE-xb is true when Xb is false between np and each NP in Cj ; (2) most-false-x&is true when Xb is true between np and less than half (but at least one) of the NPs in Cj; (3) MOST-TRUE-Xb is true when Xb is true between np and at least half (but not all) of the NPs in Cj ; and (4) ALL-Xb is true when Xb is true between np and each NP in Cj.",
        "We train a cluster ranker to jointly learn anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution using SVM1ight's ranker-learning algorithm.",
        "Specifically, for each NP, np, we create a training instance between np and each preceding cluster Cj using the features described above.",
        "Since we are learning a joint model, we need to provide the ranker with the option to start a new cluster by creating an additional training instance that contains features that solely describes np.",
        "The rank value of a training instance i(Cj, np) created for np is the rank of Cj among the competing clusters.",
        "If NP is anaphoric, its rank is High if np belongs to Cj, and Low otherwise.",
        "If np is non-anaphoric, its rank is LOW unless it is the additional training instance described above, which has rank HIGH.",
        "After training, the cluster ranker processes the NPs in a test text in a left-to-right manner.",
        "For each active NP, np , we create test instances for it by pairing it with each of its preceding clusters.",
        "To allow for the possibility that np is non-anaphoric, we create an additional test instance that contains features that solely describe the active NP (similar to what we did in the training step above).",
        "All these test instances are then presented to the ranker.",
        "If the additional test instance is assigned the highest rank value by the ranker, then np is classified as non-anaphoric and will not be resolved.",
        "Otherwise, np is linked to the cluster that has the highest rank.",
        "The training/test split we use in the coreference experiments is the same as that in the informationstatus experiments.",
        "Specifically, we use the training set to train both the information-status classifier and our coreference models, apply the informationstatus classifier to each discourse entity in the test set, and have the coreference models resolve all and only those NPs that are labeled as old by the information-status classifier.",
        "Our decision to allow the coreference models to resolve only the old entities is motivated by the fact that med and new entities have not been previously introduced in the conversation and therefore do not have antecedents.",
        "The NPs used by the coreference models are the same as those accessible to the information-status classifier.",
        "We employ two scoring programs, B (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and ((3-CEAF (Luo, 2005), to score the output of a coreference model.",
        "Given a goldstandard (i.e., key) partition, KP, and a system-generated (i.e., response) partition, RP, B computes the recall and precision of each NP and averages these values at the end.",
        "Specifically, for each NP, npj, B first computes the number of NPs that appear in both KPj and RPj, the clusters containing npj in KP and RP, respectively, and then divides this number by |KPj | and |RPj | to obtain the recall and precision of npj, respectively.",
        "On the other hand, CEAF finds the best one-to-one alignment between the key clusters and the response clusters using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm (Kuhn, 1955), where the weight ofan edge connecting two clusters is equal to the number of NPs that appear in both clusters.",
        "Precision and recall are equal to the sum of the weights of the edges in the alignment divided by the total number of NPs in the response and the key, respectively.",
        "As our baseline, we employ our coreference models to generate NP partitions on the test documents without using any knowledge of information status.",
        "Results, reported in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-measure (F) using B and (/>3-CEAF, are shown in row 1 of Table 6.",
        "As we can see, the baseline achieves B F-measures of 69.2 (MP) and 74.5 (CR) and CEAF F-measures of 61.6 (MP) and 68.5 (CR).",
        "These results suggest that the CR model is stronger than the MP model, corroborating previous empirical findings (Rahman and Ng, 2009).",
        "Next, we examine the impact of learned knowledge of information status on the performance of a coreference model.",
        "Since knowledge of information status enables a coreference model to focus on resolving only the old entities, we hypothesize that the resulting model will have a higher precision than one that does not employ such knowledge.",
        "An equally important question is: will the F-measure of the resulting model improve?",
        "Since we are employing knowledge of information status in a pipeline coref-erence architecture where information-status classification is performed prior to coreference resolution, errors made by the (upstream) information-status classifier may propagate to the (downstream) coref-erence system.",
        "Given this observation, we hypothesize that the answer to the aforementioned question depends in part on the accuracy of informationstatus classification.",
        "In particular, the higher the accuracy of information-status classification is, the more likely the F-measure of the downstream coref-erence model will improve.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we conduct experiments where we employ the knowledge provided by the three information-status classifiers which, as discussed earlier, perform at varying levels of accuracy – the first one using only Nissim s features, the second one using both lexical and Nissim s features, and the last one using Nis-sim s features in combination with lexical and parse-based features – for our coreference models.",
        "Results of the coreference models employing knowledge provided by the three information-status classifiers are shown in rows 2-4 of Table 6.",
        "As expected, B precision increases in comparison to the baseline, regardless ofthe coreference model and the scoring program.",
        "In addition, employing knowledge of information status always improves coreference performance: F-measure scores increase by 1.01.1% (B) and 0.3-0.7% (CEAF) for the MP model, and by 0.9-1.1% (B) and 1.2-2.6% (CEAF) for the CR model.",
        "These results suggest that the three information-status classifiers have achieved the level of accuracy needed for the coreference models to improve.",
        "On the other hand, it is somewhat surprising that the three information-status classifiers have yielded coreference systems that perform at essentially the same level of performance.",
        "To understand why better information-status classification results do not necessarily yield better coreference performance, we take a closer look at the results of the coreference resolver employing Nissim s features (henceforth NISSIM) and the resolver employing our Nissim+Lexical+Parse features (henceforth FULL-FEATURE).",
        "Among the old entities that were correctly classified using our features and incorrectly classified by Nissim's features, we found that the precision of the FULL-FEATURE system suffered (since in many cases the corefer-ence models identified wrong antecedents for these old entities) whereas the NISSIM system remained unaffected (since the entities were misclassified and would not be resolved by the models).",
        "In addition, although many med and new entities were correctly classified using our features and incorrectly classified (as old) using Nissim's features, we found that in many cases no antecedents were identified for these misclassified entities and hence the precision of the NISSIM system was not adversely affected.",
        "Finally, we investigate whether our coreference system could be improved if it had access to perfect knowledge of information status (taken directly from the gold-standard annotations).",
        "This experiment will allow us to determine whether the usefulness of knowledge of information status for coref-erence resolution is limited by the accuracy in computing such knowledge.",
        "Results are shown in the last row of Table 6.",
        "As we can see, using perfect information-status knowledge yields a corefer-ence system that improves those that employs automatically acquired information-status knowledge by 1.8-4.1% (MP) and 2.7-3.1% (CR) in F-measure.",
        "This indicates that the accuracy in computing such knowledge does play a role in determining its usefulness for coreference resolution."
