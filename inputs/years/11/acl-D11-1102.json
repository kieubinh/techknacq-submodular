        "However, there are two aspects of this approach that need a deeper investigation: (i) Assessment of hypotheses generated for reranking at classification phase: baseline models generate a list of hypotheses and these are used for reranking without any assessment; (ii) Detection of cases where rerank-ing models provide a worst result: the best hypothesis provided by the reranking model is assumed to be always the best result.",
        "In some cases the reranking model provides an incorrect hypothesis while the baseline best hypothesis is correct, especially when baseline models are accurate.",
        "In this paper we propose solutions for these two aspects: (i) a semantic inconsistency metric to select possibly more correct n-best hypotheses, from a large set generated by an SLU basiline model.",
        "The selected hypotheses are reranked applying a state-of-the-art model based on Partial Tree Kernels, which encode SLU hypotheses in Support Vector Machines with complex structured features; (ii) finally, we apply a decision strategy, based on confidence values, to select the final hypothesis between the first ranked hypothesis provided by the baseline SLU model and the first ranked hypothesis provided by the re-ranker.",
        "We show the effectiveness of these solutions presenting comparative results obtained reranking hypotheses generated by a very accurate Conditional Random Field model.",
        "We evaluate our approach on the French MEDIA corpus.",
        "The results show significant improvements with respect to current state-of-the-art and previous re-ranking models."

        "Discriminative reranking is a widely used approach for several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: Syntactic Parsing (Collins, 2000), Named Entity Recognition (Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2001), Semantic Role Labelling (Moschitti et al., 2008), Machine Translation (Shen et al., 2004), Question Answering (Moschitti et al., 2007).",
        "Recently reranking approaches have been successfully applied also to Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) (Dinarelli et al., 2009b).",
        "Discriminative Reranking combines two models: a first SLU model is used to generate a ranked list of n-best hypotheses; a reranking model sorts the list based on a different score and the final result is the new top ranked hypothesis.",
        "The advantage of reranking approaches is in the possibility to learn directly complex dependencies in the output domain, as this is provided in the hypotheses generated by the baseline model.",
        "In previous approaches complex features are extracted from the hypotheses for both training and classification phase, but there are very few studies on approaches that can be applied to search in the hypotheses space generated by the baseline SLU model.",
        "Moreover, to keep overall computational cost reasonable, the size of the n-best list is typically small (few tens).",
        "This is a limitation since the larger is the hypotheses space generated, the more likely is to find a better hypothesis.",
        "On the other hand, re-ranking a large set of hypotheses is computationally expensive, thus a strategy to select the best hypotheses to be re-ranked would overcome this problem.",
        "Another aspect of reranking that deserves to be deeper studied is its applicability.",
        "Although a reranking model improves the baseline model in the overall performance, in some cases the reranked best hypotheses can contain more mistakes than the baseline best hypothesis.",
        "A strategy to decide when the reranking model should be applied and when the first hypothesis of the baseline model is more accurate would improve reranking performances.",
        "In this paper, we propose two new models for improving discriminative reranking: (a) a semantic inconsistency metric that can be applied to SLU hypotheses to select those that are more likely to be correct; (b) a model selection strategy based on the confidence scores provided by the baseline SLU model and the reranker.",
        "This provides a decision function that detects if the original top ranked hypothesis is more accurate than the reranked best hypothesis.",
        "Our re-ranking strategies turn out to be effective on very accurate baseline models based on state-of-the-art Conditinal Random Fields (CRF) implementation (Lavergne et al., 2010).",
        "We evaluate our approach on the well-known French MEDIA corpus for SLU (Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2006).",
        "The results show that our approach significantly improves both \"traditional\" reranking approaches and state-of-the-art SLU models.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce the SLU task.",
        "Section 3 describes our discriminative reranking framework for SLU, in particular the baseline model adopted, in subsection 3.1, and the reranking model, in subsection 3.2.",
        "Section 4 describes the two strategies proposed in this paper for SLU reranking, whereas the experiments to evaluate our approaches are described in Section 5.",
        "Finally, after a discussion in Section 6, in Section 7 we draw some conclusions."

        "In (Raymond and Riccardi, 2007), the SFST-based model is compared with Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Moreover, in (Hahn et al., 2008a) two more models are applied to SLU: a Maximum Entropy (EM) model and a model coming from the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) community (it is actually a log-linear combination of SMT models).",
        "Among these models, CRF has shown in general superior performances on sequence labeling tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), Grapheme-to-Phoneme transcription (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987) and also Spoken Language Understanding (Hahn et al., 2008a).",

        "Kernel methods theory (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004), allows us to substitute the inner product with a so-called kernel function, computing the same result: K(oi, o) = £i ■ x.",
        "The interesting aspect of using such formulation is the possibility to compare objects in arbitrarily complex feature spaces implicitly, i.e. without knowing the features to be used.",
        "Since in real world scenarios data cannot be classified using a simple linear classifier, kernel methods can be used to carry out learning in complex feature spaces.",
        "In this work we use the Partial Tree Kernel (PTK) (Moschitti, 2006).",
        "In order to give an effective representation to SLU hypotheses in SVM, since we are using PTK, we need to represent as trees SLU hypotheses like the one described in section 2.",
        "This problem is easily solved by transforming the hypotheses into trees like the one depicted in figure 1.",
        "Although there may be more formal solutions to represent semantic information of SLU hypotheses as trees, we would like to remark that the tree structure shown in figure 1 contains all the key information needed for our purposes: the first level of the tree represents the concept sequence annotated on surface form.",
        "The second level of the tree allow to implicitly represent the segmentation of each concept, while the third level, i.e. the leaves, are the input words.",
        "Moreover, from figure 1 we removed word categories associated to words in order to keep the figure readable.",
        "Word categories are provided together with the corpus as an application knowledge base.",
        "They comprise domain categories like city names, hotel names, street names etc., and some domain independent categories like numbers, dates, months etc.",

        "The CRF model used as baseline generates the n most likely conceptual annotations for each input sentence.",
        "These are ranked by the global conditional probability of the concept sequence, given the input word sequence of CRF.",
        "The «-best list produced by the baseline model is the list of candidate hypotheses H\\, i?2, • •, Hn used in the reranking step.",
        "The candidate hypotheses are organized into pairs, e.g. (H\\,H2) or (Hi,H%).",
        "We build training pairs such that a reranker can learn to select the best one between the two hypotheses in a pair, i.e.",
        "the more correct hypothesis with respect to a reference annotation and a given metric.",

        "This means that, if n hypotheses are generated for a sentence, 2 • n instances are generated from them.",
        "Note that by construction of pairs the model is symmetric, this provides a property that will be exploited at classification phase, as described in (Shen et al., 2003b).",
        "Hypotheses are then converted into trees like the one shown in figure 1.",
