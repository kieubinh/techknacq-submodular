        "Language models (LM) assign probabilities to sequences of words.",
        "They are widely used in many natural language processing applications.",
        "The probability of a sequence can be modeled as a product of local probabilities, as shown in (1), where wi is the ith word, and hi is the word history preceding wi.",
        "Therefore the task of language modeling reduces to estimating a set of conditional distributions {P(w|h)}.",
        "The n-gram LM is a dominant way to parametrize P (w | h), where it is assumed that w only depends on the previous n – 1 words.",
        "More complex models have also been proposed-MELM (Rosenfeld, 1996) and NNLM (Bengio et al., 2003) are two examples.",
        "Modeling P(w|h) can be seen as a multi-class classification problem.",
        "Given the history, we have to choose a word in the vocabulary, which can easily be a few hundred thousand words in size.",
        "For complex models such as MELM and NNLM, this poses a computational challenge for learning, because the resulting objective functions are expensive to normalize.",
        "In contrast, n-gram LMs do not suffer from this computational challenge.",
        "In the web era, language modelers have access to virtually unlimited amounts of data, while the computing power available to process this data is limited.",
        "Therefore, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of complex LMs, the n-gram is still the predominant approach for most real world applications.",
        "Subsampling is a simple solution to get around the constraint of computing resources.",
        "For the purpose of language modeling, it amounts to taking only part of the text corpus to train the LM.",
        "For complex models such as NNLM, it has been shown that subsampling can speed up training greatly, at the cost of some degradation in predictive performance (Schwenk, 2007), allowing for trade-off between computational cost and LM quality.",
        "Our contribution is a novel way to train complex LMs such as MELM and NNLM which allows much more aggressive subsampling without incurring as high a cost in predictive performance.",
        "The key to our approach is reducing the multi-class LM problem into a set of binary problems.",
        "Instead of training a class classifier, where is the size of the vocabulary, we train V binary classifiers, each one of which performs a one-against-all classification.",
        "The V trained binary probabilities are then renormalized to obtain a valid distribution over the V words.",
        "Subsampling here can be done in the negative examples.",
        "Since the majority of training examples are negative for each of the binary classiiers, we can achieve substantial computational saving by only keeping subsets of them.",
        "We will show that the binarized LM is as powerful as its multi-class counterpart, while being able to sustain much more aggressive subsampling.",
        "For certain types of LMs such as MELM, there are more benefits-the binarization leads to a set of completely independent classiiers to train, which allows easy parallelization and significantly lowers the memory requirement.",
        "Similar one-against-all approaches are often used in the machine learning community, especially by SVM (support vector machine) practitioners to solve multi-class problems (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004; Allwein et al., 2000).",
        "The goal of this paper is to show that a similar technique can also be used for language modeling and that it enables us to sub-sample data much more efficiently.",
        "We show that the proposed approach is useful when the dominant modeling constraint is computing power as opposed to training data.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we describe our binarization and subsam-pling techniques for language models with MELM and NNLM as two specific examples.",
        "Experimental results are presented in Section 3, followed by discussion in Section 4."

        "Suppose we have an LM that can be written in the form where aw(h; 6) is a parametrized history representation for word w.",
        "Given a training corpus of word history pairs with empirical distribution P(h, w), the regularized log likelihood of the training set can be written as where r(6) is the regularizing function over the parameters.",
        "Assuming that r(6) can be written as a sum over per-word regularizers, namely r(6) = w rw(6), we can take the gradient of the log likelihood w.r.t 6 to show that the regularized MLE for the LM satis-ies",
        "For each word w, we can deine a binary classiier that predicts whether the next word is w by",
        "The regularized training set log likelihood for all the binary classiiers is given by where Pb(w|h) = 1 – Pb(w|h) is the probability of w not occurring.",
        "Here we assume the same structure of the regularizer r(6).",
        "The regularized MLE for the binary classiiers satisies",
        "Notice the right hand sides of (4) and (7) are the same.",
        "Thus, taking P'(w|h) = Pb(w|h) from ML trained binary classiiers gives an LM that meets the MLE constraints for language models.",
        "Therefore, if w Pb(w|h) = 1, ML training for the language model is equivalent to ML training of the binary classiiers and using the probabilities given by the classiiers as our LM probabilities.",
        "Note that in practice, the probabilities given by the binary classiiers are not guaranteed to sum up to one.",
        "For tasks such as measuring perplexity, these probabilities have to be normalized explicitly.",
        "Our hope is that for large enough data sets and rich enough history representation aw(h; 6), we will get J2w Pb(w|h) « 1 so that renormalizing the classi-iers to get will not change the MLE constraint too much.",
        "We note that iterative estimation of the LM shown in (2) in general requires enumerating over the T training cases in the training set and computing the denominator of (2) for each case at a cost of O(V).",
        "Thus, each iteration of training takes O( VT) in general.",
        "The complexity of estimating each of the V binary classifiers is O(T) per iteration, also giving O(VT) per iteration in total.",
        "However, as mentioned earlier, we are able to maximally subsample negative examples for each classiier.",
        "Thus the classiier for w is trained using the C(w) positive examples and a proportion a of the T – C(w) negative examples.",
        "The total number of training examples for all V classiiers is then (1 - a)T + aVT.",
        "For large V, we choose a >> j+çy so that this is approximately aVT.",
        "Thus, our complexity for estimating all V classiiers is O(aVT).",
        "The resulting training set for each binary classifier is a stratified sample (Neyman, 1934), and our estimate needs to be calibrated to account for this.",
        "Since the training set subsamples negative examples by a, the resulting classiier will have a likelihood ratio that is overestimated by a factor of ^.",
        "This can be corrected by simply adding log a to the bias (unigram) weight of the classiier.",
        "MELM is an effective alternative to the standard n-gram LM.",
        "It provides a flexible framework to incorporate different knowledge sources in the form of feature constraints.",
        "Speciically, MELM takes the form of (2), for word w following history h, we have the following probability deinition,",
        "fi is the ith feature function defined over the word-history pair, 6i is the feature weight associated with fi.",
        "By defining general features, we have a natural framework to go beyond n-grams and capture more complex dependencies that exist in language.",
        "Previous research has shown the benefit of including various kinds of syntactic and semantic information into the LM (Khudanpur and Wu, 2000).",
        "However, despite providing a promising avenue for language modeling, MELM are computationally expensive to estimate.",
        "The bottleneck lies in the denominator of(10).",
        "To estimate 6is, gradient based methods can be used.",
        "The derivative of the likelihood function L w.r.t 6i has a simple form, namely where k is the index of word-history pair in the training corpus.",
        "The irst term in the derivative is the observed feature count in the training corpus, the second term is the expected feature count according to the model.",
        "In order to obtain P(w'|h) in the second term, we need to compute the normalizer, which involves a very expensive summation over the entire vocabulary.",
        "As described earlier, the complexity for each iteration of training is at O(VT), where T is the size of training corpus.",
        "For feature sets that can be expressed hierarchically, for example n-gram feature set, where higher order n-grams imply lower order n-grams, Wu and Khudanpur (2000) exploit the structure of the normalizer, and precompute components that can be shared by different histories.",
        "For arbitrary feature sets, however, it may not be possible to establish the required hierarchical relations and the normalizer still needs to be computed explicitly.",
        "Goodman (2001) changes the original LM into a class-based LM, where each one of the two-step predictions only involves a much smaller summation in the normalizer.",
        "In addition, MELM estimation can be parallelized, with expected count computation done separately for different parts of the training data and merged together at the end of each iteration.",
        "For models with massive parametrizations, this merge step can be expensive due to communication costs.",
        "Obviously, a different way to expedite MELM training is to simply train on less data.",
        "We propose a way to do this without incurring a significant loss of modeling power, by reframing the problem in terms of binary classification.",
        "As mentioned above, we build V binary classifiers of the form in (5) to model the distribution over the V words.",
        "The binary clas-siiers use the same features as the MELM of (10), and are given by:",
        "expE i i fi(h,w)",
        "We assume the features are partitioned over the vocabulary, so that each feature fi has an associated w such that fi (h, w') = 0 for all w' = w. Therefore, the corresponding 6i affects only the binary classiier for w. This gives an important advantage in terms of parallelization-we have a set of binary classiiers with no feature sharing, and can be trained separately on different machines.",
        "The parallelized computations are completely independent and do not require the tedious communication between machines.",
        "Memory-wise, since the computations are independent, each word trainer only have to store features that are associated with the word, so the memory requirement for each individual worker is signiicantly reduced.",
        "Neural Network Language Models (NNLM) have gained a lot of interest since their introduction (Ben-gio et al., 2003).",
        "While in standard language modeling, words are treated as discrete symbols, NNLM map them into a continuous space and learn their representations automatically.",
        "It is often believed that NNLM can generalize better to sequences that are not seen in the training data.",
        "However, despite having been shown to outperform standard n-gram LM (Schwenk, 2007), NNLM are computationally expensive to train.",
        "Figure 1 shows the standard feed-forward NNLM architecture.",
        "Starting from the left part of the figure, each word of the n - 1 words history is mapped to a continuous vector and concatenated.",
        "Through a nonlinear hidden layer, the neural network constructs a multinomial distribution at the output layer.",
        "Denoting the concatenated d-dimensional word representations r, we have the following probability definition:",
        "where h denotes the hidden layer size, b and c are the bias vectors for the output nodes and hidden nodes respectively.",
        "Note that NNLM also has the form of (2).",
        "Stochastic gradient descent is often used to maximize the training data likelihood under such a model.",
        "The gradient can be computed using the back-propagation method.",
        "To analyze the complexity, computing an n-gram conditional probability requires approximately",
        "operations, where V is the size of the vocabulary.",
        "The four terms in the complexity correspond to computing the hidden layer, applying the nonlin-earity, computing the output layer and normalization, respectively.",
        "The error propagation stage can be analyzed similarly and takes about the same number of operations.",
        "For typical values as used in our experiments, namely n = 3, d = 50, h = 200,",
        "V = 10000, the majority of the complexity per iteration comes from the term hV.",
        "For large scale tasks, it may be impractical to train an NNLM.",
        "A lot of previous research has focused on speeding up NNLM training.",
        "It usually aims at removing the computational dependency on V. Schwenk (2007) used a short list of frequent words such that a large number of out-of-list words are taken care of by a back-off LM.",
        "To reduce the gradient computation introduced by the normalizer, Bengio and Senecal (2008) proposed a different kind of importance sampling technique.",
        "A recent work (Mikolov et al., 2011) applied Goodman's class MELM trick (2001) to NNLM, in order to avoid the gigantic normalization.",
        "A similar technique has been introduced even earlier which took the idea of factorizing output layer to the extreme (Morin, 2005) by replacing the V-way prediction by a tree-style hierarchical prediction.",
        "The authors show a theoretical complexity reduction from O(V) to (log V), but the technique requires a careful clustering which may not be easily attainable in practice.",
        "Subsampling has also been proposed to accelerate NNLM training (Schwenk, 2007).",
        "The idea is to select random subsets of the training data in each epoch of stochastic gradient descent.",
        "After some epochs, it is very likely that all of the training examples have been seen by the model.",
        "We will show that our binary classiier representation leads to a more robust and promising subsampling strategy.",
        "As with MELM, we notice that the parameters of (14) can be interpreted as also deining a set of",
        "V per-word binary classiiers but with a common hidden layer representation.",
        "As in MELM, we will train the classiiers, and renor-malize them to obtain an NNLM over the V words.",
        "In order to train the classiiers, we need to compute all V output nodes and propagate the errors back.",
        "Since the hidden layer is shared, the classiiers are not independent, and the computations can not be easily parallelized to multiple machines.",
        "However, subsampling can be done differently for each classiier.",
        "Each training instance serves as a positive example for one classiier and as a negative example for only a fraction a of the others.",
        "The rest of the nodes are not computed and do not produce error signal for the hidden representation.",
        "We calibrate the classiiers after subsampled training as described above for MELM.",
        "It is straightforward to show that the dominating term Vh in the complexity is reduced to aVh.",
        "We want to point out that compared with MELM, sub-sampling the negatives here does not always reduce the complexity proportionally.",
        "In cases where the vocabulary is very small, as shown in (15), computing the hidden layer can no longer be ignored.",
        "Nonetheless, real world applications such as speech recognition, usually involves a vocabulary ofconsid-erable size, therefore, subsampling in the binary setting can still achieve substantial speedup for NNLM."

        "For the standard models, the amount of existent patterns fed into training heavily depends on the sub-sampling rate a.",
        "For a small a, the models will inevitably lose some training patterns given any reasonable number of epochs of training.",
        "Taking variable random subsets in each epoch can alleviate this problem to some extent, but still can not solve the fundamental problem.",
        "In the binary setting, we are able to do subsampling differently.",
        "While the complexity remains the same without subsampling, the majority of the complexity comes from processing negatives examples for each binary classifier.",
        "Therefore, we can achieve the same level of speedup as standard subsampling by only subsampling negative examples, and most importantly, it allows us to keep all the existent patterns(positive examples) in the training data.",
        "Of course, negative examples are important and even in the binary case, we benefit from including more of them, but since we have so many of them, they might not be as critical as positive examples in determining the distribution.",
        "A similar conclusion can be drawn from Google's work on large LMs (Brants et al., 2007).",
        "Not having to properly smooth the LM, they are still able to benefit from large volumes of web text as training data.",
        "It is probably more important to have a high n-gram coverage than having a precise distribution.",
        "The explanation here might lead us to wonder whether for the multi-class problem, subsampling the terms in the normalizer would achieve the same results.",
        "More specifically, instead of summing over all words in the vocabulary, we may choose to only consider a of them.",
        "In fact, the short-list approach in (Schwenk, 2007) and the adaptive importance sampling in (Bengio and Senecal, 2008) have exactly this intuition.",
        "However, in the multi-class setup, subsampling like this has to be very careful.",
        "We have to either have a good estimate of how much probability mass we've thrown away, as in the shortlist approach, or have a good estimate of the entire normalizer, as in the importance sampling approach.",
        "It is very unlikely that an arbitrary random subsam-pling will not harm the model.",
        "Fortunately, in the binary case, the effect of random subsampling is much easier to analyze.",
        "We know exactly how much negative examples we've discarded, and they can be compensated easily in the end.",
        "It is worth pointing out that the proposed technique is not restricted to MELM and NNLM.",
        "We have done experiments to binarize the class trick sometimes used for language modeling (Goodman, 2001; Mikolov et al., 2011), and it also proves to be useful.",
        "We plan to report these results in the future.",
        "More generally, for many large-scale multi-class problems, binarization and subsampling can be an effective combination to consider."

        "We propose efficient subsampling techniques for training large multi-class classifiers such as maximum entropy language models and neural network language models.",
        "The main idea is to replace a multi-way decision by a set of binary decisions.",
        "Since most of the training instances in the binary setting are negatives examples, we can achieve substantial speedup by subsampling only the negatives.",
        "We show by extensive experiments that this is more robust than subsampling subsets of training data for the original multi-class classifier.",
        "The proposed method can be very useful for building large language models and solving more general multi-class problems."
