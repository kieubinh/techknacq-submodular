        "The function of context-sensitive text correction is to identify word-choice errors in text (Bergsma et al., 2009).",
        "It can be viewed as a lexical disambiguation task (Lapata and Keller, 2005), where a system selects from a predefined confusion word set, such as {affect, effect} or {complement, compliment}, and provides the most appropriate word choice given the context.",
        "Typically, one determines if a word has been used correctly based on lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the context of the word.",
        "One of the top performing models of spelling correction (Bergsma et al., 2010) is based on web-scale n-gram counts, which reflect both syntax and meaning.",
        "However, even with a large-scale n-gram corpus, data sparsity can hurt performance in two ways.",
        "* This work was done when the first author was an intern for Educational Testing Service.",
        "First, n-gram based methods require exact word and order matches.",
        "If there is a low frequency word in the context, such as a person's name, there will be little, if any, evidence in the n-gram data to support the usage.",
        "Second, if the target confusable word is rare, there will not be enough n-gram support or training data to render a confident decision.",
        "Because of the data sparsity problem, language modeling is not always sufficient to capture the meaning of the sentence and the correct usage of the word.",
        "Take a sentence from The New York Times (NYT) for example: \"'This fellow's won a war,' the dean of the capital's press corps, David Broder, announced on 'Meet the Press' after complimenting the president on the 'great sense of authority and command' he exhibited in a flight suit.\"",
        "Unfortunately, neither the phrase \"complementing the president\" nor \"complimenting the president\" exists in the web-scale Google N-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "The n-gram models decide solely based on the frequency of the bi-grams \"after com-ple(i)menting\" and \"comple(i)menting the\", which are common usages for both words.",
        "The real question is whether we are more likely to \"compliment\" or \"complement\" a person, the \"president\".",
        "Several clues could help us answer that question.",
        "A dependency parser can identify the word \"president\" as the subject of \"compliment\" or \"complement\" which also may be the case in some of the training data.",
        "Lexical co-occurrence (Edmonds, 1997) and semantic word relatedness measurements, such as Random Indexing (Sahlgren, 2006), could provide evidence that \"compliment\" is more likely to co-occur with \"president\" than \"complement\".",
        "Furthermore, some important clues can be quite distant from the target word, e.g. outside the 9-word context window Bergsma et al.",

        "The dependency parser finds the object of \"complement\" is \"rating\", which is outside the 9-word window.",

        "A variety of approaches have been proposed for context-sensitive spelling correction ranging from semantic methods to machine learning classifiers to large-scale n-gram models.",
        "Some semantics-based systems have been developed based on an intuitive assumption that the intended word is more likely to be semantically coherent with the context than is a spelling error.",
        "Jones and Martin (1997) made use of the semantic similarity produced by Latent Semantic Analysis.",
        "Bu-danitsky and Hirst (2001) investigated the effectiveness of predicting words based on different semantic similarity/distance measures in WordNet.",
        "Both systems report performance that is lower than systems developed more recently.",
        "A variety of machine-learning methods have been proposed in spelling correction and preposition and article error correction fields, such as Bayesian classifiers (Golding, 1995; Golding and Roth, 1996), Winnow-based learning (Golding and Roth, 1999), decision lists (Golding, 1995), transformation-based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), augmented mixture models (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002) and maximum entropy classifiers (Izumi et al., 2003; and Chodorow, 2008; Felice and Pulman, 2008).",
        "Despite their differences, these approaches mainly use contextual features to capture the lexical, semantic and/or syntactic environment of the target word.",
        "The use of distributional similarity measures for spelling correction has been previously explored in (Mohammad and Hist, 2006).",
        "In our work, distributional similarity is not the primary contribution but we show the impact it can have when used in conjunction with a large scale n-gram model and with parse features, which allows the system to select words outside the local window for distributional similarity.",
        "In the prior work, the words for distributional similarity are constrained to the local window, and positional information of the words is not encoded.",
        "Recent work (Carlson and Fette, 2007; Gamon et al., 2008; Bergsma et al., 2009) has demonstrated that large-scale language modeling is extremely helpful for contextual spelling correction and other lexical disambiguation tasks.",
        "These systems make the word choice depending on how frequently each candidate word has been seen in the given context in web-scale data.",
        "As n-gram data has become more readily available, such as the Google N-gram Corpus, the likelihood of a word being used in a certain context can be better estimated.",
        "Bergsma et al.",
        "(2009; 2010) presented a series of simple but powerful models which relied heavily on web-scale n-gram counts.",
        "From the Google Web N-gram Corpus, they retrieve counts of n-grams of different sizes (2-5) and positions that span the target word w0 within a window of 9 words.",
        "For example, for the following sentence: \"The system tried to decide {among, between} the two confusable words.",
        "\", the method would extract the five 5-gram patterns, shown below in Figure 2, where w0 can be either word in the confusion set {among, between} in this particular example.",
        "Similarly, there are four 4-grams, three 3-grams, and two 2-grams, in total, 14 n-grams for each of the words in the confusion set.",

        "As we mentioned in Section 2, NG features include log-counts of 3-to-5-gram patterns for each candidate word with the given context.",
        "LEX features can be broken down into three sub-categories: 1) bag-of-words (words at all positions in a 9-word window around the target word), 2) indicators for the words preceding or following the target word, and 3) indicators for all n-grams and their positions.",

        "The benefit of introducing dependency parse features is that 1) parse features capture contextual information in a larger context window; 2) parse features specify which words in the context are salient to the usage of the target word while purely lexically based approaches treat all words in the context equally.",

        "The second comparison is to see how parse features interact with n-gram count features in a supervised classifier.",
        "The best system from (Bergsma et al., 2010) is listed in the table as \"NG+LEX\".",
        "As shown in Table 3, the parse features proved to be beneficial when augmenting this baseline, except for the decrease in accuracy on adverse, averse by only 2 cases out of 368, and among, between by 2 cases out of 10227.",
        "For all other confusion sets, parse features decrease the error rate by as much as 2.74% (absolute) and as much as 38.5% (relative).",
        "Improvements are statistically significant on all confusion sets together, although for each separate set, improvements are significant on only 5 sets, in part due to an insufficient number of test cases.",
        "The reason that parse features are occasionally not helpful is because they sometimes include an uncommon word in dependencies, which happens to appear once with the wrong word but not with the correct word in the training data; or they sometimes include too common words, which bias the classifier in favor of the more frequent word in the confusion set.",
        "We also noticed that lexical features are not always helpful when added to n-gram count features, even for in-domain applications (i.e., with training data and test data coming from the same domain or corpus), as marked by underlines.",
        "However, lexical and parse features together show more significant and constant improvement over n-gram count-based models, as marked by a.",
        "Of the six systems, every system that uses parse features gets the example correct in Section 1, \"complementing the president\"; LEX by itself also gets the example correct, but NG and NG+LEX fail.",
        "In summary, our system NG+LEX+PAR outperforms the state-of-the-art system NG+LEX.",
        "It reduces the error rate by 12.4% across our 9 confusion sets and by 8.4% across Bergsma et al.",
        "'s 5 confusion sets.",
        "Both improvements are significant (p < 0.05) by the McNemar test.",
        "In addition, while NG+LEX is not always better than NG, NG+LEX+PAR is consistently better than NG.",
        "The LIBLINEAR tool does not provide probability estimates for SVM models but Logistic Regression can.",
        "In this set of experiments, we train a Logistic Regression model with NG+LEX+PAR features and empirically set the confidence threshold at 0.6, as described in Section 4, based on the performance on two word pairs.",
        "In the combined system, when the Logistic Regression model estimates a probability higher than the threshold we output its results, otherwise we output the result of the system based on word co-occurrence.",
        "Surprisingly, although Random Indexing takes into account more information than first-order word co-occurrence, it lowered overall performance substantially.",
        "Thus in Table 4, we only present results of using first-order word co-occurrence rather than Random Indexing.",
        "For all 12 confusion sets, distributional word co-occurrence information improves 9 sets and hurts 5 sets.",
        "Overall, it reduces the error rate slightly by 0.2% for our 9 sets and 1.5% for Bergsma et al.",
        "'s sets.",
        "We believe there are two reasons why Random Indexing fared worse than first-order word co-occurrence: 1) Random Indexing considers cooccurrence on a document level, while our firstorder word co-occurrence is limited to a 5-word window context.",
        "The latter is more suitable to context-sensitive spelling correction.",
        "2) The model for Random Indexing is trained on a relatively small size corpus compared to the web-scale data we used to get n-gram count features for the classifier and thus is not able to introduce much new evidence besides the information carried by NG+LEX+PAR features.",
        "Reason 2) also suggests why first-order cooccurrence helps on some occasions while not on other occasions.",
        "Its impact is limited because the word co-occurrence information overlaps with some of the PAR feature values as mentioned earlier.",
        "It improves some cases because it provides some new evidence from web-scale data to the system based on NG+LEX+PAR features.",
        "It introduces new errors because it simply favors the word that co-occurred more often regardless of other factors.",
        "Its impact is also limited because it is only considered when classifiers with NG+LEX+PAR features are not confident.",
