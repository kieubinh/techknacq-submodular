        "The rapid growth of social media in recent years, exemplified by Facebook and Twitter, has led to a massive volume of user-generated informal text.",
        "This in turn has sparked a great deal of research interest in aspects of social media, including automatically identifying latent demographic features of online users.",
        "Many latent features have been explored, but gender and age have generated great interest (Schler et al., 2006; Burger and Henderson, 2006; Argamon et al., 2007; Mukherjee and Liu, 2010; Rao et al., 2010).",
        "Accurate prediction of these features would be useful for marketing and personalization concerns, as well as for legal investigation.",
        "In this work, we investigate the development of highperformance classifiers for identifying the gender of Twitter users.",
        "We cast gender identification as the obvious binary classification problem, and explore the use of a number of text-based features.",
        "In Section 2, we describe our Twitter corpus, and our methods for labeling a large subset of this data for gender.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss the features that are used in our classifiers.",
        "We describe our Experiments in Section 4, including our exploration of several different classifier types.",
        "In Section 5 we present and analyze performance results, and discuss some directions for acquiring additional data by simple self-training techniques.",
        "Finally in Section 6 we summarize our findings, and describe extensions to the work that we are currently exploring.",
        "Twitter is a social networking and micro-blogging platform whose users publish short messages or tweets.",
        "In late 2010, it was estimated that Twitter had 175 million registered users worldwide, producing 65 million tweets per day (Miller, 2010).",
        "Twitter is an attractive venue for research into social media because of its large volume, diverse and multilingual population, and the generous nature of its Terms of Service.",
        "This has led many researchers to build corpora of Twitter data (Petrovic et al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2010).",
        "In April 2009, we began sampling data from Twitter using their API at a rate of approximately 400,000 tweets per day.",
        "This represented approximately 2% of Twitter's daily volume at the time, but this fraction has steadily decreased to less than 1% by 2011.",
        "This decrease is because we sample roughly the same number of tweets every day while Twitter's overall volume has increased markedly.",
        "Our corpus thus far contains approximately 213 million tweets from 18.5 million users, in many different languages.",
        "In addition to the tweets that they produce, each Twitter user has a profile with the following free-text fields:",
        "• Screen name (e.g., jsmith92, kingofpittsburgh)",
        "• Full name (e.g., John Smith, King of Pittsburgh)",
        "• Description (e.g., Retired accountant and grandfather)",
        "All of these except screen name are completely optional, and all may be changed at any time.",
        "Note that none",
        "Training Development of the demographic attributes we might be interested in are present, such as gender or age.",
        "Thus, the existing profile elements are not directly useful when we wish to apply supervised learning approaches to classify tweets for these target attributes.",
        "Other researchers have solved this problem by using labor-intensive methods.",
        "For example, Rao et al.",
        "(2010) use a focused search methodology followed by manual annotation to produce a dataset of 500 English users labeled with gender.",
        "It is infeasible to build a large multilingual dataset in this way, however.",
        "Previous research into gender variation in online discourse (Herring et al., 2004; Huffaker, 2004) has found it convenient to examine blogs, in part because blog sites often have rich profile pages, with explicit entries for gender and other attributes of interest.",
        "Many Twitter users use the URL field in their profile to link to another facet of their online presence.",
        "A significant number of users link to blogging websites, and many of these have well-structured profile pages indicating our target attributes.",
        "In many cases, these are not free text fields.",
        "Users on these sites must select gender and other attributes from dropdown menus in order to populate their profile information.",
        "Accordingly, we automatically followed the Twitter URL links to several of the most represented blog sites in our dataset, and sampled the corresponding profiles.",
        "By attributing this blogger profile information to the associated Twitter account, we created a corpus of approximately 184,000 Twitter users labeled with gender.",
        "We partitioned our dataset by user into three distinct subsets, training, development, and test, with sizes as indicated in Figure 1.",
        "That is, all the tweets from each user are in a single one of the three subsets.",
        "This is the corpus we use in the remainder of this paper.",
        "This method of gleaning supervised labels for our Twitter data is only useful if the blog profiles are in turn accurate.",
        "We conducted a small-scale quality assurance study of these labels.",
        "We randomly selected 1000 Twitter users from our training set and manually examined the description field for obvious indicators of gender, e.g., mother to 3 boys or just a dude.",
        "Only 150 descriptions (15% of the sample) had such an explicit gender cue.",
        "136 of these also had a blog profile with the gender selected, and in all of these the gender cue from the user's Twitter description agreed with the corresponding blog profile.",
        "This may only indicate that people who misrepresent their gender are simply consistent across different aspects of their online presence.",
        "However, the effort involved in maintaining this deception in two different places suggests that the blog labels on the Twitter data are largely reliable.",
        "Initial analysis using the blog-derived labels showed that our corpus is composed of 55% females and 45% males.",
        "This is consistent with the results of an earlier study which used name/gender correlations to estimate that Twitter is 55% female (Heil and Piskorski, 2009).",
        "Figure 2 shows several statistics broken down by gender, including the Twitter users who did not indicate their gender on their blog profile.",
        "In our dataset females tweet at a higher rate than males and in general users who provide their gender on their blog profile produce more tweets than users who do not.",
        "Additionally, of the 150 users who provided a gender cue in their Twitter user description, 105 were female (70%).",
        "Thus, females appear more likely to provide explicit indicators about their gender in our corpus.",
        "The average number of tweets per user is 22 and is fairly consistent across our traing/dev/test splits.",
        "There is wide variance, however, with some users represented by only a single tweet, while the most prolific user in our sample has nearly 4000 tweets.",
        "It is worth noting that many Twitter users do not tweet in English.",
        "Table 3 presents an estimated breakdown of language use in our dataset.",
        "We ran automatic language ID on the concatenated tweet texts of each user in the training set.",
        "The strong preponderance of English in our dataset departs somewhat from recent studies of Twitter language use (Wauters, 2010).",
        "This is likely due in part to sampling methodology differences between the two studies.",
        "The subset of Twitter users who also use a blog site may be different from the Twitter population as a whole, and may also be different from the users tweeting during the three days of Wauters's study.",
        "There are also possible longitudinal differences: English was the dominant language on Twitter when the online service began in 2006, and this was still the case when we began sampling tweets in 2009, but the proportion of English tweets had steadily dropped to about 50% in late 2010.",
        "Note that we do not use any explicit encoding of language information in any of the experiments described below.",
        "Our Twitter-blog dataset may not be entirely representative of the Twitter population at general, but this has at least one advantage.",
        "As with any part of the Internet, spam is endemic to Twitter.",
        "However by sampling only Twitter users with blogs we have largely filtered out spammers from our dataset.",
        "Informal inspection of a few thousand tweets revealed a negligible number of commercial tweets."

        "The tweet texts, however, present more ambiguity for the learners.",
        "The difference between the development and test set scores suggest that only minimal hill-climbing occurred during our development.",
        "We have performed experiments to better understand how performance scales with training data size.",
        "Figure 8 shows how performance increases for both the all-fields and tweet-texts-only classifiers as we train on more users, with little indication of leveling off.",
        "As discussed in Section 2, there is wide variance in the number of tweets available from different users.",
        "In Figure 9 we show how the tweet text classifier's accuracy increases as the number of tweets from the user increases.",
        "Each point is the average classifier accuracy for the user cohort with exactly that many tweets in our dev set.",
        "Performance increases given more tweets, although the averages get noisy for the larger tweet sets, due to successively smaller cohort sizes.",
        "Some of the most informative features from tweet texts are shown in Figure 7, ordered by mutual information with gender.",
        "There are far more of these strong features for the female category than the male: only five of the top 1000 features are associated more strongly with males, i.e. they have lower P(Female|f eature) than the prior, P (Female) = 0.55.",
        "Some of these features are content-based (hair, and several fragments of love), while others are stylistic (ooo, several emoticons).",
        "The presence of http as a strong male feature might be taken to indicate that men include links in their tweet texts far more often than women, but a cursory examination seems to show instead that women are simply more likely to include \"bare\" links, e.g., emnlp.org vs. http://emnlp.org.",
        "Figure 10 shows the results of the human performance benchmarks using Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "The raw per-response performance is 60.4%, only moderately better than the all-female baseline.",
        "When averaged across workers, however, this improves substantially, to 68.7.",
        "This would seem to indicate that there were a few poor workers who did many annotations, and in fact when we limit the performance average to those workers who produced 100 or more responses, we do see a degradation to 62.2.",
        "The problem of poor quality workers is endemic to anonymous crowd sourcing platforms like Mechanical Turk.",
        "A common way to combat this is to use redundancy, with a simple majority vote to choose among multiple responses for each item.",
        "This allows us to treat the five workers who responded to each item as an ensemble.",
        "As Figure 10 indicates, this provides some improvement over the raw result (65.7% vs. 60.4).",
        "A different approach, first proposed by Dawid and Skene (1979), is to use an expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the quality of each source of labels, as well as estimate the posterior for each item.",
        "In this case, the first is an AMT worker's capability and the second is the distribution of gender labels for each Twitter user.",
        "The Dawid and Skene approach has previously been applied to Mechanical Turk responses (Ipeirotis et al., 2010).",
        "We used their implementation on our AMT results but with only moderate improvement over the simple majority ensemble (67.3% vs. 65.7).",
        "All of the aggregate human results are substantially below the all-tweet-texts classifier score, suggesting that this is a difficult task for people to perform.",
        "As Figure 11 indicates, most workers perform below 80% accuracy, and less than 5% of the prolific workers outperform the automatic classifier.",
        "These high-scoring workers may indeed be good at the task, or they may have simply been assigned a less-difficult subset of the data.",
        "Figure 12 illustrates this by showing aligned worker performance and classifier performance on the precise set of items that each worker performed on.",
        "Here we see that, with few exceptions, the automatic classifier performs as well or better than the AMT workers on their subset.",
        "Finally, as described in Section 4.3, we performed some initial experiments on a self-training approach to labeling more data.",
        "As described above the all-fields classifier achieves an accuracy of 92% on the development set when trained on the full training set.",
        "Training on half of the training data results in a drop to 91.1%.",
        "The second classifier trained on the full training set, but with some label errors introduced by the first, had further degraded performance of 90.9%.",
        "Apparently the errorful labels introduced by the simplistic self-training procedure overwhelmed any new information that might have been gained from the additional data.",

        "In this paper, we have presented several configurations of a language-independent classifier for predicting the gender of Twitter users.",
        "The large dataset used for construction and evaluation of these classifiers was drawn from Twitter users who also completed blog profile pages.",
        "These classifiers were tested on the largest set of gender-tagged tweets to date that we are aware of.",
        "The best classifier performed at 92% accuracy, and the classifier relying only on tweet texts performed at 76% accuracy.",
        "Human performance was assessed on this latter condition, and only 5% of 130 humans performed 100 or more classifications with higher accuracy than this machine.",
        "In future work, we will explore how well such models carry over to gender identification in other informal online genres such as chat and forum comments.",
        "Furthermore, we have been able to assign demographic features beside gender, including age and location, to our Twitter dataset.",
        "We have begun to build classifiers for these features as well."
