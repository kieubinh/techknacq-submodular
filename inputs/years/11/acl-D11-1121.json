        "Online investment message boards such as Yahoo!",
        "Finance and Raging Bull allow investors to share trading ideas, advice and opinions on public companies.",
        "Recently, stock microblogging services such as StockTwits (which started as a filtering service over the Twitter platform) have become very popular.",
        "These forums are considered by many investors as highly valuable sources for making their trading decisions.",
        "This work aims to mine useful investment information from messages published in stock mi-croblogs.",
        "We shall henceforth refer to these messages as stock tweets.",
        "Ultimately, we would like to transform those tweets into buy and sell decisions.",
        "Given a set of stock-related messages, this process typically comprises two steps:",
        "1.",
        "Classify each message as \"bullish\" (having a positive outlook on the stock), \"bearish\" (having a negative outlook on the stock), or neutral.",
        "2.",
        "Make trading decisions based on these message classifications.",
        "Previous work on stock investment forums and microblogs usually regarded the first step (message classification) as a sentiment analysis problem, and aligned bullish with positive sentiment and bearish with negative sentiment.",
        "Messages were classified by matching positive and negative terms from sentiment lexicons, learning from a hand-labeled set of messages, or some combination of the two (Das and Chen, 2007; Antweiler and Frank, 2004; Chua et al., 2009; Zhang and Skiena, 2010; Sprenger and Welpe, 2010).",
        "Trading decisions were made by aggregating the sentiment for a given stock over all the tweets, and picking stocks with strongest sentiment signal (buying the most bullish stocks and short-selling the most bearish ones).",
        "Sentiment aggregation reflects the opinion of the investors community as a whole, but overlooks the variability in user expertise.",
        "Clearly, not all investors are born equal, and if we could tell experts from nonexperts, we would reduce the noise in these forums and obtain high-quality signals to follow.",
        "This paper presents a framework for identifying experts in stock microblogs by monitoring their performance in a training period.",
        "We show that following the experts results in more precise predictions.",
        "Based on the expert identification framework, we experiment with different methods for deriving predictions from stock tweets.",
        "While previous work largely aligned bullishness with message sentiment, our in-depth content analysis of stock tweets (to be presented in section 2.2) suggests that this view is too simplistic.",
        "To start with, one important difference between bullishness/bearishness and positive/negative sentiment is that while the former represents belief about the future, the latter may also refer to the past or present.",
        "For example, a user reporting on making profit from a buying stock yesterday and selling it today is clearly positive about the stock, but does not express any prediction about its future performance.",
        "Furthermore, messages that do refer to the future differ considerably in their significance.",
        "A tweet reporting on buying a stock by the user conveys a much stronger bullishness signal than a tweet that merely expresses an opinion.",
        "Overall, it would seem that judging bullishness is far more elusive than judging sentiment.",
        "We therefore propose and compare two alternative approaches that sidestep the complexities of assessing tweets bullishness.",
        "These two approaches can be viewed as representing two extremes.",
        "The first approach restricts our attention to the most explicit signals of bullishness and bearishness, namely, tweets that report actual buy and sell transactions performed by the user.",
        "In the second approach we learn directly the relation between tweets content and stock prices, following previous work on predicting stock price movement from factual sources such as news articles (Lavrenko et al., 2000; Koppel and Shtrimberg, 2004; Schumaker and Chen, 2010).",
        "This approach poses no restrictions on the tweets content and avoids any stipulated tweet classification.",
        "However, user-generated messages are largely subjective, and their correlation with the stock prices depends on user's expertise.",
        "This introduces much noise into the learning process.",
        "We show that by making the learning user-sensitive we can improve the results substantially.",
        "Overall, our work illustrates the feasibility of finding expert investors, and the utility of following them."

        "Their unique language and terminology often make stock tweets hard to understand for an outsider.",

        "For example, the word bought may also appear as bot or bght, and today may appear as 2day.",
        "Stock tweets also contain many sentiment expressions which may appear in many variations, e.g. wow, woooow, woooooooow and so on.",
        "These characteristics make the analysis of stock tweets a particularly challenging task.",
        "A preliminary step of this research was an extensive data analysis, aimed to gain better understanding of the major types of content conveyed in stock tweets.",
        "First, we developed a taxonomy of tweet categories while reading a few thousands of tweets.",
        "Based on this taxonomy we then tagged a sample of 350 tweets to obtain statistics on the frequency of each category.",

        "• Tweets that express question.",

        "These tweets describe patterns in the stock's chart without the inclusion of any predicted or projected movement, an important contrast to Chart Prediction, which is an opinion tweet described below.",
        "Chart pattern tweets, like news, are a condensed form of information already available through more in-depth sources and as such their added value is limited.",
        "3.",

        "We consider this as the most valuable form of tweet.",
        "4.",
        "Trade Outcome: provides details of an \"inverse trade\", the secondary trade to exit the initial position along with the outcome of the overall trade (profit/loss).",
        "The value of these tweets is debatable since although they provide details of a trade, they generally describe the \"exit\" transaction.",
        "This creates a dilemma for analysts since traders will often exit not because of a perceived change in the stock's potential but as a result of many short-term trading activities.",
        "For this reason trade outcome provides a moderate insight into a user's position which should be viewed with some degree of caution.",
        "Opinions can also be divided into four main subcat-egories:",

        "However, bearish tweets are somewhat more difficult to interpret: for example, selling a share may indicate a negative outlook on the stock, but it may also result from other considerations, e.g. following a trading strategy that holds the stock for a fixed period (cf. the discussion on Trade Outcome tweets in the previous section).",

        "For the transaction method we show all the users that were identified as experts.",
        "The random line is our baseline.",
        "It shows the expected results for randomly ordering the tweets in the test set.",

        "Except for the first 58 tweets, which achieved precision of 55%, the precision quickly dropped to a level of around 52%, which is just a little better than the random baseline.",
        "Next, we consider the transaction configuration, which is based on detecting buy transactions.",
        "Only 10 users were found to be experts according to this method, and in the test period these users had a total of 173 tweets.",
        "These 173 tweets achieve good precision (57.1% for the first 161 tweets, and 54.9% for the first 173 tweets).",
        "However this method resulted in a low number oftransactions.",
        "This happens because it is able to utilize only a small fraction of the tweets (explicit buy transactions).",
        "Remarkably, per user and joint experts, the two methods which rely on identifying the experts via unsupervised learning are by far the best methods.",
        "Both models seem to have comparable performance, where the results of the join experts model are somewhat smoother, as expected.",
        "Table 4 shows cumulative results for the first 20 users in the peruser model.",
        "The results show that this model achieves good precision for a relatively large number of tweets, and for most of the data points reported in the table the results significantly outperform the baseline (as indicated by the p value).",
