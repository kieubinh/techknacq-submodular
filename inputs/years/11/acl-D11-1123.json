        "Sentiment analysis has received much attention in recent years.",
        "A number of automatic methods have been proposed to identify and extract opinions, emotions, and sentiments from text.",
        "Previous researches on sentiment analysis tackled the problem on various levels of granularity including document, sentence, phrase and word (Pang et al., 2002; Riloff et al., 2003; Dave et al., 2003; Takamura et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Somasundaran et al., 2008; Dasgupta and Ng, 2009; Hassan and Radev, 2010).",
        "They mainly focused on two directions: sentiment classification which detects the overall polarity of a text; sentiment related information extraction which tries to answer the questions like \"who expresses what opinion on which target\".",
        "Most of the current studies on the second direction assume that an opinion can be structured as a frame which is composed of a fixed number of slots.",
        "Typical slots include opinion holder, opinion expression, and evaluation target.",
        "Under this representation, they defined the task as a slots filling problem for each of the opinions.",
        "Named entity recognition and relation extraction techniques are usually applied in this task (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kobayashi etal., 2007; Wu et al., 2009).",
        "However, through data analysis, we observe that 60.5% of sentences in our corpus do not follow the assumption used by them.",
        "A lot of important information about an opinion may be lost using those representation methods.",
        "Consider the following examples, which are extracted from real online reviews:",
        "Example 1: The interior is a bit noisy on the freeway.",
        "Example 2: Takes good pictures during the daytime.",
        "Very poor picture quality at night.",
        "Based on the definition of opinion unit proposed by Hu and Liu (2004), from the first example, the information we can get is the author's negative opinion about \"interior\" using an opinion expression \"noisy\".",
        "However, the important restriction \"on the freeway\", which narrows the scope of the opinion, is ignored.",
        "In fact, the tuple (\"noisy\",\"on the freeway\") cannot correctly express the original opinion: it is negative but under certain condition.",
        "The second example is similar.",
        "If the conditions \"during the daytime\" and \"at night\" are dropped, the extracted elements cannot correctly represent user's opinions.",
        "Example 3: The camera is actually quite good for outdoors because ofthe software.",
        "Besides that, an opinion expression may induce other opinions which are not expressed directly.",
        "In example 3, the opinion expression is \"good\" whose target is \"camera\".",
        "But the \"software\" which triggers the opinion expression \"good\" is also endowed with a positive opinion.",
        "In practice, this induced opinion on \"software\" is actually more informative than its direct counterpart.",
        "Mining those opinions may help to form a complete sentiment analysis result.",
        "Example 4: The image quality is in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students.",
        "Furthermore, the relations among individual opinions also provide additional information which is lost when they are considered separately.",
        "Example 4 is such a case that the whole positive comment of camera is expressed by a transition from a negative opinion to a positive one.",
        "In order to address those issues, this paper describes a novel sentiment representation and analysis method.",
        "Our main contributions are as follows:",
        "1.",
        "We investigate the use of graphs for representing sentence level sentiment.",
        "The vertices are evaluation target, opinion expression, modifiers of opinion.",
        "The Edges represent relations among them.",
        "The semantic relations among individual opinions are also included.",
        "Through the graph, various information on opinion expressions which is ignored by current representation methods can be well handled.",
        "And the proposed representation is language-independent.",
        "2.",
        "We propose a supervised structural learning method which takes a sentence as input and the proposed sentiment representation for it as output.",
        "The inference algorithm is based on integer linear programming which helps to concisely and uniformly handle various properties of our sentiment representation.",
        "By setting appropriate prior substructure constraints of the graph, the whole algorithm achieves reasonable performances.",
        "The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss the proposed representation method.",
        "Section 3 describes the computational model used to construct it.",
        "Experimental results in test collections and analysis are shown in",

        "In this work, we propose using directed graph to represent sentiments.",
        "In the graph, vertices are text spans in the sentences which are opinion expressions, evaluation targets, conditional clauses etc.",
        "Two types of edges are included in the graph: (1) relations among opinion expressions and their modifiers; (2) relations among opinion expressions.",
        "The edges of the first type exist within individual opinions.",
        "The second type of the edges captures the relations among individual opinions.",
        "The following sections detail the definition.",
        "Let r be an opinion expression in a sentence, the representation unit for r is a set of relations {(r, dk)}.",
        "For each relation (r, dk), dk is a modifier which is a span of text specifying the change of r's meaning.",
        "The relations between modifier and opinion expression can be the type of any kind.",
        "In this work, we mainly consider two basic types:",
        "• opinion restriction.",
        "(r, dk) is called an opinion restriction if dk narrows r's scope, adds a condition, or places limitations on r's original meaning.",
        "• opinion expansion.",
        "(r, dk ) is an opinion expansion if r's scope expands to dk, r induces another opinion on dk, or the opinion on dk is implicitly expressed by r.",
        "Mining the opinion restrictions can help to get accurate meaning of an opinion, and the opinion expansions are useful to cover more indirect opinions.",
        "As with previous sentiment representations, we actually consider the third type of modifier which dk is the evaluation target of r.",
        "Figure 1 shows a concrete example.",
        "In this example, there are three opinion expressions: \"good\", \"sharp\", \"slightly soft\".",
        "The modifiers of \"good\" are \"indoors\" and \"Focus accuracy\", where relation (\"good\",\"indoors\") is an opinion restriction because \"indoors\" is the condition under which \"Focus accuracy\" is good.",
        "On the other hand, the relation (\"sharp\", \"little 3x optical zooms\") is an opinion expansion because the \"sharp\" opinion on \"shot\" implies a positive opinion on \"little 3x optical zooms\".",
        "It is worth to remark that: 1) a modifier dk can relate to more than one opinion expression.",
        "For example, multiple opinion expressions may share a same condition; 2) dk itself can employ a set of relations, although the case appears occasionally.",
        "The following is an example:",
        "Example 5: The camera wisely get rid of many redundant buttons.",
        "In the example, \"redundant buttons\" is the evaluation target of opinion expression \"wisely get rid of\", but itself is a relation between \"redundant\" and \"buttons\".",
        "Such nested semantic structure is described by a path: \"wisely get rid of\"-> [\"redundant\"-^\"buttons\"]nested target.",
        "Assume are opinion expressions ordered by their positions in sentence, and each of them has been represented by relations {(rj,dik)} individually (the nested relations for dik have also been determined).",
        "Then we define two relations on adjacent pair n, Ti+i : coordination when the polarities of Ti and Ti+i are consistent, and transition when they are opposite.",
        "Those relations among Ti form a set B called opinion thread.",
        "In Figure 1, the opinion thread is: {(\"good\", \"sharp\"), (\"sharp\", \"slightly soft\")}.",
        "The whole sentiment representation for a sentence can be organized by a direct graph G = ( V, E).",
        "Vertex set V includes all opinion expressions and modifiers.",
        "Edge set E collects both relations of each individual opinion and relations in opinion thread.",
        "The edges are labeled with relation types in label set l={ \"restriction\", \"expansion\", \"target\", \"coordination\", \"transition\"} .",
        "Compared with previous works, the advantages of using G as sentiment representation are: 1) for individual opinions, the modifiers will collect more information than using opinion expression alone.",
        "Focus accuracy was good indoors, and although the little 3x optical zooms produced sharp shots, the edges were slightly soft on the Canon.",
        "slightly soft",
        "Thus G is a relatively complete and accurate representation; 2) the opinion thread can help to catch global sentiment information, for example the general polarity of a sentence, which is dropped when the opinions are separately represented."
