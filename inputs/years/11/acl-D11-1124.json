        "In the era of information explosion, people need new information to update their knowledge whilst information on Web is updating extremely fast.",
        "Multi-document summarization has been proposed to address such dilemma by producing a summary delivering the majority of information content from a document set, and hence is a necessity.",
        "Traditional summarization methods play an important role with the exponential document growth on the Web.",
        "However, for the readers, the impact of human interests has seldom been considered.",
        "Traditional summarization utilizes the same methodology to generate the same summary no matter who is reading.",
        "However, users may have bias on what they prefer to read due to their potential interests: they need personalization.",
        "Therefore, traditional summarization methods are to some extent insufficient.",
        "Topic biased summarization tries for personalization by predefining human interests as several general categories, such as health or science.",
        "Readers are required to select their possible interests before summary generation so that the chosen topic has priority during summarization.",
        "Unfortunately, such topic biased summarization is not sufficient for two reasons: (1) interests cannot usually be accurately predefined by ambiguous topic categories and (2) user interests cannot always be foreknown.",
        "Often users do not really know what general ideas or detail information they are interested in until they read the summaries.",
        "Therefore, more flexible interactions are required to establish personalization.",
        "Due to all the insufficiencies of existed summarization approaches, we introduce a new multi-document summarization task of Interactive Personalized Summarization (IPS) and a novel solution for the task.",
        "Taking a document collection as input, the system outputs a summary aligned both with source corpus and with user personalization, which is captured by flexible human – system interactions.",
        "We build an experimental system on 4 real datasets to verify the effectiveness of our methods compared with 4 rivals.",
        "The contribution of IPS is manifold by addressing following challenges:",
        "• The 1st challenge for IPS is to integrate user interests into traditional summary components.",
        "We measure the utilities of these components and combine them.",
        "We formulate the task into a balanced optimization framework via iterative substitution to generate summaries with maximum overall utilities.",
        "• The 2nd challenge is to capture user interests through interaction.",
        "We develop an interactive mechanism of \"click\" and \"examine\" between readers and summaries and address sparse data by \"click smoothing\" under the scenario of few user clicks.",
        "We start by reviewing previous works.",
        "In Section 3 we provide IPS overview, describe user interaction and optimize component combination with personalization.",
        "We conduct empirical evaluation and demonstrate the experimental system in Section 4.",
        "Finally we draw conclusions in Section 5."
