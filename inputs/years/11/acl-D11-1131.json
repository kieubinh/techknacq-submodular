        "One of the most fundamental ideas about language is that we use it to express our thoughts.",
        "Learning a natural language, then, amounts to (at least) learning a mapping between the things we utter and the things we think, and can therefore be seen as the task of learning a semantic parser, i.e. something that maps natural language expressions such as sentences into meaning representations such as logical forms.",
        "Obviously, this learning can neither take place in a fully supervised nor in a fully unsupervised fashion: the learner does not 'hear' the meanings of the sentences she observes, but she is also not treating them as merely meaningless strings.",
        "Rather, it seems plausible to assume that she uses extralinguistic context to assign certain meanings to the linguistic input she is confronted with.",
        "In this sense, learning a semantic parser seems to go beyond the well-studied task of unsupervised grammar induction.",
        "It involves not only learning a grammar for the form-side of language, i.e. language expressions such as sentences, but also the 'grounding' of this structure in meaning representations.",
        "It requires going beyond the mere linguistic input to incorporate, for example, perceptual information that provides a clue to the meaning of the observed forms.",
        "Essentially, it seems as if 'grounded' learning tasks like this require dealing with two different kinds of information, the purely formal (phonemic) and meaningful (semantic) aspects of language.",
        "Grammatical inference seems to be limited to dealing with one level of formal information (Chang and Maia, 2001).",
        "For this reason, probably, approaches to the task of learning a semantic parser employ a variety of sophisticated and task-specific techniques that go beyond (but often elaborate on) the techniques used for grammatical inference (Lu et al., 2008; Chen and Mooney, 2008; Liang et al., 2009; Kim and Mooney, 2010; Chen et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we show that one can reduce the task of learning a semantic parser to a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) learning task, and more generally, that grounded learning tasks are not in principle beyond the scope of grammatical inference techniques.",
        "In particular, we show how to formulate the task of learning a semantic parser as discussed by Chen, Kim and Mooney (2008, 2010) as the task of learning a PCFG from strings.",
        "Our model does not only constitute a proof of concept that this reduction is possible for certain cases, it also yields highly competitive results.",
        "By reducing the problem to the well understood PCFG formalism, it also becomes easy to consider extensions, leading to our second contribution.",
        "We demonstrate that a slight modification to our model so that it also learns the language's canonical word order improves its performance even beyond the best results previously reported in the literature.",
        "This language-independent and linguistically well motivated elaboration allows the model to learn a global fact about the language's syntax, its canonical word order.",
        "Our contribution is two-fold.",
        "We provide an illustration of how to reduce grounded learning tasks to grammatical inference.",
        "Secondly, we show that extending the model so that it can learn linguistically well motivated generalizations such as the canonical word order can lead to better results.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "First we give a short overview of the previous work by Chen, Kim and Mooney and describe their dataset.",
        "Then, we show how to reduce the parsing task addressed by them to a PCFG-learning task.",
        "Finally, we explain how to let our model additionally learn the language's canonical word order."

        "In a series of recent papers, Chen, Kim and Mooney approach the task of learning a semantic parser from ambiguous training data (Chen and Mooney, 2008; Kim and Mooney, 2010; Chen et al., 2010).",
        "This goes beyond previous work on semantic parsing such as Lu et al.",
        "(2008) or Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) which rely on unambiguous training data where every sentence is paired only with its meaning.",
        "In contrast, Chen, Kim and Mooney allow their training examples to exhibit the kind of uncertainty about sentence meanings human learners are likely to have to deal with by allowing for sentences to be associated with a set of candidate-meanings, and the correct meaning might not even be in this set.",
        "They create the training data by first collecting humanly generated written language comments on four different RoboCup games.",
        "The comments are recorded with a time-stamp and then associated with all game events automatically extracted from the games which occured up to five seconds before the comment was made.",
        "This leads to an ambiguous pairing of comments with candidate meanings that can be considered similar to the \"linguistic input in the context of a rich, relevant, perceptual environment\" to which real language learners probably have access (Chen and Mooney, 2008).",
        "For evaluation purposes, they manually create a goldstandard which contains unambiguous natural language comment / event pairs.",
        "Due to the fact that some comments refer to events not detected by their extraction-algorithm, not every natural language sentence has a gold matching meaning representation.",
        "In addition to the inherent ambiguity of the training examples, the learner therefore has to somehow deal with those examples which only have 'wrong' meanings associated with them.",
        "Datasets exist for both Korean and English, each comprising training and gold data for four games.Some details about this data are given in Table 1, such as the number of examples, their average ambiguity and the number of misleading examples.",
        "For the following short discussion of previous approaches, we mainly focus on Kim and Mooney (2010).",
        "This is the most recent publication and reports the highest scores.",
        "Learning a semantic parser from the ambiguous data is, in fact, just one of three tasks discussed by Kim and Mooney (2010), henceforth KM.",
        "In addition to parsing, they discuss matching and natural language generation.",
        "We are ignoring the generation task as we are currently only interested in the parsing problem, and we treat the matching task, picking the correct meaning from the set of candidates, merely as a byproduct of parsing, rather than as a completely separate task: parsing implicitly requires the model to disambiguate the data it is learning from.",
        "Table 1: Statistics for the Korean and the English datasets.",
        "The numbers are basically identical to those reported in Chen et al.",
        "(2010) except for minimal differences in the number of training examples (we give one more for every English training set, and one more for the 2004 Korean training set).",
        "In addition, our calculation of the average sentential ambiguity (Avg.",
        "# of MRs) differs because we assume that mutiple occurences of the same event in a context do not add to the overall ambiguity, and our calculation of the noise (fraction of training examples without the correct meaning in their context) takes into account that there are training examples which do not have their gold meaning associated with them in the training data and is therefore slightly higher than the one reported in Chen et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "KM's model builds on previous work by Lu et al.",
        "(2008) and is a generative model which defines a joint probability distribution over natural language sentences (NLs), meaning representations (MRs) and hybrid trees.",
        "The NLs are the natural language comments to the games, the MRs are simple logical formulae describing game events and playing the role of sentence meanings, and a hybrid tree is a tree structure that represents the correspondence between a sentence and its meaning.",
        "More specifically, if some NL W has as its meaning an MR m, and m has been generated by a meaning grammar (MG) G, the hybrid tree corresponding to the pair (w,m) has as its internal nodes those rules of G used in the derivation of m, and as its leaves the words making up W. An example hybrid tree for the pair (the pink goalie passes the ball to PINK11,pass(pink1,pink11)) is given in Figure 1.",
        "Their model is trained by a variant of the Inside-Outside algorithm which deals with the hybrid tree structure and takes into account the ambiguity of the training examples.",
        "In addition to learning directly from the ambiguous training data, they also train a semantic parser in a supervised fashion on data that has been previously disambiguated by their matching model.",
        "This slightly improves their system's performance.",
        "Consequently, there are two scores for each of the",

        "two languages (English and Korean) with which we compare our own model: those of the parsers trained directly from the ambiguous data, and those of the 'supervised' parsers which constitute the current state of the art.",

        "The training data expresses information of two different kinds - form and meaning.",
        "Every training example consists of a natural language string (the formal information) and a set of candidate meanings for the string (the semantic information, its context), allowing for the possibility that none of the meanings in the context is the correct one.",
        "In order to learn from data like this within a grammatical inference framework, we have to encode the semantic information as part of the string.",
        "Assigning a specific MR m to a string corresponds, in our framework, to analyzing it as a tree with Sm as its root.",
        "A sentence's context constrains which of the many possible meanings might be expressed by the string.",
        "Thus the role played by the context is adequately modelled if we ensure that if a string W is associated with a context {rm ,...,mn}, the model only considers the possibilities that this string might be analyzed as S S",
        "There are 959 different contexts, i e 959 different sets of MRs, in the English data set (984 for the Korean data), and we therefore introduce 959 new terminal symbols which play the role of context-identifiers, for example C1 to C959.",

        "The internal structure of the Phrasecon constituents, shown in full detail for Phrasepass, corresponds to a Markov process that generates the words that make up the sentence.",
        "The terminal is a context-identifier that restricts the range of Sm non-terminals that might dominate the sentence and is only used during training, as described in Section 3.1.",
        "The grammar that generates this trees is described in Figure 3.",
        "right-hand side of aü rules with Spass(pinkl,pinkll) on their left-hand side to begin with C1.",
        "More generally, if an MR m occurs in the contexts associated with the context-identifiers CK,...,CL, we require the right-hand side of all rules with Sm on their left-hand side to begin with exactly one of CK,...,CL.",
        "In this sense, the context-identifiers can be seen as providing the model with a top-down constraint - if it encounters a context-identifier, it can only try analyses leading to MRs which are licensed by this context-identifier.",
        "On the other hand, the words have to be generated by concept-specific worddistributions, and the concepts that are present restrict the range of possible Sm non-terminals which might dominate the whole string.",
        "In this sense, the words the model observes provide it with a bottom-up constraint - if it sees words which are semantically related to certain concepts con1,...,conn, it has to arrive at an MR which licenses the presence of the corresponding Phraseconx non-terminals.",
        "Of course, the model has to also learn which words are semantically related to which concepts.",
        "To enable it to do this, our grammar allows every Wordx non-terminal to be rewritten as every word of the language.",
        "Since there are sentences in the training data without the correct meaning in their context, we want to give our model the possibility of not assigning to a sentence any of the MRs licensed by its context-identifier.",

        "As a last complication, we deal with the fact that syntactic constituents are linearized with respect to each other.",
        "For example, if an MR has 3 proper constituents (i.e. excluding the MR itself), our grammar allows the corresponding 3 syntactic constituents which we might label Phrasepredicate, Phraseargland Phrasearg2 - to occur in any of the 6 possible orders.",
        "Therefore, we have an Sm rule for every context in which m occurs and for every possible order of the proper constituents of m.",
        "A formally explicit description of the rule schemata used to generate the CFG is given in Figure 3.",
        "Instantiating all those schemata leads to a grammar with 33,101 rules for the English data and 30,731 rules for the Korean data.",
        "The difference in size is due to differences in the size of the vocabulary and the different number of contexts in the data sets.",
        "These CFGs can now be trained on the training data using the Inside-Outside algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990).",
        "After training, the resulting PCFG embodies a semantic parser in the sense that, with a slight modification we describe in section 3.3, it can be used to parse a string into its meaning representation by determining the most likely syntactic analysis and reading off the meaning assigned by our model at the Sm-node.",
        "Before we go on to discuss the details of training and evaluation of our model, we want to address an objection that might seem tempting.",
        "Isn't our reduction impractical and unrealistic as even a highly abstract model of language learning - after all, setting up the huge CFG requires knowledge about the vocabulary, the MG and all the complicated rules discussed which, presumably, is more knowledge than we want to provide a language learner with, lest we trivialize the task.",
        "To this we reply firstly, that it is true that our reduction only works for offline or batch grounded learning tasks where all the data is available to the model before the actual learning begins so that it 'knows' the words, the meanings and the contexts present in the data.",
        "This offline constraint is, however, true of all models which are trained by iterating multiple times over training data such as KM's model.",
        "Secondly, the intimidating CFG can in principle be reduced to a hand-full of intuitive principles and is easy to generate automatically.",
        "First of all, the many specific Sm-rewrite rules reduce to the heuristic that every semantic constituent should correspond to a syntactic constituent, and the fact that natural language expressions are linearly ordered.",
        "Note that our model does not contain knowledge about the specific word order of the language.",
        "It simply allows for the constituents of an MR to occur in every possible order which is a very unbiased and empiricist assumption.",
        "Of course, this leads to some limited kind of 'implicit learning' of word order in the sense that for every meaning and for every context, our model might (and in most cases will) assign different probabilities to the different rules for every word order; so it can learn that certain specific MRs such as pass(pink1,pink11) are more often linearized in one way than in any other.",
        "It cannot, however, generalize this to other (or even unseen) MRs, i.e. it does not learn a global fact about the language.",
        "In a way, it lacks the knowledge that there is such a thing as word order, a point which we will elaborate on in Section 4.",
        "The many rewrite rules for the pre-terminal Wordxs are nothing but an explicit version of the assumption that every word the model encounters might, in principle, be semantically related to every concept it knows.",
        "Again, this seems to us to be a reasonable assumption.",
        "Finally, the complicated looking set of rules for the internal structure of Phrasexs corresponds to a simple unigram Markov-process for generating strings.",
        "All in all, we do not see that we make any more assumptions than other approaches; our formulation may make explicit how rich those assumptions are but we have not qualitatively changed them.",
        "The CFG described in the previous section is trained on the same training data used by KM, except that we reduce it to strings (without changing the information present in the original data) by prefixing every sentence with a context-identifier.",
        "For training we run the Inside-Outside algorithm with uniform initialization weights until convergence.",
        "For English, this results in an average number of 76 iterations for each fold, for Korean the average number of iterations is 50.",
        "To deal with the fact that the model might not observe certain meanings during training, we apply a simple smoothing technique by using a Dirichlet prior of a=0.1 on the rule probabilities.",

        "For parsing, the resulting PCFG is slightly modified by removing the context-identifiers.",
        "This is done because the task of a semantic parser is to establish a mapping between NLs and MRs, irrespective of contexts which were only used for learning the parser and should not play a role in its final performance.",
        "To do this, we add up the probability of all rules which differ only in the context-identifier which can be thought of as marginalizing out the different contexts, giving our first model which we call NoWo-PCFG.",
        "Note that the context-deletion (and the simple smoothing) enables NoWo-PCFG to parse sentences into meanings not present in the data it was trained on which, in fact, happens.",

        "The PCFG trained on games 2,3 and 4 is still able to correctly assign 12 of those 81 meanings which it has not seen during the training phase which shows the effectiveness of the bottom-up constraint.",
        "For evaluation, we employ 4-fold cross validation as described in detail in Chen and Mooney (2008) and used by KM: the model is trained on all possible combinations of 3 of the 4 games and is then used to produce an MR for all sentences of the held-out game for which there is a matching gold-standard meaning.",
        "For an NL W, our model produces an MR m by finding the most probable parse of W with the CKY algorithm and reading off m at the Sm-node.An MR is considered correct if and only if it matches the gold-standard MR exactly; the final evaluation result is averaged over all 4 folds.",

        "Its scores are virtually identical for English (0.742) and worse for Korean (0.718 vs 0.764).",

        "Our NoWo-PCFG model considers each of the possible word orders for every meaning and context in isolation: it is unable to infer from the fact that most meanings it has observed are most likely to be expressed with a certain word order that new meanings it will encounter are also more likely to be expressed with this word order.",
        "It seems, however, to be at least a soft fact about languages that they do have a canonical word order that is more likely to be realized in its sentences than any other possible word order.",
        "In order to test whether trying to learn this order helps our model, we modify the CFG used for NoWo-PCFG so it can learn word order generalizations, and train it in the same way to yield another semantic parser, WO-PCFG.",
        "For every possible ordering of the constituents corresponding to an MR, our grammar contains a rule.",
        "In NoWo-PCFG, these different rules all share the same parent which prevents the model from learning the probability of the different word orders corresponding to the many rules.",
        "A straightforward way to overcome this is to annotate every Sm node with the word order of its daughter.",
        "We split every Sm non-terminal in multiple Swo_m non-terminals, where woe {v,sv,vs,svo,sov,osv,ovs,vso,vos} indicates the linear order of the constituents the nonterminal rewrites as.",
        "This in itself does not yet allow our model to use word order as a means of generalization.",
        "To model that whenever it encounters a specific example that is indicative of a certain word order, this word order becomes slightly more probable for every other example as well, we have to make a further slight change to the CFG which we now describe.",
        "A formally explicit description of the necessary changes which we go on to describe is given in Figure 4.",
        "We introduce six new non-terminals, corresponding to the six possible word orders SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV and OVS and require every Swo m nonterminal to be dominated by the non-terminal compatible with its daughters linear order.",

        "In addition, our model correctly learns that English's predominant word order is SVO and that Korean is predominantly SOV, assigning by far the highest probability to the corresponding Root rewrite rule (0.91 for English and 0.98 for Korean).",
        "This kind of information is useful in its own right and could, for example, be exploited by coupling word order with other linguistic properties, perhaps following Greenberg (1966)'s implicational universals.",
        "In this sense, the reduction of grounded learning problems to grammatical inference does not only make possible the application of a wide variety of tools and insights developed over years of research, it might also make it easier to bring abstract (and not so abstract) linguistic knowledge to bear on those tasks.",
        "The overall slightly worse performance of our system on Korean data might stem from the fact that Korean, unlike English, has a rich morphology, and that our model does not learn anything about morphology at all.",
