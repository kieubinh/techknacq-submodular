        "Throughout the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evaluations and the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC), teams typically had a year or more from release of the target to submitting system results.",
        "One exception was MUC-6 (Grishman & Sundheim, 1996), in which scenario templates for changing positions were extracted given only one month.",
        "Our goal was to confine development to a calendar week, in fact, <50 person hours.",
        "This is significant in two ways: the less effort it takes to bring up a new domain, (1) the more broadly applicable the technology is and (2) the less effort required to run a diagnostic research experiment.",
        "Our second goal concerned minimizing training data.",
        "Rather than approximately 250k words of entity and relation annotation as in ACE, only ~20 example pairs per relation-type were provided as training.",
        "Reducing the training requirements has the same two desirable outcomes: demonstrating that the technology can be broadly applicable and reducing the overhead for running experiments.",
        "The system achieved recall of 0.49 and precision of 0.53 (for an F1 of 0.51) on a blind test set of 60 queries of the form Ri(arg1, arg2), where Ri is one of the 5 new relations and exactly one of arg1 or arg2 is a free variable for each query.",
        "Key to this achievement was a hybrid of:",
        "• a variant of (Miller, et al., 2004) to learn two new classes of entities via automatically induced word classes and active learning (6 hours)",
        "• bootstrap relation learning (Freedman et al., 2010) to learn 5 new relation classes (2.5 hours),",
        "• handwritten patterns over predicate-argument structure (5 hours), and",
        "Our bootstrap learner is initialized with relation tuples (not annotated text) and uses LDC's Giga-word and Wikipedia as a background corpus to learn patterns for relation detection that are based on normalized predicate argument structure as well as surface strings.",
        "These early empirical results suggest the following: (1) It is possible to specify a domain, adapt our system, and complete manual scoring, including human performance, within a month.",
        "Experiments in machine reading (and in extraction) can be performed much more quickly and cheaply than ever before.",
        "(2) Through machine learning and limited human pattern writing (6 hours), we adapted a machine reading system within a week (using less than 50 person hours), achieving question answering performance with an F1 of 0.5 and with recall 11% higher (relative) to a human reader.",
        "(3) Unfortunately, machine learning, though achieving 80% precision, significantly lags behind a gifted human pattern writer in recall.",
        "Thus, bootstrap learning with much higher recall at minimal sacrifice in precision is highly desirable."

        "Each of the relations in the new domain included at least one argument that was new.",

        "Alternatively, our approach may need to be extended to include a larger context window.",

      "text": [
        "First, it is encouraging that the synthesis of learning algorithms and handwritten algorithms can achieve an F1 of 0.51 in a new domain in a week (<50 hours of effort).",
        "Second, it is exciting that so little training data is required: -20 relation pairs out of context (-2.5 hours of effort) and 6 hours of active learning for the new classes.",
        "Third, the effectiveness of learning algorithms is still not competitive with handwritten patterns based on predicate-argument structure (-5 hours of effort on top of active learning for entities).",
        "Though the learned patterns have high precision (0.80 on average), recall is low (0.17) and varied greatly across the relations.",
        "Though the dominant factor in missing relations is pattern coverage, missing instances of classes contributed to low recall.",
        "Comparing learned patterns to manually written patterns, (1) synonyms or other lexical alternatives that a human pattern writer would include, (2) the creation of subclasses for argument types, and (3) the scope of patterns are each major sources of the disparity in coverage.",
        "Research on learning approaches to raise recall without significant sacrifice in precision seems essential.",
        "Fourth, despite the disparity in performance of learned versus manual patterns, and despite the low recall of learned patterns, the combined system's recall and F-Score are higher for three of the relations because the learned patterns generated answers not found by handwritten patterns.",
        "We found examples where highly specific, learned, surface-level patterns (lexical patterns) occasionally found information missed by handwritten patterns due to parsing errors or general low coverage.",
        "Fifth, the effort for coreference was the most time-consuming, given that every new relation contained at least one of the new argument types.",
        "While we included this in our estimate of domain adaptation, the infrastructure we built is domain generic.",
        "Improving generic coreference will reduce domain specific effort in future.",
        "Perhaps most significant of all, running a complete experiment from definition of the domain through creation of training data and measurement of end-to-end performance of the system can be completed in a month.",
        "The ability to rapidly, cheaply, and empirically measure the impact of extraction research could prove a significant spur to research across the board.",
        "These experiments suggest three possible directions for improving the ability to quickly develop information extraction technology for a new set of relations: (1) reducing the amount of supervision provided to the bootstrap-learner; (2) improving the bootstrapping approach to reach the level of recall achieved by the human pattern writer eliminating the need for a trained expert during domain adaptation; and (3) focusing improvements to the bootstrapping approach on techniques that allow it to find more of the instances missed by the pattern writer, thus improving the accuracy of the hybrid system."
