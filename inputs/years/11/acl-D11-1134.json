        "For each pair of categories (e.g., Musician and Instrument) it first co-clusters the text contexts that connect known instances of the two categories, generating a candidate relation for each resulting cluster.",

        "The introduction of these invalid relations can adversely affect the performance of NELL.",
        "However, it is a challenging problem to develop automated ways to distinguish between valid and invalid relations without any domain specific knowledge.",
        "To approach this problem, we identified a set of features which can help characterizing valid and invalid relations, and which can be generated automatically.",
        "Below is a description of the features and the intuition behind their use for this classification task.",
        "Each generated relation has a pair of category types (C1, C2), a corresponding set of seed instances (which are pairs of instances belonging to C1 and C2) and pattern contexts connecting C1 and C2.",
        "Let N be the number of seed instance pairs and N1 and N2 be number of unique instances (out of these N instance pairs) belonging to categories C1 and C2 respectively.",
        "1.",
        "Normalized frequency count: The frequency count of each category instance is obtained from the corpus and normalized by the category instance with maximum count.",
        "For a given relation, a feature is generated by averaging the normalized frequency counts of the instances belonging to C1.",
        "Another similar feature is generated for C2 following the same strategy.",
        "For example the relation <Profession 'believe that' Movie> was generated due to common words like 'predator', 'earthquake' being identified as movie names out of context.",
        "These features can help identify such invalid relations.",
        "2.",
        "Distribution of extraction patterns: NELL learns instances as well as extraction patterns for each category (e.g. the category Actor has extraction patterns such as '_ got an Oscar award', '_ is the movie's lead actor').",
        "If a category instance co-occurs in the web corpus with several extraction patterns belonging to other categories, then that instance has large ambiguity.",
        "We measure ambiguity of an instance (i) belonging to category 'C' with respect to another category 'M' (where M is not a sub type or super type of 'C') as Ambiguity(i,M) = # of extraction patterns in ' M' that 'i' co - occurs with",
        "# of extraction patterns in ' C' that 'i' co - occurs with We measure the average ambiguity for the set of instances (of size N) belonging to category",
        "C in the generated seeds as follows, MaxM (y Ambiguity (i,M) /N )",
        "Two features are generated for categories C1 and C2 in the relation.",
        "3.",
        "Relationship characteristics: We identified a few characteristics of the relation which help in identifying valid relations.",
        "If in the generated relation, most instances of C1 co-occur only with very few instances of C2 (or vice versa) then the relation could be weak.",
        "For example, <Organization 'Provides' EconomicSector> the instance 'Information' (of category Eco-nomicSector) connects to a large percentage of items in the category 'Organization' but does not express a meaningful relation.",
        "So we consider the instance (in this example 'Information', let us call it 'maxconnect_instance') co-occurring with maximum number of instances of the other category.",
        "The percentage of instances it co-occurs with from among the total number of instances of the other category which are part of the seed instances is taken as a feature.",
        "Also if that instance is a very common word (like 'information' which in several contexts does not refer to 'EconomicSector') then this could indicate the presence of an invalid relation.",
        "So the normalized frequency count of this instance (maxconnect_instance) is taken as another feature.",
        "4.",
        "Pattern Contexts: The number of pattern contexts attained through pattern clustering for the relation is taken as another feature.",
        "The presence of several pattern contexts connecting the instances between the two categories could indicate that the relation is a valid one.",
        "The presence of Hearst patterns (Hearst M, 1992) referring to a hyponym (\"is-a\") relation in pattern contexts indicates the possibility of a valid relation, and is taken as another feature",
        "Another feature is regarding how specific is the context pattern to this relation.",
        "If the same context connects say C1 instances to instances of several other categories apart from C2, then this context is not unique to this relation and might not indicate a meaningful valid relationship.",
        "So the ratio of the number of instances in C2 connected to C1 versus the number of instances from all categories connected to C1 by the most significant pattern context (i.e. centroid in pattern cluster) is taken as a feature.",
        "A similar feature is generated for C2 as well."
