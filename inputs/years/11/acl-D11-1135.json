        "Many NLP applications would benefit from large knowledge bases of relational information about entities.",
        "For instance, knowing that the entity Steve Balmer bears the leaderOf relation to the entity Microsoft, would facilitate question answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), data mining, and a host of other end-user applications.",
        "Due to these many potential applications, relation extraction has gained much attention in information extraction (Kambhatla, 2004; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2010).",
        "We propose a series of generative probabilistic models, broadly similar to standard topic models, which generate a corpus of observed triples of entity mention pairs and the surface syntactic dependency path between them.",
        "Our proposed models exploit entity type constraints within a relation as well as features on the dependency path between entity mentions.",
        "The output of our approach is a clustering over observed relation paths (e.g. \"X was born in Y\" and \"X is from Y\") such that expressions in the same cluster bear the same semantic relation type between entities.",
        "Past work has shown that standard supervised techniques can yield high-performance relation detection when abundant labeled data exists for a fixed inventory of individual relation types (e.g. leaderOf) (Kambhatla, 2004; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Roth and tau Yih, 2002).",
        "However, less explored are open-domain approaches where the set of possible relation types are not fixed and little to no labeled is given for each relation type (Banko et al., 2007; Banko and Etzioni, 2008).",
        "A more related line of research has explored inducing relation types via clustering.",
        "For example, DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) aims to discover different representations of the same semantic relation using distributional similarity of dependency paths.",
        "Poon and Domingos (2008) present an Unsupervised semantic parsing (USP) approach to partition dependency trees into meaningful fragments (or \"parts\" to use their terminology).",
        "The combinatorial nature of this dependency partition model makes it difficult for USP to scale to large data sets despite several necessary approximations during learning and inference.",
        "Our work is similar to DIRT and USP in that we induce relation types from observed dependency paths, but our approach is a straightforward and principled generative model which can be efficiently learned.",
        "As we show empirically, our approach outperforms these related works when trained with the same amount of data and further gains are observed when trained with more data.",
        "We evaluate our approach using 'intrinsic' clustering evaluation and 'extrinsic' evaluation settings.The former evaluation is performed using subset of induced clusters against Freebase relations, a large manually-built entity and relational database.",
        "We also show some clusters which are not included as Freebase relations, as well as some entity clusters found by our approach.",
        "The latter evaluation uses the clustering induced by our models as features for relation extraction in distant supervision framework.",
        "Empirical results show that we can find coherent clusters.",
        "In relation extraction, we can achieve 12% error reduction in precision over a state-of-the-art weakly supervised baseline and we show that using features from our proposed models can find more facts for a relation without significant accuracy loss."

        "The task of relation extraction is mapping surface textual relations to underlying semantic relations.",
        "For instance, the textual expression \"X was born in Y\" indicates a semantic relation bornIn between entities \"X\" and \"Y\".",
        "This relation can be expressed textually in several ways: for instance, \"X, a native of Y\" or \"X grew up in Y\".",
        "There are several components to a coherent relation type, including a tight small number of textual expressions as well as constraints on the entities involved in the relation.",
        "For instance, in the bornIn relation \"X\" must be a person entity and \"Y\" a location (typically a city or nation).",
        "In this work, we present an unsupervised probabilistic generative model for inducing clusters of relation types and recognizing their textual expressions.",
        "The set of relation types is not pre-specified but induced from observed unlabeled data.",
        "See Table 4 for examples of learned semantic relations.",
        "Our observed data consists of a corpus of documents and each document is represented by a bag of relation tuples.",
        "Each tuple represents an observed syntactic relationship between two Named Entities (NE) and consists of three components: the dependency path between two NE mentions, the source argument NE, and the destination argument NE.",
        "A dependency path is a concatenation of dependency relations (edges) and words (nodes) along a path in a dependency tree.",
        "For instance, the sentence \"John Lennnon was born in Liverpool\" would yield the relation tuple (Lennon, [t – nsubjpass, born, I – in], Liverpool).",
        "This relation tuple reflects a semantic bornIn relation between the John Lennon and Liverpool entities.",

        "Consecutive tokens which share the same category are assembled into entity mentions.",
        "They serve as source and destination arguments of the tuples we seek to model.",

        "Following DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), we filter out tuples that do not satisfy the following constraints.",
        "First, the path needs to be shorter than 10 edges, since longer paths occur less frequently.",
        "Second, the dependency relations in the path should connect two content words, i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.",
        "For example, in phrase 'solve a problem', 'obj(solve, problem)' is kept, while 'det(problem, a)' is discarded.",
        "Finally, the dependency labels on the path must not be: 'conj', 'ccomp', 'parataxis', 'xcomp', 'pcomp', 'advcl', 'punct', and 'infmod'.",
        "This selection is based on the observation that most of the times the corresponding dependency relations do not explicitly state a relation between two candidate arguments.",
        "After all entity mentions are generated and paths are extracted, we have nearly 2.5M tuples.",
        "After clustering (inference), each of these tuple will belong to one cluster/relation and is associated with its clusterID.",
        "We experimented with the number of clusters and find that in a range of 50-200 the performance does not vary significantly with different numbers.",
        "In our experiments, we cluster the tuples into 100 relation clusters for all three models.",

        "We treat Freebase annotations as ground truth and measure recall.",
        "We count each tuple in a cluster as true positive if Freebase states the corresponding relation between its argument pair.",
        "We find that precision numbers against Freebase are low, below 10%.",
        "However, these numbers are not reliable mainly because many correct instances found by our models are missing in Freebase.",
        "One reason why our predictions are missing in Freebase is coreference.",
        "For example, we predict parentCom relation between 'Linksys' and 'Cisco', while Freebase only considers 'Cisco Systems, Inc.' as the parent company of 'Linksys'.",
        "It does not corefer 'Cisco' to 'Cisco Systems, Inc.'.",
        "Incorporating coreference in our model may fix this problem and is a focus of future work.",

        "Rel-LDA includes spurious instances such as 'A is the chief executive of B', while Rel-LDA1 has fewer such instances due to the NER pair feature.",

        "We can see that the last cluster is noisy since we do not handle antonyms in our models.",
        "The arguments of the clusters have noise too.",
        "For example, 'New York' occurs as a destination argument in the 2nd cluster.",
        "This is because 'New York' has high frequency in the corpus and it brings noise to the clustering results.",

        "Our generative models detect clusters ofdependency paths and their arguments.",
        "Such clusters are interesting in their own right, but we claim that they can also be used to help a supervised relation extractor.",
        "We validate this hypothesis in the context of relation extraction with distant supervision using predicted clusters as features.",
        "Following previous work (Mintz et al., 2009), we use Freebase as our distant supervision source, and align related entity pairs to the New York Times articles discussed earlier.",
