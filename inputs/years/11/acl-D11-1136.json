        "In active learning, a classifier participates in its own training process by posing queries, such as requesting labels for documents in a text classification task.",
        "The goal is to maximize the accuracy of the trained system in the most economically efficient way.",
        "This paradigm is well-motivated for natural language applications, where unlabeled data may be readily available (e.g., text on the Internet), but the annotation process can be slow and expensive.",
        "Nearly all previous work in active learning, however, has focused on selecting queries from the learner's perspective.",
        "For example, experiments are often run in simulation rather than with user studies, and results are routinely evaluated in terms of training set size rather than human annotation time or labor costs (which are more reasonable measures of labeling effort).",
        "Many state-of-the-art algorithms are also too slow to run or too tedious to implement to be useful for real-time interaction with human annotators, and few analyses have taken these factors into account.",
        "Furthermore, there is very little work on actively soliciting domain knowledge from humans (e.g., information about features) and incorporating this into the learning process.",
        "While selecting good queries is clearly important, if our goal is to reduce actual annotation effort these human factors must be taken into account.",
        "In this work, we propose a new interactive annotation interface which addresses some of these issues; in particular it has the ability to pose queries on both features (e.g., words) and instances (e.g., documents).",
        "We present a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm that is fast, flexible, and accurate enough to support these interface design constraints interactively.",

        "Within each column, words are sorted by how informative they are the to classifier, and users may click on words to label them.",
        "Each column also contains a text box, where users may \"inject\" domain knowledge by typing in arbitrary words (whether they appear in any of the columns or not).",

        "The learning algorithm is actually fast enough to do this automatically after each labeling action.",
        "However, we found such a dynamically changing interface to be frustrating for users (e.g., words they wanted to label would move or disappear).",
        "2.1 A Generative Model for Learning from Feature and Instance Labels",
        "For the underlying model in this system, we use multinomial naïve Bayes (MNB) since it is simple, fast, and known to work well for several natural language applications – text classification in particular – despite its simplistic and often violated independence assumptions (McCallum and Nigam, 1998;Rennie et al., 2003).",
        "MNB models the distribution of features as a multinomial: documents are sequences of words, where fk(x) is the frequency count of word fk in document x.",
        "If we assume P(| x| ) is distributed independently of class, and since document length | x| is fixed, we can drop the first term for classification purposes.",
        "Then, we can use Bayes' rule to calculate the posterior probability under the model of a label, given the input document for classification:",
        "where Z(x) is shorthand for a normalization constant, summing over all possible class labels.",
        "The task of training such a classifier involves estimating the parameters in Q, given a set of labeled instances L = {(x(1),y(1))}L=1.",
        "To do this, we use a Dirichlet prior and take the expectation of each parameter with respect to the posterior, which is a simple way to estimate a multinomial (Heckerman, 1995).",
        "In other words, we count the fraction oftimes the word fk occurs in the labeled set among documents of class yj, and the prior adds mjk \"hallucinated\" occurrences for a smoothed version of the maximum likelihood estimate:",
        "Here, mjk is the prior for word fk under class yj,",
        "G {0,1} indicates the true labeling of the ith document in the training set, and Z(fk) is a normalization constant summing over all words in the vocabulary.",
        "Typically, a uniform prior is used, such as the Laplacian (a value of 1 for all mjk).",
        "Class parameters Qj are estimated a similar way, by counting the fraction of documents that are labeled with that class, subject to a prior mj.",
        "This prior is important in the event that no documents are yet labeled with yj, which can be quite common early on in the active learning process.",
        "Recall that our scenario lets human annotators provide not only document labels, but feature labels as well.",
        "To make use of this additional information, we assume that labeling the word fk with a class yj increases the probability P(fk|yj) of the word appearing in documents of that class.",
        "The natural interpretation of this under our model is to increase the prior mjk for the corresponding multinomial.",
        "To do this we introduce a new parameter a, and define the elements of the Dirichlet prior as follows:",
        "= J 1 + a if fk is labeled with yj, mjk = 1 otherwise.",
        "This approach is extremely flexible, and offers three particular advantages over the previous \"pooling multinomials\" approach for incorporating feature labels into MNB (Melville et al., 2009).",
        "The pooling multinomials algorithm averages together two sets of Qjk parameters: one that is estimated from labeled data, and another derived from feature labels under the assumption of a boolean output variable (treating labeled features are \"polarizing\" factors).",
        "Therefore, pooling multinomials can only be applied to binary classification tasks, while our method works equally well for problems with multiple classes.",
        "The second advantage is that feature labels need not be mutually exclusive, so the word \"score\" could be labeled with both baseball and hockey, if necessary (e.g., if the task also includes several non-sports labels).",
        "Finally, our framework allows users to conceivably provide feature-specific priors ajk to, for example, imply that the word \"inning\" is a stronger indicator for baseball than the word \"score\" (which is a more general sports term).",
        "However, we leave this aspect for future work and employ the fixed-a approach as described above in this study.",
        "In addition to document and feature labels, we usually have access to a large unlabeled corpus.",
        "In fact, these texts form the pool of possible instance queries in active learning.",
        "We can take advantage of this additional data in generative models like MNB by employing the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.",
        "Combining EM with pool-based active learning was previously studied in the context of instance labeling (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), and we extend the method to our interactive scenario, which supports feature labeling as well.",
        "First, we estimate initial parameters Q' as in Section 2.1, but using only the priors (and no instances).",
        "Then, we apply the induced classifier on the unlabeled pool U = {x(u)}^=1 (Eq.",
        "1).",
        "This is the \"E\" step of EM.",
        "Next we re-estimate feature multinomials Qjk, using both labeled instances from L and probabilistically-labeled instances from U (Eq.",
        "2).",
        "In other words, P(yj|x) G {0,1} for x G L, and P (yj |x) = Pe' (yj |x) for x G U.",
        "We also weight the data in U by a factor of 0.1, so as not to overwhelm the training signal coming from true instance labels in L. Class parameters Qj are re-estimated in the analogous fashion.",
        "This is the \"M\" step.",
        "For speed and interactivity, we actually stop training after this first iteration.",
        "When feature labels are available, we found that EM generally converges in four to 10 iterations, requiring more training time but rarely improving accuracy (the largest gains consistently come in the first iteration).",
        "Also, we ignore labeled data in the initial estimation of Q' because L is too small early in active learning to yield good results with EM.",
        "Perhaps this can be improved by using an ensemble (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), but that comes at further computational expense.",
        "Feature labels, on the other hand, seem generally more reliable for probabilistically labeling U.",
        "The final algorithmic component to our system is the selection of informative queries (i.e., unlabeled words and documents) to present to the annotator.",
        "Querying instances is the traditional mode of active learning, and is well-studied in the literature; see Settles (2009) for a review.",
        "In this work we use entropy-based uncertainty sampling, which ranks all instances in U by the posterior class entropy under the model He (Y |x) = - Ej Pe (yj |x)log Pe (yj |x), and asks the user to label the top D unlabeled documents.",
        "This simple heuristic is an approximation to querying the instance with the maximum information gain (since the class entropy, once labeled, is zero), under the assumption that each x is representative of the underlying natural data distribution.",
        "Moreover, it is extremely fast to compute, which is important for our interactive environment.",
        "Querying features, though, is a newer idea with significantly less research behind it.",
        "Previous work has either assumed that (1) features are not assigned to classes, but instead flagged for \"relevance\" to the task (Godbole et al., 2004; Raghavan et al., 2006), or (2) feature queries are posed just like instance queries: a word is presented to the annotator, who must choose among the labels (Druck et al., 2009; Attenberg et al., 2010).",
        "Recall from Figure 1 that we want to organize feature queries into columns by class label.",
        "This means our active learner must produce queries that are class-specific.",
        "To select these feature queries, we first rank elements in the vocabulary by information gain (IG):",
        "where Ik G {0,1} is a variable indicating the presence or absence of a feature.",
        "This is essentially the common feature-selection method for identifying the most salient features in text classification (Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "However, we use both L and probabilistically-labeled instances from U to compute 1G(fk), to better reflect what the model believes it has learned.",
        "To organize queries into classes, we take the top V unlabeled features and pose fk for the class yj with which it occurs most frequently, as well as any other class with which it occurs at least 75% as often.",
        "Intuitively, this approach (1) queries features that the model believes are most informative, and (2) automatically identifies classes that seem most correlated.",
        "To our knowledge, DUALIST is the first active learning environment with both of these properties."

        "For clarity, vertical axes are scaled differently for each corpus, but held constant across all users.",
        "The thin dashed lines at the top of each plot represents the idealized fully-supervised accuracy.",
        "Horizontal axes show labeling cost in terms of actual elapsed annotation time (in seconds).",
        "dual configuration yields consistently better learning curves than either active or passive learning with instances alone, often getting within 90% of fully-supervised accuracy (in under six minutes).",
        "The only two exceptions make interesting (and different) case studies.",
        "User 4 only provided four labeled features in the Movie Review corpus, which partially explains the similarity in performance to the instance-only cases.",
        "Moreover, these were manually-added features, i.e., he never answered any of the classifier's feature queries, thus depriving the learner of the information it requested.",
        "User 5, on the other hand, never manually added features and only answered queries.",
        "With the WebKB corpus, however, he apparently found feature queries for the course label to be easier than the other classes, and 71% of all his feature labels came from that class (sometimes noisily, e.g., \"instructor\" might also indicate faculty pages).",
        "This imbalance ultimately biased the learner toward the course label, which led to classification errors.",
        "These pathological cases represent potential pitfalls that could be alleviated with additional user studies and training.",
        "However, we note that the active dual interface is not particularly worse in these cases, it is simply not significantly better, as in the other 13 trials.",
        "Feature queries were less costly than instances, which is consistent with findings in previous work least expensive actions in these experiments were labeling (mean 3.2 seconds) and unlabeling (1.8s) features, while manually adding new features took only slightly longer (5.9s).",
        "The most expensive actions were labeling (10.8s) and ignoring (9.9s) instance queries.",
        "Interestingly, we observed that the human annotators spent most of the first three minutes performing feature-labeling actions (Mm), and switched to more instance-labeling activity for the final three minutes ( ■iilll ).",
        "As hypothesized in Section 3.2, it seems that the active learner is exhausting the most salient feature queries early on, and users begin to focus on more interpretable instance queries over time.",
        "However, more study (and longer annotation periods) are warranted to better understand this phenomenon, which may suggest additional user interface design improvements.",
        "We also saw surprising trends in annotation quality.",
        "In active settings, users made an average of one instance-labeling error per trial (relative to the goldstandard labels), but in the passive case this rose to 1.6, suggesting they are more accurate on the active queries.",
        "However, they also explicitly ignored more instances in the active dual condition (7.7) than either active instance (5.9) or passive (2.5), indicating that they find these queries more ambiguous.",
        "This seems reasonable, since these are the instances the classifier is least certain about.",
        "But if we look at the time users spent on these actions, they are much faster to label/ignore (9.7s/7.5s) in the active dual scenario than in the active instance (10.0s/10.7s) or passive (12.3s/15.4s) cases, which means they are being more efficient.",
        "The differences in time between dual and passive are statistically significant.",
        "Here we discuss the application of DUALIST to a few other natural language processing tasks.",
        "This section is not meant to show its superiority relative to other methods, but rather to demonstrate the flexibility and potential of our approach in a variety of problems in human language technology.",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of determining which meaning of a word is being used in a particular context (e.g., \"hard\" in the sense of a challenging task vs. a marble floor).",
        "We asked a user to employ DUALIST for 10 minutes for each of three benchmark WSD corpora (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004): Hard (3 senses), Line (6 senses), and Serve (4 senses).",
        "Each instance represents a sentence using the ambiguous word, and features are lowercased unigram and bigram terms from the surrounding context in the sentence.",
        "The learned models' prediction accuracies (on the sentences not labeled by the user) were: 83.0%, 78.4%, and 78.7% for Hard, Line, and Serve (respectively), which appears to be comparable to recent supervised learning results in the WSD literature on these data sets.",
        "However, our results were achieved in less than 10 minutes of effort each, by labeling an average of 76 sentences and 32 words or phrases per task (compared to the thousands of labeled training sentences used in previous work).",
        "DUALIST is also well-suited to a kind of large-scale information extraction known as semantic class learning: given a set of semantic categories and a very large unlabeled text corpus, learn to populate a knowledge base with words or phrases that belong to each class (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Carlson et al., 2010).",
        "For this task, we first processed 500 million English Web pages from the ClueWeb09 corpus (Callan and Hoy, 2009) by using a shallow parser.",
        "Then we represented noun phrases (e.g., \"Al Gore,\" \"World Trade Organization,\" \"upholstery\") as instances, using a vector of their co-occurrences with heuristic contextual patterns (e.g., \"visit to X\" or \"X's mission\") as well as a few orthographic patterns (e.g., capitalization, head nouns, affixes) as features.",
        "We filtered out instances or contexts that occurred fewer than 200 times in the corpus, resulting in 49,923 noun phrases and 87,760 features.",
        "We then had a user annotate phrases and patterns into five semantic classes using DUALIST: person, location, organization, date/time, and other (the background or null class).",
        "The user began by inserting simple hyponym patterns (Hearst, 1992) for their corresponding classes (e.g., \"people such as X\" for person, or \"organizations like X\" for organization) and proceeded from there for 20 minutes.",
        "Since there was no gold-standard for evaluation, we randomly sampled 300 predicted extractions for each of the four non-null classes, and hired human evaluators using the Amazon Mechanical Turk serviceto estimate precision.",
        "Each instance was assigned to three evaluators, using majority vote to score for correctness.",
        "Table 2 shows the estimated precision, total extracted instances, and the number of user-labeled features and instances for each class.",
        "While there is room for improvement (published results for this kind of task are often above 80% precision), it is worth noting that in this experiment the user did not provide any initial \"seed examples\" for each class, which is fairly common in semantic class learning.",
        "In practice, such additional seeding should help, as the active learner acquired 115 labeled instances for the null class, but fewer than a dozen for each nonnull class (in the first 20 minutes).",
        "There is growing interest in language analysis for online social media services such as Twitter(Petrovic et al., 2010; Ritter et al., 2010), which allows users to broadcast short messages limited to 140 characters.",
        "Two basic but interesting tasks in this domain are (1) language filtering and (2) sentiment classification, both of which are difficult because of the extreme brevity and informal use of language in the messages.",
        "Even though Twitter attempts to provide language metadata for its \"tweets,\" English is the default setting for most users, so about 35% of English-tagged tweets are actually in a different language.",
        "Furthermore, the length constraints encourage acronyms, emphatic misspellings, and orthographic shortcuts even among English-speaking users, so many tweets in English actually contain no proper English words (e.g., \"OMG ur sooo gr8!!",
        "#luvya\").",
        "This may render existing lexicon-based language filters – and possibly character n-gram filters – ineffective.",
        "To quickly build an English-language filter for Twitter, we sampled 150,000 tweets from the Twitter Streaming API and asked an annotator spend 10 minutes with DUALIST labeling English and non-English messages and features.",
        "Features were represented as unigrams and bigrams without any stop-word filtering, plus a few Twitter-specific features such as emoticons (text-based representations of facial expressions such as :) or :( used to convey feeling or tone), the presence of anonymized usernames (preceded by '@') or URL links, and hashtags (compound words preceded by '#' and used to label messages, e.g., \"#loveit\").",
        "Following the same methodology as Section 3.4.2, we evaluated 300 random predictions using the Mechanical Turk service.",
        "The estimated accuracy of the trained language filter was 85.2% (inter-annotator agreement among the evaluators was 94.3%).",

        "We have presented DUALIST, a new type of dual-strategy annotation interface for semi-supervised active learning.",
        "To support this dual-query interface, we developed a novel, fast, and practical semi-supervised learning algorithm, and demonstrated how users can employ it to rapidly develop useful natural language systems for a variety of tasks.",
        "For several of these applications, the interactively-trained systems are able to achieve 90% of state-of-the-art performance after only a few minutes of labeling effort on the part of a human annotator.",
        "By releasing DUALIST as an open-source tool, we hope to facilitate language annotation projects and encourage more user experiments in active learning.",
        "This represents one of the first studies of an active learning system designed to compliment the strengths of both learner and annotator.",
        "Future directions along these lines include user studies of efficient annotation behaviors, which in turn might lead to new types of queries or improvements to the user interface design.",
        "An obvious extension in the natural language domain is to go beyond classification tasks and query domain knowledge for structured prediction in this way.",
        "Another interesting potential application is human-driven active feature induction and engineering, after Della Pietra et al.",
        "(1997).",
        "From a machine learning perspective, there is an open empirical question of how useful the labels gathered by DUALIST's internal naïve Bayes model might be in later training machine learning systems with different inductive biases (e.g., MaxEnt models or decision trees), since the data are not IID.",
        "So far, attempts to \"reuse\" active learning data have yielded mixed results (Lewis and Catlett, 1994; Baldridge and Osborne, 2004).",
        "Practically speaking, DUALIST is designed to run on a single machine, and supports a few hundred thousand instances and features at interactive speeds on modern hardware.",
        "Distributed data storage (Chang et al., 2008) and parallelized learning algorithms (Chu et al., 2007) may help scale this approach into the millions.",
        "Finally, modifying the learning algorithm to better cope with violated independence assumptions may be necessary for interesting language applications beyond those presented here.",
        "TAN-Trees (Friedman et al., 1997), for example, might be able to accomplish this while retaining speed and interactivity.",
        "Alternatively, one could imagine online stochastic learning algorithms for discriminatively-trained classifiers, which are semi-supervised and can exploit feature labels.",
        "To our knowledge, such flexible and efficient learning algorithms do not currently exist, but they could be easily incorporated into the DUALIST framework in the future."
