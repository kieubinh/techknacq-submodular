        "The accuracy and speed of state-of-the-art dependency parsers has motivated a resumed interest in utilizing the output of parsing as an input to many downstream natural language processing tasks.",
        "This includes work on question answering (Wang et al., 2007), sentiment analysis (Nakagawa et al., 2010), MT reordering (Xu et al., 2009), and many other tasks.",
        "In most cases, the accuracy of parsers degrades when run on out-of-domain data (Gildea, 2001; McClosky et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Petrov et al., 2010).",
        "But these accuracies are measured with respect to gold-standard out-of-domain parse trees.",
        "There are few tasks that actually depend on the complete parse tree.",
        "Furthermore, when evaluated on a downstream task, often the optimal parse output has a model score lower than the best parse as predicted by the parsing model.",
        "While this means that we are not properly modeling the downstream task in the parsers, it also means that there is some information from small task or domain-specific data sets which could help direct our search for optimal parameters during parser training.",
        "The goal being not necessarily to obtain better parse performance, but to exploit the structure induced from human labeled treebank data while targeting specific extrinsic metrics of quality, which can include task specific metrics or external weak constraints on the parse structure.",
        "One obvious approach to this problem is to employ parser reranking (Collins, 2000).",
        "In such a setting, an auxiliary reranker is added in a pipeline following the parser.",
        "The standard setting involves training the base parser and applying it to a development set (this is often done in a cross-validated jackknife training framework).",
        "The reranker can then be trained to optimize for the downstream or extrinsic objective.",
        "While this will bias the reranker towards the target task, it is limited by the oracle performance of the original base parser.",
        "In this paper, we propose a training algorithm for statistical dependency parsers (Kubler et al., 2009) in which a single model is jointly optimized for a regular supervised training objective over the treebank data as well as a task-specific objective - or more generally an extrinsic objective - on an additional data set.",
        "The case where there are both gold-standard trees and a task-specific objective for the entire training set is a specific instance of the larger problem that we address here.",
        "Specifically, the algorithm takes the form of an online learner where a training instance is selected and the parameters are optimized based on the objective function associated with the instance (either intrinsic or extrinsic), thus jointly optimizing multiple objectives.",
        "An update schedule trades-off the relative importance of each objective function.",
        "We call our algorithm augmented-loss training as it optimizes multiple losses to augment the traditional supervised parser loss.",
        "There have been a number of efforts to exploit weak or external signals of quality to train better prediction models.",
        "This includes work on generalized expectation (Mann and McCallum, 2010), posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010) and constraint driven learning (Chang et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2010).",
        "The work of Chang et al.",
        "(2007) on constraint driven learning is perhaps the closest to our framework and we draw connections to it in Section 5.",
        "In these studies the typical goal is to use the weak signal to improve the structured prediction models on the intrinsic evaluation metrics.",
        "For our setting this would mean using weak application specific signals to improve dependency parsing.",
        "Though we explore such ideas in our experiments, in particular for semi-supervised domain adaptation, we are primarily interested in the case where the weak signal is precisely what we wish to optimize, but also desire the benefit from using both data with annotated parse structures and data specific to the task at hand to guide parser training.",
        "In Section 2 we outline the augmented-loss algorithm and provide a convergence analysis.",
        "In Section 3 and 4 we present a set of experiments defining diffent augmented losses covering a task-specific extrinsic loss (MT reordering), a domain adaptation loss, and an alternate intrinsic parser loss.",
        "In all cases we show the augmented-loss framework can lead to significant gains in performance.",
        "In Section 5 we tie our augmented-loss algorithm to other frameworks for encoding auxiliary information and/or joint objective optimization."

        "tence xi and an output yi; and 2) a loss-function, L(y,y), that measures the cost of predicting output y relative to the gold standard y and is usually the 0/1 loss (Collins, 2002).",
        "For dependency parser training, this set-up consists of input sentences x and the corresponding gold dependency tree y G yx, where YX is the space of possible parse trees for sentence x.",
        "In the perceptron setting, Fe (x) = arg maxyeyx 9 • $(y) where $ is mapping from a parse tree y for sentence x to a high dimensional feature space.",
        "Learning proceeds by predicting a structured output given the current model, and if that structure is incorrect, updating the model: rewarding features that fire in the gold-standard $(yi), and discounting features that fire in the predicted output, $(yi).",
        "The structured perceptron, as given in Algorithm 1, only updates when there is a positive loss, meaning that there was a prediction mistake.",
        "For the moment we will abstract away from details such as the precise definition of F(x) and $(y).",
        "We will show in the next section that our augmented-loss method is general and can be applied to any dependency parsing framework that can be trained by the perceptron algorithm, such as transition-based parsers (Nivre, 2008; Zhang and Clark, 2008) and graph-based parsers (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "The augmented-loss training algorithm that we propose is based on the structured perceptron; however, the augmented-loss training framework is a general mechanism to incorporate multiple loss functions in online learner training.",
        "Algorithm 2 is the pseudocode for the augmented-loss structured perceptron algorithm.",
        "The algorithm is an extension to Algorithm 1 where there are 1) multiple loss functions being evaluated L,..., LM ; 2) there are multiple datasets associated with each of these loss functions D,..., DM ; and 3) there is a schedule for processing examples from each of these datasets, where Sched(j, i) is true if the jth loss function should be updated on the ith iteration of training.",
        "Note that for data point dj = (x, y), which is the ith training instance of the jth data set, that y does not necessarily have to be a dependency tree.",
        "It can either be a task-specific output of interest, a partial tree, or even null, in the case where learning will be guided strictly by the loss Lj.",
        "The training algorithm is effectively the same as the perceptron, the primary difference is that if Lj is an extrinsic loss, we cannot compute the standard updates since we do not necessarily know the correct parse (the line indicated by f).",
        "Section 2.2 shows one method for updating the parser parameters for extrinsic losses.",
        "In the experiments in this paper, we only consider the case where there are two loss functions: a supervised dependency parsing labeled-attachment loss; and an additional loss, examples of which are presented in Section 3.",
        "In order to make Algorithm 2 more concrete, we need a way of defining the loss and resulting parameter updates for the case when Lj is not a standard supervised parsing loss (f from Algorithm 2).",
        "Assume that we have a cost function C(xi,y,yi) which, given a training example (xi, yi) will give a score for a parse y G yXi relative to some output yi.",
        "While we can compute the score for any parse, we are unable to determine the features associated with the optimal parse, as yi need not be a parse tree.",

        "The intuition behind this method is that in the presence of only a cost function and a k-best list, the parameters will be updated towards the parse structure that has the lowest cost, which over time will move the parameters of the model to a place with low extrinsic loss.",

        "Proof.",
        "It must be the case for all (x, y) G D that L(y1;y) = 0 (and y1 is the argmax) after a finite amount of time.",
        "Otherwise, by Assumption 2, there exists some x, such that when it is next processed, there would exist an output in the k-best list that had a lower loss, which will result in an additional mistake.",

        "Theorem 2, when coupled with Theorem 1, implies that augmented-loss learning will make at most R/y mistakes at training, but does not guarantee the rate at which these mistakes will be made, only that convergence is finite, providing that the scheduling time (defined by Sched()) between seeing the same instance is always finite, which is always true in our experiments.",
        "This analysis does not assume anything about the loss L. Every instance (x, y) can use a different loss.",

        "We feel this is a realistic partial labeled training setting where it would be possible to quickly collect a significant amount of data.",
        "To test whether such weak information can significantly improve the parsing of questions, we trained an augmented-loss parser using the training set of the QTB stripped of all dependencies except the dependency from the root to the main verb of the sentence.",
        "In other words, for each sentence, the parser may only observe a single dependency at training from the QTB - the dependency to the main verb.",
        "Our augmented-loss function in this case is a simple binary function: 0 if a parse has the correct root dependency and 1 if it does not.",
        "Thus, the algorithm will select the first parse in the k-best list that has the correct root as the proxy to a gold standard parse.",

        "It is important to point out that these improvements are not limited to simply better root predictions.",
