        "Supervised classification is the predominant technique for a large number of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "The large amount of labeled training data that supervised classification relies on is time-consuming and expensive to create, especially when experts perform the data annotation.",
        "Recently, crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) have become available as an alternative that offers acquisition of non-expert annotations at low cost.",
        "MTurk is a software service that outsources small annotation tasks - called HITs - to a large group of freelance workers.",
        "The cost of MTurk annotation is low, but a consequence of using non-expert annotators is much lower annotation quality.",
        "This requires strategies for quality control of the annotations.",
        "Another promising approach to the data acquisition bottleneck for supervised learning is active learning (AL).",
        "AL reduces annotation effort by setting up an annotation loop where, starting from a small seed set, only the maximally informative examples are chosen for annotation.",
        "With these annotated examples, the classifier is then retrained to again select more informative examples for further annotation.",
        "In general, AL needs a lot fewer annotations to achieve a desired performance level than random sampling.",
        "AL has been successfully applied to a number of NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging (Ringger et al., 2007), parsing (Osborne and Baldridge, 2004), text classification (Tong and Koller, 2002), sentiment detection (Brew et al., 2010), and named entity recognition (NER) (Tomanek et al., 2007).",
        "Until recently, most AL studies focused on simulating the annotation process by using already available gold standard data.",
        "In reality, however, human annotators make mistakes, leading to noise in the annotations.",
        "For this reason, some authors have questioned the applicability of AL to noisy annotation scenarios such as MTurk (Baldridge and Palmer, 2009; Re-hbeinetal.,2010).",
        "AL and crowdsourcing are complementary approaches: AL reduces the number of annotations used while crowdsourcing reduces the cost per annotation.",
        "Combined, the two approaches could substantially lower the cost of creating training sets.",
        "Our main contribution in this paper is that we show for the first time that AL is significantly better than randomly selected annotation examples in a real crowdsourcing annotation scenario.",
        "Our experiments directly address two tasks, named entity recognition and sentiment detection, but our evidence suggests that AL is of general benefit in crowdsourcing.",
        "We also show that the effectiveness of MTurk annotation with AL can be further enhanced by using two techniques that increase label quality: adaptive voting and fragment recovery."

        "Furthermore, they only evaluate their approach in simulations.",
        "We use the actual labels of human annotators to avoid the risk of unrealistic assumptions when modeling annotators.",

        "While AL generally is superior to this baseline in simulated experiments, it is not clear that this result carries over to crowdsourcing annotation.",
        "Crowdsourcing differs in a number of ways from simulated experiments: the dificulty and annotation consistency of examples drawn by AL differs from that drawn by random sampling; crowdsourcing labels are noisy; and because of the noisiness of labels statistical classiiers behave differently in simulated and real annotation experiments."

        "One fundamental design criterion for our annotation system was the ability to select examples in real time to support, e.g., the interactive annotation experiments presented in this paper.",
        "Thus, we could not use the standard MTurk workflow or services like CrowdFlower.",

        "'http ://crowdflower.com/",
        "feature of MTurk.",
        "An external question contains an URL to our frontend web application, which is queried when a worker views an annotation task.",
        "Our frontend then in turn queries our backend component for an example to be annotated and renders it in HTML.",
        "The backend component is responsible for selection of an example to be annotated in response to a worker's request for an annotation task.",
        "The back-end implements a diverse choice of random and active selection strategies as well as the multilabel-ing strategies described in section 3.2.",
        "The backend component runs as a standalone server and is queried by the frontend via REST-like HTTP calls.",
        "For the NER task, we present one sentence per HIT, segmented into tokens, with a select box underneath each token containing the classes.",
        "The definition of the classes is based on the CoNLL-2003 annotation guidelines (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-der, 2003).",
        "Examples were given for every class.",
        "Annotators are forced to make a selection for uppercase tokens.",
        "Lowercase tokens are prelabeled with \"O\" (no named entity), but annotators are encouraged to change this label if the token is in fact part of an entity phrase.",
        "For sentiment annotation, we found in preliminary experiments that using simple radio button selection for the choice of the document label (positive or negative) leads to a very high amount of spam submissions, taking the overall classification accuracy down to around 55%.",
        "We then designed a template that forced annotators to type the label as well as a randomly chosen word from the text.",
        "Individual label accuracy was around 75% in this scheme.",
        "AL works by setting up an interactive annotation loop where at each iteration, the most informative example is selected for annotation.",
        "We use a pool-based AL setup where the most informative example is selected from a pool of unlabeled examples.",
        "Informativeness is calculated as uncertainty (Lewis and Gale, 1994) using the margin metric (Schein and Ungar, 2007).",
        "This metric chooses examples for which the margin of probabilities from the classifier between the two most probable classes is the smallest:",
        "Here, xn is the instance to be classified, c\\ and C2 are the two most likely classes, and P the classifier's estimate of probability.",
        "For NER, the margins of the tokens are averaged to get an uncertainty assessment of the sentence.",
        "For sentiment, whole documents are classified, thus uncertainties can be used directly.",
        "After annotation, the selected example is removed from the unlabeled pool and, together with its labels), added to the set of labeled examples.",
        "The classifier is then retrained on the labeled examples and the informativeness of the remaining examples in the pool is re-evaluated.",
        "Depending on the classifier and the sizes of pool and labeled set, retraining and réévaluation can take some time.",
        "To minimize wait times, traditional AL implementations select examples in batches of the n most informative examples.",
        "However, batch selection might not give the optimum selection (examples in a batch are likely to be redundant, see Brinker (2003)) and wait times can still occur between one batch and the next.",
        "When performing annotation with MTurk, wait times are unacceptable.",
        "Thus, we perform the retraining and uncertainty rescoring concurrently with the annotation user interface.",
        "The unlabeled pool is stored in a priority queue that is ordered according to the examples' informativeness.",
        "The annotation user interface takes the most informative example from the pool and presents it to the annotator.",
        "The labeled example is then inserted into a second queue that feeds and updates retraining and rescoring processes.",
        "The pool queue then is resorted according to the new informativeness.",

        "This is similar toHaertel etal.",
        "(2010).",
        "MTurk labels often have a high error rate.",
        "A common strategy for improving label quality is to acquire multiple labels by different workers for each example and then consolidate the annotations into a single label of higher quality.",

        "Most AL work assumes constant cost per annotation unit.",

        "For our concurrent NER system, the average staleness of an example was about 12 (min: 1, max: 40), for sentiment it was about 2.",
        "The figure for NER is higher than the number cited by Haertel et al.",
        "(2010) because there are more annotators accessing our system at the same time via MTurk but not as high for sentiment since documents are longer and retraining the sentiment classifier is faster.",
        "The average staleness of an example in a batch-mode system is half the batch size.",
        "Thus, we set the batch size of our comparison system to 25 for NER and to 4 for sentiment.",

        "(ii) intermediate effect of noise on example selection - we see in Figure 3 that (i) has a large effect on NER whereas (ii) has a noticeable, but small effect.",
        "For example, at 1966 sentences, F\\ scores are 70.6 (MTurk-MTurk), 81.4 (MTurk-gold) and 84.9 (gold-gold).",
        "This means that a performance difference of 10 points Fi has to be attributed to noisy labels resulting in a worse final classifier (effect i), and another 3.5 points are lost due to suboptimal example selection (effect ii).",
        "For sentiment, the results are different.",
        "There is no clear difference between the three runs.",
        "We attribute this to the fact that the quality of the labels is higher in sentiment than in NER.",
        "Our initial experiments on sentiment were all negative (showing no improvement of AL compared to random) because label quality was too low.",
        "Only after we introduced the template described in Section 3 and used 4-voting with a = .75 did we get positive results for AL.",
        "This leads to an overall label quality of about 90% (over all runs) which is so high that the difference to using gold labels is small if present at all."

        "Some workers submit only one or two HITs just to try out the task.",
        "For NER, the majority of workers submit between 5 and 10 sentences, with label qualities between 0.5 and 0.8.",
        "The chance level for correctness is around 0.25 (four different named entity categories for uppercase tokens).",
        "For sentiment, most workers submit 1 to 5 documents, with label qualities between 0.5 and 1.",
        "Chance level lies at around 0.5 (for two equally distributed labels).",
        "While quality for highly productive workers is mediocre in our experiments, other researchers have found extremely bad quality for their most prolific workers (Callison-Burch, 2009).",
        "Some of these workers might be spammers who try to submit answers with automatic scripts.",
        "We encountered some spammers that our heuristics did not detect (shown in the bottom-right areas of Figure 4, left), but the voting mechanism was able to mitigate their negative influence.",
        "Given the large variation in Figure 4, using worker quality in crowdsourcing for improved training set creation seems promising.",
        "We now test two such strategies for NER in an oracle setup.",
        "A simple approach is to refuse annotations from workers that have been determined to provide low quality answers.",
        "We simulated this strategy on NER data using oracle quality ratings.",
        "We chose NER because of its lower overall label quality.",
        "The results are presented in Figure 5 for random (a) and AL (b).",
        "For random, quality filtering with low cutoffs helps by removing bad annotations that likely come from spammers.",
        "While the voting strategy prevented a performance decrease with bad annotations, it needed to expend many extra annotations for correction.",
        "With filtering, these extra annotations become unnecessary and the system can learn faster.",
        "When low-quality workers are less active, as in the AL dataset, we find no meaningful performance increase for low cutoffs up to 0.4.",
        "For very high cutoffs (0.7), the beginning of the performance curve shows that further cost reductions can be achieved.",
        "However, we did not have enough recorded human annotations available to perform a simulation for the full budget.",
        "The complementary approach is to take annotations from highly rated workers at face value and immediately accept them as the correct label, bypassing the voting procedure.",
        "Bypassing saves the cost of repeated annotation of the same sentence.",
        "Figure 5 shows learning curves for two bypass thresholds on worker quality (measured as proportion of correct non-O tokens) for random (c) and AL (d).",
        "Bypassing performs surprisingly well.",
        "We find a steeper rise of the learning curve, meaning less cost for the same performance.",
        "Not only do we find substantial cost reductions, but also higher overall performance.",
        "We believe this is because high-quality annotations can sometimes be voted down by other annotations.",
        "If we can identify high-quality workers and directly use their annotations, this can be avoided.",
        "These experiments are oracle experiments using gold data that is normally not available.",
        "In future work, we would like to repeat the experiments using methods for worker quality estimation (Ipeirotis et al., 2010; Donmez et al., 2009).",
        "For AL, the choice as to which labels are used (as a result ofvoting, bypassing or other) also has an influence on the selection.",
        "However, we had to keep the sequence of the selected sentences fixed in the simulations reported above.",
        "While our method of sample selection for AL proved to be quite robust even in the presence of noise, higher quality labels do have an influence on the sample selection (see section 4.4), so the improvement could be even better than indicated here.",
        "The essence of AL is to select examples that are difficult to classify.",
        "As observed in our experiments on annotation time, this difficulty is reflected in the amount of time a human needs to work on examples selected through AL.",
        "Another effect to expect from difficulty could be lower annotation accuracy.",
        "We therefore examined the accuracies for each worker who contributed to both the AL and the random experiment.",
        "We found that in the NER task, the 20 workers in this group had a slightly higher (0.07) average quality for randomly selected examples.",

        "Thus AL not only reduces annotation costs, but also offers an improvement in absolute performance for these tasks.",
