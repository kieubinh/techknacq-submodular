        "to many challenging research problems and practical applications.",
        "Two fundamental problems in opinion mining are opinion lexicon expansion and opinion target extraction (Liu 2006; Pang and Lee 2008).",
        "An opinion lexicon is a list of opinion words such as good, excellent, poor,andbad which are used to indicate positive or negative sentiments.",
        "It forms the foundation of many opinion mining tasks, for example, sentence (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003; Kim and Hovy 2004) and document (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Turney 2002) sentiment classification, and feature-based opinion summarization (Hu and Liu 2004).",
        "Although there are several opinion lexicons publicly available, it is hard, if not impossible, to maintain a universal opinion lexicon to cover all domains as opinion expressions vary significantly from domain to domain.",
        "A word can be positive in one domain but has no opinion or even negative opinion in another domain.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to expand a known opinion lexicon for applications in different domains using text corpora from the corresponding domains.",
        "Opinion targets are topics on which opinions are expressed.",
        "They are important because without knowing the targets, the opinions expressed in a sentence or document are of limited use.",
        "For example, in the opinion sentence I am not happy with the battery life ofthis phone, battery life is the target of the opinion.",
        "If we do not know that, this opinion is of little value.",
        "Although several researchers have studied the opinion lexicon expansion and opinion target extraction (also known as topic, feature, or aspect extraction) problems, their algorithms either need additional and external resources or impose strong constraints and are of limited success.",
        "Detailed discussions of existing works will be given in Section 2.",
        "In this article, we propose a novel propagation based method to solve the opinion lexicon expansion and target extraction problems simultaneously.",
        "Our approach differs from existing approaches in that it requires no additional resources except an initial seed opinion lexicon, which is readily available.",
        "Thus, it can be seen as a semi-supervised method due to the use of the seeds.",
        "It is based on the observation that there are natural relations between opinion words and targets due to the fact that opinion words are used to modify targets.",
        "Furthermore, we find that opinion words and targets themselves have relations in opinionated expressions too.",
        "These relations can be identified via a dependency parser based on the dependency grammar (Tesniere 1959), and then exploited to perform the extraction tasks.",
        "The basic idea of our approach is to extract opinion words (or targets) iteratively using known and extracted (in previous iterations) opinion words and targets through the identification of syntactic relations.",
        "The identification of the relations is the key to the extractions.",
        "As our approach propagates information back and forth between opinion words and targets, we call it double propagation.",
        "Opinion word sentiment or polarity assignment (positive, negative, or neutral) and noisy target pruning methods are also designed to refine the initially extracted results.",
        "In evaluation, we compare our approach with several state-of-the-art existing approaches in opinion lexicon expansion (or opinion word extraction) and target (or feature/topic) extraction.",

        "Our work is related to opinion word extraction and target (or topic) extraction in opinion mining.",
        "Extensive work has been done on sentiment analysis at word, expression (Breck, Choi, and Cardie 2007; Takamura, Inui, and Okumura 2007), sentence (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003; Kim and Hovy 2004) and document (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Turney 2002) levels.",
        "We only describe work at word level as it is most relevant to our work.",
        "In general, the existing work can be categorized as corpora-based (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997; Wiebe 2000; Wiebe et al.",
        "2004; Turney and Littman 2003; Kanayama and Nasukawa 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa 2007) and dictionary-based (Hu and Liu 2004; Kim and Hovy 2004; Kamps et al.",
        "2004; Esuli and Sebastiani 2005; Takamura, Inui, and Okumura 2005) approaches.",
        "Our work falls into the corpora-based category.",
        "Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) proposed the first method for determining adjective polarities or orientations (positive, negative, and neutral).",
        "The method predicts orientations of adjectives by detecting pairs of such words conjoined by conjunc-tionssuchasand and or in a large document set.",
        "The underlying intuition is that the orientations of conjoined adjectives are subject to some linguistic constraints.",
        "For example, in the sentence This car is beautiful and spacious, if we know that beautiful is positive, we can infer that spacious is positive too.",
        "The weakness of this method is that as it relies on the conjunction relations it is unable to extract adjectives that are not conjoined.",
        "Wiebe (2000) and Wiebe et al.",
        "(2004) proposed an approach to finding subjective adjectives using the results of word clustering according to their distributional similarity.",
        "However, they did not tackle the prediction of sentiment polarities of the found subjective adjectives.",
        "Turney and Littman (2003) compute the point wise mutual information (PMI) of the target term with each seed positive and negative term as a measure of their semantic association.",
        "Their work requires additional access to the Web (or any other corpus similar to the Web to ensure sufficient coverage), which is time consuming.",
        "Another recent corpora-based approach is proposed by Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006).",
        "Their work first uses clause level context coherency to find candidates, then uses a statistical estimation method to determine whether the candidates are appropriate opinion words.",
        "Their method for finding candidates would have low recall if the occurrences of seed words in the data are infrequent or an unknown opinion word has no known opinion words in its context, however.",
        "Besides, the statistical estimation can be unreliable if the corpus is small, which is a common problem for statistical approaches.",
        "We will compare our approach with this approach in our experiments.",
        "In dictionary-based approaches, Kamps et al.",
        "(2004) take advantage of WordNet to construct a synonymy network by connecting pairs of synonymous words.",
        "The semantic orientation of a word is decided by its shortest paths to two seed words good and bad which are chosen as representatives of positive and negative orientations.",
        "Esuli and Sebastiani (2005) use text classification techniques to classify orientations.",
        "Their method is based on the glosses (textual definitions) in an on-line \"glossary\" or dictionary.",
        "The work of Takamura, Inui, and Okumura (2005) also exploits the gloss information from dictionaries.",
        "The method constructs a lexical network by linking two words if one appears in the gloss of the other.",
        "The weights of links reflect if these two connected words are of the same orientation.",
        "The works of Hu and Liu (2004) and Kim and Hovy (2004) are simpler as they simply used synonyms and antonyms.",
        "However, all dictionary-based methods are unable to find domain dependent sentiment words because most entries in dictionaries are domain-independent.",
        "For example, unpredictable is often a positive opinion word in movie reviews, as in unpredictable plot, but in car reviews unpredictable is likely to be negative, as in unpredictable steering.",
        "Our approach extracts opinion words using domain dependent corpora; thus we are able to find domain-dependent opinion words.",
        "Opinion target (or topic) extraction is a difficult task in opinion mining.",
        "Several methods have been proposed, mainly in the context of product review mining (Hu and Liu 2004; Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Kobayashi, Inui, and Matsumoto 2007; Mei et al.",
        "2007; Scaffidi et al.",
        "2007; Wong, Lam, and Wong 2008; Stoyanov and Cardie 2008).",
        "In this mining task, opinion targets usually refer to product features, which are defined as product components or attributes, as in Liu (2006).",
        "In the work of Hu and Liu (2004), frequent nouns and noun phrases are treated as product feature candidates.",
        "In our work, we also extract only noun targets.",
        "Different pruning methods are proposed to remove the noise.",
        "To cover infrequent features that are missed, they regard the nearest nouns/noun phrases of the opinion words identified by frequent features as infrequent features.",
        "In Popescu and Etzioni (2005), the authors investigated the same problem.",
        "Their extraction method, however, requires that the product class is known in advance.",
        "The algorithm determines whether a noun/noun phrase is a feature by computing the PMI score between the phrase and class-specific discriminators through a Web search.",
        "Querying the Web is a problem, as discussed earlier.",
        "We will compare these two representative methods with our approach in the experiments.",
        "In Scaffidi et al.",
        "(2007), the authors proposed a language model approach to product feature extraction with the assumption that product features are mentioned more often in a product review than they are mentioned in general English text.",
        "However, statistics may not be reliable when the corpus is small, as pointed out earlier.",
        "The recent work by Kobayashi, Inui, and Matsumoto (2007) focused on the aspect-evaluation (aspect and evaluation mean the opinion target and opinion word respectively in our context) and aspect-of extraction problems in blogs.",
        "Their aspect-evaluation extraction uses syntactic patterns learned via pattern mining to extract (aspect, evaluation) pairs.",
        "Our work differs from theirs in that we make use of syntactic relations from dependency trees.",
        "Additionally, we consider not only the relations of opinion targets and opinion words, but also many other types of relations, as we will see in Section 3.",
        "In Stoyanov and Cardie (2008), the authors treated target extraction as a topic coreference resolution problem.",
        "The key to their approach is to cluster opinions sharing the same target together.",
        "They proposed to train a classifier to judge if two opinions are on the same target, which indicates that their approach is supervised.",
        "Our work differs from theirs in that our approach is semi-supervised.",
        "Other related work on target extraction mainly uses the idea of topic modeling to capture targets in reviews (Mei et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Topic modeling is to model the generation of a document set and mine the implied topics in the documents.",
        "However, our experiments with topic modeling show that it is only able to find some general or coarse topics in texts and represent them as clusters of words.",
        "Their aim is thus different from our fine-grained opinion target extraction task."

        "In the dependency grammar, a syntactic relation between two words A and B can be described as A (or B) depends on B (or A).",

        "In (a), A depends on B directly and they both depend on H directly in (b).",

        "Some examples are shown in Figures 1 (c) and (d).",
        "In (c), A depends on B through H1; in (d), A depends on H through H1 and B depends on H through H2.",
        "Actually, IDDs denote all possible relations apart from DDs.",
        "Note that DDs and IDDs describe only the topology of all possible dependencies.",

        "2007).",
        "Thus the potential POS tags for opinion words are JJ (adjectives), JJR (comparative adjectives), and JJS (superlative adjectives), whereas those for targets are NN (singular nouns) and NNS (plural nouns).",

        "Our extraction approach adopts the rule-based strategy which is quite natural given the well-defined relations.",

        "Therefore, the polarities of targets inherit those of associated opinion words.",
        "We also consider whether there are negations/contrary words associated with the opinion words (by examining each word in the surrounding 5-word window).",

        "We also observe that these words can cancel the polarity change when they are used together or associated with negations.",

        "As these two potential targets are in the same clause (we identify the boundary of a clause using Minipar) and are not connected by a conjunction, one of them has to be removed.",

        "We set Q = 2, K = 1 in our experiments.",
        "After obtaining the target phrases, we conduct another frequency-based pruning to remove targets that appear only once in the whole opinion data.",
        "This global pruning compensates for the clause pruning in case that a clause contains only one target which is kept no matter what its frequency is.",
        "Note that in clause pruning, it is possible to prune some words in a target phrase (with two or more words), but they will be recovered in this step by the combination as long as one of the words in the phrase is not pruned."

        "We use the customer review collection from Hu and Liu (2004) as the testing data.",
        "The collection contains five review data sets: two on two digital cameras, one on a DVD player, one on an mp3 player, and one on a cell phone.",
        "The detailed information of each review data set is shown in Table 2.",
        "The targets (i.e., product features) in these reviews are already labeled.",
        "Although the opinion expressed on each target in each sentence is also labeled, the polarities (or orientations) of opinion words are not labeled.",
        "In our experiments, we manually labeled the opinion words and their polarities.",
        "The seed opinion lexicon is also provided by Hu and Liu (2004), which contains 654 positive and 1,098 negative opinion words.",
        "3 http://uuu.cs.uic.edu/liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html.",
        "Detailed information of the five review data sets.",
        "Data set Number of reviews Number of sentences",
        "For the comparison of our approach in opinion lexicon expansion, we implemented the approach in Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006; referred to as KN06 hereafter).",
        "Details about this approach were given in Section 2.",
        "We only considered adjectives as the candidates in our experiments because our method is only concerned with adjective opinion words.",
        "As propagation is not performed in KN06, we also implemented a non-propagation version of our approach, in which opinion words are only extracted by the seed words and targets which are extracted by both the seeds and extracted opinion words.",
        "Furthermore, as our tasks can be regarded as a sequential labeling problem (to label if a word is an opinion word, a target, or an ordinary word), we experimented with the conditional random fields (CRF) technique (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001) for extraction, which is a popular information extraction method and has been successfully used in labeling tasks such as POS tagging (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001) and Named Entity Recognition (Finkel, Grenager, and Manning 2005).",
        "The well-known toolkit CRF++ is employed.",
        "We consider two kinds of processing windows, one using the whole sentence (CRF); the other using words between any pair of adjective and noun (CRF-D).",
        "In the first case, we designed seven labels for training, product features, nonfeature nouns, opinion adjectives, non-opinion adjectives, verbs, prepositions/conjunctions,and others.",
        "In the second case, we took advantage of the relations on the shortest dependency path between the two words and used them as labels.",
        "In this way, CRF is made to capture long range dependencies between words.",
        "For both cases, we use the default parameter settings in CRF++.",
        "To train CRF for the extraction task, we use one data set for training and the remaining four sets for testing.",
        "Consequently, we have five runs.",
        "The average results are reported here.",
        "In the set-up of our approaches and KN06, to examine the accuracy in extracting opinion words with different numbers of seeds we divide the initial opinion lexicon into 10 subsets, each with roughly the same number of words.",
        "We call these lists of opinion words the 10p lists.",
        "These ten 10p lists are combined to produce 20p, 50p, and 80p lists which mean 20%, 50%, and 80% of the original set (1,752 opinion words), respectively.",
        "The experiments using four kinds of seed lists are performed separately.",
        "Note that all metrics (precision, recall, and F-score) are computed on the newly extracted opinion words.",

        "CRF and CRF-D are not evaluated against the number of seed opinion words because that results in too few training data for CRF and CRF-D and consequently poorer results.",
        "That is also why their results stay the same for all cases.",
        "Prop-dep is our propagation approach and noProp-dep is the non-propagation version of our technique.",
        "Observing from Figure 4, we can see that our approaches, both propagation and non-propagation versions, outperform others in all the four cases in precision.",
        "This indicates that our rules based on the dependency relations are effective in extracting correct opinion words.",
        "The precision of CRF is low, which means CRF has difficulty in distinguishing ordinary adjectives from opinion ones.",
        "The better performance of CRF-D over CRF indicates that long-range dependency relations are helpful.",
        "KN06 is reported to have around 60% precision in the Japanese test data, but it does not perform as well in our experiments.",
        "One reason could be that the statistical estimation of KN06 measures a word's positive or negative occurrences compared to its total occurrences, which can introduce unreliability if words are infrequent when the corpus is small.",
        "Considering the size of the testing data in our experiments (which is much smaller than theirs), the estimation can be quite unreliable.",
        "Many infrequent non-opinion words are identified as opinion words, which lowers the precision.",
        "In our technique, rules are applied in terms of single sentences.",
        "Thus it is not sensitive to the size of the testing data.",
        "Another observation is that in our approaches, the best performance is gained at 10p rather than 80p.",
        "This is because at 80p most of the opinion words are already known (in the seed list) and the number of remaining ones to be extracted is small and they are usually harder to identify.",
        "From Figure 5, we can see that our approach makes significant improvement over others in recall except CRF-D. Clearly, the propagation is at work.",
        "In the 10p case, the new opinion words extracted by our approach could cover almost 75% of the whole opinion set whereas the corresponding seed words only cover 8% of the opinion words in the data (see the Init line).",
        "Thus our propagation method is quite powerful in identifying a large number of new opinion words.",
        "We also notice that the results do not change dramatically in different cases (all around 75%), which shows that the propagation performs steadily in extracting new opinion words with a different number of seeds (although it does introduce more noise as the number of seeds increases, as shown in Figure 4.).",
        "CRF is found to cover only about 30% of the opinion words.",
        "Technically, CRF captures only local patterns rather than long-range patterns.",
        "Many dependency relationships are long range (i.e., there are many words between the opinion word and the feature that it modifies), which explains the weak performance of CRF.",
        "CRF-D performs the best (about 78%), which confirms the usefulness of long range patterns.",
        "However, considering the large size of training data for CRF-D (the training data set already contains most of the correct opinion words) and poorer precision (Figure 4), its result is weaker than our approach.",
        "KN06 performs poorly in finding new opinion words, which we believe is due to its strategy in selecting candidates.",
        "The strategy only considers adjectives in successive sentences and does not use features or any dependency relationships.",
        "Such relationships clearly exist and are useful.",
        "Figure 6 shows the F-score results.",
        "In all four cases, our propagation approach (Prop-dep) achieves the highest F-score.",

        "Average polarity assignment accuracy on correct new opinion words.",

        "Figure 7 shows the accuracy of polarity assignment of different approaches computed on the newly discovered correct opinion words by each approach.",
        "From the results, we can see that noProp-dep performs the best before around 65p (which means 65% of the complete opinion lexicon).",
        "Prop-dep performs worse than KN06 but approaches it when the number of seeds increases, and outperforms KN06 from around 50p and noProp-dep from around 65p.",
        "Considering our approach has a much higher recall, about 20% higher at 80p (Figure 5), this result is useful.",
        "At 10p, 20p, and 50p, the recall values of our methods are even higher than KN06.",
        "In the cases of 50p and 80p, our method becomes more accurate than KN06 (Figure 7).",
        "We consider those two cases to be realistic for practical applications because there are already several existing opinion lexicons compiled by researchers.",
        "Thus, in practice, one does not need to start with a very small number of seeds.",
        "Note that this does not conflict with our earlier statement about our propagation approach's ability in extracting a large number of new opinion words with only a small set of seeds.",
        "For performance evaluation on opinion target extraction, we compare our work (and also the non-propagation version, i.e., extracting targets using only the opinion words) with those in Hu and Liu (2004, henceforth Hu) and Popescu and Etzioni (2005, henceforth Popescu), which also considered only explicit noun targets and experimented with the same data sets.",
        "Details of both approaches have been described in Section 2.",
        "Additionally, we experimented with the popular topic modeling algorithm PLSA (Hofmann 1999), using a public domain program, and CRF (CRF-D) using the toolkit CRF++.",

        "The value of M and the number of clusters were chosen empirically.",
        "We set M as 10, 20, and 30 and number of clusters as 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.",
        "We used the best results based on F-scores as the final results of each data set for PLSA.",
        "For the five data sets, the best results for the DVD player were gained at M = 10 with the number of clusters being 30, and those for the remaining four data sets were all gained at M = 20 with the number of clusters being 10.",

        "From Table 3, we can see that on average our approach has a 16% improvement in precision over Hu, 34% over PLSA, 28% over CRF, and 30% over CRF-D, and has similar results to Popescu.",
        "noProp-dep performs the best, which indicates that the rules are helpful in extracting targets, but the propagation introduces noise.",

        "Although some of the product features tend to appear with product discriminators like product has, ofproduct, there are many other features that do not have high co-occurrences with these discriminators.",
        "The better performance of CRF-D over CRF again indicates that dependency relations are helpful in identifying more targets.",
        "F-scores in Table 5 show that our approach outperforms Hu (by 10%), Popescu (4%),",
        "PLSA (32%), CRF (43%), and CRF-D (32%).",
        "Paired t-tests show that all the improvements are statistically significant at the confidence level of 95%.",
        "noProp-dep also has good F-score results (even a little better than Hu) due to its high precision.",
        "The poor results seen with PLSA and CRF indicate that these approaches may not be suitable for this task.",
        "As analyzed earlier, PLSA is known for its ability to mine rough topics in a large text collection by clustering topic words together based on the probability distribution in the corpus.",
        "It is not suitable for the fine-grained extraction task.",
        "Therefore, a large number of non-targets are included.",
        "CRF and CRF-D perform poorly as explained in the opinion word extraction task."

        "This article focuses on two important tasks in opinion mining, namely, opinion lexicon expansion and target extraction.",
        "We propose a propagation approach to extract opinion words and targets iteratively given only a seed opinion lexicon of small size.",
        "The extraction is performed using identified relations between opinion words and targets, and also opinion words/targets themselves.",
        "The relations are described syntactically based on the dependency grammar.",
        "We also propose novel methods for new opinion word polarity assignment and noisy target pruning.",
        "In the evaluation, we compared our new approach with others on standard testing data sets.",
        "The results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in these two tasks.",
        "In the future, we plan to first focus on improving the precision of opinion word extraction by working on opinion word pruning methods.",
        "We will then also try to learn syntactic relations automatically from large corpuses using pattern mining techniques to improve the relation coverage.",
