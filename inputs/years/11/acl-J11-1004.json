        "Kun University of NewHampshire In this article we focus on human-human multitasking dialogues, in which pairs of conversants, using speech, work on an ongoing task while occasionally completing real-time tasks.",
        "The ongoing task is a poker game in which conversants need to assemble a poker hand, and the real-time task is a picture game in which conversants need to find out whether they have a certain picture on their displays.",
        "We employ empirical corpus studies and machine learning experiments to understand the mechanisms that people use in managing these complex interactions.",
        "First, we examine task interruptions: switching from the ongoing task to a real-time task.",
        "We find that generally conversants tend to interrupt at a less disruptive context in the ongoing task when possible.",
        "We also find that the discourse markers oh and wait occur in initiating a task interruption twice as often as in the conversation of the ongoing task.",
        "Pitch is also found to be statistically correlated with task interruptions; in fact, the more disruptive the task interruption, the higher the pitch.",
        "Second, we examine task resumptions: returning to the ongoing task after completing an interrupting real-time task.",
        "We find that conversants might simply resume the conversation where they left off, but sometimes they repeat the last utterance or summarize the critical information that was exchanged before the interruption.",
        "Third, we apply machine learning to determine how well task interruptions can be recognized automatically and to investigate the usefulness of the cues that we find in the corpus studies.",
        "We find that discourse context, pitch, and the discourse markers oh and wait are important features to reliably recognize task interruptions; and with non-lexical features one can improve the performance ofrecognizing task interruptions with more than a 50% relative error reduction over a baseline.",
        "Finally, we discuss the implication of our findings for building a speech interface that supports multitasking dialogue."

        "Submission received: 26 July 2009; revised submission received: 22 July 2010; accepted for publication: 13 October 2010.",
        "next-generation speech interfaces will be able to work with the user on multiple tasks at the same time, which is especially useful for real-time tasks.",
        "For instance, a driver in a car might use a speech interface to catch up on e-mails, while occasionally checking upcoming traffic conditions, and receiving navigation instructions; or a police officer might need to be alerted to a nearby accident while accessing a database during a routine traffic stop.",
        "Several speech interfaces that allowmulti-tasking dialogues have been built (e.g., Traum and Rickel 2002; Kun, Miller, and Lenharth 2004; Lemon and Gruenstein 2004; Larsson 2003).",
        "However, it is unclear that the mechanisms of managing multiple verbal tasks in these systems resemble human conventions or do the best to help users with task switching.",
        "For complex domains, the user might be confused about which task the interface is talking about, or might be confused about where they left off in a task.",
        "In order to build a speech interface that supports multitasking dialogue, we need to determine a set of conventions that the user and interface can followin task switching.",
        "We propose to start with conventions that are actually used in human-human speech conversations, which are natural for users to follow and probably efficient in problemsolving.",
        "Once we understand the human conventions, we can try to implement them in a dialogue manager and run user studies to verify the effectiveness of such conventions in human-computer dialogue.",
        "In this article we focus on understanding the human conventions of managing multiple tasks.",
        "Multi-tasking dialogues, where multiple independent topics overlap with each other in time, regularly arise in human-human conversation: For example, a driver and a passenger in a car might be talking about their summer plans, while occasionally interjecting road directions or conversation about what music to listen to.",
        "However, little is known about how people manage multitasking dialogues.",
        "Given the scenario where a real-time task with a time constraint arises during the course of an ongoing task, we are specially interested in two switching behaviors: task interruption, which is to suspend the ongoing task and switch to a waiting real-time task, and task resumption, which is to return to the interrupted ongoing task after completing a realtime task.",
        "The first question we ask is how quickly conversants respond to a real-time task.",
        "Intuitively if the real-time task is very urgent (e.g., the driver is about to miss a turn), the passenger might want to immediately cut off the ongoing conversation, and notify the driver of the turn.",
        "However, if the real-time task is less urgent, for example, the driver does not like the music and wants the passenger to load another CD, do conversants still immediately interrupt the ongoing conversation?",
        "If conversants do vary how quickly they interrupt, are there any regularities of where conversants switch from the ongoing task to the real-time task?",
        "We hypothesize that, given the choice, conversants interrupt the ongoing task where the interruption is less disruptive to the ongoing task.",
        "The second question we ask is how conversants signal task interruptions.",
        "Previous research showed that conversants signal the start of a new topic in single-tasking speech (monologue and dialogue) with discourse markers and prosodic cues.",
        "We thus hypothesize that conversants also use these cues to signal task interruptions.",
        "We also investigate whether conversants vary the intensity of the cues, and under what circumstances.",
        "The third question we ask is what conversants do immediately upon resuming the ongoing task.",
        "Switching to a real-time task causes the ongoing task to be temporarily suspended.",
        "On completing the real-time task and returning to the ongoing task, do conversants simply continue on from where they were interrupted?",
        "We hypothesize that conversants might sometimes perform certain actions to recover from the interruption.",
        "For example, it is imaginable that conversants might ask where were we at for summer plans, and then review what was discussed before the interruption.",
        "To answer these questions, we collect the MTD corpus, which consists of a set of human-human dialogues where pairs of conversants have multiple overlapping verbal tasks to perform.",
        "In our research, we keep things relatively simple by having conversants talk to each other to play two games on computers.",
        "The first game, the ongoing task, is a poker game in which conversants need to assemble a poker hand, which usually takes a relatively long time to complete.",
        "The second game, the real-time task, is a picture game in which conversants need to find out whether they have a certain picture on their displays, which can be done in a couple of turns but has a time constraint.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the task setup and corpus collection.",
        "In Section 4, we examine when and where conversants suspend the ongoing task and switch to the real-time task.",
        "In Section 5, we examine how conversants signal task interruptions.",
        "In Section 6, we examine the behavior of context restoration in task resumptions.",
        "In addition to the three questions we have asked, in Section 7, we use machine learning to automatically recognize task interruptions.",
        "Recognizing task interruptions is an important component in building speech interfaces that support multitasking dialogue.",
        "For example, the speech interface can accordingly switch the language model when it detects that the user has switched to another task, which should improve speech recognition performance (Iyer and Ostendorf 1999) and utterance understanding, leading to higher user satisfaction (Walker, Passonneau, and Boland 2001).",
        "We run machine learning experiments to determine how well we can automatically recognize task interruptions and to understand the utility of the features that we found in our corpus studies.",
        "Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 8.",
        "This paper includes and extends Heeman et al.",
        "(2005), Yang, Heeman, and Kun (2008), and Yang and Heeman (2009) with more corpus data, more robust statistical analysis, more machine learning experiments, and more comprehensive discussions."

        "There is some initial research effort in building speech interfaces to support multitasking dialogue.",
        "Kun, Miller, and Lenharth (2004) developed a system called Project54, which allowed a user to interact with multiple devices in a police cruiser using speech.",
        "The architecture of Project54 allowed for handling multiple tasks overlapped in time.",
        "For example, when pulling over a vehicle, an officer could first issue a spoken command to turn on the lights and siren, then issue spoken commands to initiate a data query, go back to interacting with the lights and siren (perhaps to change the pattern after the vehicle has been pulled over), and finally receive the spoken results of the data query.",
        "This example shows that system responses related to different tasks could be interleaved: The system responded to the data query after the user had already switched back to interacting with the lights and siren.",
        "Lemon and Gruenstein (2004) also explored multitasking in a speech interface.",
        "They built a speech interface for a human operator to direct a robotic helicopter on executing multiple tasks, such as searching for a car and flying to a tower.",
        "The interface kept an ordered set of active dialogue tasks, and interpreted the user utterance in terms of the most active task for which the utterance made sense.",
        "Conversely, during the interface's turn of speaking, it could produce an utterance for any of the dialogue tasks and thus intermixed utterances from different tasks.",
        "In Kun, Miller, and Lenharth (2004) or Lemon and Gruenstein (2004), the systems did not explicitly signal tasks switching, either for task interruptions or for task resumptions, but instead relied on semantic interpretation to determine which task an utterance belonged to.",
        "Larsson (2003) built the GoDis system which hard-coded two types of signals when resuming an interrupted conversation.",
        "The first type of signal was to use the discourse marker so to implicitly signal a topic resumption.",
        "The second type of signal was to use the phrase returning to the issue ofto explicitly resume an interrupted topic.",
        "For example, when searching for the price of an air ticket with GoDis, the user could suspend the system's question when do you want to travel by interjecting a question do I need a visa.",
        "The system, after a short dialogue answering the user's question about a visa, would resume the ticket booking by returning to the issue of price.",
        "Traum and his colleagues (Rickel et al.",
        "2002; Traum and Rickel 2002) developed the Mission Rehearsal Exercise system in which the user and virtual humans collaborated on multiple tasks that could interrupt each other.",
        "They created a scenario in which a lieutenant (the user) was sent to a village for an Army peacekeeping task.",
        "However, on his way, he encountered an auto accident in which his platoon's vehicle crashed into a civilian vehicle, injuring a local boy.",
        "The boy's mother and an Army medic were hunched over him, and a sergeant approached the lieutenant to brief him on the situation.",
        "These multiple virtual humans could interrupt or be involved in conversations with the lieutenant.",
        "The authors proposed and partially implemented a multilevel dialogue manager, with levels for turn-taking, initiative, grounding, topic management, negotiation, and rhetorical structure.",
        "In their view, topic management included where one topic is started before an old one is completed.",
        "They described howtopic shifts in general can be signaled with cue phrases, such as now and anyways, and with nonverbal cues.",
        "These research works show the usefulness of a spoken dialogue system being able to handle multiple tasks, and promote a thorough examination of multitasking dialogue.",
        "In this article we examine the conventions of task switching in human-human dialogue as the first step towards understanding the practice of managing tasking switching in a computer dialogue system.",
        "Research in cognitive science suggests that task interruptions and resumptions are complicated behavior and warrant investigation.",
        "There is extensive research on the disruptiveness of interruptions, in which individuals switch between multiple manualvisual tasks.",
        "For example, Gillie and Broadbent (1989) found that the length (in time) of an interruption is not an important factor, but that the real-time task's complexity and similarity to the ongoing task contribute to the disruptiveness.",
        "On the other hand, in their study of checklists, Linde and Goguen (1987) found that it is not the number of interruptions but the length of interruptions that affects the disruptiveness.",
        "Cutrell, Czerwinski, and Hovitz (2001) examined the influence of instant messaging on users performing ongoing computing tasks, and found that interruptions unrelated to the ongoing task resulted in longer task resumptions.",
        "Although these results do not appear to always converge on the same conclusions, they suggest that task switching can be disruptive to users.",
        "Researchers have been trying to minimize the disruptive effect of task switching in human-computer interaction.",
        "McFarlane (1999) explored four alternatives for when to suspend the ongoing task and switch to the interruption, namely, immediate, negotiated, mediated, and scheduled, and found mixed results.",
        "Renaud (2000) argued for, and built, a prototype of a visualization tool to help users restore the context of the ongoing task when returning from an interruption.",
        "Hess and Detweiler (1994) and Gopher, Greenshpan, and Armony (1996) found that the disruptive effects are reduced as people gain more experience with interruptions.",
        "These studies suggest that it is worthwhile to investigate howa computer dialogue system should manage task switching.",
        "Research in discourse structure also sheds light on task switching.",
        "It is important to understand the conventions that people use to manage discourse structure as these might also be used for managing multiple tasks.",
        "According to Grosz and Sidner (1986), the structure of a discourse is a combination of linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state.",
        "The linguistic structure is a hierarchical segmentation of the dialogue.",
        "Each segment has a purpose, which is established by the conversant who initiates the segment.",
        "The purposes come together to form the intentional structure.",
        "The attentional state contains the objects, properties, and relations that are most salient at any point in the dialogue.",
        "The attentional state is claimed to work like a stack.",
        "When a newsegment is started, a newfocus space is created on top of the attentional stack.",
        "When the segment completes, the focus space is popped off.",
        "Signaling discourse structure in single-tasking speech is about signaling the boundary of related discourse segments that contribute to the achievement of a discourse purpose.",
        "Two types of cues have been identified.",
        "The first type is discourse markers (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Schiffrin 1987; Moser and Moore 1995; Passonneau and Litman 1997; Bangerter and Clark 2003).",
        "Discourse markers can be used to signal the start of a newdiscourse segment and its relation to other discourse segments.",
        "For example, now might signal moving on to the next topic, and well might signal a negative or unexpected response.",
        "The second type of cue is prosody.",
        "In read speech, Grosz and Hirschberg (1992) studied broadcast news and found that pause length is the most important factor that indicates a newdiscourse segment.",
        "Ayers (1992) found that pitch range appears to correlate more closely with hierarchical topic structure in read speech than in spontaneous speech.",
        "In spontaneous monologue, Butterworth (1972) found that the beginning of a discourse segment exhibits slower speaking rate; Swerts (1995) and Passonneau and Litman (1997) found that pause length correlates with discourse segment boundaries; Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) found that the beginning of a discourse segment correlates with higher pitch.",
        "In human-human dialogue, similar behavior has been observed: The pitch value tends to be higher for starting a newdiscourse segment (Nakajima and Allen 1993).",
        "In human-computer dialogue, Swerts and Ostendorf (1995) found that the first utterance of a discourse segment correlates with slower speaking rate and longer preceding pause.",
        "Thus, we are interested in whether discourse markers and prosodic cues are also used in signaling task interruptions in multitasking dialogue.",
        "1 Grosz and Sidner (1986) also briefly talked about interruptions.",
        "In their discourse structure theory, interruptions are modeled as special discourse segments.",
        "When a task interruption happens, an attentional state is created for the real-time task and pushed on top of the discourse stack.",
        "There is an impenetrable separation between the attentional state of the real-time task and the interrupted ongoing task, so that the real-time task cannot access the ongoing task.",
        "When the real-time task is completed, its attentional state is popped off and the ongoing task becomes salient."

        "In order to better understand multitasking human-human dialogue, we collected the MTD corpus, in which pairs of players perform overlapping verbal tasks.",
        "For the MTD corpus, we decided to have players complete two types of tasks via conversation: an ongoing task and real-time tasks.",
        "The ongoing task needs to build up significant context that players have to keep in mind.",
        "On task resumption, this context is needed to finish the task, and so might need to be re-established.",
        "The task should also encourage both players to equally participate as we believe that mixed-initiative will be the conversational mode in future speech interfaces.",
        "The real-time task can be kept simple: It does not build up much context and can be finished in a couple turns.",
        "However, we vary the urgency of this task.",
        "For the ongoing task, a pair of players collaborate to assemble as many poker hands as possible, where a poker hand consists of a full house, flush, straight, or four of a kind.",
        "Each player initially has three cards in hand, which the other cannot see.",
        "Players take turns drawing an extra card and then discarding one, until they find a valid poker hand, for which they earn 50 points; they then start over to form another poker hand.",
        "To discourage players from rifling through the cards to look for a specific one without talking, one point is deducted for each picked-up card, and ten points for a missed or incorrect poker hand.",
        "To complete this game, players converse to share card information, and explore and establish strategies based on the combined cards in their hands (Toh, Yang, and Heeman 2006).",
        "The poker game is played on computers.",
        "The game display, which each player sees, is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The player with four cards can click on a card to discard it.",
        "The card disappears from the screen, and a newcard is automatically dealt to the other player.",
        "Once they find a poker hand the player with four cards clicks the Done Poker Hand button to start a newgame.",
        "The real-time task is a picture game.",
        "From time to time, the computer prompts one of the players to determine whether the other has a certain picture on the bottom of the display.",
        "The picture task has a time constraint of 10,25, or 40 seconds, which is (pseudo) randomly determined.",
        "Two solid bars above and below the player's cards flash when there is a pending picture game.",
        "This should alert the player to a pending picture game without taking the attention away from the poker game.",
        "The color of the flashing bars depends on howmuch time remains: green for 26-40 seconds, yellowfor 11-25 seconds, and red for 0-10 seconds.",
        "The player can see the exact amount of time left in the heading of the picture game.",
        "In Figure 1, the player needs to find out whether the other player has a blue circle, with 6 seconds left.",
        "The players get 5 points if the correct answer is given in time.",
        "The overall goal of the players is to earn as many points as possible from the two tasks.",
        "We recruited six pairs of players, who each received US $10 for completing the data collection.",
        "All players were native American English speakers, and had a bachelor's degree or higher in computer science or electrical engineering.",

        "The game display for players.",
        "The data collection for each pair of players lasted about one hour.",
        "Players were separated so that they could not see each other and they talked to each other through headsets.",
        "After a short orientation, the players played the poker game for about 5 minutes to become familiar with the rules.",
        "They then had a practice conversation with both the poker game and the picture game for about 15 minutes, so that they got used to managing both tasks.",
        "Finally, they had two more conversations, each lasting for about 15 minutes.",
        "In each conversation, nine picture games, three for each urgency level, were prompted for each player.",
        "In this research, we analyze the last two conversations, but not the practice one.",
        "Thus we have a total of about 180 minutes of conversation from the six pairs of players.",
        "For each dialogue, we recorded both channels of speech (each in an audio file) and created a log file.",
        "The log file contains all the events of the computer dealer and the GUI actions of the two players for each task with time-stamps.",
        "For the poker game, it contains information of when a card is dealt or discarded, and information of when a poker hand is achieved or missed; for the real-time task, it contains each question, the time it is generated, the answer, and the time it is answered.",
        "A post-experiment survey was conducted in which players were given the following questions: (1) Did you ever play poker before you participated in this experiment?",

        "Some players also mentioned that they enjoyed the games.",
        "We segmented each dialogue into utterances using consensus annotations (see Yang and Heeman [2010] for more details), following the guidelines of the Trains corpus (Heeman and Allen 1995).",
        "We also annotated each utterance as to whether or not it is a trivial utterance.",
        "We define trivial utterances as those that are just a stall (such as uh and um) or a simple acknowledgement (such as okay, uh-huh,and alright).",
        "According to Strayer, Heeman, and Yang (2003), annotators reached high inter-coder agreement on a similar annotation scheme.",
        "There are in total about 4,300 non-trivial utterances in playing the poker game.",
        "The ongoing task can be naturally divided into individual poker games, in which the players successfully complete a poker hand.",
        "Each poker game can be further divided into a sequence of card segments, in which players discuss which card to discard, or players identify a poker hand.",
        "In total, there are 120 game segments and 781 card segments in the corpus.",
        "We also group the utterances involved in each picture game into a segment.",

        "The players can start the picture game as soon as they notice it, for example, within one second; or they can delay the picture game, for example, for 35 seconds, if the time constraint allows.",

        "However, overall the response delay under the urgency levels of 40 sec (M = 12.5 sec) or 25 sec (M = 9.7 sec) is much higher than under the urgency level of 10 sec (M = 2.8 sec).",

        "Intuitively, when players start a picture game, the more time that is remaining to finish the task, the less hurried they need to be.",

        "From Figure 8, we see that for all six pairs of players, the rate of utterance restatement after an embedded interruption is higher than the baseline, and it is statistically significant, t(5) = 13.52, p < 0.001.",
        "This suggests that utterance restatement after an embedded interruption is not a random behavior, but it is part of the resumption to the ongoing task.",

        "The purpose of the second experiment is to investigate how well interruptions can be identified without using lexical features, as could be used in an actual system.",
        "In the previous sections, we examined players' behavior of task switching in the MTD corpus.",

        "We thus conduct a machine learning experiment to understand howthese features contribute to the automatic identification of task interruptions.",
        "In this experiment, we focus on the 285 cases of do you have, 170 for task interruption and 115 for poker playing.",
        "As we argued in Section 5.2, this allows us to better extract and understand prosodic features of task interruptions.",
        "We extract the following features: 1) discourse context: whether the utterance before do you have is the end of a poker game, the end of a card segment, or in the middle of a card segment; 2) oh/wait: whether the discourse marker oh/wait precedes do you have; 3) normalized pitch: the pitch of do you have divided by the average pitch of the speaker during the dialogue.",

        "We also include the following additional features: 4) discourse markers: whether a discourse marker precedes do you have; 5) normalized energy: the energy of do you have divided by the average energy of the speaker during the dialogue; and 6) duration: the duration of do you have.",
        "We use a decision tree classifier (C4.5) to discriminate task interruption from poker playing (Quinlan 1986).",

        "The data that we have are highly skewed.",
        "We have 208 cases of task interruptions but more than 4,000 non-interrupting utterances.",
        "We thus perform down-sampling so that both classes have the same number of data points.",
        "In the first down-sampling, which we refer to as general down-sampling, we use all 208 cases of task interruptions, and we randomly select 208 non-interrupting utterances.",
        "A concern with the general down-sampling is that 82% of the task interruptions are do you have questions, and do you have questions are only about 2.5% of the non-interrupting utterances.",
        "It is unclear whether a classifier trained from such a data set discriminates task interruptions or discriminates do you have utterances.",
        "Thus in the second down-sampling, which we refer to as DYH down-sampling, we use all 208 cases of task interruptions, and we also use all 105 cases of non-interrupting do you have utterances, then finally we randomly select 103 other non-interrupting utterances.",
        "The DYH down-sampling, however, still has imbalanced do you have utterances in the two classes.",
        "Thus we further introduce the Balanced-DYH down-sampling, in which we use all 105 do you have utterances in the poker playing and 38 other (i.e., non do you have) utterances in task interruptions, and randomly select 105 do you have utterances from task interruptions and 38 other utterances from poker playing.",
        "We run the experiments with decision tree learning (C4.5) (Quinlan 1986) and support vector machine (SVM) (Chang and Lin 2001).",
        "We evaluate the performance using general-leave-one-out.",
        "The procedure of down-sampling and general-leave-one-out is repeated 10 times, and then we calculate the average performance.",
        "Note that in our evaluation, the distribution of task interruption (which is 50%) is different from the true distribution in the corpus (which is less than 5%).",
        "We adopt some metrics from medical diagnostic tests that do not involve prior distributions.",
        "Sensitivity is defined as TruePositive/'(TruePositive + FalseNegative), which, in our case, is the recall of task interruptions.",
        "It measures the percentage of task interruptions that the classifier correctly identifies as such.",
        "Specificity is",
        "6 Card and game segments could be determined fairly accurately from the mouse clicks even without the speech.",
        "Baseline",
        "defined as TrueNegative/(TrueNegative + FalsePositive), which, in our case, is the recall of non-interruptions.",
        "It measures the percentage of non-interruptions that the classifier correctly identifies as such.",
        "These two metrics can then be combined using the likelihood ratio, which provides a direct estimate of how much a prediction will change the odds.",
        "The likelihood ratio for a positive result (LR+) is defined as LR+ = sensitivity/(1 – specificity).",
        "It tells us howmuch the odds of a task interruption increase when the classifier predicts positive (task interruption).",
        "The likelihood ratio for a negative result (LR – ) is defined as LR – = specificity/(1 – sensitivity).",
        "It tells us howmuch the odds of a task interruption decrease when the classifier predicts negative (non-interruption).",
        "Table 6 shows the results.",
        "If we assume a naive baseline with no knowledge, its sensitivity and specificity are both 50%, and LR+ and LR – are both 1.0.",
        "For all three down-sampling settings, SVM performs slightly better than C4.5, and both are much better than the baseline.",
        "The result for SVM with general down-sampling shows how well we can recognize task interruptions for our MTD domain, for which we achieve a sensitivity of 78.6% and a specificity of 76.9%.",
        "For the Balanced-DYH down-sampling, in which we have the same number of do you have utterances in both the classes, SVM cannot make use of the features that distinguish do you have from other utterances.",
        "Hence, its result might be more indicative of performance in other domains, where task interruptions might not be marked by the same introductory words.",
        "Even here, we obtain a sensitivity of 75.3%, a specificity of 75.8%, and 3.11 in LR+ and 3.07 in LR – , which is more than a 50% relative error reduction over the baseline.",
        "Overall, our results showthat non-lexical features are useful for the recognition of task interruptions.",
        "Because the features used in our machine learning experiments do not require the lexical information of the current utterance, we can make use of the identification of task interruptions to benefit automatic speech recognition (ASR).",
        "For example, we can build two language models, one for the ongoing task, and one for the real-time task.",
        "For each utterance, we can calculate the likelihood of the utterance being a task interruption, using the decision tree classifier or the SVM classifier.",
        "We can then use this likelihood to dynamically interpolate the two language models in the speech decoding.",
        "This should be able to improve the accuracy of ASR, which we leave for future work."

        "examined the discourse context of task interruptions, that is, where conversants suspend the ongoing task and switch to a real-time task.",
        "Our analysis shows that people are more likely to wait until the end of a card or game segment for task switching.",
        "We then examined the cues that people use to signal task interruptions.",
        "We find that task interruptions correlate with certain discourse markers and prosodic variations.",
        "More interestingly, the intensity of pitch depends on the discourse context of the task interruption.",
        "We next conducted an exploratory study on context restoration in task resumption.",
        "We find that when returning to an interrupted task, conversants sometimes resynchronize the interrupted ongoing conversation by either restating a previous utterance or summarizing the critical information.",
        "Finally, our machine learning experiments showthat discourse context, pitch, and the discourse markers oh and wait are useful features to reliably recognize task interruptions; and, more importantly, with non-lexical features one can improve the performance of recognizing task interruptions with more than a 50% relative error reduction over the baseline.",
        "In our study on multitasking dialogues, we distinguish three types of discourse contexts where players suspend the poker player and switch to a picture game.",
        "We claim that these discourse contexts differ in terms of players' engagement and memoryload in the ongoing task.",
        "First, we feel that players are more engaged in the ongoing task during card discussion.",
        "In the middle of a card discussion, players actively share information, explore different (potential) poker hands, and decide what to discard if no poker hand is found.",
        "Second, we feel that players also have a higher memory load in the middle of a card discussion.",
        "Across poker games, players do not have to remember anything; across card segments, players need to remember what cards each other has; while inside of a card discussion, players need to also remember what card is being discussed, and howfar they are into deciding which card to discard.",
        "Engagement can be used to explain the intensity of cues in task interruptions.",
        "As we found in Section 5, when players interrupt in the middle of a card discussion, they use a higher pitch than in the case when they interrupt at the end of a game or a card, which is also marked with a higher pitch than non-task-switching (during poker playing).",
        "According to Miyata and Norman (1986), a more intrusive signal is needed to attract the attention of people heavily engaged in an ongoing task.",
        "Sussman, Winkler, and Schroger (2003) found that higher pitch can serve as a more intrusive signal.",
        "Thus when interrupting in the middle of a card discussion, the speaker uses higher pitch probably because the hearer is more engaged in the ongoing task.",
        "Memory load can explain the context restoration behavior in task resumptions.",
        "As we found in Section 6, after a picture game that is at the end of a game, players smoothly start a newpoker game as if nothing happened; after a picture game that is at the end of a card segment, players might sometimes use information summary to remind each other of what cards they have in hand; and after a picture game that is in the middle of a card segment, players might even repeat or clarify the previous utterance that has been said before the interruption.",
        "These observations are consistent with the memory load of discourse contexts.",
        "If players are interrupted in a discourse context where the memory load is high, because of the limited working memory, players would need to spend extra effort to recover the memory after completing the interruptions.",
        "Engagement and memory can also explain our finding on the discourse context of task interruptions.",
        "According to Miyata and Norman (1986), interruptions where people are deeply engaged in the ongoing task, or where people have a high memory load, should be disruptive.",
        "Thus interruptions at the end of a card game are the least disruptive, with those at the end of a card discussion being more disruptive, and those embedded inside of a card discussion being the most disruptive.",
        "A more disruptive interruption tends to have a higher cost to the ongoing task.",
        "The disruptiveness of interruptions thus explains players' behavior of delaying the picture game.",
        "For task interruptions, players do not always switch to a real-time task when it is prompted, but instead they take into account the discourse context of the ongoing task.",
        "They strive to switch to a picture game at the end of a (poker) game or a card when possible.",
        "According to Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986), players would try to minimize their collaborative effort in dialogue.",
        "The reason that players try to avoid interrupting in the middle of a card discussion probably is because such interruptions have a higher cost to the ongoing task, i.e. these interruptions are more disruptive.",
        "Delaying the switch to the real-time task is thus used as a tool to reduce the disruptiveness of the switch.",
        "Our studies thus suggest that conversants strive to interrupt at a discourse context where the cost of interruption is low, but if they interrupt in a more intensive context they use stronger cues to mark the more disruptive interruption.",
        "By understanding people's conventions in task interruptions and context restoration, we can implement these conventions into a speech interface to allow natural and smooth task switching in human-computer dialogue.",
        "Based on our findings, we propose the following principles for building a speech interface that supports multitasking dialogue:",
        "• Minimize the disruptiveness of task switching.",
        "Delay task switching till the user's engagement and memory load in the ongoing task are lowso that the interruption is less disruptive, while still accomplishing the interruption task in a timely matter.",
        "Minimizing the disruptiveness reduces the cost of interruptions to the ongoing task.",
        "• Signal task switching.",
        "Discourse markers, such as oh and wait,and prosodic variations, especially high pitch, can be used to signal task switching.",
        "These devices help to disengage the user's attention from the ongoing task so that the user is aware of the task switching.",
        "Use stronger cues (e.g., higher pitch) when the task switching is more disruptive (i.e., when the user is more engaged in the ongoing task).",
        "• Recognize task switching.",
        "The speech interface can make use of non-lexical features, such as contextual information and the user's pitch, together with discourse markers if available, to help recognize the user's initiation of task interruptions.",
        "Recognizing task switching helps the speech interface to interpret the user's utterance in the correct context, which should lead to higher speech recognition accuracy and better language understanding.",
        "• Restore context after an interruption.",
        "Utterance restatement and information summary are two effective devices.",
        "Context restoration is needed, especially after a disruptive interruption where the memory load in the ongoing task is high, in order to help resolve or prevent misunderstandings and forgetting.",
        "There are obviously a lot of open questions regarding multitasking dialogue that are not solved in this article.",
        "In this research, we only examined a domain where an ongoing task, rich in context, is interrupted by real-time tasks, which are short and simple in nature.",
        "Psychological research showed that the complexity of the real-time task and its similarity to the ongoing task play an important role in the disruptiveness of interruptions (Gillie and Broadbent 1989); thus we can vary these factors in future research.",
        "First, we can vary the complexity of the real-time tasks; for example, for some interruptions, the player needs to find out whether the other player has a combination of pictures, such as a black square but not a white triangle (■ A – A).",
        "This will allow us to examine the correlation between the length of interruptions and context restoration.",
        "Second, we can use real-time tasks that are less structured, so that people do not mutually knowwhen it ends.",
        "This will allow us to examine whether and how people signal task resumptions.",
        "Third, we can introduce ambiguity between the ongoing task and the real-time task: for example, to put the card suits into the picture game, where an utterance such as do you have a heart?",
        "can belong to either task.",
        "This will allow us to see a wider range of task switching behavior.",
        "Furthermore, in this research we do not investigate how multitasking dialogue would be affected by a manual-visual task, such as driving.",
        "This is an important question, because for hands-busy, eyes-busy situations such as driving, speech interfaces may provide a human-computer interaction modality that interferes the least with the execution of the manual-visual task (Weng et al.",
        "2006; Villing et al.",
        "2008).",
        "We expect that the presence of the manual-visual task will even further necessitate a good understanding of the natural and efficient human conventions for managing multitasking so as not to adversely affect the manual-visual task.",
        "Finally, it was pointed out that human-computer dialogue is not exactly the same as human-human dialogue – that is, people might change their behavior when talking to a computer (Doran et al.",
        "2001).",
        "It will thus be useful to build an actual speech interface for multitasking dialogue, or perhaps first simulate such a system with Wizard of Oz experiments, and to examine whether following the principles that we derived from human-human dialogue does lead to improvements."
