        "See Young (2000), Lemon and Pietquin (2007), and Frampton and Lemon (2009) for an introduction to dialogue strategy learning.",
        "One of the major limitations of this approach is that it relies on a large quantity of data being available.",
        "In cases when a fixed data set is used for learning (e.g., Walker 2000; Singh et al.",
        "2002; Henderson, Lemon, and Georgila 2008), the optimal policy can only be discovered when it is present in the data set.",
        "(Note, by a policy being \"present in a data set\" we mean that the set of state-action mappings which define the policy is contained in that data set.",
        "When a policy is not present in a data set, either some states covered by the policy are not seen at all in that data, or the actions chosen by the policy in some states are different to those seen in the data.)",
        "To overcome this problem, simulated learning environments are being used to explore optimal policies which were previously unseen in the data (e.g., Eckert, Levin, and Pieraccini 1997; Ai, Tetreault, and Litman 2007; Young et al.",
        "2009).",
        "However, several aspects of the components of this simulated environment are usually hand-crafted, and thus limit the scope of policy learning.",
        "In particular, the optimization (or reward) function is often manually set (Paek 2006).",
        "In order to build simulation components from real data, annotated in-domain dialogue corpora have to be available which explore a range of dialogue management decisions.",
        "Collecting dialogue data without a working prototype is problematic, leaving the developer with a classic \"chicken-or-egg\" problem.",
        "We therefore propose to learn dialogue strategies using simulation-based RL, where the simulated environment is learned from small amounts of Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) data.",
        "In a WOZ experiment, a hidden human operator, the so-called \"wizard,\" simulates (partly or completely) the behavior of the application, while subjects are left in the belief that they are interacting with a real system (Fraser and Gilbert 1991).",
        "In contrast to preceding work, our approach enables strategy learning in domains where no prior system is available.",
        "Optimized learned strategies are then available from the first moment of on-line operation, and handcrafting of dialogue strategies is avoided.",
        "This independence from large amounts of in-domain dialogue data allows researchers to apply RL to new application areas beyond the scope of existing dialogue systems.",
        "We call this method \"bootstrapping.\"",
        "In addition, our work is the first using a data-driven simulated environment.",
        "Previous approaches to simulation-based dialogue strategy learning usually handcraft some of their components.",
        "Of course, some human effort is needed in developing the WOZ environment and annotating the collected data, although automatic dialogue annotation could be applied (Georgila et al.",
        "2009).",
        "The alternative – collecting data using hand-coded dialogue strategies – would still require annotation of the user actions, and has the disadvantage of constraining the system policies explored in the collected data.",
        "Therefore, WOZ data allows exploration of a range of possible strategies, as intuitively generated by the wizards, in contrast to using an initial system which can only explore a predefined range of options.",
        "However, WOZ experiments usually only produce a limited amount of data, and the optimal policy is not likely to be present in the original small data set.",
        "Our method shows how to use these data to build a simulated environment in which optimal policies can be discovered.",
        "We show this advantage by comparing RL-based strategy against a supervised strategy which captures average human wizard performance on the dialogue task.",
        "This comparison allows us to measure relative improvement over the training data.",
        "The use of WOZ data has earlier been proposed in the context of RL.",
        "Williams and Young (2004) use WOZ data to discover the state and action space for the design of a Markov Decision Process (MDP).",
        "Prommer, Holzapfel, and Waibel (2006) use WOZ data to build a simulated user and noise model for simulation-based RL.",

        "Note that RL is fundamentally different to Supervised Learning (SL): RL is a statistical planning approach which allows us to find an optimal policy (sequences of actions) with respect to an overall goal (Sutton and Barto 1998); SL, in contrast, is concerned with deducing a function from training data for predicting/classifying events.",
        "This article is not concerned with showing differences between SL and RL on a small amount of data, but we use SL methods to capture the average human wizard strategy in the original data, and show that simulation-based RL is able to find new policies that were previously unseen.",
        "We apply this framework to optimize multimodal information-seeking dialogue strategies for an in-car digital music player.",
        "Dialogue Management and multimodal output generation are two closely interrelated problems for information seeking dialogues: the decision of when to present information depends on how many pieces of information to present and the available options for how to present them, and vice versa.",

        "2002; Henderson, Lemon, and Georgila 2008; Rieser and Lemon 2008a, 2008b); the other focuses on automatic evaluation of dialogue strategies (e.g., the PARADISE framework [Walker et al.",
