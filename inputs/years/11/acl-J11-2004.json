        "This article concerns Automated Genre Classification (AGC).",
        "Genre has a range of definitions, but for Language Technology, a good one is a class of documents that share a communicative purpose (e.g., Kessler, Nunberg, and Schütze 1997).",
        "Although communicative purpose may be difficult to recognize without document understanding, researchers have found low-level features of texts to correlate with genre, making it a useful proxy.",
        "AGC can directly benefit Information Retrieval (Freund, Clarke, and Toms 2006), where users may want documents that serve a particular communicative purpose (instructions, reviews, user guides, etc.).",
        "AGC can also benefit Language Technology indirectly, where differences in the low-level properties that correlate with genre may impact system performance.",
        "For example, if a part-of-speech (PoS) tagger or Statistical Machine Translation system trained on a corpus of editorials was then used for PoS tagging or translating a corpus of letters to the editor, it would benefit from the knowledge that inter alia the likelihood of the word \"states\" being a verb is considerably higher in letters (-20%) than in editorials",

        "Because both genre classification and topic classification exploit low-level features of text as a basis for their predictions, a feature indicative of topic might benefit a genre classifier through correlations in the training corpus.",
        "However, if the topics addressed in different genres can change unpredictably over time, such correlated features can then harm performance.",
        "Although domain adaptation techniques might remedy this, they typically require extensive data in the target domain, and the remedy may fail as soon as the distribution changes again.",
        "To date, the correlation between topic and genre has not been quantified, nor has the extent to which it may change in an actively growing corpus.",
        "In order to motivate research on stability in AGC, we analyzed a large, publicly available newspaper corpus and found that (1) genres and topics do correlate substantially and (2) these correlations vary substantially over time.",
        "This squib makes two points: (1) Low-level features that correlate with topic can degrade the performance of AGC systems and are best removed unless the genre-topic distribution is guaranteed to be fixed, and (2) PoS features should not be lumped together in AGC because they have different correlations with genre and topic.",

Although variable length n-grams as features for genre classification had previously been proposed by Kanaris and Stamatatos (2007), we followed Sharoff, Wu, and Markert in using fixed length 4-grams, which they found to yield higher accuracies.",
        "Although a variety of Machine Learning (ML) methods were used in these approaches, here we just used the SVM implementation by Joachims (1999) because other ML methods produced similar, albeit poorer, results (Petrenz 2009).",

        "The performance drop for both KC and KNS is slight but still significant.",

        "(More on this shortly.)",
        "Some of these results are not surprising: As bag-of-words and character n-grams reflect lexical differences of texts, systems that rely on them (SWM and FCT) will be misled by a major change in genre-topic distribution.",
        "Similar findings were reported in Finn and Kushmerick (2006) for bag-of-words and in (SWM) for character n-grams, although no explicit tests with topical distributions were carried out in the latter.",
        "More surprising are the results involving PoS tags: Two of the methods that used PoS tags – FMOG and KNSPOS – suffered when the genre-topic distribution changed, even though PoS frequencies had previously been reported to perform well as a feature set when used in new topical domains (Finn and Kushmerick 2006).",

        "They were then tested on both test sets described in Section 2.",

        "Recall from Table 1 that the genre-topic distribution for test set 1 is the same as in the training set, whereas in test set 2 it is different.",
        "The first thing to note in Table 2 is that the classifier performs significantly better on the larger set of 49 features than on the smaller set of 13 basic features when the genre-topic distribution is not altered (column 2).",
        "When it is altered (column 3), the losses are less severe on our baseline than on the set that includes PoS features.",
        "This can be explained by looking at the contributions of each feature.",

        "To highlight the most interesting results, we only show features which cause a deviation of more than 1% from the baseline for at least one of the two test sets.",
        "When the topic-genre distribution remains the same (i.e., test set 1), PoS frequencies appear to have a positive impact on prediction accuracy: When added to the basic feature set, accuracy increases.",

        "The odd result here is that singular proper noun (NNP) frequencies do not impair classifier stability: Unlike NN, NNS, and NNPS frequencies, they are topic-independent.",
        "This is because the most commonly tagged singular proper nouns in news reports are titles such as \"Mr.\", \"Ms.\", \"Dr.\", etc., regardless of the topic.",
        "The frequency of titles among proper nouns is much lower in editorials and even lower in letters, across all three topical domains.",
        "NNP frequency in news reports is increased by the fact that titles are usually followed by one or more names, which are also singular proper nouns.",
        "We assume that this is the reason that the fluctuation between NNP frequencies is relatively low across topics (for the three topics and genres we examined) and hence a stable contributor to genre prediction.",

        "Rather, our point is that PoS tags should not be included or excluded wholesale for AGC.",

        "Our results suggest that prediction accuracy on a static topic distribution should not be the sole basis for assessing the quality of Automatic Genre Classification systems: In particular, approaches that perform well on a static topic distribution can be severely impacted by changes in topical distributions.",
        "The notion of topic independence for features has rarely been explored in the literature on genre classification.",
        "Nevertheless, this is an important issue, especially in dynamic environments like the World Wide Web, where new topics emerge rapidly and unpredictably.",
        "In topical domains with little or no labeled data to train on, instability can impede any useful application of classifiers.",
        "Because of this, we believe that stability should join accuracy as a criterion for assessing any new developments in genre classification.",
        "To this end, we introduced a crossproduct methodology in Section 2 as a way of assessing stability.",
        "Our results also suggest that, where the cost of PoS-tagging is acceptable, selective use of PoS-based features can yield high performance that is stable even when topical distribution differs from training to test sets.",
        "Although we have not identified a set of PoS-based features that supports classification among an arbitrary set of genres, we can say that it is crucial to evaluate and select PoS-based features carefully in order to achieve genre classification which is as topic-independent as possible."
