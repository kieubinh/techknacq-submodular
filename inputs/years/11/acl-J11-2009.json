        "Cross-Language Information Retrieval is a compact book introducing a branch of information retrieval that has gained considerable research interest since the dawn of the World Wide Web in the mid 1990s.",
        "Information retrieval is generally concerned with the problem of finding documents within a large collection that are relevant to a given input query.",
        "Whereas the original formulation of IR assumes that queries and documents are written in the same language, cross-language IR (CLIR) presumes instead that they are written in two different languages.",
        "If the collection contains documents in more languages, then we refer to multilingual IR (MLIR), which is typically solved with multiple instances of CLIR.",
        "Recently, other variations on the theme have been proposed that address non-textual documents, such as image, music, and speech retrieval.",
        "An interesting application of CLIR is the retrieval of images that are provided with textual descriptions in any language.",
        "Computational linguistics could be interested in CLIR for several reasons.",
        "CLIR is mainly about the optimal integration of machine translation (MT) and IR, and it presents peculiar and difficult translation issues when short queries are involved, which is the most common case.",
        "For such problems, interesting approaches have been developed and refined over time, which mainly build on top of core statistical MTtechniques (e.g., word alignment models, translation models) and various lexical resources (e.g., WordNet, dictionaries).",
        "In recent years, several books on IR have been published (e.g., Grossman and Frieder 2004; Manning, Raghavan, and Schütze 2008; Buttcher, Clarke, and Cormack 2010), which devoted at most a section or chapter to CLIR.",
        "As specific books on CLIR have been limited so far to edited collections of scientific papers (Grefenstette 1998), it was definitely time for the first monograph on the topic.",
        "Jian-Yun Nie's volume is structured as five chapters, which are organized as follows:",
        "• Chapter 1, \"Introduction,\" covers IR problems, approaches, and models, language problems in IR with European and East Asian languages, CLIR problems and approaches, needs for CLIR and MLIR, and a brief history",
        "of CLIR.",
        "• Chapter 2, \"Using manually constructed translation systems and resources for CLIR,\" covers an introduction to MT, basic use of MT in CLIR, and dictionary-based translation for CLIR.",
        "• Chapter 3, \"Translation based on parallel and comparable corpora,\" covers methods for automatic paragraph and sentence alignment, use",
        "of translation models for CLIR, alternative approaches using parallel corpora, discussion of CLIR methods and resources, and mining for translation resources and relations.",
        "• Chapter 4, \"Other methods to improve CLIR,\" covers pre-and post-translation expansion, fuzzy matching, combination of translations, transitive translation, and integration of monolingual and translingual relations.",
        "• Chapter 5, \"A look into the future: Towards a unified view of monolingual IR and CLIR?\"",
        "summarizes the state-of-the-art in CLIR and proposals for improvements.",
        "CLIR approaches are in general presented together with their statistical models, whose understanding does not require more than elementary calculus and probability theory.",
        "However, the book does not present algorithms or data structures to implement the models, so it might not be a sufficient resource to build an effective CLIR system.",
        "The first two chapters are rather introductory and lead to the conventional CLIR approach, in which MTor dictionary-based translation is simply cascaded with monolingual IR.",
        "A discussion on the limitations of using such general translation tools convinces the reader of the need for translation techniques that are more specific to and better integrated with IR.",
        "In Chapters 3 and 4, the core of the book, several advanced CLIR models from the recent literature are discussed.",
        "In particular, Chapter 3 focuses on the collection and processing of parallel texts and on statistical translation models for query terms.",
        "Chapter 4 discusses cross-lingual counterparts of well-established IR techniques (i.e., pre-and post-translation query expansion) as well as CLIR-specific methods to further improve retrieval performance (e.g., fuzzy matching and translation combination).",
        "Finally, in Chapter 5 the author, starting from a parallel between query expansion in IR and query translation in CLEF, proposes new directions for future work.",
        "In conclusion, the book presents a body of work in CLIR with a uniform level of presentation and a consistent notation.",
        "It is definitely a good reference for an introduction to the field as well as for a survey of the state-of-the-art."
