        "The combination of these pragmatic effects results in the large range of linguistic variation observed between individual speakers (Biber 1988).",
        "Much of the research on generating utterances that manifest different linguistic styles has focused on text generation applications such as journalistic writing or instruction manuals (Hovy 1988; Scott and de Souza 1990; Paris and Scott 1994; Green and DiMarco 1996; Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 2000; Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha 2003; Inkpen and Hirst 2004).",
        "Recent research in language generation for dialogue applications has also begun to take linguistic variation into account, developing algorithms to modify the system's linguistic style based on either the user's linguistic style, or other factors such as the user's emotional state, her personality, or considerations of politeness strategies (Walker, Cahn, and Whittaker 1997; Lester, Towns, and Fitzgerald 1999; Lester, Stone, and Stelling 1999; Andre et al.",

        "Previous work on SNLG has focused on three main approaches: (a) learning statistical language models (SLMs) from corpora in order to rerank a set of pre-generated utterances; (b) learning utterance reranking models from user feedback rather than corpora; and (c) learning generation parameters directly from data.",
        "The first approach has used SLMs to rerank a large set of candidate utterances, and focused on grammaticality and naturalness (Bangalore and Rambow 2000; Langkilde-Geary 2002; Chambers and Allen 2004; Nakatsu and White 2006).",
        "The seminal work of Langkilde and Knight (1998) in this area showed that high quality paraphrases can be generated from an underspecified representation of meaning, by first applying a very underconstrained, rule-based overgeneration phase, whose outputs are then ranked by an SLM scoring phase.",
        "The SLM scoring gives a low score (rank) to any ungrammatical output produced by the rule-based generator.",
        "We will refer to this as the overgenerate and scoring (OS) approach.",
        "In a novel twist, Isard, Brockmann, and Oberlander (2006) applied this method to the generation of dialogues in which conversational agents with different personalities discuss movies.",
        "The SLM ranking model blends SLMs from blogs annotated with Big Five personality traits with SLMs from Switchboard, a much larger conversational dialogue corpus.",
        "Their CRAG-2 generator discretizes the blog personality ratings into three groups (low, medium, and high), and models personality with three distinct SLM models for each trait.",
        "Each model estimates the likelihood of the utterance given the personality type.",
        "A cache model based on recently used linguistic forms can also be combined, in order to model recency effects and alignment (Pickering and Garrod 2004).",
        "This approach was integrated into a demonstrator, but it does not generate continuous variation (discretization of personality ratings), and to our knowledge it has never been evaluated to test whether the variation produced is perceivable by users.",
        "A second approach to SNLG is a variant of the OS technique that trains the scoring phase to replicate human judgments rather than relying on the probabilities or frequencies of a SLM.",
        "This approach typically uses higher-level syntactic, semantic, and discourse features rather than only n-grams, with typical results demonstrating that the performance of the scoring models approaches the gold-standard human ranking with a relatively small training set (Rambow, Rogati, and Walker 2001; Stent and Guo 2005; Nakatsu and White 2006).",
        "An advantage of this approach is that human judgments can be based on any aspect of the output, such as stylistic differences in politeness or personality.",
        "Walker et al.",
        "(2007) showed that this technique can be used to model individual preferences in rhetorical structure, syntactic form, and content ordering.",
        "In previous work, we also applied this method to scoring randomly produced outputs of PERSONAGE (Mairesse 2008).",
        "The resulting statistical generator is referred to as PERSONAGE-OS.",
        "We randomly varied PERSONAGE's non-deterministic decisions points to generate a large number of paraphrases.",
        "We then computed post hoc features consisting of the actual generation decisions, surface word n-grams, and content-analysis features from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool (Pennebaker, Francis, and Booth 2001) and the MRC psycholinguistic database (Coltheart 1981).",
        "Example content-analysis features include the ratio of words related to positive emotions (e.g., good), social interactions (e.g., pal), or the average frequency of use of each word.",
        "Scoring models trained on personality ratings of random utterances (in-domain data) outperformed the mean value baseline for all Big Five traits, with the best results for agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability.",
        "The models for those traits predict the ratings of unseen utterances with correlations of r = .52, r = .37, and r = .29, respectively.",
        "We also trained models on out-of-domain data, that is, 96 personality-annotated conversation extracts (without any generation decision features).",
        "Results show that the out-of-domain models perform worse for all traits, only outperforming the baseline for agreeableness and conscientiousness.",
        "We also explored several hybrid methods for training that mix and blend data from different sources.",
        "Inspired by recent work on domain adaptation, we tested whether the performance of the out-of-domain models can be improved when training includes a small amount of data from the target domain, by applying the method of Daumé (2007).",
        "Whereas adding out-of-domain data improved performance for some traits, we find that adding a single domain feature performs as well as Daume's method.",
        "The results showed that mixing randomly generated in-domain utterances with rule-based in-domain utterances improves performance; the rule-based utterances provide a way to incorporate knowledge from the personality psychology literature into an SNLG approach.",
        "Thus, personality scoring models can be effective, although the computational cost of the OS approach remains a major drawback.",
        "The third SNLG approach estimates the generation parameters directly from data, without any overgeneration phase.",
        "If the language generator is constrained to be a generative SLM, the parameters can then be learned through standard maximum-likelihood estimation.",
        "Whereas n-gram SLMs can only model local linguistic phenomena, Belz showed that a context-free grammar (PCFG) can successfully model individual differences in the production of weather reports (Belz 2005, 2008).",
        "This method provides a principled way to produce utterances matching the linguistic style of a specific corpus (e.g., of an individual author) without any overgeneration phase.",
        "However, standard PCFG generation methods require a treebank-annotated corpus, and they cannot model context-dependent generation decisions, such as the control of sentence length or the generation of referring expressions.",
        "Paiva and Evans (2005) adopt a more general framework by learning a regression model mapping generation decisions to stylistic dimensions extracted from a corpus, independently of the language generation mechanism.",
        "Factors are identified by applying factor analysis to a corpus exhibiting stylistic variation, and expressed as a linear combination of linguistic features (Biber 1988).",
        "Textual outputs are generated with a rule-based generator in the target domain that is allowed to randomly vary the generation parameters, while logging the parameter settings corresponding to each output.",
        "Then the same factors found in the original corpus are measured in the random outputs, and linear regression is applied to learn which generation parameters predict the factor measurements.",
        "The generation parameters can then be manipulated to hit multiple stylistic targets on a continuous scale (because factors are measured continuously) by searching for the parameter setting yielding the target stylistic scores according to the linear models.",
        "The generator of Paiva and Evans, trained in this way, can reproduce intended factor levels across several factors, such as sentence length and type of referring expression, thus modeling the stylistic variation as measured in the original corpus.",

        "This article presents a novel SNLG method based on parameter estimation models that estimate optimal generation parameters given target stylistic scores, which are then used directly by the base generator to produce the output utterance.",
        "We believe that dialogue applications such as spoken dialogue systems, interactive drama systems, and intelligent tutoring systems would benefit from taking individual stylistic differences into account, and that theories of human personality traits represent an appropriate set of dimensions for a computational model of this adaptation.",
        "Starting from a communicative goal, we show how personality affects all phases of the language generation process, and that certain parameters such as the polarity of the content selected have a strong effect on the perception of personality.",
        "We present, to our knowledge, the first results of a human evaluation experiment using the perceptions of naive subjects to evaluate the stylistic variation of a language generator.",
        "The parameter estimation method is a computationally tractable generation method that does not require any overgeneration phase, and our results show that naive judges can recognize the intended system personality for most traits.",
        "Whereas most previous work on SNLG is based on the overgenerate and scoring (OS) framework (Langkilde and Knight 1998; Walker, Rambow, and Rogati 2002; Isard, Brockmann, and Oberlander 2006), our results show that direct parameter optimization is a viable alternative for stylistic control.",
        "Given the cost of an overgeneration phase, parameter estimation methods might be the only alternative for real-time generation, which is necessary for spoken dialogue interaction.",
        "The fact that the accuracy of OS methods depends on the complexity of the overgeneration phase prevents them from scaling to the large generation space required for stylistic variation.",
        "For example, an exhaustive search over PERSONAGE's output space would require more than 2 parameter combinations, for each of which an utterance would have to be generated and scored.",
        "On the other hand, the tractability of OS methods could be improved by pruning candidates throughout the generation process, as well as by using compact data structures – such as in the OpenCCG chart realizer (White, Rajkumar, and Martin 2007) – although we do not know of any SNLG system using this approach.",
        "The main advantage of the OS approach is that it can model global utterance features reflecting multiple generation decisions as well as input dependencies (e.g., sentence length).",
        "The predictive accuracy of scoring models trained on our data discussed in the introduction suggests that OS methods could be useful for stylistic SNLG when limited to a mild data-driven overgeneration phase, e.g., to rerank candidate utterances produced by stochastic parameter estimation models.",
        "The OS approach therefore can be seen as a way to relax the parameter independence assumptions required to learn robust models.",
        "Parameter estimation models are trained on utterances generated in the application domain.",
        "In contrast with out-of-domain corpus based methods (Isard, Brockmann, and",
        "Oberlander 2006), in-domain personality annotations not only reduce data sparsity by constraining the range of outputs, they also allow us to explicitly model the relation between stylistic factors and generation decisions.",
        "The parameter estimation approach is inspired by previous work by Paiva and Evans (2005), who present a data-driven method for stylistic control that does not require an overgeneration phase.",
        "We extend this work in multiple ways.",
        "First, we focus on the control of the speaker's personality, rather than stylistic dimensions extracted from corpora.",
        "Second, we present a method for learning parameter estimation models predicting generation decisions directly from input personality scores, whereas the method of Paiva and Evans (2005) requires a search for the optimal generation decision over the model's input space.",
        "Third, we present a perceptual evaluation of the generated stylistic variation, using naive human judges.",
        "We modeled stylistic variation in terms of the Big Five personality traits, because these traits are widely accepted as the most important dimensions of behavioral variation within human beings (Norman 1963; Goldberg 1990).",
        "Collecting reliable personality annotations for in-domain utterances is a non-trivial task, as reflected by the moderate inter-rater agreement reported in Section 4.3.1.",
        "The difficulty is increased by the use of random generation decisions, which is necessary to ensure that the learned relation between personality ratings and generation parameters is not due to artificial correlations between generation decisions.",
        "One way to increase inter-rater agreement would be to reduce the number of parameters varied simultaneously for each utterance, thereby decreasing the chances of observing inconsistent markers.",
        "While this would require collecting a larger training set to model the same number of parameters, one could filter out irrelevant parameters in a first data collection phase, to focus on data quality in a second phase.",
        "A second way to improve the quality of the annotations would be to increase the size of each text sample, by simultaneously rating multiple utterances generated from the same parameters, rather than a single utterance.",
        "This is likely to produce models that are more robust to input variation, given a small increase in annotation effort.",
        "Despite the difficulty of the annotation task, our experiments show that parameter estimation models are able to detect a large range of personality markers in our training set.",
        "The fact that those markers are successfully recognized by naive judges suggests that our approach is robust to ambiguities in the data.",
        "While the Big Five traits are widely accepted in the psychology literature, they differ in terms of their impact on linguistic production.",
        "Results suggest that perceptions of agreeableness and extraversion are easier to model, whereas conscientiousness and openness to experience are more difficult.",
        "A possible explanation is that these traits are not conveyed well in PERSONAGE's narrow domain.",
        "However, previous personality recognition results suggest that observed openness to experience is difficult to model using general conversational data as well (Mairesse et al.",
        "2007).",
        "It is therefore possible that this trait may not be expressed through spoken language as clearly as other traits.",
        "The evaluation using naive judges in Table 10 shows that the average ratings correlate strongly with the target personality scores for all traits but conscientiousness, with correlation coefficients ranging from .41 (openness to experience) up to .80 (extraversion).",
        "It is important to note that the magnitudes of the model correlations are high compared to traditional correlations between personality and linguistic markers, which typically range from .05 to .10 (Pennebaker and King 1999; Mehl, Gosling, and Pennebaker 2006).",
        "This is possibly due to our experimental method, which simultaneously tests a small number of personality markers in a controlled experiment, whereas such markers are harder to extract from the varied language samples used in psychology studies.",
        "In terms of limitations, even though PERSONAGE's parameters were suggested by psychological studies, some of them are not modeled successfully by the parameter estimation approach, and thus were omitted from Tables 6 and 7.",
        "This could be due to the relatively small training set size (160 utterances to optimize 67 parameters).",
        "However, even with a larger training set, it is possible that some of the parameters in Table 2 are not perceivable in our domain.",
        "Additionally, the parameter-independence assumption of the PE method could be responsible for the poor accuracy of some models.",
        "While this issue could possibly be resolved by training statistical models that simultaneously predict multiple dependent variables (e.g., structured prediction methods), this would exponentially increase the size of the parameter prediction space and further aggravate data sparsity issues.",
        "We also find that parameter estimation models perform slightly worse when projecting extreme traits than the rule-based generator in the same domain (see Section 4.3.2).",
        "We believe this is due to the lack of extreme utterances in the training data to learn from.",
        "Future work should consider whether it is possible to flatten the distribution of training data, perhaps using more knowledge or active learning methods for NLG (Mairesse et al.",
        "2010).",
        "Another limitation of the current approach is that we assume the existence of a generation dictionary containing syntactic templates that, in some cases, express various pragmatic effects, even though most of PERSONAGE's variation is generated automatically.",
        "Our dictionary is currently handcrafted, but future work could build on research on methods for extracting the generation dictionary from data (Barzilay and Lee 2002; Higashinaka, Walker, and Prasad 2007; Snyder and Barzilay 2007).",
        "Finally, it is likely that both the accuracy and coverage of parameter estimation models could be improved with a larger sample of judges and random utterances at development time.",
        "A larger number of judges would also smooth out rating inconsistencies and individual differences in personality perception, thus allowing the direct modeling of laypeople's perceptions by removing the need for expert judges.",
        "Another important area for future work is to explore the interface between the language generator and the dialogue manager and text-to-speech (TTS) engine, because personality also affects aspects of dialogue such as initiative and prosodic realization (Scherer 1979; Vogel and Vogel 1986).",
        "It might be possible to apply a similar methodology to the parameterization of a dialogue manager and a TTS component, in order to project a consistent personality to the user, or to use a reinforcement learning approach to train the dialogue manager (Walker, Fromer, and Narayanan 1998; Singh et al.",
        "2002), with personality judgments as the objective function.",
        "Our results suggest that personality can be recognized by manipulating the linguistic cues of a single utterance, but it is likely that additional cues (e.g., characterizing the system's dialogue strategy) could only make the user's perception of the system's personality more robust.",
        "Nevertheless it is clear that the PE SNLG approach offers many advantages over handcrafted methods.",
        "Firstly, SNLG methods can scale more easily to other domains and other types of stylistic variation, as collecting data requires less effort than tuning a large number parameters.",
        "In order to apply our method to a new domain or task, the base generator would have to be modified.",
        "Although PERSONAGE was implemented with domain independence in mind by using general parameters, handling a new communicative goal (e.g., a user request) would require modifying the syntactic aggregation operations as well as the pragmatic marker insertion rules.",
        "Porting PERSONAGE to a new information presentation domain would only require modifying the syntactic templates in the generation dictionary.",
        "Once a base generator is available in the target domain, it can be used to collect ratings for any stylistic dimension.",
        "Our parameter estimation method can then learn to control the generator's output from data, without any further handcrafting or parameter tuning.",
        "A second advantage of our parameter estimation method over handcrafted approaches is that it can learn to target scalar combinations of the Big Five traits, whereas handcrafting all possible ways in which multiple stylistic dimensions can affect output utterances requires considerable effort.",
        "Thirdly, our parameter estimation method can easily model continuous stylistic dimensions, while producing such models by hand is not tractable.",
        "For example, one could interpolate various handcrafted parameter sets to handle continuous input scales (e.g., to generate an utterance that is 75% extravert); however, the various weights can only be learned reliably from data.",
        "Our results also suggest that SNLG systems may still require handcrafting to guarantee the naturalness of the output, but that data-driven models can be used to control various pragmatic effects.",
        "As naturalness depends on the combination of multiple generation decisions, modeling naturalness in the PE framework would require taking inter-parameter dependencies into account.",
        "At training time, this can be achieved by extending each PE model with independent variables for naturalness as well as all previous generation decisions made.",
        "During the generation process, the models would predict future generation decisions given all previous decisions and a high input naturalness value.",
        "Although we believe this approach is tractable, it optimizes parameters sequentially in a greedy fashion.",
        "A global optimization method would require jointly optimizing all (past and future) parameters simultaneously.",
        "However, predictions in such a large output space would require a much larger training set.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that future work should evaluate methods for jointly optimizing multiple NLG decisions.",
        "Finally, this work focuses on controlling the perceptions of the output of a dialogue system, but an important next step is to use these techniques together with personality-based user modeling methods (Mairesse et al.",
        "2007) to simultaneously model the personality of the user and the system in dialogue.",
        "Both models provide the tools for testing various hypotheses regarding personality-based alignment, such as the similarity-attraction effect (Isard, Brockmann, and Oberlander 2006).",
        "Furthermore, the optimal personality of the system is likely to be application-dependent; it would thus be useful to evaluate how the user's and the system's personality affect task performance in different applications.",
