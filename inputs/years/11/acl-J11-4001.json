        "More specifically, let us use it in the following form:",
        "This is the case because P(E) acts as a linear scaling factor and thus can be ignored.",
        "First, Bayes' Law divides responsibility between a prior over possible models (P(M)) and a term that depends on the evidence, its posterior given the model.",
        "The war between rationalists and empiricists seems to have quieted of late, but it raged during much of my academic career, with the rationalists (typically followers of Chomsky) insisting that the brain is pre-wired for language (and presumably much of the rest) and the empiricists believing that our model of the world is determined primarily by the evidence of our senses.",
        "Bayes' Law calmly says that both play large roles, the exact balance to be determined in the future.",
        "The next section looks at the role of informative priors in current models of learning from sensory input.",
        "Secondly, Bayes' Law says that evidence is incorporated via a generative model of the world (P(E | M)).",
        "This is, of course, as opposed to a discriminative model (P(M | E)).",
        "There is a lot to be said in favor of the latter.",
        "When both are possibilities, the general wisdom has it that discriminative models work better on average.",
        "Icertainly have that impression.",
        "But children have only the evidence of their senses to go by.",
        "Nobody reads them the Penn Treebank or any other training data early in their career.",
        "Thus generative models seem to be the only game in town.",
        "Furthermore, this generative model has to be a very large one – one of the entire world insofar as the child knows it.",
        "For example, we can describe visual experiences in language, so it must include both vision and language, not to mention touch and smell.",
        "Thus it must be a joint model of all of these.",
        "Taking this to heart, Ilook in Section 4 at some work that uses joint modeling of multiple phenomena.",
        "Lastly, Bayes' Law gives another clue, this time by what it omits – any notion of how any of this is done.",
        "This suggests, to me at least, that the inference mechanism itself is not learned, and if not, it must be innate.",
        "Or to put it another way, Darwinian selection has already done the learning for us.",
        "In the final section I will address what we can say about this mechanism.",
        "One last point before moving on.",
        "What is the model that is to be learned?",
        "Bayes' Law does not, in fact, tell us.",

        "That is, if you don't know the correct model, you should plan accordingly and not commit.",
        "This corresponds to the equation",
        "Now integrating over all models makes a lot of sense, but to me it sounds a lot like telling people to change all their passwords every month – it is sound advice, but who will take the time?",
        "One possibility is to adopt the most likely one, for example,",
        "At first glance this would seem to be a no-brainer, but some worry that we could have a probability distribution something like that in Figure 2.",
        "Here the most likely one, off on the right, has the very bad property that if we are only a little bit wrong we end up with a very bad model of the world, thus negatively impacting the probability that we will survive to have progeny.",
        "Better is to take the average model.",
        "This will put us somewhere in the middle of the large block on the left, relatively safe from catastrophic results from small errors.",
        "My personal opinion is that this will turn out to be a non-problem.",
        "Given the right prior, the probability space over models will have one huge peak and not much else.",

        "In this section I give three examples of such priors, two in language, one in vision.",
        "In section 1 we looked at the work in Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (1996) on infants' ability to divide a speech stream into individual \"words.\"",
        "This problem has also been attacked using computational approaches, albeit with simplifying assumptions.",
        "We base our discussion on the work of Goldwater and Griffiths (2007), as it dramatically shows the need for some informative prior.",
        "This, like most other computational linguistic work on word segmentation, considers an abstract model of the problem.",
        "A corpus of child-directed speech is translated into a simplified phoneme string by first transcribing the words, then for each word writing down its most common pronunciation.",
        "All spaces between sounds inside an utterance are removed, but the boundaries between utterances are kept.",
        "For example, you want to see the book would come out as yuwanttusiD6bUk.",
        "The output is to be the phoneme sequence with word boundaries restored.",
        "Although we are really dealing with phoneme sequences with spaces added, we will speak of dividing the speech stream into words.",
        "A simple generative model for this task goes as follows:",
        "For each utterance:",
        "It is assumed here that P(w) is over possible vocabulary items plus a special \"end-of-utterance\" symbol.",
        "If we have no prior on possible P(w)'s, then Bayes' Law reduces to finding the M = P(w) that makes the data most likely, and this is easy to specify.",
        "It is simply a distribution with n \"words,\" each one a single utterance.",
        "That is, it is a distribution that memorizes the training data.",
        "It is easy to see why this is so.",
        "If the model generalized at all, it would assign probability to a sequence that is not in the input, and thus the probability of observed training data must be less than that assigned by the memorization model.",
        "In Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) the model was forced away from this solution by adopting a \"sparse prior\" – in this case a \"Dirichlet\" distribution.",
        "This says, in effect, prefer M's with as few different words as possible.",
        "Thus if the number of words is significantly smaller than the number of utterances, there is some pressure to prefer a word-based distribution over one for each utterance.",
        "Unfortunately, the Dirichlet is a very weak prior, that is, the \"pressure\" is not very great.",
        "So in one solution to the problem the child's utterance comes out as youwant to see thebook.",
        "There is still a distinct tendency to merge words together.",
        "Why is Dirichlet so weak?",
        "We want to evaluate the probability of our prior multiplied by a generative posterior for a particular model M. In our case M is just a",
        "until the \"end of utterance\" symbol is chosen Pick the next word according to P(w).",
        "probability distribution over possible words.",
        "We assume for the sake of argument that we get this distribution from estimated integer counts over possible words.",
        "(In Section 5 we look at how Goldwater and Griffiths [2007] actually infers this distribution.)",
        "So our current guess is that we have seen the \"word\" D6bUk two times, and so forth.",
        "A simple maximum likelihood distribution would assign a probability to this word of £, where L is the total number of word tokens the model currently proposes in all of the utterances.",
        "Of course, the maximum likelihood distribution is called the maximum likelihood distribution because for a given set of counts it assigns probabilities to make the probability of the data (the \"likelihood\") as high as possible.",
        "Therefore it will lead us to the memorization result.",
        "The Dirichlet does something slightly different.",
        "Imagine that before we do the division L we subtract 2 from each nonzero word count.",
        "Then D6bUk has a probability L-055K, where K is the number of different word types (dictionary entries, as it were).",
        "This creates sparsity in the sense that entries that already have few counts tend to get still fewer because they are impacted more than words with high counts.",
        "So if we have two words, one with a count of 1 and one with a count of 1,000, and we have, say, a total of 10,000 word tokens and 1,000 word types, the first will go from a probability of 10~to approximately 0.53 • 10~ and the second will actually increase slightly (from 0.1 to 0.105).",
        "Thus words with small counts get crowded out, and the distribution becomes more sparse.",
        "But the crowding is not all that strong, and in this model there are much stronger countervailing winds.",
        "The model assumes that words appear at random, and this is very far from the case.",
        "In the first utterance the phrase the book occurs much more often than the independent probabilities of the and book would suggest, so the model has an incentive to make them one word in order to capture a regularity it otherwise has no way to represent.",
        "Including bigram probabilities in the model would do the trick, and indeed, performance is greatly enhanced by this change.",
        "But this takes us beyond our current topic – priors.",
        "We turn now to work by Sudderth and Jordan (2008) on segmenting an image into pieces that correspond to objects and background, as in Figure 3.",
        "To put the goal another way, each pixel in the image should be assigned to exactly one of a small number of groups, so that all the pixels in the same group exactly cover the places in the image corresponding to one type of object, be it people, trees, sky, and so on.",
        "Any one pixel can, a priori, be in any of the different groups.",
        "But not all groupings are equally plausible in an everyday image.",
        "Consider Figure 4.",
        "Each row corresponds to random samples from a prior distribution over possible images, where each color corresponds to one pixel set.",
        "Although neither looks like scenes from the world around us, the upper row is more plausible than the lower one.",
        "The lower one corresponds to the so-called \"Potts\" prior: each pixel is a node in a Markov random field, and the Potts prior encourages neighboring points to be from the same region.",
        "Although these pixel arrays have such a property, there are all sorts of features that are not image-like.",
        "Single pixels are surrounded by other regions.",
        "If we divide the array into, say, tenths, each tenth probably has at least one pixel from all of the sets, and so forth.",
        "The upper, more plausible \"images\" come from the prior illustrated in Figure 5.",
        "The process of randomly selecting from the prior works as follows: First generate a three-dimensional surface by picking a small number of points and placing a two-dimensional Gaussian over them.",
        "The surface point height corresponds to the sum of all the Gaussian values at that point.",
        "The topmost image on the left is an example.",
        "Now locate a random plane parallel to the bottom of the image.",
        "All surface areas above the plane correspond to image region number 1.",
        "The dark blue area in the image on the right corresponds to a plane through the top left Gaussian with the yellow and red areas above the selected plane.",
        "We assign region 1 to be the areas most in the foreground.",
        "We then repeat this process with new Gaussians and new planes (images 2 and 3 on the left) until we get the desired number of regions.",
        "The result is the random pixel array on the right.",

        "Image priors from sets of Gaussians.",
        "Naturally, in image segmentation one does not generate random selections from the prior.",
        "But the depictions give the reader an idea of the biases placed on image reconstruction.",
        "A better way to think about the process would be to imagine that we try different reconstructions of the kinds of texture, lines, and so forth, that correspond to a single image region, and then present each of these region combinations to the prior for its \"take\" on things.",
        "It will strongly prefer blobby regions, with nearer ones tending to be convex.",
        "And, as we would hope, region segmentation works better with the more realistic prior.",
        "Part-of-speech tagging is the process of labeling each word of a string with its correct part of speech, a category such as \"plural noun\" (NNS) or preposition (PP), that to some degree captures the syntactic properties of the word.",
        "The problem is not completely well defined insofar as there is no single \"correct\" set – part-of-speech sets for English range in size between 12 and 20 • 12.",
        "Nevertheless, words do fall into such categories and even as rough approximations they are useful as a first step in parsing.",
        "In unsupervised part-of-speech induction we want our program to infer a set of parts of speech.",
        "Because of their arbitrary properties, the size of this set is typically set in advance – for English typically 45, corresponding to the Penn Treebank set.",
        "Since the early work of Merialdo (1994) we have known that this is a difficult problem, and in retrospect it is easy to see why.",
        "Most generative models work from the following generative story:",
        "For each word wi",
        "where ti is the ith (current) tag, ti_1 the previous, and wi is the current word.",
        "With no prior over models, any such story is simply going to divide words into some number of classes to best raise the probability of the words.",
        "Merialdo uses expectation maximization (EM) to find his classes.",
        "Nothing in this set-up says anything about looking for syntactic properties, and it should therefore not be surprising that the classes found are as much semantic or phonological as syntactic.",
        "For example, a good way to raise probability is to split determiners into two categories, one including a, the second an.",
        "Similarly, for nouns create two classes, \"starting with vowel\" and \"starting with consonant.\"",
        "This means that other less-used categories (foreign word or symbol) get omitted entirely.",
        "This is the sort of thing EM does.",
        "Words are assigned many tags (typically on the order of 10 to 20) and it evens out the tag assignments so most tags have the same number of words assigned to them.",
        "There is, however, prior knowledge that is useful here.",
        "Iam following here the work of Clark (2003).",
        "Clark first notes that, for the languages tried to date, most words have either just one tag or one tag that dominates all the others.",
        "As just remarked, this is a far cry from what EM does.",
        "So the first thing Clark (2003) does is to impose a one-tag-per-word-type constraint.",
        "This more closely models the true distribution than does the EM outcome.",
        "In the paper he notes that giving this up inevitably yields poorer results.",
        "Secondly, he notes that, again contrary to EM's proclivities, tags have very skewed word counts.",
        "Some, typically content-word types like nouns, have very large numbers of word types, whereas grammatical types such as prepositions have very few.",
        "Putting this fact into the prior also helps significantly.",
        "Note that using these facts (close to one tag per word and widely differing wordtype counts per tag) in our prior amounts to positing linguistic universals.",
        "Iam not an expert in world languages and thus anything Isay about this is far from definitive, but as linguistic universals go, these look reasonable to me."

        "Naturally, there is no guarantee that the first pronoun following a person's name refers back to that individual, but the statistical signal is pretty strong.)",
        "Conversely, suppose we have solved the co-reference problem.",
        "We could then pick up facts such as Congressmen is a good descriptor of one kind of entity (e.g., person).",
        "Or that people and organizations, but not places, can say things.",
        "In practice the model distinguishes among entity types (e.g., person), entities (e.g., the particular congressman), and mentions (the word sequence Congressman Weiner).",
        "All entities have an entity type that provides a prior on the properties of the entity.",
        "So suppose we see a new entity that is described by the mention Congressman Boehner.",
        "The program will make a guess about entity type.",
        "If the program already \"knows\" that congressman is a legitimate descriptor for people but not other types, this will bias the program towards person.",
        "Naturally, the program does not call these types \"person,\" \"place,\" and so on.",
        "Rather, the program is told in advance to expect some small number of entity types, say ten.",
        "If it works properly, we should see after the fact that the program has indeed jointly learned not only co-reference, but the common types of individuals mentioned in the news articles.",
        "Of course, the program cannot even begin to approach the accuracy of discriminative named-entity tagging.",
        "But from the perspective of this talk, that is besides the point.",
        "We are taking a child's view of the problem.",
        "Furthermore, eventually we want not just three or ten entity types, but a very detailed hierarchy (almost certainly an acyclic graph) of them.",
        "My guess is that such a graph can only be learned."

        "Bayes' Law says nothing about the mechanism used to infer a model of the world and from that Iconclude that this mechanism is innate.",
        "Nevertheless, any model, no matter how abstracted from the particulars of neural implementation, must eventually confront the question of how these inferences are carried out.",
        "For many of us, optimizing generative models has been virtually synonymous with expectation maximization.",
        "It is relatively efficient, and although it can be prone to local maxima, it often works well when started from uninformative initial states – the IBM Model 1 of machine-translation fame being an obvious case in point.",
        "However, it has very serious drawbacks: It does not make room for a prior over models, it requires storing the training data for multiple iterations, and as its sine qua non, it requires the storage of all possible expectations on the data, which in many cases of interest is simply not feasible.",
        "Consider again the problem of segmenting a sound stream into words.",
        "The string yuwanttusiD6bUk can be broken up into yu want tusiD6b Uk, yuwant tu siD6bUk,and so forth.",
        "To a first approximation the number grows exponentially in the length of the string and EM requires storing expectations counts for all of the possibilities.",
        "This is why Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) use Gibbs sampling rather than EM.",
        "In Gibbs sampling we do not store the probabilities of all possibilities, but rather repeatedly go through data making somewhat random choices based upon the program's current \"beliefs.\"",
        "For word segmentation this means we look at the point between two phonemes and ask, \"Should we put a word boundary here?\"",
        "We compute the probability for the two cases (two words here or just one) based upon the counts we have currently guessed.",
        "So if the \"no-segment\" case produces a word we have seen reasonably often, its probability would be higher than the product of the probabilities for the two-word case.",
        "Suppose it comes out 60-40.",
        "We then flip a 60-40 biased coin and put in a split if it is heads.",
        "Note that at any one time we need to store only counts for those words for which the program has at least one attestation, a number that grows only linearly in string length.",
        "But Gibbs sampling, too, has serious drawbacks.",
        "Like EM, it is an iterative algorithm.",
        "As a psychological theory it would require the child to store all of her experiences and continually revise her beliefs about all of them.",
        "Another major problem with Gibbs sampling is its requirement that the probability model is \"exchangeable.\"",
        "Each Gibbs iteration requires visiting all the decisions and (possibly) revising them.",
        "Being exchangeable means that if we had made the same decisions but in a different order (picking the sentences in reverse order, or first picking even-numbered places between phonemes, then odd), the probability after visiting every one exactly once would come out the same.",
        "Amazingly, the word-segmentation model is exchangeable.",
        "But mathematical miracles do not grow on trees.",
        "Although the Haghighi-Klein reference model uses Gibbs sampling, their model is not in fact exchangeable, something they had to work around.",
        "More generally, this requirement is ever less likely to be satisfied as our probability models become more complicated.",
        "Or consider the options in inference mechanisms for statistical parsing.",
        "If we restrict ourselves to constituent parsing (as opposed to dependency parsing), the most used search algorithm is Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY).",
        "CKY takes a context-free grammar and uses the context-free property to reduce an exponential search problem to O(n), where n is the length of the sentence.",
        "CKY is bottom-up, so for a sentence like Dogs eat food it would first find the noun phrases Dogs and food, then build up a verb phrase eat food, and only after completely processing the entire sentence would it link the subject Dogs to the verb phrase eat food.",
        "But there are very strong reasons to believe that people do nothing like this.",
        "The strongest is the observation that various tests (as well as introspection) indicate that we are well aware that Dog is the subject of eat before the sentence is complete.",
        "(This is increasingly obvious as we make the sentence longer.)",
        "The second reason is more subtle but to me equally important, the context-free requirement.",
        "In a context-free grammar, saying that there is, say, a VP spanning positions 1 to 3 in our sentence is also saying that no knowledge from anywhere else in the sentence has any effect on what goes on inside this verb phrase, and vice versa.",
        "Putting it another way, every symbol in a CKY chart is a knowledge barrier between its outside and inside.",
        "We have managed to tame this somewhat by \"state splitting,\" annotating the \"VP\" with other information, but to the degree that we do this we are exactly losing the performance that CKY should deliver.",
        "We see a pattern here.",
        "We want large joint models, and we want to take advantage of them by using as much as possible of our experiential history (e.g., previous words of a sentence) to influence our expectations of what should come next and how our model of the world should adapt.",
        "But increasingly as we do this, various mathematical and algorithm shortcuts cease to work.",
        "Actually, when you look at our requirements, there are not that many options.",
        "We want a mechanism that uses probabilities to guide the search for a model, it has to be able to incorporate prior knowledge, and it cannot depend on storing very much of our experiential history.",
        "Offhand this sounds like some sort of beam search with probability estimates as the search heuristic and this is, in fact, the solution that Brian Roark (Roark and Johnson 1999) and I(Charniak 2010) both adopted for parsing models that seem reasonable as models of human performance.",
        "A standard example of such a search mechanism is particle filtering.",
        "It is somewhat like Gibbs sampling, except rather than repeatedly re-evaluating previous inputs it tries multiple evaluations immediately.",
        "In the limit, as the size of the beam goes to infinity, it is equivalent to Gibbs sampling but does not require exchangeability.",
        "But as John Maynard Keynes almost said, in the limit we are all dead.",
        "In practice we cannot afford that many particles (beam size).",
        "When discussing model selection, Icommented that as far as Ican see the only option is to \"integrate\" over a very small number of possible models.",
        "Isaid this because this is essentially what particle filtering is doing.",
        "Compared to EM, or Gibbs sampling, or CKY, this is quite inefficient.",
        "But it is not as though we have a lot of options here.",
        "It, or something quite like it, seems to be the best we can hope for."
