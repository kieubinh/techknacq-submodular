        "However, most of the work has been focused just on best-worst decisions, namely, finding a ranking between different machine translation systems.",

        "The overall goal is to get a better overview of the nature of actual translation errors – to identify strong and weak points of a translation system, to get ideas about possible improvements of the system, to analyze improvements achieved by particular methods, and to better understand the differences between different translation systems.",
        "There are many possible ways to carry out automatic error analysis using the proposed framework.",
        "The focus of this work is classifying errors into the following five categories: morphological (inflectional) errors, reordering errors, missing words, extra words, and incorrect lexical choice.",
        "In addition, the distribution of these error types over POS classes is investigated.",
        "This method can be applied to any language pair; the prerequisite is the availability of a morpho-syntactic analyzer for the target language.",
        "The results of the proposed method are compared with the results obtained by human error analysis.",
        "Detailed experiments on different types of corpora and various language pairs are carried out in order to investigate two applications of error analysis: estimating the contribution of each error category within one translation output, and comparing different translation outputs using the introduced error categories.",

        "As for the comparison of different translation outputs, we show that all error categories except extra words correlate well with the human analysis.",
        "We also show that verbs, nouns, and adverbs correlate well in all error categories (except extra words), as well as that inflectional and reordering errors correlate well for almost all POS classes.",
        "Nevertheless, for missing words, lexical errors, and extra words, some of the POS classes have low correlations.",
        "The main reason for these discrepancies is again the problematic disambiguation between the three error categories.",

        "The work described in this article also opens many other directions for future work.",

        "We show that the results obtained by the proposed framework correlate very well with the results of human error analysis, as well as that the main source of discrepancies is disambiguation between missing words, lexical errors, and extra words.",
        "The new error rates are then calculated for various translation outputs in order to compare them.",
        "Different source and target languages are compared to see particular problems for each language pair and translation direction.",
        "An analysis of improvements yielded by POS-based reorderings is carried out as well.",
        "Finally, we show how the new measures can show differences between distinct translation systems, namely, what are the weak/strong points of particular systems.",
        "The presented framework offers a number of possibilities for future work, both to improve the proposed metrics as well as to investigate other set-ups."
