        "However, they were not to use knowledge of the future when annotating a historical article.",
        "For example, an article from the fall of 1990 may talk about the coming war against Iraq.",
        "Today we know exactly how long that lasted.",
        "But annotators were asked to try to put themselves in the shoes of the 1990 readers of that article, and make their judgments accordingly.",
        "This was because we wanted people's estimates of typical durations of events, rather than the exact durations.",
        "Annotation could be made easier and more consistent if coreferential and nearcorefer-ential descriptions of events were identified initially.",

        "When the articles were completely annotated by the three annotators, the results were analyzed and the differences were reconciled.",
        "Differences in annotation could be due to the differences in interpretations of the event; we found that the vast majority of radically different judgments could be categorized into a relatively small number of classes, however.",
        "Some of these correspond to aspectual features of events, which have been investigated intensively (e.g., Vendler 1967; Dowty, 1979; Moens and Steedman 1988; Passonneau 1988; Giorgi and Pianesi 1997; Madden and Zwaan 2003; Smith 2005).",
        "We then developed guidelines to make annotators aware of these cases and to guide them in making the judgments (see the next section).",

        "But the number of these discrepancies was surprisingly small.",

        "Although they may seem instantaneous, we believe they should be considered to happen across some interval (i.e., the first or last sub-event of the larger event).",
        "For example, in the \"finished\" event should be considered as the last sub-event of the larger event (the \"cleaning\" event), because it actually involves opening the door of the washer, taking out the clothes, closing the door, and so on.",
        "All this takes time.",
        "This interpretation will also give us more information on typical durations than if we simply assume such events are instantaneous.",

        "General Abacha's supporters began a two-day rally in the capital.",
        "the gathering of people marks the \"beginning\" of the rally, and it generally takes time for a crowd of people to get together to start a rally.",

        "the saying probably took between 1 and 3 seconds; it's very unlikely it took more than 10 seconds.",
        "• Unquoted Report: When the reporting description occurs without quotes, the report could be as short as the duration of the actual utterance of the reported content (lower bound), and as long as the duration of a briefing or press conference (upper bound).",
        "If the sentence is very short, then it's likely that it is one complete sentence from the speaker's remarks, and a short duration should be given; if it is a long, complex sentence, then it's more likely to be a summary of a long discussion or press conference, and a longer duration should be given.",
        "For example, consider",
        "The police said it did not appear that anyone else was injured.",
        "A Brooklyn woman who was watching her clothes dry in a laundromat was killed Thursday evening when two would-be robbers emptied their pistols into the store, the police said.",
        "If the first sentence were quoted text, it would be very much the same.",
        "Hence the duration of the \"said\" event should be short.",
        "In the second sentence everything that the spokesperson (here the police) has said is compiled into a single sentence by the reporter, and it is unlikely that the spokesperson said only a single sentence with all this information.",
        "Thus, it is reasonable to give longer duration to this \"said\" event.",
        "Multiple Events: Many occurrences of verbs and other event descriptors refer to multiple events, especially, but not exclusively, if the subject or object of the verb is plural.",
        "For example, in",
        "Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles.",
        "both single (i.e., destroyed one missile) and aggregate (i.e., destroyed all missiles) events happened.",
        "This was a significant source in disagreements in our first round of annotation.",
        "Because both judgments provide useful information, our current annotation interface allows the annotator to specify the event as multiple, and give durations for both the single and aggregate events.",
        "In the following example:",
        "Seventy-five million copies of the rifle have been built since it entered production in February 1947.",
        "\"built\" and \"production\" are both multiple events.",
        "The annotators were asked to give durations for both the single (i.e., built/produce one rifle) and aggregate (i.e., built/produce 75 million copies of the rifle) events.",
        "Events Involving Negation: Negated events didn't happen, so it may seem strange to specify their duration.",
        "But whenever negation is used, there is a certain class of events whose occurrence is being denied.",
        "Annotators should consider this class, and make a judgment about the likely duration of the events in it.",
        "In addition, there is the interval during which the nonoccurrence of the events holds.",
        "For example, in",
        "He was willing to withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be",
        "there is the typical amount of time of \"being attacked,\" namely, the duration of a single attack, and a longer period of time of \"not being attacked.\"",
        "The first is probably from seconds to minutes and the second from months to years.",
        "Similarly to multiple events, annotators were asked to give durations for both the event negated and the negation of that event.",
        "Appearance Events.",
        "Verbs like \"seem\" and \"appear\" usually indicate appearance events.",
        "The duration of this kind of event depends on the duration of the validity or availability of the evidence that causes one to have some impression at the time.",
        "Such an event begins when enough evidence has accumulated for one to make that guess or judgment, and it ends when either the evidence is contradicted or certainty is achieved.",
        "For example, in",
        "It appears that the destruction of this city in 2700 B.C.",
        "was related to the eruption of the",
        "the \"appears\" event lasts from when the archaeologist discovers enough evidence to make the conjecture until the time the conjecture is refuted or confirmed.",
        "Positive Infinite Durations: These are states which continue essentially forever once they begin, for example,",

        "We first need to decide what scale is most appropriate.",
        "One possibility is just to convert all the temporal units to seconds.",
        "However, this would not correctly capture our intuitions about the relative relations between duration ranges.",

        "In order to handle this problem, we use a logarithmic scale for our data.",
        "After first converting from temporal units to seconds, we then take the natural logarithms of these values.",
        "This use of a logarithmic scale also conforms to the idea of the importance of half orders of magnitude (HOM) (Hobbs 2000; Hobbs and Kreinovich 2001), which has been shown to have utility in commonsense reasoning and in several very different linguistic contexts.",
        "In the literature on the kappa statistic, most authors address only category data (either in nominal scales or ordinal scales); some can handle more general data, such as data in interval scales or ratio scales (Krippendorff 1980; Carletta 1996).",
        "However, none of the techniques directly apply to our data, which involves a range of durations from a lower bound to an upper bound.",

        "In the research described in this article, we have addressed a problem – extracting information about event durations encoded in event descriptions – that has heretofore received very little attention in the field.",
        "It is information that can have a substantial impact on applications where the temporal placement of events is important.",
        "Moreover, it is representative of a set of problems – making use of the vague information in text – that has largely eluded empirical approaches in the past.",
        "We have explicated the linguistic categories of the phenomena that give rise to grossly discrepant judgments among annotators, and give guidelines for resolving these discrepancies.",
        "We have also described a method for measuring inter-annotator agreement when the judgments are intervals on a scale; this should extend from time to other scalar judgments.",
        "Inter-annotator agreement is too low on fine-grained judgments.",
        "However, for the coarsegrained judgments of more than or less than a day, and of approximate agreement on temporal unit, human agreement is acceptably high.",
        "For these cases, we have shown that machine-learning techniques achieve encouraging results.",
        "This article has also provided the necessary foundation for modeling and learning our most fine-grained duration annotations that are intervals on a scale.",
        "The duration interval has been modeled using the normal distribution, and the difference between two duration intervals are then the overlap between two distributions.",
        "So in order to learn this distribution, only two parameters need to be learned, namely, the mean and the standard deviation of the normal distribution, and the cost function can be defined as a function of distribution overlaps."
