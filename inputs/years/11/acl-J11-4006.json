        "Through much experimentation, we determine that this result is primarily caused by a lack of lexical information.",

        "We attain 89.14% F-score on this much more difficult task.",
        "Finally, we implement a post-processing module that brackets nps identified by the Bikel (2004) parser.",

        "With the augmented Penn Treebank that we have created, the true head can now be identified.",
        "This may remove the need to condition on the previous modifier, and will be experimented with in Section 5.4.",
        "The separate NP submodel also allows the parser to learn NP boundaries effectively, namely, that it is rare for words to precede a determiner in an NP.",
        "Collins (2003, page 602) gives the example Yesterday the dog barked, where conditioning on the head of the NP, dog, results in incorrectly generating Yesterday as part of the NP.",
        "On the other hand, if the model is conditioning on the previous modifier, the, then the correct STOP category is much more likely to be generated, as words do not often come before the in an NP.",
        "Collins also notes that a separate X-bar level is helpful for the parser's performance.",

        "In this case the example shown in the table is correct (with a tick in the final column), while the parser would've incorrectly labeled the bracket as JJP.",

        "In particular, NML nodes that begin with a determiner are quite rare, only occurring when a possessive follows.",
        "The parser also has difficulty in replicating the constituents around speech marks and brackets.",
        "We suspect that this is due to the fact that Collins's model does not generate punctuation as it does other constituents.",
        "There are a number of NML and JJP brackets in the parser's output that are clearly incorrect, either because they define right-branching structure (which we leave implicit) or because they dominate only a single token.",
        "The only single token NMLs exist in coordinations, but unfortunately the parser is too liberal with this rule.",

        "We carry out a subtractive analysis of the feature types, and find that both context feature groups, as well as the semantic, border, POS tag rule, and parser features all have a negative impact on performance.",
        "Our optimal result comes from removing these feature groups.",
        "The 89.14% F-score achieved with this model is shown as Best in Table 21.",
