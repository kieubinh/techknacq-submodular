        "Languages with rich morphological systems present significant hurdles for statistical machine translation (SMT), most notably data sparsity, source-target asymmetry, and problems with automatic evaluation.",
        "In this work, we propose to address the problem of morphological complexity in an English-to-Finnish MT task within a phrase-based translation framework.",
        "We focus on unsupervised segmentation methods to derive the morphological information supplied to the MT model in order to provide coverage on very large datasets and for languages with few hand-annotated resources.",
        "In fact, in our experiments, unsupervised morphology always outperforms the use of a hand-built morphological analyzer.",
        "Rather than focusing on a few linguistically motivated aspects of Finnish morphological behaviour, we develop techniques for handling morphological complexity in general.",
        "We chose Finnish as our target language for this work, because it exemplifies many of the problems morphologically complex languages present for SMT.",
        "Among all the languages in the Europarl data-set, Finnish is the most difficult language to translate from and into, as was demonstrated in the MT Summit shared task (Koehn, 2005).",
        "Another reason is the current lack of knowledge about how to apply SMT successfully to agglutinative languages like Turkish or Finnish.",
        "Our main contributions are: 1) the introduction of the notion of segmented translation where we explicitly allow phrase pairs that can end with a dangling morpheme, which can connect with other morphemes as part of the translation process, and 2) the use of a fully segmented translation model in combination with a post-processing morpheme prediction system, using unsupervised morphology induction.",
        "Both of these approaches beat the state of the art on the English-Finnish translation task.",
        "Morphology can express both content and function categories, and our experiments show that it is important to use morphology both within the translation model (for morphology with content) and outside it (for morphology contributing to fluency).",
        "Automatic evaluation measures for MT, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), WER (Word Error Rate) and PER (Position Independent Word Error Rate) use the word as the basic unit rather than morphemes.",
        "In a word comprised of multiple morphemes, getting even a single morpheme wrong means the entire word is wrong.",
        "In addition to standard MT evaluation measures, we perform a detailed linguistic analysis of the output.",

        "We set up three baseline models for comparison in this work.",
        "The first is a basic word-based model (called Baseline in the results); we trained this on the original unsegmented version of the text.",
        "Our second baseline is a factored translation model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) (called Factored), which used as factors the word, \"stem\" and suffix.",
        "These are derived from the same unsupervised segmentation model used in other experiments.",
        "The results (Table 3) show that a factored model was unable to match the scores of a simple word-based baseline.",
        "We hypothesize that this may be an inherently difficult representational form for a language with the degree of morphological complexity found in Finnish.",
        "Because the morphology generation must be precomputed, for languages with a high degree of morphological complexity, the combinatorial explosion makes it unmanageable to capture the full range of morphological productivity.",
        "In addition, because the morphological variants are generated on a per-word basis within a given phrase, it excludes productive morphological combination across phrase boundaries and makes it impossible for the model to take into account any longdistance dependencies between morphemes.",
        "We conclude from this result that it may be more useful for an agglutinative language to use morphology beyond the confines of the phrasal unit, and condition its generation on more than just the local target stem.",
        "In order to compare the performance of unsupervised segmentation for translation, our third baseline is a segmented translation model based on a supervised segmentation model (called Sup), using the hand-built Omorfi morphological analyzer (Pirinen and Lis-tenmaa, 2007), which provided slightly higher BLEU scores than the word-based baseline.",
        "For segmented translation models, it cannot be taken for granted that greater linguistic accuracy in segmentation yields improved translation (Chang et al., 2008).",
        "Rather, the goal in segmentation for translation is instead to maximize the amount of lexical content-carrying morphology, while generalizing over the information not helpful for improving the translation model.",
        "We therefore trained several different segmentation models, considering factors of granularity, coverage, and source-target symmetry.",
        "We performed unsupervised segmentation of the target data, using Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) and Paramor (Monson, 2008), two top systems from the Morpho Challenge 2008 (their combined output was the Morpho Challenge winner).",
        "However, translation models based upon either Paramor alone or the combined systems output could not match the word-based baseline, so we concentrated on Morfes-sor.",
        "Morfessor uses minimum description length criteria to train a HMM-based segmentation model.",
        "When tested against a human-annotated gold standard of linguistic morpheme segmentations for Finnish, this algorithm outperforms competing unsupervised methods, achieving an F-score of 67.0% on a 3 million sentence corpus (Creutz and Lagus, 2006).",
        "Varying the perplexity threshold in Morfessor does not segment more word types, but rather over-segments the same word types.",
        "In order to get robust, common segmentations, we trained the segmenter on the 5000 most frequent words; we then used this to segment the entire data set.",
        "In order to improve coverage, we then further segmented",
        "and in translation.",
        "any word type that contained a match from the most frequent suffix set, looking for the longest matching suffix character string.",
        "We call this method Unsup L-match.",
        "After the segmentation, word-internal morpheme boundary markers were inserted into the segmented text to be used to reconstruct the surface forms in the MT output.",
        "We then trained the Moses phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2007) on the segmented and marked text.",
        "After decoding, it was a simple matter to join together all adjacent morphemes with word-internal boundary markers to reconstruct the surface forms.",
        "Figure 1(a) gives the full model overview for all the variants of the segmented translation model (super-vised/unsupervised; with and without the Un-sup L-match procedure).",
        "Table 1 shows how morphemes are being used in the MT system.",
        "Of the phrases that included segmentations ('Morph' in Table 1), roughly a third were 'productive', i.e. had a hanging morpheme (with a form such as stem+) that could be joined to a suffix ('Hanging Morph' in Table 1).",
        "However, in phrases used while decoding the development and test data, roughly a quarter of the phrases that generated the translated output included segmentations, but of these, only a small fraction (6%) had a hanging morpheme; and while there are many possible reasons to account for this we were unable to find a single convincing cause.",
        "Morphology generation as a post-processing step allows major vocabulary reduction in the translation model, and allows the use of morphologically targeted features for modeling inflection.",
        "A possible disadvantage of this approach is that in this model there is no opportunity to consider the morphology in translation since it is removed prior to training the translation model.",
        "Morphology generation models can use a variety of bilingual and contextual information to capture dependencies between morphemes, often more long-distance than what is possible using n-gram language models over morphemes in the segmented model.",
        "Similar to previous work (Minkov et al., 2007; Toutanova et al., 2008), we model morphology generation as a sequence learning problem.",
        "Unlike previous work, we use unsupervised morphology induction and use automatically generated suffix classes as tags.",
        "The first phase of our morphology prediction model is to train a MT system that produces morphologically simplified word forms in the target language.",
        "The output word forms are complex stems (a stem and some suffixes) but still missing some important suffix morphemes.",
        "In the second phase, the output of the MT decoder is then tagged with a sequence of abstract suffix tags.",
        "In particular, the output of the MT decoder is a sequence of complex stems denoted by x and the output is a sequence of suffix class tags denoted by y.",
        "We use a list of parts from (x,y) and map to a d-dimensional feature vector $(x, y), with each dimension being a real number.",
        "We infer the best sequence of tags using:",
        "where F(x) returns the highest scoring output y*.",

        "where Z = Ey'eGEN(x) exp($(x y/) ^ w).",
        "Weuse stochastic gradient descent (using crfsgd) to train the weight vector w. So far, this is all off-the-shelf sequence learning.",

        "is to take the abstract suffix tag sequence y* and then map it into fully inflected word forms, and rank those outputs using a morphemic language model.",
        "The abstract suffix tags are extracted from the unsupervised morpheme learning process, and are carefully designed to enable CRF training and decoding.",
        "We call this model CRF-LM for short.",
        "Figure 1(b) shows the full pipeline and Figure 2 shows a worked example of all the steps involved.",
        "We use the morphologically segmented training data (obtained using the segmented corpus described in Section 2.2) and remove selected suffixes to create a morphologically simplified version of the training data.",
        "The MT model is trained on the morphologically simplified training data.",
        "The output from the MT system is then used as input to the CRF model.",
        "The CRF model was trained on a ^210,000 Finnish sentences, consisting of ~1.5 million tokens; the 2,000 sentence Europarl test set consisted of 41,434 stem tokens.",
        "The labels in the output sequence y were obtained by selecting the most productive 150 stems, and then collapsing certain vowels into equivalence classes corresponding to Finnish vowel harmony patterns.",
        "Thus",
        "Note that unlike Section 2.2 we do not use Unsup L-match because when evaluating the CRF model on the suffix prediction task it obtained 95.61% without using Unsup L-match and 82.99% when using Unsup L-match.",
        "variants -ko and -ko become vowel-generic enclitic particle -kO, and variants -ssa and -ssa become the vowel-generic inessive case marker -ssA, etc.",
        "This is the only language-specific component of our translation model.",
        "However, we expect this approach to work for other agglutinative languages as well.",
        "For fusional languages like Spanish, another mapping from suffix to abstract tags might be needed.",
        "These suffix transformations to their equivalence classes prevent morphophonemic variants of the same morpheme from competing against each other in the prediction model.",
        "This resulted in 44 possible label outputs per stem which was a reasonable sized tag-set for CRF training.",

        "We also demonstrate that for Finnish (and possibly other agglutinative languages), phrase-based MT benefits from allowing the translation model access to morphological segmentation yielding productive morphological phrases.",
        "Taking advantage of linguistic analysis of the output we show that using a post-processing morphology generation model can improve translation fluency on a sub-word level, in a manner that is not captured by the BLEU word-based evaluation measure.",
        "In order to help with replication of the results in this paper, we have run the various morphological analysis steps and created the necessary training, tuning and test data files needed in order to train, tune and test any phrase-based machine translation system with our data.",
        "The files can be downloaded from natlang.cs.sfu.ca.",
        "In future work we hope to explore the utility of phrases with productive morpheme boundaries and explore why they are not used more pervasively in the decoder.",
        "Evaluation measures for morphologically complex languages and tuning to those measures are also important future work directions.",
        "Also, we would like to explore a non-pipelined approach to morphological pre-and post-processing so that a globally trained model could be used to remove the target side morphemes that would improve the translation model and then predict those morphemes in the target language."
