        "Supervised machine learning techniques are still the mainstay for many NLP tasks.",
        "There is, however, a well-known bottleneck for these approaches: the amount of high-quality data needed for training, mostly obtained by human annotation.",
        "Active Learning (AL) has been proposed as a promising approach to reduce the amount of time and cost for human annotation.",
        "The idea behind active learning is quite intuitive: instead of annotating a large number of randomly picked instances we carefully select a small number of instances that are maximally informative for the machine learning classifier.",
        "Thus a smaller set of data points is able to boost classifier performance and to yield an accuracy comparable to the one obtained when training the same system on a larger set of randomly chosen data.",
        "43",
        "Active learning has been applied to several NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging (Ringger et al., 2007), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), syntactic parsing (Osborne and Baldridge, 2004; Hwa, 2004), Named Entity Recognition (Shen et al., 2004; Laws and Sch√ºtze, 2008; Tomanek and Hahn, 2009), Word Sense Disambiguation (Chen et al., 2006; Zhu and Hovy, 2007; Chan and Ng, 2007), text classification (Tong and Koller, 1998) or statistical machine translation (Haffari and Sarkar, 2009), and has been shown to reduce the amount of annotated data needed to achieve a certain classifier performance, sometimes by as much as half.",
        "Most of these studies, however, have only simulated the active learning process using goldstandard data.",
        "This setting is crucially different from a real world scenario where we have to deal with erroneous data and inconsistent annotation decisions made by the human annotators.",
        "While simulations are an indispensable instrument to test different parameters and settings, it has been shown that when applying AL to highly ambiguous tasks like e.g. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) with fine-grained sense distinctions, AL can actually harm the learning process (Dang, 2004; Rehbein et al., 2010).",
        "Dang suggests that the lack of a positive effect of AL might be due to inconsistencies in the human annotations and that AL cannot efficiently be applied to tasks which need double blind annotation with adjudication to insure a sufficient data quality.",
        "Even if we take a more optimistic view and assume that AL might still be useful even for tasks featuring a high degree of ambiguity, it remains crucial to address the problem of annotation noise and its impact on AL.",
        "In this paper we present a thorough evaluation of the impact of annotation noise on AL.",
        "We simulate different types of coder errors and assess the effect on the learning process.",

        "We are interested in the question whether or not AL can be successfully applied to a supervised classification task where we have to deal with a considerable amount of inconsistencies and noise in the data, which is the case for many NLP tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, the detection of metaphors, WSD with fine-grained word senses, to name but a few).",
        "Therefore we do not consider part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, where coders are expected to agree on most annotation decisions.",
        "Instead, we focus on work on AL for WSD, where intercoder agreement (at least for fine-grained annotation schemes) usually is much lower than for the former tasks.",
        "Studies on active learning for WSD have been limited to running simulations of AL using gold standard data and a coarse-grained annotation scheme",
        "Hovy, 2007).",
        "Two exceptions are Dang (2004) and Rehbein et al.",
        "(2010) who both were not able to replicate the positive findings obtained for AL for WSD on coarse-grained sense distinctions.",
        "A possible reason for this failure is the amount of annotation noise in the training data which might mislead the classifier during the AL process.",
        "Recent work on the impact of annotation noise on a machine learning task (Reidsma and Carletta, 2008) has shown that random noise can be tolerated in supervised learn-44 ing, while systematic errors (as caused by biased annotators) can seriously impair the performance of a supervised classifier even if the observed accuracy of the classifier on a test set coming from the same population as the training data is as high as 0.8.",
        "Related work (Beigman Klebanov et al., 2008; Beigman Klebanov and Beigman, 2009) has been studying annotation noise in a multi-annotator setting, distinguishing between hard cases (unreliably annotated due to genuine ambiguity) and easy cases (reliably annotated data).",
        "The authors argue that even for those data points where the annotators agreed on one particular class, a proportion of the agreement might be merely due to chance.",
        "Following this assumption, the authors propose a measure to estimate the amount of annotation noise in the data after removing all hard cases.",
        "Klebanov et al.",
        "(2008; 2009) show that, according to their model, high inter-annotator agreement (k) achieved in an annotation scenario with two annotators is no guarantee for a high-quality data set.",
        "Their model, however, assumes that a) all instances where annotators disagreed are in fact hard cases, and b) that for the hard cases the annotators decisions are obtained by coin-flips.",
        "In our experience, some amount of disagreement can also be observed for easy cases, caused by attention slips or by a deviant interpretation of some class(es) by one of the annotators, and the annotation decision of an individual annotator cannot so much be described as random choice (coin-flip) but as systematically biased selection, causing the types of errors which have been shown to be problematic for supervised classification (Reidsma and Carletta, 2008).",
        "Further problems arise in the AL scenario where the instances to be annotated are selected as a function of the sampling method and the annotation judgements made before.",
        "Therefore, Beigman and Klebanov Beigman (2009)'s approach of identifying unreliably annotated instances by disagreement is not applicable to AL, as most instances are annotated only once.",
        "For AL to be succesful, we need to remove systematic noise in the training data.",
        "The challenge we face is that we only have a small set of seed data and no information about the reliability of the annotations assigned by the human coders.",
        "Zhu et al.",
        "(2008) present a method for detecting outliers in the pool of unannotated data to prevent these instances from becoming part of the training data.",
        "This approach is different from ours, where we focus on detecting annotation noise in the manually labelled training data produced by the human coders.",
        "Schein and Ungar (2007) provide a systematic investigation of 8 different sampling methods for AL and their ability to handle different types of noise in the data.",
        "The types of noise investigated are a) prediction residual error (the portion of squared error that is independent of training set size), and b) different levels of confusion among the categories.",
        "Type a) models the presence of unknown features that influence the true probabilities of an outcome: a form of noise that will increase residual error.",
        "Type b) models categories in the data set which are intrinsically hard to disambiguate, while others are not.",
        "Therefore, type b) errors are of greater interest to us, as it is safe to assume that intrinsically ambiguous categories will lead to biased coder decisions and result in the systematic annotation noise we are interested in.",
        "Schein and Ungar observe that none of the 8 sampling methods investigated in their experiment achieved a significant improvement over the random sampling baseline on type b) errors.",
        "In fact, entropy sampling and margin sampling even showed a decrease in performance compared to random sampling.",
        "For AL to work well on noisy data, we need to identify and remove this type of annotation noise during the AL process.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on detecting and removing annotation noise by human coders during AL."

        "To make sure that the data we use in our simulation is as close to real-world data as possible, we do not create an artificial data set as done in (Schein and Ungar, 2007; Reidsma and Carletta, 2008) but use real data from a WSD task for the German verb drohen (threaten).",
        "Drohen has three different word senses which can be disambiguated by humans with a high accuracy.",
        "This point is crucial to our setup.",
        "To control the amount of noise in the data, we need to be sure that the initial data set is noise-free.",
        "For classification we use a maximum entropy classifier.",
        "Our sampling method is uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994), a standard sampling heuristic for AL where new instances are selected based on the confidence of the classifier for predicting the appropriate label.",
        "As a measure of uncertainty we use Shannon entropy (1) (Zhang and Chen, 2002) and the margin metric (2) (Schein and Ungar, 2007).",
        "The first measure considers the model's predictions q for each class c and selects those instances from the pool where the Shannon entropy is highest.",
        "The second measure looks at the difference between the largest two values in the prediciton vector q, namely the two predicted classes c, cC which are, according to our model, the most likely ones for instance xn, and selects those instances where the difference (margin) between the two predicted probabilities is the smallest.",
        "We discuss some details of this metric in Section 4.",
        "The features we use for WSD are a combination of context features (word token with window size 11 and POS context with window size 7), syntactic features based on the output of a dependency parserand semantic features based on GermaNet hyper-onyms.",
        "These settings were tuned to the target verb by (Rehbein et al., 2009).",
        "All results reported below are averages over a 5-fold cross validation.",
        "Before starting the AL trials we automatically separate the 2,500 sentences into test set (498 sentences) and pool (2,002 sentences), retaining the overall distribution of word senses in the data set.",
        "We insert a varying amount of noise into the pool data,",
        "Table 1 : Distribution of word senses in pool and test sets starting from 0% up to 0% of noise, increasing by 2% in each trial.",
        "We assess the impact of annotation noise on active learning in three different settings.",
        "In the first setting, we randomly select new instances from the pool (random sampling; rand).",
        "In the second setting, we randomly replace n percent of all labels (from 0 to 30) in the pool by another label before starting the active learning trial, but retain the distribution of the different labels in the pool data (active learning with random errors); (Table 1, ALrand, 30%).",
        "In the third setting we simulate biased decisions by a human annotator.",
        "For a certain fraction (0 to 30%) of instances of a particular non-majority class, we substitute the majority class label for the gold label, thereby producing a more skewed distribution than in the original pool (active learning with biased errors); (Table 1, ALbias, 30%).",
        "For all three settings (rand, ALrand, ALbias) and each degree of noise (0-30%), we run active learning simulations on the already annotated data, simulating the annotation process by selecting one new, pre-labelled instance per trial from the pool and, instead of handing them over to a human coder, assigning the known (possibly erroneous) label to the instance and adding it to the training set.",
        "We use the same split (test, pool) for all three settings and all degrees of noise, with identical test sets for all trials.",
        "Figure 1 shows active learning curves for the different settings and varying degrees of noise.",
        "The horizontal black line slightly below 0.5 accuracy shows the majority baseline (the performance obtained when always assigning the majority class).",
        "For all degrees of randomly inserted noise, active learning (ALrand) outperforms random sampling (rand) at an early stage in the learning process.",
        "Looking at biased errors (ALbias), we see a different picture.",
        "With a low degree of noise, the curves for ALrand and ALbias are very similar.",
        "When inserting more noise, performance for ALbias decreases, and with around 20% of biased errors in the pool AL performs worse than our random sampling baseline.",
        "In the random noise setting (ALrand), even after inserting 30% of errors AL clearly outperforms random sampling.",
        "Increasing the size of the seed data reduces the effect slightly, but does not prevent it (not shown here due to space limitations).",
        "This confirms the findings that under certain circumstances AL performs worse than random sampling (Dang, 2004; Schein and Ungar, 2007; Rehbein et al., 2010).",
        "We could also confirm Schein and Ungar (2007)'s observation that margin sampling is less sensitive to certain types of noise than entropy sampling (Table 2).",

        "Even for the noisier data sets with up to 26% of errors, ALbias with filtering performs at least as well as random sampling.",
        "Next we want to find out what kind of errors the system could detect.",
        "We want to know whether the approach is able to detect the errors previously inserted into the data, and whether it manages to identify hard cases representing true ambiguities.",
        "To answer these questions we look at one fold of the ALbias data with 10% of noise.",
        "In 1,200 AL iterations the system rejected 116 instances (Table 3).",
        "The major part of the rejections was due to the majority vote of the ensemble classifiers (first heuristic, H1) which rejects all instances where the ensemble classifiers agree with each other but disagree with the human judgement.",
        "Out of the 105 instances rejected by H1, 41 were labelled incorrectly.",
        "This means that we were able to detect around half of the incorrect labels inserted in the pool.",
        "11 instances were filtered out by the margin threshold (H2).",
        "None of these contained an incorerrors inserted in pool 173 err.",
        "instances selected by AL 93 instances rejected by H1+H2 116 instances rejected by H1 105 true errors rejected by H1 41 instances rejected by H2 11 true errors rejected by H2 0 rect label.",
        "On first glance H2 seems to be more lenient than H1, considering the number of rejected sentences.",
        "This, however, could also be an effect of the order in which we apply the filters.",
        "The different word senses are evenly distributed over the rejected instances (H1: Commitment 30, drohenl-salsa 38, Run_risk 36; H2: Commitment 3, drohenl-salsa 4, Run_risk 4).",
        "This shows that there is less uncertainty about the majority word sense, Run_risk.",
        "It is hard to decide whether the correctly labelled instances rejected by the filtering method would have helped or hurt the learning process.",
        "Simply adding them to the seed data after the conclusion of AL would not answer this question, as it would merely tell us whether they improve classification accuracy further, but we still would not know what impact these instances would have had on the selection of instances during the AL process."
