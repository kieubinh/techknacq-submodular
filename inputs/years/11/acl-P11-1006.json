        "Because the",
        "Number of Rules Maximum Number of Applicable Rules",
        "time complexity of Aho-Corasick algorithm is determined by the lengths of query strings and the number of matches, we examined how the number of matches on query strings with different lengths changes when the number of rules increases.",
        "The experimental results are shown in Fig. 7.",
        "We can see that the number of matches is not largely affected by the number of rules in the rule index.",
        "It implies that the time for searching applicable rules is close to a constant and does not change much with different numbers of rules.",
        "Next, since the running time of our method is proportional to the number of visited nodes on the vocabulary trie, we evaluated the efficiency of our method in terms of number of visited nodes.",
        "The result reported here is that when k is 10.",
        "Specifically, we tested how the number of visited nodes changes according to three factors: maximum number of applicable rules in a transformation, vocabulary size and rule set size.",
        "The experimental results are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 respectively.",
        "From Fig. 8, with increasing maximum number of applicable rules in a transformation, number of visited nodes increases first and then stabilizes, especially when the words are long.",
        "Note that pruning becomes even more effective because number of visited nodes without pruning grows much faster.",
        "It demonstrates that our method is very efficient when compared to the non-pruning method.",

        "It indicates that our pruning strategy is very effective.",
        "From all the figures, we can see that our method is always efficient especially when the words are relatively short.",
