        "Commercial search engines use query associations in a variety of ways, including the recommendation of related queries in Bing, 'something different' in Google, and 'also try' and related concepts in Yahoo.",
        "Mining techniques to extract such query associations generally fall into four categories: (a) clustering queries by their co-clicked url patterns (Wen et al., 2001; Baeza-Yates et al., 2004); (b) leveraging co-occurrences of sequential queries in web search query sessions (Zhang and Nasraoui, 2006; Boldi et al., 2009); (c) pattern-based extraction over lexico-syntactic structures of individual queries (Pa§ca and Durme, 2008; Jain and Pantel, 2009); and (d) distributional similarity techniques over news or web corpora (Agirre et al., 2009; Pantel et al., 2009).",
        "These techniques operate at the surface level, associating one surface context (e.g., queries) to another.",
        "In this paper, we focus instead on associating surface contexts with entities that refer to a particular entry in a knowledge base such as Freebase, IMDB, Amazon's product catalog, or The Library of Congress.",
        "Whereas the former models might associate the string \"Ronaldinho\" with the strings \"AC Milan\" or \"Lionel Messi\", our goal is to associate \"Ronaldinho\" with, for example, the Wikipedia entity page \"wiki/ACMilan\" or the Freebase entity \"en/lioneLmess\".",
        "Or for the query string \"ice fishing\", we aim to recommend products in a commercial catalog, such as jigs or lures.",
        "The benefits and potential applications are large.",
        "By knowing the entity identifiers associated with a query (instead of strings), one can greatly improve both the presentation of search results as well as the click-through experience.",
        "For example, consider when the associated entity is a product.",
        "Not only can we present the product name to the web user, but we can also display the image, price, and reviews associated with the entity identifier.",
        "Once the entity is clicked, instead of issuing a simple web search query, we can now directly show a product page for the exact product; or we can even perform actions directly on the entity, such as buying the entity on Amazon.com, retrieving the product's operating manual, or even polling your social network for friends that own the product.",
        "This is a big step towards a richer semantic search experience.",
        "In this paper, we define the association between a query string q and an entity id e as the probability that e is relevant given the query q, P(e|q).",
        "Following Baeza-Yates et al.",
        "(2004), we model relevance as the likelihood that a user would click on e given q, events which can be observed in large query-click graphs.",
        "Due to the extreme sparsity of query click graphs (Baeza-Yates, 2004), we propose several smoothing models that extend the click graph with query synonyms and then use the synonym click probabilities as a background model.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our smoothing models, via a large-scale empirical study over real-world data, which significantly reduce model errors.",
        "We further apply our models to the task of query-product recommendation.",
        "Queries in session logs are annotated using our association probabilities and recommendations are obtained by modeling sessionlevel query-product co-occurrences in the annotated sessions.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate that our models affect 9% of general web queries with 94% recommendation precision."

        "We introduce a novel application of significant commercial value: entity recommendations for general Web queries.",
        "This is different from the vast body of work on query suggestions (Baeza-Yates et al., 2004; Fuxman et al., 2008; Mei et al., 2008b; Zhang and Nasraoui, 2006; Craswell and Szummer, 2007; Jagabathula et al., 2011), because our suggestions are actual entities (as opposed to queries or documents).",
        "There is also a rich literature on recommendation systems (Sarwar et al., 2001), including successful commercial systems such as the Amazon product recommendation system (Linden et al., 2003) and the Netflix movie recommendation system (Bell et al., 2007).",
        "However, these are entity-to-entity recommendations systems.",
        "For example, Netflix recommends movies based on previously seen movies (i.e., entities).",
        "Furthermore, these systems have access to previous transactions (i.e., actual movie rentals or product purchases), whereas our recommendation system leverages a different resource, namely query sessions.",
        "In principle, one could consider vertical search engines (Nie et al., 2007) as a mechanism for associating queries to entities.",
        "For example, if we type the query \"canon eos digital camera\" on a commerce search engine such as Bing Shopping or Google Products, we get a listing of digital camera entities that satisfy our query.",
        "However, vertical search engines are essentially rankers that given a query, return a sorted list of (pointers to) entities that are related to the query.",
        "That is, they do not expose actual association scores, which is a key contribution of our work, nor do they operate on general search queries.",
        "Our smoothing methods for estimating association probabilities are related to techniques developed by the NLP and speech communities to smooth n-gram probabilities in language modeling.",
        "The simplest are discounting methods, such as additive smoothing (Lidstone, 1920) and Good-Turing (Good, 1953).",
        "Other methods leverage lower-order background models for low-frequency events, such as Katz' backoff smoothing (Katz, 1987), Witten-Bell discounting (Witten and Bell, 1991), Jelinek-Mercer interpolation (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980), and Kneser-Ney (Kneser and Ney, 1995).",
        "In the information retrieval community, Ponte and Croft (1998) are credited for accelerating the use of language models.",
        "Initial proposals were based on learning global smoothing models, where the smoothing of a word would be independent of the document that the word belongs to (Zhai and Laf-ferty, 2001).",
        "More recently, a number of local smoothing models have been proposed (Liu and 2006).",
        "Unlike global models, local models leverage relationships between documents in a corpus.",
        "In particular, they rely on a graph structure that represents document similarity.",
        "Intuitively, the smoothing of a word in a document is influenced by the smoothing of the word in similar documents.",
        "For a complete survey of these methods and a general optimization framework that encompasses all previous proposals, please see the work of Mei, Zhang et al.",
        "(2008a).",
        "All the work on local smoothing models has been applied to the prediction of priors for words in documents.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish that query-click graphs can be used to create accurate models of query-entity associations.",
        "3 Association Model Task Definition: Consider a collection of entities E. Given a search query q, our task is to compute P(e|q), the probability that an entity e is relevant to q, for all e G E.",
        "We limit our model to sets of entities that can be accessed through urls on the web, such as Amazon.com products, IMDB movies, Wikipedia entities, and Yelp points of interest.",
        "Following Baeza-Yates et al.",
        "(2004), we model relevance as the click probability of an entity given a query, which we can observe from click logs of vertical search engines, i.e., domain-specific search engines such as the product search engine at Amazon, the local search engine at Yelp, or the travel search engine at Bing Travel.",
        "Clicked results in a vertical search engine are edges between queries and entities e in the vertical's knowledge base.",
        "General search query click logs, which capture direct user intent signals, have shown significant improvements when used for web search ranking (Agichtein et al., 2006).",
        "Unlike for general search engines, vertical search engines have typically much less traffic resulting in extremely sparse click logs.",
        "In this section, we define a graph structure for recording click information and we propose several models for estimating P(e|q) using the graph.",
        "We define a query entity click graph, QEC(Q U U U E, Cu U Ce), as a tripartite graph consisting of a set of query nodes Q, url nodes U, entity nodes E, and weighted edges Cu exclusively between nodes of Q and nodes of U, as well as weighted edges Ce exclusively between nodes of Q and nodes of E. Each edge in Cu and Ce represents the number of clicks observed between query-url pairs and query-entity pairs, respectively.",
        "Let wu(q, u) be the click weight of the edges in Cu, and we(q, e) be the click weight of the edges in Ce.",
        "If Ce is very large, then we can model the association probability, P(e|q), as the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of observing clicks on e given the query q:",
        "Figure 1 illustrates an example query entity graph linking general web queries to entities in a large commercial product catalog.",
        "Figure 1a illustrates eight queries in Q with their observed clicks (solid lines) with products in E. Some probability estimates, assigned by Equation 3.1, include: Pmfe(panfishjigs,ei) = 0, pmle(ice jigs, ei) = 1, and /VMk«^^ e) _ ce(ice auger,es)+ce(ice augers).",
        "Even for the largest search engines, query click logs are extremely sparse, and smoothing techniques are necessary (Craswell and Szummer, 2007; Gao et al., 2009).",
        "By considering only Ce, those clicked urls that map to our entity collection E, the sparsity situation is even more dire.",
        "The sparsity ofthe graph comes in two forms: a) there are many queries for which an entity is relevant that will never be seen in the click logs (e.g., \"panfish jig\" in Figure 1a); and b) the query-click distribution is Zipfian and most observed edges will have very low click counts yielding unreliable statistics.",
        "In the following subsections, we present a method to expand QEC with unseen queries that are associated with entities in E. Then we propose smoothing methods for leveraging a background model over the expanded click graph.",
        "Throughout our models, we make the simplifying assumption that the knowledge base E is complete.",
        "Following Gao et al.",
        "(2009), we address the sparsity of edges in Ce by inferring new edges through traversing the query-url click subgraph, UC(Q U U, Cu), which contains many more edges than Ce.",
        "If two queries and qj are synonyms or near synonyms, then we expect their click patterns to be similar.",

        "Figure 1b illustrates similarity edges created between query \"ice auger\" and both \"power auger\" and \"d rock\".",

        "We developed several models for estimating the probability that an entity is relevant given a user query.",
