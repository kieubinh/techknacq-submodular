        "Automatic mark-up of textual documents with linguistic annotations such as part-of-speech tags, sentence constituents, named entities, or semantic roles is a common practice in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "It is, however, much less common in information retrieval (IR) applications.",
        "Accordingly, in this paper, we focus on annotating search queries submitted by the users to a search engine.",
        "There are several key differences between user queries and the documents used in NLP (e.g., news articles or web pages).",
        "As previous research shows, these differences severely limit the applicability of standard NLP techniques for annotating queries and require development ofnovel annotation approaches for query corpora (Bergsma and Wang, 2007; Barr et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2009; Bendersky et al., 2010; Li, 2010).",
        "The most salient difference between queries and documents is their length.",
        "Most search queries are very short, and even longer queries are usually shorter than the average written sentence.",
        "Due to their brevity, queries often cannot be divided into sub-parts, and do not provide enough context for accurate annotations to be made using the standard NLP tools such as taggers, parsers or chun-kers, which are trained on more syntactically coherent textual units.",
        "A recent analysis of web query logs by Bendersky and Croft (2009) shows, however, that despite their brevity, queries are grammatically diverse.",
        "Some queries are keyword concatenations, some are semi-complete verbal phrases and some are wh-questions.",
        "It is essential for the search engine to correctly annotate the query structure, and the quality of these query annotations has been shown to be a crucial first step towards the development of reliable and robust query processing, representation and understanding algorithms (Barr et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2009; Manshadi and Li, 2009; Li, 2010).",
        "However, in current query annotation systems, even sentence-like queries are often hard to parse and annotate, as they are prone to contain misspellings and idiosyncratic grammatical structures.",
        "Figure 1 : Examples of a mark-up scheme for annotating capitalization (L - lowercase, C - otherwise), POS tags (N -noun, V - verb, X - otherwise) and segmentation (B/I - beginning of/inside the chunk).",
        "They also tend to lack prepositions, proper punctuation, or capitalization, since users (often correctly) assume that these features are disregarded by the retrieval system.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel joint query annotation method to improve the effectiveness of existing query annotations, especially for longer, more complex search queries.",
        "Most existing research focuses on using a single type of annotation for information retrieval such as subject-verb-object dependencies (Balasubramanian and Allan, 2009), named-entity recognition (Guo et al., 2009), phrase chunking (Guo et al., 2008), or semantic labeling (Li, 2010).",
        "In contrast, the main focus of this work is on developing a unified approach for performing reliable annotations of different types.",
        "To this end, we propose a probabilistic method for performing a joint query annotation.",
        "This method allows us to exploit the dependency between different unsupervised annotations to further improve the accuracy of the entire set of annotations.",
        "For instance, our method can leverage the information about estimated parts-of-speech tags and capitalization of query terms to improve the accuracy of query segmentation.",
        "We empirically evaluate the joint query annotation method on a range of query types.",
        "Instead of just focusing our attention on keyword queries, as is often done in previous work (Barr et al., 2008; Bergsma and Wang, 2007; Tan and Peng, 2008; Guo et al., 2008), we also explore the performance of our annotations with more complex natural language search queries such as verbal phrases and wh-questions, which often pose a challenge for IR applications (Bendersky et al., 2010; Kumaran and Allan, 2007; Kumaran and Carvalho, 2009; Lease, 2007).",
        "We show that even with a very limited amount of training data, our joint annotation method significantly outperforms annotations that were done independently for these queries.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we demonstrate several examples of annotated search queries.",
        "Then, in Section 3, we introduce our joint query annotation method.",
        "In Section 4 we describe two types of independent query annotations that are used as input for the joint query annotation.",

        "Accordingly, a more in-depth investigation of the linguistic structure of the verbal phrase queries is an interesting direction for future work.",
        "Recall that in our experiments, out of the overall 250 annotated queries, there are 96 verbal phrases, 93 questions and 61 keyword queries.",
        "Figure 3 shows a plot that contrasts the relative performance for these three query types of our best-performing joint annotation method, j-PRF, on capitalization, POS tagging and segmentation annotation tasks.",
        "Next, we analyze the performance profiles for the annotation tasks shown in Figure 3.",
        "For the capitalization task, the performance of j-PRF on verbal phrases and questions is similar, with the difference below 3%.",
        "The performance for keyword queries is much higher â€“ with improvement over 20% compared to either of the other two types.",
        "We attribute this increase to both a larger number of positive examples in the short keyword queries (a higher percentage of terms in keyword queries is capitalized) and their simpler syntactic structure (adjacent terms in these queries are likely to have the same case).",
        "For the segmentation task, the performance is at its best for the question and keyword queries, and at its worst (with a drop of 11%) for the verbal phrases.",
        "We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that question queries and keyword queries tend to have repetitive structures, while the grammatical structure for verbose queries is much more diverse.",
        "For the tagging task, the performance profile is reversed, compared to the other two tasks â€“ the performance is at its worst for keyword queries, since their grammatical structure significantly differs from the grammatical structure of sentences in news articles, on which the POS tagger is trained.",
        "For question queries the performance is the best (6% increase over the keyword queries), since they resemble sentences encountered in traditional corpora.",
        "It is important to note that the results reported in Figure 3 are based on training the joint annotation model on all available queries with 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "We might get different profiles if a separate annotation model was trained for each query type.",
        "In our case, however, the number of queries from each type is not sufficient to train a reliable model.",
        "We leave the investigation of separate training of joint annotation models by query type to future work.",
        "In order to further evaluate the proposed joint annotation method, j-PRF, in this section we compare its performance to other query annotation methods previously reported in the literature.",
        "Unfortunately, there is not much published work on query capitalization and query POS tagging that goes beyond the simple query-based methods described in Section 4.1.",
        "The published work on the more advanced methods usually requires access to large amounts of proprietary user data such as query logs and clicks (Barr et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2009).",
        "Therefore, in this section we focus on recent work on query segmentation (Bergsma and Wang, 2007; Hagen et al., 2010).",
        "We compare the segmentation effectiveness of our best performing method, j-PRF, to that of these query segmentation methods.",
        "The first method, SEG-1, was first proposed by Hagen et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "It is currently the most effective publicly disclosed unsupervised query segmentation method.",
        "SEG-1 method requires an access to a large web n-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).",
        "The optimal segmentation for query Q, SQ, is then obtained using where Sq is the set of all possible query segmentations, S is a possible segmentation, s is a segment in S, and count(s) is the frequency of s in the web n-gram corpus.",
        "The second method, SEG-2, is based on a successful supervised segmentation method, which was first proposed by Bergsma and Wang (2007).",
        "SEG-2 employs a large set of features, and is pre-trained on the query collection described by Bergsma and Wang (2007).",
        "The features used by the SEG-2 method are described by Bendersky et al.",
        "(2009), and include, among others, n-gram frequencies in a sample of a query log, web corpus and Wikipedia titles.",
        "j-PRF, SEG-1 and SEG-2 methods.",
        "When compared to the SEG-1 baseline, j-PRF is significantly more effective, even though it only employs bigram counts (see Eq.",
        "4), instead of the high-order n-grams used by SEG-1, for computing the score of a segmentation.",
        "This results underscores the benefit of joint annotation, which leverages capitalization and POS tagging to improve the quality of the segmentation.",
        "When compared to the SEG-2 baseline, j-PRF and SEG-2 are statistically indistinguishable.",
        "SEG-2 posits a slightly better F1, while j-PRF has a better MQA.",
        "This result demonstrates that the segmentation produced by the j-PRF method is as effective as the segmentation produced by the current supervised state-of-the-art segmentation methods, which employ external data sources and high-order n-grams.",
        "The benefit of the j-PRF method compared to the SEG-2 method, is that, simultaneously with the segmentation, it produces several additional query annotations (in this case, capitalization and POS tagging), eliminating the need to construct separate sequence classifiers for each annotation."
