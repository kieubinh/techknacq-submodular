        "Learning to rank, which aims at ranking documents in terms of their relevance to user's query, has been widely studied in machine learning and information retrieval communities (Herbrich et al., 2000; Freund et al., 2004; Burges et al., 2005; Yue et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2007; Liu, 2009).",
        "In general, large amount of training data need to be annotated by domain experts for achieving better ranking performance.",
        "In real applications, however, it is time consuming and expensive to annotate training data for each search domain.",
        "To alleviate the lack of training data in the target domain, many researchers have proposed to transfer ranking knowledge from the source domain with plenty of labeled data to the target domain where only a few or no labeled data is available, which is known as ranking model adaptation (Chen et al., 2008a; Chen et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2008b; Geng et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2009).",
        "Intuitively, the more similar an source instance is to the target instances, it is expected to be more useful for cross-domain knowledge transfer.",
        "This motivated the popular domain adaptation solution based on instance weighting, which assigns larger weights to those transferable instances so that the model trained on the source domain can adapt more effectively to the target domain (Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "Existing instance weighting schemes mainly focus on the adaptation problem for classification (Zadrozny, 2004; Huang et al., 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Sugiyama et al., 2008).",
        "Although instance weighting scheme may be applied to documents for ranking model adaptation, the difference between classification and learning to rank should be highlighted to take careful consideration.",
        "Compared to classification, the learning object for ranking is essentially a query, which contains a list of document instances each with a relevance judgement.",
        "Recently, researchers proposed listwise ranking algorithms (Yue et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2007) to take the whole query as a learning object.",

        "To avoid losing this information, query weighting takes the query as a whole and directly measures its importance.",
        "wise approach significantly outperformed pointwise approach, which takes each document instance as independent learning object, as well as pairwise approach, which concentrates learning on the order of a pair of documents (Liu, 2009).",
        "Inspired by the principle of listwise approach, we hypothesize that the importance weighting for ranking model adaptation could be done better at query level rather than document level.",
        "Figure 1 demonstrates the difference between instance weighting and query weighting, where there are two queries qs1 and qs2 in the source domain and qt1 and qt2 in the target domain, respectively, and each query has three retrieved documents.",
        "In Figure 1(a), source and target domains are represented as a bag of document instances.",
        "It is worth noting that the information about which document instances belong to the same query is lost.",
        "To avoid this information loss, query weighting scheme shown as Figure 1(b) directly measures importance weight at query level.",
        "Instance weighting makes the importance estimation of document instances inaccurate when documents of the same source query are similar to the documents from different target queries.",
        "Take Figure 2 as a toy example, where the document instance is represented as a feature vector with four features.",
        "No matter what weighting schemes are used, it makes sense to assign high weights to source queries qsi and qs2 because they are similar to target queries qt1 and qt2, respectively.",
        "Meanwhile, the source query qs3 should be weighted lower because it's not quite similar to any of qt1 and qt2 at query level, meaning that the ranking knowledge from qs3is different from that of qt1 and qt2 and thus less useful for the transfer to the target domain.",
        "Unfortunately, the three source queries qs1, qs2 and qs3would be weighted equally by document instance weighting scheme.",
        "The reason is that all of their documents are similar to the two document instances in target domain despite the fact that the documents of qs3 correspond to their counterparts from different target queries.",
        "Therefore, we should consider the source query as a whole and directly measure the query importance.",
        "However, it's not trivial to directly estimate a query's weight because a query is essentially provided as a matrix where each row represents a vector of document features.",
        "In this work, we present two simple but very effective approaches attempting to resolve the problem from distinct perspectives: (1) we compress each query into a query feature vector by aggregating all of its document instances, and then conduct query weighting on these query feature vectors; (2) we measure the similarity between the source query and each target query one by one, and then combine these fine-grained similarity values to calculate its importance to the target domain."

        "Then model w(x) can be used to estimate the importance of source instances.",
        "Model parameters were computed with a linear model by minimizing the KL-divergence from pt(x) to its estimator pt(x).",
        "Since pt(x) = W(x)ps(x), the ultimate objective only contains model W(x).",
        "For using instance weighting in pairwise ranking algorithms, the weights of document instances should be transformed into those of document pairs (Gao et al., 2010).",
        "Given a pair of documents (xi,xj) and their weights Wi and Wj, the pairwise weight wij could be estimated probabilistically as wi * Wj.",
        "To consider query factor, query weight was further estimated as the average value of the weights over all the pairs, i.e., wq = jjYli j wij, where M is the number of pairs in query q. Additionally, to take the advantage of both query and document information, a probabilistic weighting for (xi} xj) was modeled by wq * wij.",

        "The Kendall's t = Jf+QQ is used to measure the correlation (Kendall, 1970), where P is the number of concordant query pairs and Q is the number of discordant pairs.",
        "It's noted that t's range is from 1 to 1, and the larger value means the two ranking is better correlated.",
        "The Kendall's t by different weighting methods are given in Table 4 and 5.",
        "We find that Rweight produced by query-aggr and query-comp are all positively correlated with Rmappand clearly the orders generated by query-comp are more positive than those by query-aggr.",
        "This is another explanation why query-comp outperforms query-aggr.",
        "Furthermore, both are far better than query-rand because the Rweight by query-rand is actually independent of Rmapp.",
        "In the situation where there are large scale data in source and target domains, how to efficiently weight a source query is another interesting problem.",
        "Without the loss of generality, we reported the weighting time of doc-pair, query-aggr and query-comp from adaptation from TD to HP using DS measure.",
        "As doc-avg and doc-comb are derived from doc-pair, their efficiency is equivalent to doc-pair.",
        "As shown in table 6, query-aggr can efficiently weight query using query feature vector.",
        "The reason is two-fold: one is the operation of query document aggregation can be done very fast, and the other is there are 1000 documents in each query of TD or HP, which means that the compression ratio is 1000:1.",
        "Thus, the domain separator can be found quickly.",
        "In addition, query-comp is more efficient than doc-pair because doc-pair needs too much time to find the separator using all instances from source and target domain.",
        "And query-comp uses a divide-and-conquer method to measure the similarity of source query to each target query, and then efficiently combine these fine-grained similarity values.",
