        "Automatic document level sentiment classification (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002) is the task of classifying a given review with respect to the sentiment expressed by the author of the review.",
        "For example, a sentiment classifier might classify a user review about a movie as positive or negative depending on the sentiment expressed in the review.",
        "Sentiment classification has been applied in numerous tasks such as opinion mining (Pang and Lee, 2008), opinion summarization (Lu et al., 2009), contextual advertising (Fan and Chang, 2010), and market analysis (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "Supervised learning algorithms that require labeled data have been successfully used to build sentiment classifiers for a specific domain (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "However, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and it is costly to annotate data for each new domain in which we would like to apply a sentiment classifier.",
        "For example, in the domain of reviews about electronics products, the words \"durable\" and \"light\" are used to express positive sentiment, whereas \"expensive\" and \"short battery life\" often indicate negative sentiment.",
        "On the other hand, if we consider the books domain the words \"exciting\" and \"thriller\" express positive sentiment, whereas the words \"boring\" and \"lengthy\" usually express negative sentiment.",
        "A classifier trained on one domain might not perform well on a different domain because it would fail to learn the sentiment of the unseen words.",
        "Work in cross-domain sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007) focuses on the challenge of training a classifier from one or more domains (source domains) and applying the trained classifier in a different domain (target domain).",
        "A cross-domain sentiment classification system must overcome two main challenges.",
        "First, it must identify which source domain features are related to which target domain features.",
        "Second, it requires a learning framework to incorporate the information regarding the relatedness of source and target domain features.",
        "Following previous work, we define cross-domain sentiment classification as the problem of learning a binary classifier (i.e. positive or negative sentiment) given a small set of labeled data for the source domain, and unlabeled data for both source and target domains.",
        "In particular, no labeled data is provided for the target domain.",
        "In this paper, we describe a cross-domain sentiment classification method using an automatically created sentiment sensitive thesaurus.",
        "We use labeled data from multiple source domains and unla-beled data from source and target domains to represent the distribution of features.",
        "We represent a lexical element (i.e. a unigram or a bigram of word lemma) in a review using a feature vector.",
        "Next, for each lexical element we measure its relatedness to other lexical elements and group related lexical elements to create a thesaurus.",
        "The thesaurus captures the relatedness among lexical elements that appear in source and target domains based on the contexts in which the lexical elements appear (their distributional context).",
        "A distinctive aspect of our approach is that, in addition to the usual co-occurrence features typically used in characterizing a word's distributional context, we make use, where possible, of the sentiment label of a document: i.e. sentiment labels form part of our context features.",
        "This is what makes the distributional thesaurus sensitive to sentiment.",
        "Unlabeled data is cheaper to collect compared to labeled data and is often available in large quantities.",
        "The use of unlabeled data enables us to accurately estimate the distribution of words in source and target domains.",
        "Our method can learn from a large amount of unlabeled data to leverage a robust cross-domain sentiment classifier.",
        "We model the cross-domain sentiment classification problem as one of feature expansion, where we append additional related features to feature vectors that represent source and target domain reviews in order to reduce the mismatch of features between the two domains.",
        "Methods that use related features have been successfully used in numerous tasks such as query expansion (Fang, 2008), and document classification (Shen et al., 2009).",
        "However, feature expansion techniques have not previously been applied to the task of cross-domain sentiment classification.",
        "In our method, we use the automatically created thesaurus to expand feature vectors in a binary classifier at train and test times by introducing related lexical elements from the thesaurus.",
        "We use L1 regularized logistic regression as the classification algorithm.",
        "(However, the method is agnostic to the properties of the classifier and can be used to expand feature vectors for any binary classifier).",
        "L1 regularization enables us to select a small subset of features for the classifier.",
        "Unlike previous work which attempts to learn a cross-domain classifier using a single source domain, we leverage data from multiple source domains to learn a robust classifier that generalizes across multiple domains.",

If there are no features that co-occur with both u and v, then the relatedness reaches its minimum value of 0.",

This is an important fact that differentiates our sentiment-sensitive thesaurus from other distributional thesauri which do not consider sentiment information.",
        "Moreover, we only need to retain lexical elements in the sentiment sensitive thesaurus because when predicting the sentiment label for target reviews (at test time) we cannot generate sentiment elements from those (unlabeled) reviews, therefore we are not required to find expansion candidates for sentiment elements.",

        "First, following the bag-of-words model, we model a review d using the set {w1,..., wN}, where the elements wj are either unigrams or bigrams that appear in the review d. We then represent a review d by a real-valued term-frequency vector d G RN, where the value of the j-th element dj is set to the total number of occurrences of the unigram or bigram wj in the review d. To find the suitable candidates to expand a vector d for the review d, we define a ranking score score(uj, d) for each base entry in the thesaurus as follows:",
        "According to this definition, given a review d, a base entry uj will have a high ranking score if there are many words wj in the review d that are also listed as neighbors for the base entry uj in the sentiment-sensitive thesaurus.",
        "Moreover, we weight the relatedness scores for each word wj by its normalized term-frequency to emphasize the salient uni-grams and bigrams in a review.",
        "Recall that relatedness is defined as an asymmetric measure in Equation 2, and we use t(wj, uj) in the computation of score(ui, d) in Equation 3.",
        "This is particularly important because we would like to score base entries u considering all the unigrams and bigrams that appear in a review d, instead of considering each unigram or bigram individually.",
        "To expand a vector, d, for a review d, we first rank the base entries, uj using the ranking score in Equation 3 and select the top k ranked base entries.",
        "Let us denote the r-th ranked (1 < r < k) base entry for a review d by vrd.",
        "We then extend the original set of unigrams and bigrams {w1,..., wN} by the base entries ,..., vk to create a new vector dd G R(N+k) with dimensions corresponding to w1,..., wN, vd,..., for a review d. The values of the extended vector dd are set as follows.",
        "The values of the first N dimensions that correspond to unigrams and bigrams wj that occur in the review d are set to dj, their frequency in d. The subsequent k dimensions that correspond to the top ranked based entries for the review d are weighted according to their ranking score.",
        "Specifically, we set the value of the r-th ranked base entry vd to 1/r.",
        "Alternatively, one could use the ranking score, score(vd, d), itself as the value of the appended base entries.",
        "However, both relatedness scores as well as normalized term-frequencies can be small in practice, which leads to very small absolute ranking scores.",
        "By using the inverse rank, we only take into account the relative ranking of base entries and ignore their absolute scores.",
        "Note that the score of a base entry depends on a review d. Therefore, we select different base entries as additional features for expanding different reviews.",
        "Furthermore, we do not expand each wj individually when expanding a vector d for a review.",
        "Instead, we consider all unigrams and bi-grams in d when selecting the base entries for expansion.",
        "One can think of the feature expansion process as a lower dimensional latent mapping of features onto the space spanned by the base entries in the sentiment-sensitive thesaurus.",
        "The asymmetric property of the relatedness (Equation 2) implicitly prefers common words that co-occur with numerous other words as expansion candidates.",
        "Such words act as domain independent pivots and enable us to transfer the information regarding sentiment from one domain to another.",
        "Using the extended vectors dd to represent reviews, we train a binary classifier from the source domain labeled reviews to predict positive and negative sentiment in reviews.",
        "We differentiate the appended base entries vd from wj that existed in the original vector d (prior to expansion) by assigning different feature identifiers to the appended base entries.",
        "For example, a unigram excellent in a feature vector is differentiated from the base entry excellent by assigning the feature id, \"BASE=excellent\" to the latter.",
        "This enables us to learn different weights for base entries depending on whether they are useful for expanding a feature vector.",
        "We use L1 regularized logistic regression as the classification algorithm (Ng, 2004), which produces a sparse model in which most irrelevant features are assigned a zero weight.",
        "This enables us to select useful features for classification in a systematic way without having to preselect features using heuristic approaches.",

        "The books domain has the lowest number of unlabeled reviews (around 5000) in the dataset.",

        "The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's honestly significant differences (HSD) tests on the classification accuracies for the four domains show that our method is statistically significantly better than both the No Thesaurus and NSS baselines, at confidence level 0.05.",
        "We therefore conclude that using the sentiment sensitive thesaurus for feature expansion is useful for cross-domain sentiment classification.",
        "The results returned by our method are comparable to state-of-the-art techniques such as SCL-MI and SFA.",
        "In particular, the differences between those techniques and our method are not statistically significant."

        "Compared to single-domain sentiment classification, which has been studied extensively in previous work (Pang and Lee, 2008; Turney, 2002), cross-domain sentiment classification has only recently received attention in response to advances in the area of domain adaptation.",
