        "The aim of our project is to predict the real world characteristics of players of massively-multiplayer online games, such as Second Life (SL).",
        "We sought to predict actual player attributes like age or education levels, and personality traits including leadership or conformity.",
        "Our task was to do so using only the behaviors, communication, and interaction among the players produced during game play.",
        "To do so, we logged all players' avatar movements, \"touch events\" (putting on or taking off clothing items, for example), and their public chat messages (i.e., messages that can be seen by all players in the group).",
        "Given the complex nature of interpreting chat in an online game environment, we required a tool that would allow annotators to have a synchronized view of both the event action as well as the chat utterances.",
        "This would allow our annotators to correlate the events and the chat by marking them simultaneously.",
        "More importantly, being able to view game events enables more accurate chat annotation; and conversely, viewing chat utterances helps to interpret the significance of certain events in the game, e.g., one avatar following another.",
        "For example, an exclamation of: \"I can't do it!\"",
        "could be simply a response (rejection) to a request from another player; however, when the game action is viewed and the speaker is seen attempting to enter a building without success, another interpretation may arise (an assertion, a call for help, etc.",
        ").",
        "The Real World (RW) characteristics of SL players (and other on-line games) may be inferred to varying degrees from the appearance of their avatars, the behaviors they engage in, as well as from their on-line chat communications.",
        "For example, the avatar gender generally matches the gender of the owner; on the other hand, vocabulary choices in chat are rather poor predictors of a player's age, even though such correlation is generally seen in real life conversation.",
        "Second Life was the chosen platform because of the ease of creating objects, controlling the play environment, and collecting players' movement, chat, and other behaviors.",
        "We generated a corpus of chat and movement data from 48 quests comprised of 206 participants who generated over 30,000",
        "protect players' identities.",
        "Linden Lab, San Francisco, CA.",
        "http://secondlife.com",
        "messages and approximately 140 hours of recorded action.",
        "We required an annotation tool to help us efficiently annotate dialogue acts and communication links in chat utterances as well as avatar movements from such a large corpus.",
        "Moreover, we required correlation between these two dimensions of chat and movement since movement and other actions may be both causes and effects of verbal communication.",
        "We developed a multimodal event and chat annotation tool (called RAT, the Relational Annotation Tool), which will simultaneously display a 2D rendering of all movement activity recorded during our Second Life studies, synchronized with the chat utterances.",
        "In this way both chat and movements can be annotated simultaneously: the avatar movement actions can be reviewed while making dialogue act annotations.",
        "This has the added advantage of allowing the annotator to see the relationships between chat, behavior, and location/movement.",
        "This paper will describe our annotation process and the RAT tool."

        "Annotation tools have been built for a variety of purposes.",
        "The CSLU Toolkit (Sutton et al., 1998) is a suite of tools used for annotating spoken language.",
        "Similarly, the EMU System (Cassidy and Harrington, 2001) is a speech database management system that supports multilevel annotations.",
        "Systems have been created that allow users to readily build their own tools such as AGTK (Bird et al., 2001).",
        "The multi-modal tool DAT (Core and Allen, 1997) was developed to assist testing of the DAMSL annotation scheme.",
        "With DAT, annotators were able to listen to the actual dialogues as well as view the transcripts.",
        "While these tools are all highly effective for their respective tasks, ours is unique in its synchronized view of both event action and chat utterances.",
        "Although researchers studying online communication use either off-the shelf qualitative data analysis programs like Atlas.ti or NVivo, a few studies have annotated chat using custom-built tools.",
        "One approach uses computer-mediated discourse analysis approaches and the Dynamic Topic Analysis tool (Herring, 2003; Herring & Nix; 1997; Stromer-Galley & Martison, 2009), which allows annotators to track a specific phenomenon of online interaction in chat: topic shifts during an interaction.",
        "The Virtual Math Teams project (Stahl, 2009) created a ated a tool that allowed for the simultaneous playback of messages posted to a quasi-synchronous discussion forum with whiteboard drawings that student math team members used to illustrate their ideas or visualize the math problem they were trying to solve (Ã‡akir, 2009).",
        "A different approach to data capture of complex human interaction is found in the AMI Meeting Corpus (Carletta, 2007).",
        "It captures participants' head movement information from individual head-mounted cameras, which allows for annotation of nodding (consent, agreement) or shaking (disagreement), as well as participants' locations within the room; however, no complex events involving series of movements or participant proximity are considered.",
        "We are unaware of any other tools that facilitate the simultaneous playback of multi-modes of communication and behavior."

      "text": [
        "To generate player data, we rented an island in Second Life and developed an approximately two hour quest, the Case of the Missing Moonstone.",
        "In this quest, small groups of 4 to 5 players, who were previously unacquainted, work their way together through the clues and puzzles to solve a murder mystery.",
        "We recruited Second Life players in-game through advertising and setting up a shop that interested players could browse.",
        "We also used Facebook ads, which were remarkably effective.",
        "The process of the quest experience for players started after they arrived in a starting area of the island (the quest was open only to players who were made temporary members of our island) where they met other players, browsed quest-appropriate clothing to adorn their avatars, and received information from one of the researchers.",
        "Once all players arrived, the main quest began, progressing through five geographic areas in the island.",
        "Players were accompanied by a \"training sergeant\", a researcher using a robot avatar, that followed players through the quest and provided hints when groups became stymied along their investigation but otherwise had little interaction with the group.",
        "The quest was designed for players to encounter obstacles that required coordinated action, such as all players standing on special buttons to activate a door, or the sharing of information between players, such as solutions to a word puzzle, in order to advance to the next area of the quest (Figure 1).",
        "Slimy Roastbeef: \"who's got the square gear?\"",
        "Kenny Superstar: \"I do, but I'm stuck\" Slimy Roastbeef: \"canyou hand it to me?\"",
        "Kenny Superstar: \"i don't know how\"",
        "Slimy Roastbeef: \"open your inventory, click and drag it onto me\"",
        "Quest activities requiring coordination among the players were common and also necessary to ensure a sufficient degree of movement and message traffic to provide enough material to test our predictions, and to allow us to observe particular social characteristics of players.",
        "Players answered a survey before and then again after the quest, providing demographic and trait information and evaluating other members of their group on the characteristics of interest.",
        "We recorded all players' avatar movements as they purposefully moved avatars through the virtual spaces of the game environment, their public chat, and their \"touch events\", which are the actions that bring objects out of player inventories, pick up objects to put in their inventories, or to put objects, such as hats or clothes, onto the avatars, and the like.",
        "We followed Yee and Bailenson's (2008) technical approach for logging player behavior.",
        "To get a sense of the volume of data generated, 206 players generated over 30,000 messages into the group's public chat from the 48 sessions.",
        "We compiled approximately 140 hours of recorded action.",
        "The avatar logger was implemented to record each avatar's location through their (x,y,z) coordinates, recorded at two second intervals.",
        "This information was later used to render the avatar's position on our 2D representation of the action (section 4.1).",
        "The Relational Annotation Tool (RAT) was built to assist in annotating the massive collection of data collected during the Second Life experiments.",
        "A tool was needed that would allow annotators to see the textual transcripts of the chat while at the same time view a 2D representation of the action.",
        "Additionally, we had a textual transcript for a select set of events: touch an object, stand on an object, attach an object, etc., that we needed to make available to the annotator for review.",
        "These tool characteristics were needed for several reasons.",
        "First, in order to fully understand the communication and interaction occurring between players in the game environment and accurately annotate those messages, we needed annotators to have as much information about the context as possible.",
        "The 2D map coupled with the events information made it easier to understand.",
        "For example, in the quest, players in a specific zone, encounter a dead, maimed body.",
        "As annotators assigned codes to the chat, they would sometimes encounter exclamations, such as \"ew\" or \"gross\".",
        "Annotators would use the 2D map and the location of the exclaiming avatar to determine if the exclamation was a result of their location (in the zone with the dead body) or because of something said or done by another player.",
        "Location of avatars on the 2D map synchronized with chat was also helpful for annotators when attempting to disambiguate communicative links.",
        "For example, in one subzone, mad scribblings are written on a wall.",
        "If player A says \"You see that scribbling on the wall?\"",
        "the annotator needs to use the 2D map to see who the player is speaking to.",
        "If player A and player C are both standing in that subzone, then the annotator can make a reasonable assumption that player A is directing the question to player C, and not player B who is located in a different subzone.",
        "Second, we annotated coordinated avatar movement actions (such as following each other into a building or into a room), and the only way to readily identify such complex events was through the 2D map of avatar movements.",
        "The overall RAT interface, Figure 2, allows the annotator to simultaneously view all modes of representation.",
        "There are three distinct panels in this interface.",
        "The left hand panel is the 2D representation of the action (section 4.1).",
        "The upper right hand panel displays the chat and event transcripts (section 4.2), while the lower right hand portion is reserved for the three annotator sub-panels (section 4.3).",
        "The 2D representation was the most challenging of the panels to implement.",
        "We needed to find the proper level of abstraction for the action, while maintaining its usefulness for the annotator.",
        "Too complex a representation would cause cognitive overload for the annotator, thus potentially deteriorating the speed and quality of the annotations.",
        "Conversely, an overly abstract representation would not be of significant value in the annotation process.",
        "There were five distinct geographic areas on our Second Life Island: Starting Area, Mansion, Town Center, Factory and Apartments.",
        "An overview of the area in Second Life is displayed in Figure 3.",
        "We decided to represent each area separately as each group moves between the areas together, and it was therefore never necessary to display more than one area at a time.",
        "The 2D representation of the Mansion Area is displayed in Figure 4 below.",
        "Figure 5 is an exterior view of the actual Mansion in Second Life.",
        "Each area's fixed representation was rendered using Java Graphics, reading in the Second Life (x,y,z) coordinates from an XML data file.",
        "We represented the walls of the buildings as connected solid black lines with openings left for doorways.",
        "Key item locations were marked and labeled, e.g. Kitten, maid, the Idol, etc.",
        "Even though annotators visited the island to familiarize themselves with the layout, many mansion rooms were labeled to help the annotator recall the layout of the building, and minimize error of annotation based on flawed recall.",
        "Finally, the exact time of the action that is currently being represented is displayed in the lower left hand corner.",
        "Figure 4: 2D representation of Second Life action inside the Mansion/Manor were represented in our 2D panel as moving solid color circles, using the x and y coordinates.",
        "A color coded avatar key was displayed below the 2D representation.",
        "This key related the full name of every avatar to its colored circle representation.",
        "The z coordinate was used to determine if the avatar was on the second floor of a building.",
        "If the z value indicated an avatar was on a second floor, their icon was modified to include the number \"2\" for the duration of their time on the second floor.",
        "Also logged was the avatar's degree of rotation.",
        "Using this we were able to represent which direction the avatar was looking by a small black dot on their colored circle.",
        "As the annotators stepped through the chat and event annotation, the action would move forward, in synchronized step in the 2D map.",
        "In this way at any given time the annotator could see the avatar action corresponding to the chat and event transcripts appearing in the right panels.",
        "The annotator had the option to step forward or backward through the data at any step interval, where each step corresponded to a two second increment or decrement, to provide maximum flexibility to the annotator in viewing and reviewing the actions and communications to be annotated.",
        "Additionally, \"Play\" and \"Stop\" buttons were added to the tool so the annotator may simply watch the action play forward rather than manually stepping through.",
        "Avatar utterances along with logged Second Life events were displayed in the Chat and Event Panel (Figure 6).",
        "Utterances and events were each displayed in their own column.",
        "Time was recorded for every utterance and event, and this was displayed in the first column of the Chat and Event Panel.",
        "All avatar names in the utterances and events were color coded, where the colors corresponded to the avatar color used in the 2D panel.",
        "This panel was synchronized with the 2D Representation panel and as the annotator stepped through the game action on the 2D display, the associated utterances and events populated the Chat and Event panel.",
        "Avatar location was recorded in our log files as an (x,y,z) coordinate at a two second interval.",
        "Avatars",
        "The Annotator Panels (Figures 7 and 10) contains all features needed for the annotator to quickly annotate the events and dialogue.",
        "Annotators could choose from a number of categories to label each dialogue utterance.",
        "Coding categories included communicative links, dialogue acts, and selected multi-avatar actions.",
        "In the following we briefly outline each of these.",
        "A more detailed description of the chat annotation scheme is available in (Shaikh et al., 2010).",
        "One of the challenges in multi-party dialogue is to establish which user an utterance is directed towards.",
        "Users do not typically add addressing information in their utterances, which leads to ambiguity while creating a communication link between users.",
        "With this annotation level, we asked the annotators to determine whether each utterance was addressed to some user, in which case they were asked to mark which specific user it was addressed to; was in response to another prior utterance by a different user, which required marking the specific utterance responded to; or a continuation of the user's own prior utterance.",
        "Communicative link annotation allows for accurate mapping of dialogue dynamics in the multiparty setting, and is a critical component of tracking such social phenomena as disagreements and leadership.",
        "We developed a hierarchy of 19 dialogue acts for annotating the functional aspect of the utterance in the discussion.",
        "The tagset we adopted is loosely based on DAMSL (Allen & Core, 1997) and SWBD (Jurafsky et al., 1997), but greatly reduced and also tuned significantly towards dialogue pragmatics and away from more surface characteristics of utterances.",
        "In particular, we ask our annotators what is the pragmatic function of each utterance within the dialogue, a decision that often depends upon how earlier utterances were classified.",
        "Thus augmented, DA tags become an important source of evidence for detecting language uses and such social phenomena as conformity.",
        "Examples of dialogue act tags include Assertion-Opinion, Acknowledge, Information-Request, and Confirmation-Request.",
        "Using the augmented DA tagset also presents a fairly challenging task to our annotators, who need to be trained for many hours before an acceptable rate of inter-annotator agreement is achieved.",
        "For this reason, we consider our current DA tagging as a work in progress.",
        "Each of the five main areas had a corresponding set of subzones.",
        "A subzone is a building, a room within a building, or any other identifiable area within the playable spaces of the quest, e.g. the Mansion has the subzones: Hall, Dining Room, Kitchen, Outside, Ghost Room, etc.",
        "The subzone was determined based on the avatar(s) (x,y,z) coordinates and the known subzone boundaries.",
