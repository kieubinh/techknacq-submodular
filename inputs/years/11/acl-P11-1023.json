        "As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings ofwidespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent.",
        "But more accurate, non-automatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle.",
        "We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER.",
        "We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semi-automated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure.",

        "In this paper we show that evaluating machine translation by assessing the translation accuracy of each argument in the semantic role framework correlates with human judgment on translation adequacy as well as HTERat a significantly lower labor cost.",
        "The correlation of this new metric, MEANT, with human judgment is far superior to BLEU and other automatic n-gram based evaluation metrics.",
        "We argue that BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and other automatic n-gram based MT evaluation metrics do not adequately capture the similarity in meaning between the machine translation and the reference translation – which, ultimately, is essential for MT output to be useful.",
        "N-gram based metrics assume that \"good\" translations tend to share the same lexical choices as the reference translations.",
        "While BLEU score performs well in capturing the translation fluency, Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) and Koehn and Monz (2006) report cases where BLEU strongly disagree with human judgment on translation quality.",
        "The underlying reason is that lexical similarity does not adequately reflect the similarity in meaning.",
        "As MT systems improve, the shortcomings of the n-gram based evaluation metrics are becoming more apparent.",
        "State-of-the-art MT systems are often able to output fluent translations that are nearly grammatical and contain roughly the correct words, but still fail to express meaning that is close to the input.",
        "At the same time, although HTER (Snover et al., 2006) is more adequacy-oriented, it is only employed in very large scale MT system evaluation instead of day-to-day research activities.",
        "The underlying reason is that it requires rigorously trained human experts to make difficult combinatorial decisions on the minimal number of edits so as to make the MT output convey the same meaning as the reference translation – a highly labor-intensive, costly process that bottlenecks the evaluation cycle.",
        "Instead, with MEANT, we adopt at the outset the principle that a good translation is one that is useful, in the sense that human readers may successfully understand at least the basic event structure – \"who did what to whom, when, where and why\" (Pradhan et al., 2004) – representing the central meaning of the source utterances.",
        "It is true that limited tasks might exist for which inadequate translations are still useful.",
        "But for meaningful tasks, generally speaking, for a translation to be useful, at least the basic event structure must be correctly understood.",
        "Therefore, our objective is to evaluate trans-220lation utility: from a user's point of view, how well is the most essential semantic information being captured by machine translation systems?",
        "In this paper, we detail the methodology that underlies MEANT, which extends and implements preliminary directions proposed in (Lo and Wu, 2010a) and (Lo and Wu, 2010b).",
        "We present the results of evaluating translation utility by measuring the accuracy within a semantic role labeling (SRL) framework.",
        "We show empirically that our proposed SRL based evaluation metric, which uses untrained monolingual humans to annotate semantic frames in MT output, correlates with human adequacy judgments as well as HTER, and far better than BLEU and other commonly used metrics.",
        "Finally, we show that replacing the human semantic role labelers with an automatic shallow semantic parser in our proposed metric yields an approximation that is about 80% as closely correlated with human judgment as HTER, at an even lower cost – and is still far better correlated than n-gram based evaluation metrics."

        ",1997), CDER (Leusch et al., 2006) and WER (Nießen et al., 2000), also perform well in capturing translation fluency, but share the same problem that although evaluation with these metrics can be done very quickly at low cost, their underlying assumption – that a \"good\" translation is one that shares the same lexical choices as the reference translation – is not justified semantically.",
        "Lexical similarity does not adequately reflect similarity in meaning.",

        "HTER (non-automatic) Despite the fact that Human-targeted Translation Edit Rate (HTER) as proposed by Snover et al.",
        "(2006) shows a high correlation with human judgment on translation adequacy, it is not widely used in day-to-day machine translation evaluation because of its high labor cost.",
        "HTER not only requires human experts to understand the meaning expressed in both the reference translation and the machine translation, but also rethe MT output such that the post-edited MT output conveys the same meaning as the reference translation.",
        "Requiring such heavy manual decision making greatly increases the cost of evaluation, bottlenecking the evaluation cycle.",
        "To reduce the cost of evaluation, we aim to reduce any human decisions in the evaluation cycle to be as simple as possible, such that even untrained humans can quickly complete the evaluation.",
        "The human decisions should also be defined in a way that can be closely approximated by automatic methods, so that similar objective functions might potentially be used for tuning in MT system development cycles.",
        "Task based metrics (non-automatic) Voss and Tate (2006) proposed a task-based approach to MT evaluation that is in some ways similar in spirit to ours, but rather than evaluating how well people understand the meaning as a whole conveyed by a sentence translation, they measured the recall with which humans can extract one of the who, when, or where elements from MT output – and without attaching them to any predicate or frame.",
        "A large number of human subjects were instructed to extract only one particular type of wh-item from each sentence.",
        "They evaluated only whether the role fillers were correctly identified, without checking whether the roles were appropriately attached to the correct predicate.",
        "Also, the actor, experiencer, and patient were all conflated into the undistinguished who role, while other crucial elements, like the action, purpose, manner, were ignored.",
        "Instead, we argue, evaluating meaning similarity should be done by evaluating the semantic structure as a whole: (a) all core semantic roles should be checked, and (b) not only should we evaluate the presence of semantic role fillers in isolation, but also their relations to the frames' predicates.",
        "Syntax based metrics Unlike Voss and Tate, Liu and Gildea (2005) proposed a structural approach, but it was based on syntactic rather than semantic structure, and focused on checking the correctness of the role structure without checking the correctness of the role fillers.",
        "Their subtree metric (STM) and headword chain metric (HWC) address the failure of BLEU to evaluate translation grammaticality; however, the problem remains that a grammatical translation can achieve a high syntax-based score even if contains meaning errors arising from confusion of semantic roles.",
        "STM was the first proposed metric to incorporate syntactic features inMT evaluation, and STM underlies most other recently proposed syntactic MT evaluation metrics, for example the evaluation metric based on lexical-functional grammar of Owczarzak et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "STM is a precision-based metric that measures what fraction of quires them to propose the minimum number of edits to221subtree structures are shared between the parse trees of machine translations and reference translations (averaging over subtrees up to some depth threshold).",
        "Unlike Voss and Tate, however, STM does not check whether the role fillers are correctly translated.",
        "HWC is similar, but is based on dependency trees containing lexical as well as syntactic information.",
        "HWC measures what fraction of headword chains (a sequence of words corresponding to a path in the dependency tree) also appear in the reference dependency tree.",
        "This can be seen as a similarity measure on n-grams of dependency chains.",
        "Note that the HWC's notion of lexical similarity still requires exact word match.",
        "Although STM-like syntax-based metrics are an improvement over flat lexical similarity metrics like BLEU, they are still more fluency-oriented than adequacy-oriented.",
        "Similarity of syntactic rather than semantic structure still inadequately reflects meaning preservation.",
        "Moreover, properly measuring translation utility requires verifying whether role fillers have been correctly translated – verifying only the abstract structures fails to penalize when role fillers are confused.",
        "Semantic roles as features in aggregate metrics",
        "Gimenez and Marquez (2007, 2008) introduced ULC, an automatic MT evaluation metric that aggregates many types of features, including several shallow semantic similarity features: semantic role overlapping, semantic role matching, and semantic structure overlapping.",
        "Unlike Liu and Gildea (2007) who use discriminative training to tune the weight on each feature, ULC uses uniform weights.",
        "Although the metric shows an improved correlation with human judgment of translation quality (Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Gimenez and Marquez, 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Gimenez and Marquez, 2008), it is not commonly used in large-scale MT evaluation campaigns, perhaps due to its high time cost and/or the difficulty of interpreting its score because of its highly complex combination of many heterogenous types of features.",
        "Specifically, note that the feature based representations of semantic roles used in these aggregate metrics do not actually capture the structural predicate-argument relations.",
        "\"Semantic structure overlapping\" can be seen as the shallow semantic version of STM: it only measures the similarity of the tree structure of the semantic roles, without considering the lexical realization.",
        "\"Semantic role overlapping\" calculates the degree of lexical overlap between semantic roles of the same type in the machine translation and its reference translation, using simple bag-of-words counting; this is then aggregated into an average over all semantic role types.",
        "\"Semantic role matching\" is just like \"semantic role overlapping\", except that bag-of-words degree of similarity is replaced (rather harshly) by a boolean indicating whether the role fillers are an exact string match.",
        "It is important to note that \"semantic role overlapping\" and \"semantic role matching\" both use flat feature based representations which do not capture the structural relations in semantic frames, i.e., the predicate-argument relations.",
        "Like system combination approaches, ULC is a vastly more complex aggregate metric compared to widely used metrics like BLEU or STM.",
        "We believe it is important to retain a focus on developing simpler metrics which not only correlate well with human adequacy judgments, but nevertheless still directly provide representational transparency via simple, clear, and transparent scoring schemes that are (a) easily human readable to support error analysis, and (b) potentially directly usable for automatic credit/blame assignment in tuning tree-structured SMT systems.",
        "We also believe that to provide a foundation for better design of efficient automated metrics, making use of humans for annotating semantic roles and judging the role translation accuracy in MT output is an essential step that should not be bypassed, in order to adequately understand the upper bounds of such techniques.",
        "We agree with Przybocki et al.",
        "(2010), who observe in the NIST MetricsMaTr 2008 report that \"human [adequacy] assessments only pertain to the translations evaluated, and are of no use even to updated translations from the same systems\".",
        "Instead, we aim for MT evaluation metrics that provide fine-grained scores in a way that also directly reflects interpretable insights on the strengths and weaknesses of MT systems rather than simply replicating human assessments."
