        "These ciphers are more complex than simple substitution ciphers.",
        "Homophonic ciphers are generated via a non-deterministic encipherment process – the key is 1-to-many in the enciphering direction.",
        "The number of potential cipher symbol substitutes for a particular plaintext letter is often proportional to the frequency of that letter in the plaintext language – for example, the English letter \"E\" is assigned more cipher symbols than \"Z\".",
        "The objective of this is to flatten out the frequency distribution of cipher-text symbols, making a frequency-based cryptanalysis attack difficult.",
        "The substitution key is, however, deterministic in the decipherment direction – each ciphertext symbol maps to a single plaintext letter.",
        "Since the ciphertext can contain more than 26 types, we need a larger alphabet system – we use a numeric substitution alphabet in our experiments.",

        "The base distribution Po represents prior knowledge about the model parameter distributions.",
        "For the plaintext source model, we use probabilities from an English language model and for the channel model, we specify a uniform distribution (i.e., a plaintext letter can be substituted with any given cipher type with equal probability).",
        "C1-1 represents the count of events occurring before plaintext letter pi in the derivation (we call this the \"cache\").",
        "a and ß represent Dirich-let prior hyperparameters over the source and channel models respectively.",
        "A large prior value implies that characters are generated from the base distribution Po, whereas a smaller value biases characters to be generated with reference to previous decisions inside the cache (favoring sparser distributions).",
        "Efficient inference via type sampling: We use a",
        "Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984) method for performing inference on our model.",
        "We could follow a point-wise sampling strategy, where we sample plaintext letter choices for every cipher token, one at a time.",
        "But we already know that the substitution ciphers described here exhibit determinism in the deciphering direction, i.e., although we have no idea about the key mappings themselves, we do know that there exists only a single plaintext letter mapping for every cipher symbol type in the true key.",
        "So sampling plaintext choices for every cipher token separately is not an efficient strategy – our sampler may spend too much time exploring invalid keys (which map the same cipher symbol to different plaintext letters).",
        "Instead, we use a type sampling technique similar to the one proposed by Liang et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Under this scheme, we sample plaintext letter choices for each cipher symbol type.",
        "In every step, we sample a new plaintext letter for a cipher type and update the entire plaintext hypothesis (i.e., plaintext letters at all corresponding positions) to reflect this change.",
        "For example, if we sample a new choice pnew for a cipher symbol which occurs at positions 4,10,18, then we update plaintext letters p4, p10 and p18 with the new choice pnew.",
        "Using the property of exchangeability, we derive an incremental formula for re-scoring the probability of a new derivation based on the probability of the old derivation – when sampling at position i, we pretend that the area affected (within a context window around i) in the current plaintext hypothesis occurs at the end of the corpus, so that both the old and new derivations share the same cache.",
        "While we may make corpus-wide changes to a derivation in every sampling step, exchangeability allows us to perform scoring in an efficient manner.",
        "Combining letter n-gram language models with word dictionaries: Many existing probabilistic approaches use statistical letter n-gram language models of English to assign P(p) probabilities to plaintext hypotheses during decipherment.",
        "Other decryption techniques rely on word dictionaries (using words from an English dictionary) for attacking substitution ciphers.",
        "Unlike previous approaches, our decipherment method combines information from both sources – letter n-grams and word dictionaries.",
        "We build an interpolated word+n-gram LM and use it to assign P (p) probabilities to any plaintext letter sequence p1 ...pn.",
        "The advantage is that it helps direct the sampler towards plaintext hypotheses that resemble natural language – high probability letter sequences which form valid words such as \"H E L L O\" instead of sequences like \"'T X H R T\".",
        "But in addition to this, using letter n-gram information makes our model robust against variations in the original plaintext (for example, unseen words or misspellings as in the case of Zodiac-408 cipher) which can easily throw off dictionary-based attacks.",
        "Also, it is hard for a point-wise (or type) sampler to \"find words\" starting from a random initial sample, but easier to \"find n-grams\".",
        "Sampling for ciphers without spaces: For ciphers without spaces, dictionaries are hard to use because we do not know where words start and end.",
        "We introduce a new sampling operator which counters this problem and allows us to perform inference using the same decipherment model described earlier.",
        "In a first sampling pass, we sample from 26 plaintext letter choices (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", ...) for every cipher symbol type as before.",
        "We then run a second pass using a new sampling operator that iterates over adjacent plaintext letter pairs pi-1,pi in the current hypothesis and samples from two choices – (1) add a word boundary (space character \"_\") between pi-1and pi, or (2) remove an existing space character between pi-1 and pi.",
        "For example, given the English plaintext hypothesis \"... A B O Y ... \", there are two sampling choices for the letter pair A,B in the second step.",
        "If we decide to add a word boundary, our new plaintext hypothesis becomes \"... A _ B O Y",
        "We compute the derivation probability of the new sample using the same efficient scoring procedure described earlier.",
        "The new strategy allows us to apply Bayesian decipherment even to ciphers without spaces.",
