        "Probabilistic topic models, as exemplified by probabilistic latent semantic indexing (Hofmann, 1999) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) are unsupervised statistical techniques to discover the thematic topics that permeate a large corpus of text documents.",
        "Topic models have had considerable application beyond natural language processing in computer vision (Rob et al., 2005), biology (Shringarpure and Xing, 2008), and psychology (Landauer et al., 2006) in addition to their canonical application to text.",
        "For text, one of the few real-world applications of topic models is corpus exploration.",
        "Unannotated, noisy, and ever-growing corpora are the norm rather than the exception, and topic models offer a way to quickly get the gist a large corpus.",
        "Contrary to the impression given by the tables shown in topic modeling papers, topics discovered by topic modeling don't always make sense to ostensible end users.",
        "Part of the problem is that the objective function of topic models doesn't always correlate with human judgements (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "Another issue is that topic models – with their bag-of-words vision of the world – simply lack the necessary information to create the topics as end-users expect.",
        "There has been a thriving cottage industry adding more and more information to topic models to correct these shortcomings; either by modeling perspective (Paul and Girju, 2010; Lin et al., 2006), syntax (Wallach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007), or authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004; Dietz et al., 2007).",
        "Similarly, there has been an effort to inject human knowledge into topic models (Boyd-Graber et al., 2007; Andrzejewski et al., 2009; Petterson et al., 2010).",
        "However, these are a priori fixes.",
        "They don't help a frustrated consumer of topic models staring at a collection of topics that don't make sense.",
        "In this paper, we propose interactive topic modeling (ITM), an in situ method for incorporating human knowledge into topic models.",
        "In Section 2, we review prior work on creating probabilistic models that incorporate human knowledge, which we extend in Section 3 to apply to ITM sessions.",
        "Section 4 discusses the implementation of this process during the inference process.",
        "Via a motivating example in Section 5, simulated ITM sessions in Section 6, and a real interactive test in Section 7, we demonstrate that our approach is able to focus a user's desires in a topic model, better capture the key properties of a corpus, and capture diverse interests from users on the web.",
