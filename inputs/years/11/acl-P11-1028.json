        "In this paper, we study the task of grounding linguistic analysis in control applications such as computer games.",
        "In these applications, an agent attempts to optimize a utility function (e.g., game score) by learning to select situation-appropriate actions.",
        "In complex domains, finding a winning strategy is challenging even for humans.",
        "Therefore, human players typically rely on manuals and guides that describe promising tactics and provide general advice about the underlying task.",
        "Surprisingly, such textual information has never been utilized in control algorithms despite its potential to greatly improve performance.",
        "The natural resources available where a population settles affects its ability to produce food and goods.",
        "Build your city on a plains or grassland square with a river running through it if possible.",
        "Consider for instance the text shown in Figure 1.",
        "This is an excerpt from the user manual of the game Civilization II.",
        "This text describes game locations where the action \"build-city\" can be effectively applied.",
        "A stochastic player that does not have access to this text would have to gain this knowledge the hard way: it would repeatedly attempt this action in a myriad of states, thereby learning the characterization of promising state-action pairs based on the observed game outcomes.",
        "In games with large state spaces, long planning horizons, and high-branching factors, this approach can be prohibitively slow and ineffective.",
        "An algorithm with access to the text, however, could learn correlations between words in the text and game attributes - e.g., the word \"river\" and places with rivers in the game - thus leveraging strategies described in text to better select actions.",
        "The key technical challenge in leveraging textual knowledge is to automatically extract relevant information from text and incorporate it effectively into a control algorithm.",
        "Approaching this task in a supervised framework, as is common in traditional information extraction, is inherently difficult.",
        "Since the game's state space is extremely large, and the states that will be encountered during game play cannot be known a priori, it is impractical to manually annotate the information that would be relevant to those states.",
        "Instead, we propose to learn text analysis based on a feedback signal inherent to the control application, such as game score.",
        "Our general setup consists of a game in a stochastic environment, where the goal of the player is to maximize a given utility function R(s) at state s. We follow a common formulation that has been the basis of several successful applications of machine learning to games.",
        "The player's behavior is determined by an action-value function Q(s, a) that assesses the goodness of an action a in a given state s based on the features of s and a.",
        "This function is learned based solely on the utility R(s) collected via simulated game-play in a Monte-Carlo framework.",
        "An obvious way to enrich the model with textual information is to augment the action-value function with word features in addition to state and action features.",
        "However, adding all the words in the document is unlikely to help since only a small fraction of the text is relevant for a given state.",
        "Moreover, even when the relevant sentence is known, the mapping between raw text and the action-state representation may not be apparent.",
        "This representation gap can be bridged by inducing a predicate structure on the sentence – e.g., by identifying words that describe actions, and those that describe state attributes.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for learning an action-value function augmented with linguistic features, while simultaneously modeling sentence relevance and predicate structure.",
        "We employ a multilayer neural network where the hidden layers represent sentence relevance and predicate parsing decisions.",
        "Despite the added complexity, all the parameters of this non-linear model can be effectively learned via Monte-Carlo simulations.",
        "We test our method on the strategy game Civilization II, a notoriously challenging game with an immense action space.",
        "As a source of knowledge for guiding our model, we use the official game manual.",
        "As a baseline, we employ a similar Monte-Carlo search based player which does not have access to textual information.",
        "We demonstrate that the linguistically-informed player significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of number of games won.",
        "Moreover, we show that modeling the deeper linguistic structure of sentences further improves performance.",

        "Like the above models, we use environment feedback (in the form of a utility function) as the main source of supervision.",
        "The key difference, however, is in the language interpretation task itself.",
        "Previous work has focused on the interpretation of instruction text where input documents specify a set of actions to be executed in the environment.",
        "In contrast, game manuals provide high-level advice but do not directly describe the correct actions for every potential game state.",
        "Moreover, these documents are long, and use rich vocabularies with complex grammatical constructions.",
        "We do not aim to perform a comprehensive interpretation of such documents.",
        "Rather, our focus is on language analysis that is sufficiently detailed to help the underlying control task.",
        "The area of language analysis situated in a game domain has been studied in the past (Eisenstein et al., 2009).",
        "Their method, however, is different both in terms of the target interpretation task, and the supervision signal it learns from.",
        "They aim to learn the rules of a given game, such as which moves are valid, given documents describing the rules.",
        "Our goal is more open ended, in that we aim to learn winning game strategies.",
        "Furthermore, Eisenstein et al.",
        "(2009) rely on a different source of supervision game traces collected a priori.",
        "For complex games, like the one considered in this paper, collecting such game traces is prohibitively expensive.",

        "Figure 5: Accuracy of our method's sentence relevance predictions, averaged over 100 independent runs.",
        "impractical since the relevance decision is dependent on the game context, and is hence specific to each time step of each game instance.",
        "Therefore, for the purposes of this evaluation, we modify the game manual by adding to it sentences randomly selected from the Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) - sentences that are highly unlikely to be relevant to game play.",
        "We then evaluate the accuracy with which sentences from the original manual are picked as relevant.",
        "In this evaluation, our method achieves an average accuracy of 71.8%.",
        "Given that our model only has to differentiate between the game manual text and the Wall Street Journal, this number may seem disappointing.",
        "Furthermore, as can be seen from Figure 5, the sentence relevance accuracy varies widely as the game progresses, with a high average of 94.2% during the initial 25 game steps.",
        "In reality, this pattern of high initial accuracy followed by a lower average is not entirely surprising: the official game manual for Civilization II is written for first time players.",
        "As such, it focuses on the initial portion of the game, providing little strategy advice relevant to subsequence game play.",
        "If this is the reason for the observed sentence relevance trend, we would also expect the final layer of the neural network to emphasize game features over text features after the first 25 steps of the game.",
        "This is indeed the case, as can be seen from Figure 6.",

        "Predicate Labeling Figure 4 shows examples of the predicate structure output of our model.",
        "We evaluate the accuracy of this labeling by comparing it against a gold-standard annotation of the game manual.",
        "Table 3 shows the performance of our method in terms of how accurately it labels words as state, action or background, and also how accurately it differentiates between state and action words.",
        "In addition to showing a performance improvement over the random baseline, these results display two clear trends: first, under both evaluations, labeling accuracy is higher during the initial stages of the game.",
        "This is to be expected since the model relies heavily on textual features only during the beginning of the game (see Figure 6).",
        "Second, the model clearly performs better in differentiating between state and action words, rather than in the three-way labeling.",
        "To verify the usefulness of our method's predicate labeling, we perform a final set of experiments where predicate labels are selected uniformly at random within our full model.",
        "This random labeling results in a win rate of 44% - a performance similar to the sentence relevance model which uses no predicate information.",
