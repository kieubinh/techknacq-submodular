      "text": [
        "Previously, related work in education and psychometrics has been concerned with measuring word difficulty or classifying words into different difficulty categories.",
        "Examples of such approaches include creation of word lists for targeted vocabulary instruction at various grade levels that were compiled by educational experts, such as Nation (1993) or Biemiller (2008).",
        "Such word difficulty assignments are also implicitly present in some readability formulas that estimate difficulty of texts, such as Lexiles (Stenner, 1996), which include a lexical difficulty component based on the frequency of occurrence of words in a representative corpus, on the assumption that word difficulty is inversely correlated to corpus frequency.",
        "Additionally, research in psycholinguistics has attempted to outline and measure psycholinguistic dimensions of words such as age-of-acquisition and familiarity, which aim to track when certain words become known and how familiar they appear to an average person.",
        "Importantly, all such word difficulty measures can be thought of as functions that assign a single scalar value to each word w:",
        "There are several important limitations to such metrics, regardless of whether they are derived from corpus frequency, expert judgments or other measures.",
        "First, learning each word is a continual process, one that is interdependent with the rest of the vocabulary.",
        "Wolter (2001) writes:",
        "[...] Knowing a word is quite often not an either-or situation; some words are known well, some not at all, and some are known to varying degrees.",
        "[...] How well a particular word is known may condition the connections made between that particular word and the other words in the mental lexicon.",
        "Thus, instead of modeling when a particular word will become fully known, it makes more sense to model the degree to which a word is known at different levels of language exposure.",
        "Second, word difficulty is inherently perspectiv al: the degree of word understanding depends not only on the word itself, but also on the sophistication of a given learner.",
        "Consider again the difference between \"dog\" and \"focal\": a typical first-grader will have much more difficulty understanding the latter word compared to the former, whereas a well-educated adult will be able to use these words with equal ease.",
        "Therefore, the degree, or maturity, of word knowledge is inherently a function of two parameters â€“ word w and learner level /:",
        "As the level / increases (i.e. for more advanced learners), we would expect the degree of understanding of word w to approach its full value corresponding to perfect knowledge; this will happen at different rates for different words.",
        "Ideally, we would obtain maturity values by testing word knowledge of learners across different levels (ages or school grades) for all the words in the lexicon.",
        "Such a procedure, however, is prohibitively expensive; so instead we would like to estimate word maturity by using computational models.",
        "To summarize: our aim is to model the development of meaning of words as a function of increasing exposure to language, and ultimately - the degree to which the meaning of words at each stage of exposure resemble their \"adult\" meaning.",
        "We therefore define word meaning maturity to be the degree to which the understanding of the word (expected for the average learner of a particular level) resembles that of an ideal mature learner.",
        "3 Modeling Word Meaning Acquisition with Latent Semantic Analysis",
        "An appealing choice for quantitatively modeling word meanings and their growth over time is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), an unsupervised method for representing word and document meaning in a multidimensional vector space.",
        "The LSA vector representation is derived in an unsupervised manner, based on occurrence patterns of words in a large corpus of natural language documents.",
        "A Singular Value Decomposition on the high-dimensional matrix of word/document occurrence counts (^4) in the corpus, followed by zeroing all but the largest r elements of the diagonal matrix S, yields a lower-rank word vector matrix (U).",
        "The dimensionality reduction has the effect of smoothing out incidental co-occurrences and preserving significant semantic relationships between words.",
        "The resulting word vectors in U are positioned in such a way that semantically related words vectors point in similar directions or, equivalently, have higher cosine values between them.",

        "The SVD process in LSA illustrated.",
        "The original high-dimensional word-by-document matrix A is decomposed into word (U) and document (V) matrices of lower dimensionality.",
        "In addition to merely measuring semantic relatedness, LSA has been shown to emulate the learning of word meanings from natural language (as can be evidenced by a broad range of applications from synonym tests to automated essay grading), at rates that resemble those of human learners (Laundauer et al., 1997).",
        "Landauer and Dumais (1997) have demonstrated empirically that LSA can emulate not only the rate of human language acquisition, but also more subtle phenomena, such as the effects of learning certain words on meaning of other words.",

        "In this work, the general procedure behind computationally estimating word maturity of a learner at a particular intermediate level (i.e. age or school grade level) is as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Create an intermediate corpus for the given level.",
        "This corpus approximates the amount and sophistication of language encountered by a learner at the given level.",

        "Compare the meaning representation of each word (its LSA vector) to the corresponding one in a reference model.",
        "The reference model is trained on a much larger corpus and approximates the word meanings by a mature adult learner.",
        "We can repeat this process for each of a number of levels.",
        "These levels may directly correspond to school grades, learner ages or any other arbitrary gradations.",
        "In summary, we estimate word maturity of a given word at a given learner level by comparing the word vector from an intermediate LSA model (trained on a corpus of size and sophistication comparable to that which a typical real student at the given level encounters) to the corresponding vector from a reference adult LSA model (trained on a larger corpus corresponding to a mature language learner).",
        "A high discrepancy between the vectors would suggest that an intermediate model's meaning of a particular word is quite different from the reference meaning, and thus the word maturity at the corresponding level is relatively low.",
        "Comparing vectors across different LSA spaces is less straightforward, since the individual dimensions in LSA do not have a meaningful interpretation, and are an artifact of the content and ordering of the training corpus used.",
        "Therefore, direct comparisons across two different spaces, even of the same dimensionality, are meaningless, due to a mismatch in their coordinate systems.",
        "Fortunately, we can employ a multivariate algebra technique known as Procrustes Alignment (or Procrustes Analysis) (PA) typically used to align two multivariate configurations of a corresponding set of points in two different geometric spaces.",
        "PA has been used in conjunction with LSA, for example, in cross-language information retrieval (Littman, 1998).",
        "The basic idea behind PA is to derive a rotation matrix that allows one space to be rotated into the other.",
        "The rotation matrix is computed in such a way as to minimize the differences (namely: sum of squared distances) between corresponding points, which in the case of LSA can be common words or documents in the training set.",
        "For more details, the reader is advised to consult chapter 5 of (Krzanowski, 2000) or similar literature on multivariate analysis.",
        "In summary, given two matrices containing coordinates of n corresponding points X and Y (and assuming mean-centering and equal number of dimensions, as is the case in this work), we would like to minimize the sum of squared distances between the points:",
        "We try to find an orthogonal rotation matrix Q, which minimizes M by rotating Y relative to X.",
        "That matrix can be obtained by solving the equation:",
        "It turns out that the solution to Q is given by VU', where UIV is the singular value decomposition of the matrix X'Y.",
        "In our situation, where there are two spaces, adult and intermediate, the alignment points are the corresponding document vectors corresponding to the documents that the training corpora of the two models have in common (recall that the adult corpus is a superset of each of the intermediate corpora).",
        "The result of the Procrustes Alignment of the two spaces is effectively a joint LSA space containing two distinct word vectors for each word (e.g. \"dogl\", \"dog2\"), corresponding to the vectors from each of the original spaces.",
        "After merging using Procrustes Alignment, the comparison of word meanings becomes a simple problem of comparing word vectors in the joint space using the standard cosine metric."

        "Another insight into the fact that the LSA-based word maturity metric tracks word meaning rather than mere frequency may be gained from analysis of words that are homographs: words that contain two or more unrelated meanings in the same written form, such as the word \"turkey\" illustrated in Section 4.",
        "(This is related to but distinct from the merely polysemous words that have several related meanings),",
        "Because of the conflation of several unrelated meanings into the same orthographic form, homographs implicitly contain more semantic content in a single word.",
        "Therefore, one would expect the meaning of homographs to mature more slowly than would be predicted by frequency alone: all things being equal, a learner has to learn the meanings for all of the senses of a homograph word before the word can be considered fully known.",
        "More specifically, one would expect the time-to-maturity of homographs to have greater values than words of similar frequency.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we obtained a list 174 common English homographs.",
        "For each of them, we compared their time-to-maturity to the average time-to-maturity of words that have the same (+/- 1%) corpus frequency.",
        "The results of a paired t-test confirms the hypothesis that the time-to-maturity of homographs is greater than other words of the same frequency, with the p-value = 5.9e.",
        "This is consistent with the observation that homographs will take longer to learn and serves as evidence that LSA-based word maturity approximates effects related to meaning.",
        "Another area of investigation is the repercussions of the choice of the corpus for the reference (adult) model.",
        "The size (and content) of the corpus used to train the reference model is potentially important, since it affects the word maturity calculations, which are comparisons of the intermediate LSA spaces to the reference LSA space built on this corpus.",
        "It is interesting to investigate how the word maturity model would be affected if the adult corpus were made significantly more sophisticated.",
        "If the word maturity metric were simply based on word frequency (including the frequency-based maturity baseline described in Section 6.1), one would expect the word maturity of the words at each level to decrease significantly if the reference model is made significantly larger, since each intermediate level will have encountered fewer words by comparison.",
        "Intuition about language learning, however, tells us that with enough language exposure a learner learns virtually all there is to know about any particular word; after the word reaches its adult maturity, subsequent encounters of natural readings do little to further change the knowledge of that word.",
        "Therefore, if word maturity were tracking something similar to real word knowledge, one would expect the word maturity for most words to plateau over time, and subsequently not change significantly, no matter how sophisticated the reference model becomes.",
        "To evaluate this inquiry we created a reference corpus that is twice as large as before (four times as large and of the same difficulty range as the corpus for the last intermediate level), containing roughly 329,000 passages.",
        "We computed the word maturity model using this larger reference corpus, while keeping all the original intermediate corpora of the same size and content.",

        "Furthermore, this number is as low as 6%, if one only considers more common words that occur 50 times or more in the corpus.",
        "This relatively small difference, in spite of a twofold increase of the adult corpus, is consistent with the idea that word knowledge should approach a plateau, after which further exposure to language does little to change most word meanings.",
        "Another important consideration with respect to word learning mentioned in Wotler (2001), is the \"connections made between [a] particular word and the other words in the mental lexicon.\"",
        "One implication of that is that measuring word maturity must take into account the way words in the language are integrated with other words.",
        "One way to test this effect is to introduce readings where a large part of the important vocabulary is not well known to learners at a given level.",
        "One would expect learning to be impeded when the learning materials are inappropriate for the learner level.",
        "This can be simulated in the word maturity model by rearranging the order of some of the training passages, by introducing certain advanced passages at a very early level.",
        "If the results of the word maturity metric were merely based on frequency, such a reordering would have no effect on the maturity of important words (measured after all the passages containing these words have been encountered), since the total number of relevant word encounters does not change as a result of this reshuffling.",
        "If, however, the metric reflected at least some degree of semantics, we would expect word maturities for important words in these readings to be lower as a result of such rearranging, due to the fact that they are being introduced in contexts consisting of words that are not well known at the early levels.",
        "To test this effect, we first collected all passages in the training corpus of intermediate models containing some advanced words from different topics, namely: \"chromosome\", \"neutron\" and \"filibuster\" together with their plural variants.",
        "We changed the order of inclusion of these 89 passages into the intermediate models in each of the two following ways:",
        "1.",
        "All the passages were introduced at the first level (l=1) intermediate corpus",
        "2.",
        "All the passages were introduced at the last level (l=14) intermediate corpus.",
        "This resulted in two new variants of word maturity models, which were computed in all the same ways as before, except that all of these 89 advanced passages were introduced either at the very first level or at the very last level.",
        "We then computed the word maturity at the levels they were introduced.",
        "The hypothesis consistent with a meaning-based maturity method would be that less learning (i.e. lower word maturity) of the relevant words will occur when passages are introduced prematurely (at level 1).",
        "Table 5 shows the word maturities measured for each of those cases, at the level (1 or 14) when all of the passages have been introduced.",
        "Table 5.",
        "Word maturity of words resulting when all the relevant passages are introduced early vs late.",
        "Indeed, the results show lower word maturity values when advanced passages are introduced too early, and higher ones when the passages are introduced at a later stage, when the rest of the supporting vocabulary is known."
