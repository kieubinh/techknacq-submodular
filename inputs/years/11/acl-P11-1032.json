        "With the ever-increasing popularity of review websites that feature user-generated opinions (e.g., TripAdvisor and Yelp), there comes an increasing potential for monetary gain through opinion spam – inappropriate or fraudulent reviews.",
        "Opinion spam can range from annoying self-promotion of an unrelated website or blog to deliberate review fraud, as in the recent case of a Belkin employee who hired people to write positive reviews for an otherwise poorly reviewed product.",
        "While other kinds of spam have received considerable computational attention, regrettably there has been little work to date (see Section 2) on opinion spam detection.",
        "Furthermore, most previous work in the area has focused on the detection of disruptive OPINION SPAM – uncontroversial instances of spam that are easily identified by a human reader, e.g., advertisements, questions, and other irrelevant or non-opinion text (Jindal and Liu, 2008).",
        "And while the presence of disruptive opinion spam is certainly a nuisance, the risk it poses to the user is minimal, since the user can always choose to ignore it.",
        "We focus here on a potentially more insidious type of opinion spam: DECEPTIVE OPINION spam – fictitious opinions that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, in order to deceive the reader.",
        "For example, one of the following two hotel reviews is truthful and the other is deceptive opinion spam:",
        "1.",
        "I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is tops.",
        "The service at the hotel is first class.",
        "The rooms are modern and very comfortable.",
        "The location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants.",

        "We knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice!",
        "The rooms are BEAUTIFUL and the staff very attentive and wonderful!!",
        "The area of the hotel is great, since I love to shop I couldn't ask for more!!",
        "We will definatly be back to Chicago and we will for sure be back to the James Chicago.",
        "Typically, these deceptive opinions are neither easily ignored nor even identifiable by a human reader; consequently, there are few good sources of labeled data for this research.",
        "Indeed, in the absence of gold-standard data, related studies (see Section 2) have been forced to utilize ad hoc procedures for evaluation.",
        "In contrast, one contribution of the work presented here is the creation of the first large-scale, publicly available dataset for deceptive opinion spam research, containing 400 truthful and 400 gold-standard deceptive reviews.",
        "To obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of deceptive opinion spam, we explore the relative utility of three potentially complementary framings of our problem.",
        "Specifically, we view the task as: (a) a standard text categorization task, in which we use n-gram-based classifiers to label opinions as either deceptive or truthful (Joachims, 1998; Sebastiani, 2002); (b) an instance of psycholinguistic deception detection, in which we expect deceptive statements to exemplify the psychological effects of lying, such as increased negative emotion and psychological distancing (Hancock et al., 2008; Newman et al., 2003); and, (c) a problem of genre identification, in which we view deceptive and truthful writing as sub-genres of imaginative and informative writing, respectively (Biber et al., 1999; Rayson et al., 2001).",
        "We compare the performance of each approach on our novel dataset.",
        "Particularly, we find that machine learning classifiers trained on features traditionally employed in (a) psychological studies of deception and (b) genre identification are both outperformed at statistically significant levels by n-gram-based text categorization techniques.",
        "Notably, a combined classifier with both n-gram and psychological deception features achieves nearly 90% cross-validated accuracy on this task.",
        "In contrast, we find deceptive opinion spam detection to be well beyond the capabilities of most human judges, who perform roughly at-chance – a finding that is consistent with decades of traditional deception detection research (Bond and DePaulo, 2006).",
        "edu/~myleott/op_spam",
        "Additionally, we make several theoretical contributions based on an examination of the feature weights learned by our machine learning classifiers.",
        "Specifically, we shed light on an ongoing debate in the deception literature regarding the importance of considering the context and motivation of a deception, rather than simply identifying a universal set of deception cues.",
        "We also present findings that are consistent with recent work highlighting the difficulties that liars have encoding spatial information (Vrij et al., 2009).",
        "Lastly, our study of deceptive opinion spam detection as a genre identification problem reveals relationships between deceptive opinions and imaginative writing, and between truthful opinions and informative writing.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we summarize related work; in Section 3, we explain our methodology for gathering data and evaluate human performance; in Section 4, we describe the features and classifiers employed by our three automated detection approaches; in Section 5, we present and discuss experimental results; finally, conclusions and directions for future work are given in Section 6."

        "The HIT instructions ask the Turker to assume that they work for the hotel's marketing department, and to pretend that their boss wants them to write a fake review (as if they were a customer) to be posted on a travel review website; additionally, the review needs to sound realistic and portray the hotel in a positive light.",

        "We suspect that these \"quick\" users may have started working prior to having formally accepted the HIT, presumably to circumvent the imposed time limit.",
        "Indeed, the quickest submission took just 5 seconds and contained 114 words.",
        "For truthful opinions, we mine all 6,977 reviews from the 20 most popular Chicago hotels on TripAdvisor.",
        "From these we eliminate:",
        "• 75 reviews with fewer than 150 characters since, by construction, deceptive opinions are",
        "• 1,607 reviews written by first-time authors – new users who have not previously posted an opinion on TripAdvisor – since these opinions are more likely to contain opinion spam, which would reduce the integrity of our truthful review data (Wu et al., 2010).",
        "Finally, we balance the number of truthful and deceptive opinions by selecting 400 of the remaining 2,124 truthful reviews, such that the document lengths of the selected truthful reviews are similarly distributed to those of the deceptive reviews.",
        "Work by Serrano et al.",
        "(2009) suggests that a log-normal distribution is appropriate for modeling document lengths.",
        "Thus, for each of the 20 chosen hotels, we select 20 truthful reviews from a log-normal (left-truncated at 150 characters) distribution fit to the lengths of the deceptive reviews.",
        "Combined with the 400 deceptive reviews gathered in Section 3.1 this yields our final dataset of 800 reviews.",
        "Assessing human deception detection performance is important for several reasons.",
        "First, there are few other baselines for our classification task; indeed, related studies (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009) have only considered a random guess baseline.",
        "Second, assessing human performance is necessary to validate the deceptive opinions gathered in Section 3.1.",
        "If human performance is low, then our deceptive opinions are convincing, and therefore, deserving of further attention.",
        "Our initial approach to assessing human performance on this task was with Mechanical Turk.",
        "Unfortunately, we found that some Turkers selected among the choices seemingly at random, presumably to maximize their hourly earnings by obviating the need to read the review.",
        "While a similar effect has been observed previously (Akkaya et al., 2010), there remains no universal solution.",

        "In fact, judge 2 classified fewer than 12% of the opinions as deceptive!",
        "Interestingly, this bias is effectively smoothed by the skeptic meta-judge, which produces nearly perfectly class-balanced predictions.",

        "This result is best explained by theories of reality monitoring (Johnson and Raye, 1981), which suggest that truthful and deceptive opinions might be classified into informative and imaginative genres, respectively.",
        "Work by Rayson et al.",
        "(2001) has found strong distributional differences between informative and imaginative writing, namely that the former typically consists of more nouns, adjectives, prepositions, determiners, and coordinating conjunctions, while the latter consists of more verbs, adverbs,pronouns, and pre-determiners.",
        "Indeed, we find that the weights learned by POSSVM (found in Table 4) are largely in agreement with these findings, notably except for adjective and adverb superlatives, the latter of which was found to be an exception by Rayson et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "However, that deceptive opinions contain more superlatives is not unexpected, since deceptive writing (but not necessarily imaginative writing in general) often contains exaggerated language (Buller and Burgoon, 1996; Hancock et al., 2008).",
