        "Indeed, sentiment analysis systems, which mine opinions from textual sources (e.g. news, blogs, and reviews), can be used in a wide variety of",
        "The work was conducted when the first author was visiting Cornell University.",

        "Not surprisingly, most methods for sentiment classification are supervised learning techniques, which require training data annotated with the appropriate sentiment labels (e.g. document-level or sentence-level positive vs. negative polarity).",
        "This data is difficult and costly to obtain, and must be acquired separately for each language under consideration.",
        "Previous work in multilingual sentiment analysis has therefore focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources (e.g. lexicons) from resource-rich languages (typically English) to other languages, with the goal of transferring sentiment or subjectivity analysis capabilities from English to other languages (e.g. Mihalcea et al.",

        "In recent years, however, sentiment-labeled data is gradually becoming available for languages other than English (e.g. Seki et al.",

        "(2010); Schulz et al.",
        "(2010)).",
        "In addition, there is still much room for improvement in existing monolingual (including English) sentiment classifiers, especially at the sentence level (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "This paper tackles the task of bilingual sentiment analysis.",
        "In contrast to previous work, we (1) assume that some amount of sentiment-labeled data is available for the language pair under study, and (2) investigate methods to simultaneously improve sentiment classification for both languages.",
        "Given the labeled data in each language, we propose an approach that exploits an unlabeled parallel corpus with the following intuition: two sentences or documents that are parallel (i.e. translations of one another) should exhibit the same sentiment – their sentiment labels (e.g. polarity, subjectivity, intensity) should be similar.",
        "The proposed maximum entropy-based EM approach jointly learns two monolingual sentiment classifiers by treating the sentiment labels in the unlabeled parallel text as unobserved latent variables, and maximizes the regularized joint likelihood of the language-specific labeled data together with the inferred sentiment labels of the parallel text.",
        "Although our approach should be applicable at the document-level and for additional sentiment tasks, we focus on sentence-level polarity classification in this work.",
        "We evaluate our approach for English and Chinese on two dataset combinations (see Section 4) and find that the proposed approach outperforms the monolingual baselines (i.e. maximum entropy and SVM classifiers) as well as two alternative methods for leveraging unlabeled data (transductive SVMs (Joachims, 1999b) and co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998)).",
        "Accuracy is significantly improved for both languages, by 3.44%-8.12%.",

        "Another notable approach is the work of Boyd-Graber and Resnik (2010), which presents a generative model --- supervised multilingual latent Dirichlet allocation --- that jointly models topics that are consistent across languages, and employs them to better predict sentiment ratings.",

        "We compare to co-training and transductive SVMs in Section 5.",
        "Multilingual NLP for Other Tasks.",
        "Finally, there exists related work using bilingual resources to help other NLP tasks, such as word sense disambiguation (e.g. Ido and Itai (1994)), parsing (e.g. Burkett and Klein (2008); Zhao et al.",
        "(2009); Burkett et al.",

        "In these cases, multilingual models increase performance because different languages contain different ambiguities and therefore present complementary views on the shared underlying labels.",

        "In this section, we investigate how adding automatically translated labeled data might influence the performance as mentioned in Section 3.4.",
        "We use only the translated labeled data to train classifiers, and then directly classify the test data.",
        "The average accuracies in setting 1 are 66.61% and 63.11% on English and Chinese, respectively; while the accuracies in setting 2 are 58.43% and 54.07% on English and Chinese, respectively.",
        "This result is reasonable because of the language gap between the original language and the translated language.",
        "In addition, the class distributions of the English labeled data and the Chinese are quite different (30% vs. 55% for positive as shown in",
        "Table 1).",
        "Figures 5 and 6 show the accuracies when varying the weight of the translated labeled data vs. the labeled data, with and without the unlabeled parallel data.",

        "see that the translated data can be helpful given the labeled data and even the unlabeled data, as long as is small; while in Figure 6, the translated data decreases the performance in most cases for setting 2.",
        "One possible reason is that in the first data setting, the NTCIR English data covers the same topics as the NTCIR Chinese data and thus direct translation is helpful, while the English and Chinese topics are quite different in the second data setting, and thus direct translation hurts the performance given the existing labeled data in each language.",
        "To further understand what contributions our proposed approach makes to the performance gain, we look inside the parameters in the MaxEnt models learned before and after adding the parallel unlabeled data.",
        "Table 3 shows the features in the model learned from the labeled data that have the largest weight change after adding the parallel data; and Table 4 shows the newly learned features from the unlabeled data with the largest weights.",
        "From Table 3 we can see that the weight changes of the original features are quite reasonable, e.g. the top words in the positive class are obviously positive and the proposed approach gives them higher weights.",
        "The new features also seem reasonable given the knowledge that the labeled and unlabeled data includes negative news about for specific topics (e.g. Germany, Taiwan),.",
        "We also examine the process of joint training by checking the performance on test data and the agreement of the two monolingual models on the unlabeled parallel data in both settings.",
        "The average agreement across 5 folds is 85.06% and 73.87% in settings 1 and 2, respectively, before the joint training, and increases to 100% and 99.89%, respectively, after 100 iterations of joint training.",
        "Although the average agreement has already increased to 99.50% and 99.02% in settings 1 and 2, respectively, after 30 iterations, the performance on the test set steadily improves in both settings until around 50-60 iterations, and then becomes relatively stable after that.",
        "Examination of those sentence pairs in setting 2 for which the two monolingual models still disagree after 100 iterations of joint training often produces sentences that are not quite parallel, e.g.:",
        "English: The two sides attach great importance to international cooperation on protection and promotion of human rights.",
        "Chinese: MlJik%,&AUnm±^È&%fy\"MMfâm\",&M& HU^M+MfflAUl'nJMMBo (Both sides agree that double standards on the issue of human rights are to be avoided, and are opposed to using pressure on human rights issues in international relations.)",
        "Since the two sentences discuss human rights from very different perspectives, it is reasonable that the two monolingual models will classify them with different polarities (i.e. positive for the English sentence and negative for the Chinese sentence) even after joint training."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we study bilingual sentiment classification and propose a joint model to simultaneously learn better monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language by exploiting an unlabeled parallel corpus together with the labeled data available for each language.",
        "Our experiments show that the proposed approach can significantly improve sentiment classification for both languages.",
        "Moreover, the proposed approach continues to produce (albeit smaller) performance gains when employing pseudo-parallel data from machine translation engines.",
        "In future work, we would like to apply the joint learning idea to other learning frameworks (e.g. SVMs), and to extend the proposed model to handle word-level parallel information, e.g. bilingual dictionaries or word alignment information.",
        "Another issue is to investigate how to improve multilingual sentiment analysis by exploiting comparable corpora."
