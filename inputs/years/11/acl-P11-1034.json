        "Both sentiment analysis (opinion recognition) and summarization have been well studied in recent years in the natural language processing (NLP) community.",
        "Most of the previous work on sentiment analysis has been conducted on reviews.",
        "Summarization has been applied to different genres, such as news articles, scientific articles, and speech domains including broadcast news, meetings, conversations and lectures.",
        "However, opinion summarization has not been explored much.",
        "This can be useful for many domains, especially for processing the increasing amount of conversation recordings (telephone conversations, customer service, round-table discussions or interviews in broadcast programs) where we often need to find a person's opinion or attitude, for example, \"how does the speaker think about capital punishment and why?\".",
        "This kind of questions can be treated as a topic-oriented opinion summarization task.",
        "Opinion summarization was run as a pilot task in Text Analysis Conference (TAC) in 2008.",
        "The task was to produce summaries of opinions on specified targets from a set of blog documents.",
        "In this study, we investigate this problem using spontaneous conversations.",
        "The problem is defined as, given a conversation and a topic, a summarization system needs to generate a summary of the speaker's opinion towards the topic.",
        "This task is built upon opinion recognition and topic or query based summarization.",
        "However, this problem is challenging in that: (a) Summarization in spontaneous speech is more difficult than well structured text (Mckeown et al., 2005), because speech is always less organized and has recognition errors when using speech recognition output; (b) Sentiment analysis in dialogues is also much harder because of the genre difference compared to other domains like product reviews or news resources, as reported in (Raaijmakers et al., 2008); (c) In conversational speech, information density is low and there are often off topic discussions, therefore presenting a need to identify utterances that are relevant to the topic.",
        "In this paper we perform an exploratory study on opinion summarization in conversations.",
        "We compare two unsupervised methods that have been widely used in extractive summarization: sentence-ranking and graph-based methods.",
        "Our system attempts to incorporate more information about topic relevancy and sentiment scores.",
        "Furthermore, in the graph-based method, we propose to better incorporate the dialogue structure information in the graph in order to select salient summary utterances.",
        "We have created a corpus of reasonable size in this study.",

        "Research in document summarization has been well established over the past decades.",
        "Many tasks have been defined such as single-document summarization, multi-document summarization, and query-based summarization.",
        "Previous studies have used various domains, including news articles, scientific articles, web documents, reviews.",
        "Recently there is an increasing research interest in speech summarization, such as conversational telephone speech (Zhu and Penn, 2006; Zechner, 2002), broadcast news (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005; Lin et al., 2010) , voice mails (Koumpis and Renals, 2005).",
        "In general speech domains seem to be more difficult than well written text for summarization.",
        "In previous work, unsupervised methods like Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and supervised methods that cast the extraction problem as a binary classification task have been adopted.",
        "Prior research has also explored using speech specific information, including prosodic features, dialog structure, and speech recognition confidence.",
        "In order to provide a summary over opinions, we need to find out which utterances in the conversation contain opinion.",
        "Most previous work in sentiment analysis has focused on reviews (Pang and Lee, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Ng et al., 2006) and news resources (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).",
        "Many kinds of features are explored, such as lexical features (unigram, bigram and trigram), part-of-speech tags, dependency relations.",
        "Most of prior work used classification methods such as naive Bayes or SVMs to perform the polarity classification or opinion detection.",
        "Only a handful studies have used conversational speech for opinion recognition (Murray and Carenini, 2009; Raaijmakers et al., 2008), in which some domain-specific features are utilized such as structural features and prosodic features.",
        "Our work is also related to question answering (QA), especially opinion question answering.",
        "(Stoy-anov et al., 2005) applies a subjectivity filter based on traditional QA systems to generate opinionated answers.",
        "(Balahur et al., 2010) answers some specific opinion questions like \"Why do people criticize Richard Branson?\"",
        "by retrieving candidate sentences using traditional QA methods and selecting the ones with the same polarity as the question.",
        "Our work is different in that we are not going to answer specific opinion questions, instead, we provide a summary on the speaker's opinion towards a given topic.",
        "There exists some work on opinion summarization.",
        "For example, (Hu and Liu, 2004; Nishikawa et al., 2010) have explored opinion summarization in review domain, and (Paul et al., 2010) summarizes contrastive viewpoints in opinionated text.",
        "However, opinion summarization in spontaneous conversation is seldom studied."

        "Though there are many annotated data sets for the research of speech summarization and sentiment analysis, there is no corpus available for opinion summarization on spontaneous speech.",
        "Thus for this study, we create a new pilot data set using a subset of the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey and Holli-man, 1997).",
        "These are conversational telephone speech between two strangers that were assigned a topic to talk about for around 5 minutes.",
        "They were told to find the opinions of the other person.",
        "There are 70 topics in total.",
        "From the Switchboard corpus, we selected 88 conversations from 6 topics for this study.",
        "Table 1 lists the number of conversations in each topic, their average length (measured in the unit of dialogue acts (DA)) and standard deviation of length.",
        "Table 1: Corpus statistics: topic description, number of conversations in each topic, average length (number of dialog acts), and standard deviation.",
        "We recruited 3 annotators that are all undergraduate computer science students.",
        "From the 88 conversations, we selected 18 (3 from each topic) and let all three annotators label them in order to study inter-annotator agreement.",
        "The rest of the conversations has only one annotation.",
        "The annotators have access to both conversation transcripts and audio files.",
        "For each conversation, the annotator writes an abstractive summary of up to 100 words for each speaker about his/her opinion or attitude on the given topic.",
        "They were told to use the words in the original transcripts if possible.",
        "Then the annotator selects up to 15 DAs (no minimum limit) in the transcripts for each speaker, from which their abstractive summary is derived.",
        "The selected DAs are used as the human generated extractive summary.",
        "In addition, the annotator is asked to select an overall opinion towards the topic for each speaker among five categories: strongly support, somewhat support, neutral, somewhat against, strongly against.",
        "Therefore for each conversation, we have an abstractive summary, an extractive summary, and an overall opinion for each speaker.",
        "The following shows an example of such annotation for speaker B in a dialogue about \"capital punishment\":",
        "[Extractive Summary]",
        "I think I've seen some statistics that say that, uh, it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life.",
        "committing them mostly is, you know, either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught",
        "but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis, for example, someone like, uh,jeffrey dahlmer,",
        "by putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again.",
        "I don't think he could ever redeem himself,",
        "but ifyou look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed, it's very racially related - and ethnically related [Abstractive Summary]",
        "B is against capital punishment except under certain circumstances.",
        "B finds that crimes deserving of capital punishment are \"crimes of the moment\" and as a result feels that capital punishment is not an effective deterrent.",
        "however, B also recognizes that on an individual basis some criminals can never \"redeem\" themselves.",
        "[Overall Opinion] Somewhat against",
        "Table 2 shows the compression ratio of the extractive summaries and abstractive summaries as well as their standard deviation.",
        "Because in conversations, utterance length varies a lot, we use words as units when calculating the compression ratio.",
        "We measured the inter-annotator agreement among the three annotators for the 18 conversations (each has two speakers, thus 36 \"documents\" in total).",
        "Results are shown in Table 3.",
        "For the extractive or abstractive summaries, we use ROUGE scores (Lin, 2004), a metric used to evaluate automatic summarization performance, to measure the pairwise agreement of summaries from different annotators.",
        "ROUGE F-scores are shown in the table for different matches, unigram (R-1), bigram (R-2), and longest subsequence (R-L).",
        "For the overall opinion category, since it is a multiclass label (not binary decision), we use Krippendorff's a coefficient to measure human agreement, and the difference function for interval data: ö\"C.k = (c – k) (where c, k are the interval values, on a scale of 1 to 5 corresponding to the five categories for the overall opinion).",
        "We notice that the inter-annotator agreement for extractive summaries is comparable to other speech summary annotation (Liu and Liu, 2008).",
        "The agreement on abstractive summaries is much lower than extractive summaries, which is as expected.",
        "Even for the same opinion or sentence, annotators use different words in the abstractive summaries.",
        "The agreement for the overall opinion annotation is similar to other opinion/emotion studies (Wilson, 2008b), but slightly lower than the level recommended by Krippendorff for reliable data (a = 0.8) (Hayes and Krippendorff, 2007), which shows it is even difficult for humans to determine what opinion a person holds (support or against something).",
        "Often human annotators have different interpretations about the same sentence, and a speaker's opinion/attitude is sometimes ambiguous.",
        "Therefore this also demonstrates that it is more appropriate to provide a summary rather than a simple opinion category to answer questions about a person's opinion towards something.",

        "We use all three annotators' annotation as reference, and consider an utterance as positive if one annotator selects it.",
        "This results in a large number of reference summary DAs (because of low human agreement), and thus the number of false negatives in the system output is very high.",
        "As expected, a smaller compression ratio (fewer selected DAs in the system output) yields a higher false negative rate and a lower false positive rate.",
        "From the results, we can see that generally adding adjacency matrix information is able to reduce both types of errors except when the compression ratio is 0.15.",
        "The following shows an example, where the third DA is selected by the system with Aadj =0.3, but not by Aadj = 0.",
        "This is partly because the weight of the second DA is enhanced by the the question-",

        "(a) Topic relevance measure.",
        "We use the statistics from the Switchboard corpus to measure the relevance of each word to a given topic (PMI score), therefore only when people use the same word in different conversations of the topic, the PMI score of this word and the topic is high.",
        "However, since the size of the corpus is small, some topics only contain a few conversations, and some words only appear in one conversation even though they are topic-relevant.",
        "Therefore the current PMI measure cannot properly measure a word's and a sentence's topic relevance.",
        "This problem leads to many false negative errors (relevant sentences are not captured by our system).",
        "(b) Extraction units.",
        "We used DA segments as units for extractive summarization, which can be problematic.",
        "In conversational speech, sometimes a DA segment is not a complete sentence because of overlaps and interruptions.",
        "We notice that annotators tend to select consecutive DAs that constitute a complete sentence, however, since each individual DA is not quite meaningful by itself, they are often not selected by the system.",
        "The following segment is extracted from a dialogue about \"universal health insurance\".",
        "The two DAs from speaker B are not selected by our system but selected by human annotators, causing false negative errors.",
