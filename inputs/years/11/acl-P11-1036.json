        "Online product reviews have become an increasingly valuable and influential source of information for consumers.",
        "Different reviewers may choose to comment on different properties or aspects of a product; therefore their reviews focus on different qualities of the product.",
        "Even when they discuss the same properties, their experiences and, subsequently, evaluations of the product can differ dramatically.",
        "Thus, information in any single review may not provide a complete and balanced view representative of the product as a whole.",
        "To address this need, online retailers often use simple aggregation mechanisms to represent the spectrum of user sentiment.",

        "The first cluster represents a coherent property of the underlying product, namely the cocktail property, and assesses distinctions in user sentiment.",
        "The latter cluster simply shares a common attribute expression and does not represent snippets discussing the same product property.",
        "In this work, we aim to produce the first type of property cluster with correct sentiment labeling.",
        "views, providing access to reviews at different levels of satisfaction.",
        "The goal of our work is to provide a mechanism for review content aggregation that goes beyond numerical scores.",
        "Specifically, we are interested in identifying fine-grained product properties across reviews (e.g., battery life for electronics or pizza for restaurants) as well as capturing attributes of these properties, namely aggregate user sentiment.",
        "For this task, we assume as input a set of product review snippets (i.e., standalone phrases such as \"battery life is the best I've found\") rather than complete reviews.",
        "There are many techniques for extracting this type of snippet in existing work; we use the Sauper et al.",
        "(2010) system.",
        "At first glance, this task can be solved using existing methods for review analysis.",
        "These methods can effectively extract product properties from individual snippets along with their corresponding sentiment.",
        "While the resulting property-attribute pairs form a useful abstraction for cross-review analysis, in practice direct comparison of these pairs is challenging.",
        "Consider, for instance, the two clusters of restaurant review snippets shown in Figure 1.",
        "While both clusters have many words in common among their members, only the first describes a coherent property cluster, namely the cocktail property.",
        "The snippets of the latter cluster do not discuss a single product property, but instead share similar expressions of sentiment.",
        "To solve this issue, we need a method which can correctly identify both property and sentiment words.",
        "In this work, we propose an approach that jointly analyzes the whole collection of product review snippets, induces a set of learned properties, and models the aggregate user sentiment towards these properties.",
        "We capture this idea using a Bayesian topic model where a set of properties and corresponding attribute tendencies are represented as hidden variables.",
        "The model takes product review snippets as input and explains how the observed text arises from the latent variables, thereby connecting text fragments with corresponding properties and attributes.",
        "The advantages of this formulation are twofold.",
        "First, this encoding provides a common ground for comparing and aggregating review content in the presence of varied lexical realizations.",
        "For instance, this representation allows us to directly compare how many reviewers liked a given property of a product.",
        "Second, our model yields an efficient mean-field variational inference procedure which can be parallelized and run on a large number of review snippets.",
        "We evaluate our approach in the domain of snippets taken from restaurant reviews on Yelp.",
        "In this collection, each restaurant has on average 29.8 snippets representing a wide spectrum of opinions about a restaurant.",
        "The evaluation we present demonstrates that the model can accurately retrieve clusters of review fragments that describe the same property, yielding 20% error reduction over a standalone clustering baseline.",
        "We also show that the model can effectively identify binary snippet attributes with 9.2% error reduction over applicable baselines, demonstrating that learning to identify attributes in the context of other product reviews yields significant gains.",
        "Finally, we evaluate our model on its ability to identify product properties for which there is significant sentiment disagreement amongst user snippets.",
        "This tests our model's capacity to jointly identify properties and assess attributes."

        "Our work on review aggregation has connections to three lines of work in text analysis.",
        "First, our work relates to research on extraction of product properties with associated sentiment from review text (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005a; Popescu et al., 2005).",
        "These methods identify relevant information in a document using a wide range of methods such as association mining (Hu and Liu, 2004), relaxation labeling (Popescu et al., 2005) and supervised learning (Kim and Hovy, 2006).",
        "While our method also extracts product properties and sentiment, our focus is on multi-review aggregation.",
        "This task introduces new challenges which were not addressed in prior research that focused on per-document analysis.",
        "A second related line of research is multi-document review summarization.",
        "Some of these methods directly apply existing domain-independent summarization methods (Seki et al., 2006) , while others propose new methods targeted for opinion text (Liu et al., 2005b; Carenini et al., 2006; Hu and Liu, 2006; Kim and Zhai, 2009).",
        "For instance, these summaries may present contrastive view points (Kim and Zhai, 2009) or relay average sentiment (Carenini et al., 2006).",
        "The focus of this line of work is on how to select suitable sentences, assuming that relevant review features (such as numerical scores) are given.",
        "Since our emphasis is on multi-review analysis, we believe that the information we extract can benefit existing summarization systems.",
        "Finally, a number of approaches analyze review documents using probabilistic topic models (Lu and Zhai, 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Mei et al., 2007) .",
        "While some of these methods focus primarily on modeling ratable aspects (Titov and McDonald, 2008), others explicitly capture the mixture of topics and sentiments (Mei et al., 2007).",
        "These approaches are capable of identifying latent topics in the collection in opinion text (e.g., weblogs) as well as associated sentiment.",
        "While our model captures similar high-level intuition, it analyzes fine-grained properties expressed at the snippet level, rather than document-level sentiment.",
        "Delivering analysis at such a fine granularity requires a new technique."
