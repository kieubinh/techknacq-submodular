        "Named Entities Recognition (NER) is generally understood as the task of identifying mentions of rigid designators from text belonging to named-entity types such as persons, organizations and locations (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).",
        "Proposed solutions to NER fall into three categories: 1) The rule-based (Krupka and Hausman, 1998); 2) the machine learning based (Finkel and Manning, 2009; Singh et al., 2010) ; and 3) hybrid methods (Jansche and Abney, 2002).",
        "With the availability of annotated corpora, such as ACE05, Enron (Minkov et al., 2005) and",
        "* This work has been done while the author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia.",
        "the data driven methods now become the dominating methods.",
        "However, current NER mainly focuses on formal text such as news articles (Mccallum and Li, 2003; Etzioni et al., 2005).",
        "Exceptions include studies on informal text such as emails, blogs, clinical notes (Wang, 2009).",
        "Because of the domain mismatch, current systems trained on non-tweets perform poorly on tweets, a new genre of text, which are short, informal, ungrammatical and noise prone.",
        "For example, the average F1 of the Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005) , which is trained on the CoNLL03 shared task data set and achieves state-of-the-art performance on that task, drops from 90.8% (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) to 45.8% on tweets.",
        "Thus, building a domain specific NER for tweets is necessary, which requires a lot of annotated tweets or rules.",
        "However, manually creating them is tedious and prohibitively unaffordable.",
        "Proposed solutions to alleviate this issue include: 1) Domain adaption, which aims to reuse the knowledge of the source domain in a target domain.",
        "Two recent examples are Wu et al.",
        "(2009), which uses data that is informative about the target domain and also easy to be labeled to bridge the two domains, and Chiticariu et al.",
        "(2010), which introduces a high-level rule language, called NERL, to build the general and domain specific NER systems; and 2) semi-supervised learning, which aims to use the abundant unlabeled data to compensate for the lack of annotated data.",
        "Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) is one such example.",
        "Another challenge is the limited information in tweet.",
        "Two factors contribute to this difficulty.",
        "One is the tweet's informal nature, making conventional features such as part-of-speech (POS) and capitalization not reliable.",
        "The performance of current NLP tools drops sharply on tweets.",
        "For example, OpenNLP , the state-of-the-art POS tagger, gets only an accuracy of 74.0% on our test data set.",
        "The other is the tweet's short nature, leading to the excessive abbreviations or shorthand in tweets, and the availability of very limited context information.",
        "Tackling this challenge, ideally, requires adapting related NLP tools to fit tweets, or normalizing tweets to accommodate existing tools, both of which are hard tasks.",
        "We propose a novel NER system to address these challenges.",
        "Firstly, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based classifier is adopted to conduct word level classification, leveraging the similar and recently labeled tweets.",
        "Following the two-stage prediction aggregation methods (Krishnan and Manning, 2006), such pre-labeled results, together with other conventional features used by the state-of-the-art NER systems, are fed into a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) model, which conducts fine-grained tweet level NER.",
        "Furthermore, the KNN and CRF model are repeatedly retrained with an incrementally augmented training set, into which high confidently labeled tweets are added.",
        "Indeed, it is the combination of KNN and CRF under a semi-supervised learning framework that differentiates ours from the existing.",
        "Finally, following Lev Ratinov and Dan Roth (2009), 30 gazetteers are used, which cover common names, countries, locations, temporal expressions, etc.",
        "These gazetteers represent general knowledge across domains.",
        "The underlying idea of our method is to combine global evidence from KNN and the gazetteers with local contextual information, and to use common knowledge and unlabeled tweets to make up for the lack of training data.",
        "12,245 tweets are manually annotated as the test data set.",
        "Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baselines.",
        "It is also demonstrated that integrating KNN classified results into the CRF model and semi-supervised learning considerably boost the performance.",
        "Our contributions are summarized as follows.",
        "1.",
        "We propose to a novel method that combines a KNN classifier with a conventional CRF based labeler under a semi-supervised learning framework to combat the lack of information in tweet and the unavailability of training data.",
        "2.",
        "We evaluate our method on a human annotated data set, and show that our method outperforms the baselines and that both the combination with KNN and the semi-supervised learning strategy are effective.",
