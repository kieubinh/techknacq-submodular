        "Word alignment is an important subtask in statistical machine translation which is typically solved in one of two ways.",
        "The more common approach uses a generative translation model that relates bilingual string pairs using a latent alignment variable to designate which source words (or phrases) generate which target words.",
        "The parameters in these models can be learned straightforwardly from parallel sentences using EM, and standard inference techniques can recover most probable alignments (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "This approach is attractive because it only requires parallel training data.",
        "An alternative to the generative approach uses a discriminatively trained alignment model to predict word alignments in the parallel corpus.",
        "Discriminative models are attractive because they can incorporate arbitrary, overlapping features, meaning that errors observed in the predictions made by the model can be addressed by engineering new and better features.",
        "Unfortunately, both approaches are problematic, but in different ways.",
        "In the case of discriminative alignment models, manual alignment data is required for training, which is problematic for at least three reasons.",
        "Manual alignments are notoriously difficult to create and are available only for a handful of language pairs.",
        "Second, manual alignments impose a commitment to a particular preprocessing regime; this can be problematic since the optimal segmentation for translation often depends on characteristics of the test set or size of the available training data (Habash and Sadat, 2006) or may be constrained by requirements of other processing components, such parsers.",
        "Third, the \"correct\" alignment annotation for different tasks may vary: for example, relatively denser or sparser alignments may be optimal for different approaches to (downstream) translation model induction (Lopez, 2008; Fraser, 2007).",
        "Generative models have a different limitation: the joint probability of a particular setting of the random variables must factorize according to steps in a process that successively \"generates\" the values of the variables.",
        "At each step, the probability of some value being generated may depend only on the generation history (or a subset thereof), and the possible values a variable will take must form a locally normalized conditional probability distribution (CPD).",
        "While these locally normalized CPDs may be pa rameterized so as to make use of multiple, overlapping features (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010), the requirement that models factorize according to a particular generative process imposes a considerable restriction on the kinds of features that can be incorporated.",
        "When Brown et al.",
        "(1993) wanted to incorporate a fertility model to create their Models 3 through 5, the generative process used in Models 1 and 2 (where target words were generated one by one from source words independently of each other) had to be abandoned in favor of one in which each source word had to first decide how many targets it would generate.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a discriminatively trained, globally normalized log-linear model of lexical translation that can incorporate arbitrary, overlapping features, and use it to infer word alignments.",
        "Our model enjoys the usual benefits of discriminative modeling (e.g., parameter regularization, well-understood learning algorithms), but is trained entirely from parallel sentences without gold-standard word alignments.",
        "Thus, it addresses the two limitations of current word alignment approaches.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "We begin by introducing our model (§2), and follow this with a discussion of tractability, parameter estimation, and inference using finite-state techniques (§3).",
        "We then describe the specific features we used (§4) and provide experimental evaluation of the model, showing substantial improvements in three diverse language pairs (§5).",
        "We conclude with an analysis of related prior work (§6) and a general discussion (§8)."

        "Under some reasonable assumptions (a finite target vocabulary Q and that all 9k < oo), the partition function Ze (s, n) will always take on finite values, guaranteeing that p(t, a | s, n) is a proper probability distribution.",

        "The model introduced in the previous section is extremely general, and it can incorporate features sensitive to any imaginable aspects of a sentence pair and their alignment, from linguistically inspired (e.g., an indicator feature for whether both the source and target sentences contain a verb), to the mundane (e.g., the probability of the sentence pair and alignment under Model 1), to the absurd (e.g., an indicator if s and t are palindromes of each other).",
        "However, while our model can make use of arbitrary, overlapping features, when designing feature functions it is necessary to balance expressiveness and the computational complexity of the inference algorithms used to reason under models that incorporate these features.",
        "To understand this tradeoff, we assume that the random variables being modeled (t, a) are arranged into an undirected graph G such that the vertices represent the variables and the edges are specified so that the feature function H decomposes linearly over all the cliques C in G, where tC and aC are the components associated with subgraph C and h( ) is a local feature vector function.",
        "In general, exact inference is exponential in the width of tree-decomposition of G, but, given a fixed width, they can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming.",
        "For example, when the graph has a sequential structure, exact inference can be carried out using the familiar forward-backward algorithm (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Although our features look at more structure than this, they are designed to keep treewidth low, meaning exact inference is still possible with dynamic programming.",
        "Figure 1 gives a graphical representation of our model as well as the more familiar generative (directed) variants.",
        "The edge set in the depicted graph is determined by the features that we use (§4).",

        "L(0) = - E lQg E P<> (t, a I s,n)+ ß E iflfe I .",
        "Because of the li penalty, this objective is not everywhere differentiable, but the gradient with respect to the parameters of the log-likelihood term is as follows.",
        "To optimize L, we employ an online method that approximates li regularization and only depends on the gradient of the unregularized objective (Tsu-ruoka et al., 2009).",
        "This method is quite attractive since it is only necessary to represent the active features, meaning impractically large feature spaces can be searched provided the regularization strength is sufficiently high.",
        "Additionally, not only has this technique been shown to be very effective for optimizing convex objectives, but evidence suggests that the stochasticity of online algorithms often results in better solutions than batch optimizers for non-convex objectives (Liang and Klein, 2009).",
        "On account of the latent alignment variable in our model, L is non-convex (as is the likelihood objective of the generative variant).",
        "To choose the regularization strength ß and the initial learning rate no, we trained several models on a 10,000-sentence-pair subset of the French-English Hansards, and chose values that minimized the alignment error rate, as evaluated on a 447 sentence set of manually created alignments (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "For the remainder of the experiments, we use the values we obtained, ß = 0.4 and n0 = 0.3.",
        "We now describe how to use weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to compute the quantities necessary for training.",
        "We begin by describing the ideal WFSA representing the full translation search space, which we call the discriminative neighborhood, and then discuss strategies for reducing its size in the next section, since the full model is prohibitively large, even with small data sets.",
        "For each training instance (s, t), the contribution to the gradient (Equation 1) is the difference in two vectors of expectations.",
        "The first term is the expected value of H( ) when observing (s, n, t) and letting a range over all possible alignments.",
        "The second is the expectation of the same function, but observing only (s, n) and letting t' and a take on any possible values (i.e., all possible translations of length n and all their possible alignments to s).",
        "To compute these expectations, we can construct a WFSA representing the discriminative neighborhood, the set Qn x [0, m]n, such that every path from the start state to goal yields a pair (t', a) with weight",

        "We then intersect the WFSA with an unweighted FSA representing the target sentence t (because of the restricted structure of our WFSA, this amounts to removing edges), and finally run the forward-backward algorithm on the resulting WFSA to compute the first expectation.",

        "Feature engineering lets us encode knowledge about what aspects of a translation derivation are useful in predicting whether it is good or not.",
        "In this section we discuss the features we used in our model.",
        "Many of these were taken from the discriminative alignment modeling literature, but we also note that our features can be much more fine-grained than those used in supervised alignment modeling, since we learn our models from a large amount of parallel data, rather than a small number of manual alignments.",
        "Word association features.",
        "Word association features are at the heart of all lexical translation models, whether generative or discriminative.",
        "In addition to fine-grained boolean indicator features (saj,tj) for pair types, we have several orthographic features: identity, prefix identity, and an orthographic similarity measure designed to be informative for predicting the translation of named entities in languages that use similar alphabets.",
        "It has the property that source-target pairs of long words that are similar are given a higher score than word pairs that are short and similar (dissimilar pairs have a score near zero, regardless of length).",
        "We also include \"global\" association scores that are precomputed by looking at the full training data: Dice's coefficient (discretized), which we use to measure association strength between pairs of source and target word types across sentence pairs (Dice, 1945), IBM Model 1 forward and reverse probabilities, and the geometric mean of the Model 1 forward and reverse probabilities.",
        "Finally, we also cluster the source and target vocabularies (Och, 1999) and include class pair indicator features, which can learn generalizations that, e.g., \"nouns tend to translate into nouns but not modal verbs.\"",
        "Positional features.",
        "Following Blunsom and Cohn (2006), we include features indicating closeness to the alignment matrix diagonal,",
        "We also conjoin this feature with the source word class type indicator to enable the model to learn that certain word types are more or less likely to favor a location on the diagonal (e.g. Urdu's sentence-final verbs).",
        "Source features.",
        "Some words are functional elements that fulfill purely grammatical roles and should not be the \"source\" of a translation.",
        "For example, Romance languages require a preposition in the formation of what could be a noun-noun compound in English, thus, it may be useful to learn not to translate certain words (i.e. they should not participate in alignment links), or to have a bias to translate others.",
        "To capture this intuition we include an indicator feature that fires each time a source vocabulary item (and source word class) participates in an alignment link.",
        "Source path features.",
        "One class of particularly useful features assesses the goodness of the alignment 'path' through the source sentence (Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "Although assessing the predicted path requires using nonlocal features, since each cj G [0, m] and m is relatively small, features can be sensitive to a wider context than is often practical.",
        "We use many overlapping source path features, some of which are sensitive to the distance and direction of the jump between aj_1 and cj, and others which are sensitive to the word pair these two points define, and others that combine all three elements.",
        "The features we use include a discretized jump distance, the discretized jump conjoined with an indicator feature for the target length n, the dis-cretized jump feature conjoined with the class of saj, and the discretized jump feature conjoined with the class of saj and saj-1.",
        "To discretize the features we take a log transform (base 1.3) of the jump width and let an indicator feature fire for the closest integer.",
        "In addition to these distance-dependent features, we also include indicator features that fire on bigrams (saj-1, saj ) and their word classes.",
        "Thus, this feature can capture our intuition that, e.g., adjectives are more likely to come before or after a noun in different languages.",
        "Target string features.",
        "Features sensitive to multiple values in the predicted target string or latent alignment variable must be handled carefully for the sake of computational tractability.",
        "While features that look at multiple source words can be computed linearly in the number of source words considered (since the source string is always observable), features that look at multiple target words require exponential time and space!",
        "However, by grouping the tj's into coarse equivalence classes and looking at small numbers of variables, it is possible to incorporate such features.",
        "We include a feature that fires when a word translates as itself (for example, a name or a date, which occurs in languages that share the same alphabet) in position j, but then is translated again (as something else) in position j – 1 or j + 1."

        "These pairs were selected since each poses different alignment challenges (word order in Chinese and Urdu, morphological complexity in Czech, and a non-alphabetic writing system in Chinese), and confining ourselves to these relatively small corpora reduced the engineering overhead of getting an implementation up and running.",
        "Future work will explore the scalability characteristics and limits of the model.",
        "For each language pair, we train two log-linear translation models as described above (§3), once with English as the source and once with English as the target language.",

        "One is the average alignment \"fertility\" of source words that occur only a single time in the training data (so-called hapax legomena).",
        "This assesses the impact of a typical alignment problem observed in generative models trained to maximize likelihood: infrequent source words act as \"garbage collectors\", with many target words aligned to them (the word dislike in the Model 4 alignment in Figure 2 is an example).",
        "Thus, we expect lower values of this measure to correlate with better alignments.",
        "The second measure is the number of rule types learned in the grammar induction process used for translation that match the translation test sets.",
        "While neither a decrease in the average singleton fertility nor an increase in the number of rules induced guarantees better alignment quality, we believe it is reasonable to assume that they are positively correlated.",
        "For the translation experiments in each language pair, we make use of the cdec decoder (Dyer et al., 2010), inducing a hierarchical phrase based translation grammar from two sets of symmetrized alignments using the method described by Chiang (2007).",
        "Additionally, recent work that has demonstrated that extracting rules from n-best alignments has value (Liu et al., 2009; Venugopal et al., 2008).",
        "We therefore define a third condition where rules are extracted from the corpus under both the Model 4 and discriminative alignments and merged to form a single grammar.",

        "In the training data, many of the sentences are questions directed to a second person, you.",
        "However, Chinese questions do not invert and the subject remains in the canonical first position, thus the transition from the start of sentence to you is highly weighted.",
        "Finally, Figure 2 illustrates how Model 4 (left) and our discriminative model (right) align an English-Urdu sentence pair (the English side is being conditioned on in both models).",
        "A reflex of Urdu's head-final word order is seen in the list of most highly weighted bigrams, where a path through the English source where verbs that transition to end-of-sentence periods are predictive of good translations into Urdu.",
