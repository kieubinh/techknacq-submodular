        "The NEWS10 data sets are extracted Wikipedia InterLanguage Links (WIL) which consist of parallel phrases, whereas a parallel corpus consists of parallel sentences.",

        "where Qo, Qk+1 are set to a special boundary symbol.",
        "N-gram models of order > 1 did not work well because these models tended to learn noise (information from non-transliteration pairs) in the training data.",
        "For our experiments, we only trained g2p with the unigram model.",
        "In test mode, we look for the best sequence of multigrams given a fixed source and target string and return the probability of this sequence.",

        "We build a phrase-based MT system for transliteration using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "We also tried using g2p for implementing the transliteration decoder but found Moses to perform better.",
        "Moses has the advantage of using Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) which optimizes transliteration accuracy rather than the likelihood of the training data as g2p does.",
        "The training data contains more non-transliteration pairs than transliteration pairs.",
        "We don't want to maximize the likelihood of the non-transliteration pairs.",

        "We build the LM on the target word types in the data to be filtered.",
        "For training Moses as a transliteration system, we treat each word pair as if it were a parallel sentence, by putting spaces between the characters of each word.",

        "The distortion limit \"d\" is set to zero (no reordering).",
