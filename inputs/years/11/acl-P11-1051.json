      "text": [
        "The coherence and readability of citation-based summaries are impeded by several factors.",
        "First, many citation sentences cite multiple papers besides the target.",
        "For example, the following is a citation sentence that appeared in the NLP literature and talked about Resnik's (1999) work.",
        "(1) Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the web to generate corpora for languages where electronic resources are scarce, while Resnik (1999) describes a method for mining the web for bilingual texts.",
        "The first fragment of this sentence describes different work other than Resnik's.",
        "The contribution of Resnik is mentioned in the underlined fragment.",
        "Including the irrelevant fragments in the summary causes several problems.",
        "First, the aim of the summarization task is to summarize the contribution of the target paper using minimal text.",
        "These fragments take space in the summary while being irrelevant and less important.",
        "Second, including these fragments in the summary breaks the context and, hence, degrades the readability and confuses the reader.",
        "Third, the existence of irrelevant fragments in a sentence makes the ranking algorithm assign a low weight to it although the relevant fragment may cover an aspect of the paper that no other sentence covers.",
        "A second factor has to do with the ordering of the sentences included in the summary.",
        "For example, the following are two other citation sentences for",
        "Resnik (1999).",
        "(2) Mining the Web for bilingual text (Resnik, 1999) is not likely to provide sufficient quantities of high quality data.",
        "(3) Resnik (1999) addressed the issue of language identification for finding Web pages in the languages of interest.",
        "If these two sentences are to be included in the summary, the reasonable ordering would be to put the second sentence first.",
        "Thirdly, in some instances of citation sentences, the reference is not a syntactic constituent in the sentence.",
        "It is added just to indicate the existence of citation.",
        "For example, in sentence (2) above, the reference could be safely removed from the sentence without hurting its grammaticality.",
        "In other instances (e.g. sentence (3) above), the reference is a syntactic constituent of the sentence and removing it makes the sentence ungrammatical.",
        "However, in certain cases, the reference could be replaced with a suitable pronoun (i.e. he, she or they).",
        "This helps avoid the redundancy that results from repeating the author name(s) in every sentence.",
        "Finally, a significant number of citation sentences are not suitable for summarization (Teufel et al., 2006) and should be filtered out.",
        "The following sentences are two examples.",
        "(4) The two algorithms we employed in our dependency parsing model are the Eisner parsing (Eisner, 1996) and Chu-Lius algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965).",
        "(5) This type of model has been used by, among others, Eisner (1996).",
        "Sentence (4) appeared in a paper by Nguyen et al. (2007).",
        "It does not describe any aspect of Eisner's work, rather it informs the reader that Nguyen et al.",
        "used Eisner's algorithm in their model.",
        "There is no value in adding this sentence to the summary of Eisner's paper.",
        "Teufel (2007) reported that a significant number of citation sentences (67% of the sentences in her dataset) were of this type.",
        "Likewise, the comprehension of sentence (5) depends on knowing its context (i.e. its surrounding sentences).",
        "This sentence alone does not provide any valuable information about Eisner's paper and should not be added to the summary unless its context is extracted and included in the summary as well.",
        "In our approach, we address these issues to achieve the goal of improving the coherence and the readability of citation-based summaries."

        "In the first stage, the citation sentences are preprocessed to rule out the unsuitable sentences and the irrelevant fragments of sentences.",
        "In the second stage, a number of citation sentences that cover the various aspects of the paper are selected.",
        "In the last stage, the selected sentences are post-processed to enhance the readability of the summary.",
        "We describe the stages in the following three subsections.",
        "The aim of this stage is to determine which pieces of text (sentences or fragments of sentences) should be considered for selection in the next stage and which ones should be excluded.",
        "This stage involves three tasks: reference tagging, reference scope identification, and sentence filtering.",
        "A citation sentence contains one or more references.",
        "At least one of these references corresponds to the target paper.",
        "When writing scientific articles, authors usually use standard patterns to include pointers to their references within the text.",
        "We use pattern matching to tag such references.",
        "The reference to the target is given a different tag than the references to other papers.",
        "The following example shows a citation sentence with all the references tagged and the target reference given a different tag.",

        "In the previous section, we showed the importance of identifying the scope of the target reference; i.e. the fragment of the citation sentence that corresponds to the target paper.",
        "We define the scope of a reference as the shortest fragment of the citation sentence that contains the reference and could form a grammatical sentence if the rest of the sentence was removed.",
        "To find such a fragment, we use a simple yet adequate heuristic.",
        "We start by parsing the sentence using the link grammar parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1991).",
        "Since the parser is not trained on citation sentences, we replace the references with placeholders before passing the sentence to the parser.",
        "Figure 1 shows a portion of the parse tree for Sentence (1) (from Section 1).",
