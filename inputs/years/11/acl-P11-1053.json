        "Relation extraction is an important information extraction task in natural language processing (NLP), with many practical applications.",
        "The goal of relation extraction is to detect and characterize semantic relations between pairs of entities in text.",
        "For example, a relation extraction system needs to be able to extract an Employment relation between the entities US soldier and US in the phrase US soldier.",
        "Current supervised approaches for tackling this problem, in general, fall into two categories: feature based and kernel based.",
        "Given an entity pair and a sentence containing the pair, both approaches usually start with multiple level analyses of the sentence such as tokenization, partial or full syntactic parsing, and dependency parsing.",
        "Then the feature based method explicitly extracts a variety of lexical, syntactic and semantic features for statistical learning, either generative or discriminative (Miller et al., 2000; Kambhatla, 2004; Boschee et al., 2005; Grishman et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005; Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "In contrast, the kernel based method does not explicitly extract features; it designs kernel functions over the structured sentence representations (sequence, dependency or parse tree) to capture the similarities between different relation instances (Zelenko et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2008).",
        "Both lines of work depend on effective features, either explicitly or implicitly.",
        "The performance of a supervised relation extraction system is usually degraded by the sparsity of lexical features.",
        "For example, unless the example US soldier has previously been seen in the training data, it would be difficult for both the feature based and the kernel based systems to detect whether there is an Employment relation or not.",
        "Because the syntactic feature of the phrase US soldier is simply a noun-noun compound which is quite general, the words in it are crucial for extracting the relation.",
        "This motivates our work to use word clusters as additional features for relation extraction.",
        "The assumption is that even if the word soldier may never have been seen in the annotated Employment relation instances, other words which share the same cluster membership with soldier such as president and ambassador may have been observed in the Employment instances.",
        "The absence of lexical features can be compensated by the cluster features.",
        "Moreover, word clusters may implicitly correspond to different relation classes.",
        "For example, the cluster of president may be related to the Employment relation as in US president while the cluster of businessman may be related to the Affiliation relation as in US businessman.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: we explore the cluster-based features in a systematic way and propose several statistical methods for selecting effective clusters.",
        "We study the impact of the size of training data on cluster features and analyze the performance improvements through an extensive experimental study.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work and Section 3 provides the background of the relation extraction task and the word clustering algorithm.",

        "The training procedure can be extremely time consuming if we enumerate every possible |m|-combination of l , given that |m| can range from 1 to the size of l and the size of l equals the length of the longest bit string which is usually 20 when inducing 1,000 clusters using the Brown algorithm.",

        "For our purpose, C is the set of relation types, f is a cluster-based feature with a certain prefix length such as HM1_WC* where * means the prefix length and a value v is the prefix of the bit string representation of HM1.",

        "For example, we collapse the 3 types: HM1WC, HM2_WC and HM12 WC into a single type HM_WC for computing the IG.",
        "Prefix Coverage (PC): If we use a short prefix then the clusters produced correspond to the high branches in the word hierarchy and would be very general.",
        "The cluster features may not provide more informative information than the words themselves.",
        "Similarly, if we use a long prefix such as the length of the longest bit string, then maybe only a few of the lexical features can be covered by clusters.",
        "To capture this intuition, we define the PC of a prefix length i as below:",
        "county jl ) where f stands for a lexical feature such as HM1 and fc a cluster feature with prefix length i such as HM1_WCi, count (*) is the number of occurrences of that feature in training data.",
        "Similar to IG, we compute PC for a group of cluster features, not for each individual feature.",
        "In our experiments, the top 10 ranked prefix lengths based on IG and prefix lengths with PC values in the range [0.4, 0.9] were used.",
        "In addition to the above two statistical measures, for comparison, we introduce another two simple but extreme measures for the selection of clusters.",
