        "The indicator and argument words for the damage relation are highlighted.",
        "increasingly available in forms such as Wikipedia article categories, financial reports, and biographies.",
        "In contrast to previous work, our approach learns from domain-independent meta-constraints on relation expression, rather than supervision specific to particular relations and their instances.",
        "In particular, we leverage the linguistic intuition that documents in a single domain exhibit regularities in how they express their relations.",
        "These regularities occur both in the relations' lexical and syntactic realizations as well as at the level of document structure.",
        "For instance, consider the damage relation excerpted from earthquake articles in Figure 1.",
        "Lexically, we observe similar words in the instances and their contexts, such as \"destroying\" and \"houses.\"",
        "Syntactically, in two instances the relation instantiation is the dependency child of the word \"destroying.\"",
        "On the discourse level, these instances appear toward the beginning of their respective documents.",
        "In general, valid relations in many domains are characterized by these coherence properties.",
        "We capture these regularities using a Bayesian model where the underlying relations are represented as latent variables.",
        "The model takes as input a constituent-parsed corpus and explains how the constituents arise from the latent variables.",
        "Each relation instantiation is encoded by the variables as a relation-evoking indicator word (e.g., \"destroying\") and corresponding argument constituent (e.g., \"some homes\").",
        "Our approach capitalizes on relation regularity in two ways.",
        "First, the model's generative process encourages coherence in the local features and placement of relation instances.",
        "Second, we apply posterior regularization (Graca et al., 2007) during inference to enforce higher-level declarative constraints, such as requiring indicators and arguments to be syntactically linked.",
        "We evaluate our approach on two domains previously studied for high-level document structure analysis, news articles about earthquakes and financial markets.",

        "We give USP the required Stanford dependency format as input (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",
        "We find that the results are sensitive to the cluster granularity prior, so we tune this parameter and report the best-performing runs.",
        "We recognize that USP targets a different output representation than ours: a hierarchical semantic structure over the entirety of a dependency-parsed text.",
        "In contrast, we focus on discovering a limited number K of domain-relevant relations expressed as constituent phrases.",
        "Despite these differences, both methods ultimately aim to capture domain-specific relations expressed with varying verbalizations, and both operate over in-domain input corpora supplemented with syntactic information.",
        "For these reasons, USP provides a clear and valuable point of comparison.",
        "For this comparison, we transform USP's lambda calculus formulas to relation spans as follows.",
        "First, we group lambda forms by a combination of core form, argument form, and the parent's core form.",

        "Table 3's first two sections present the results of our main evaluation.",
        "For earthquake, the far more difficult domain, our base model with only the domain-independent constraints strongly outperforms all three baselines across both metrics.",
        "For finance, the CLUTO and USP baselines achieve performance comparable to or slightly better than our base model.",
        "Our approach, however, has the advantage of providing a formalism for seamlessly incorporating additional arbitrary domain-specific constraints.",
        "When we add such constraints (denoted as model+DSC), we achieve consistently higher performance than all baselines across both datasets and metrics, demonstrating that this approach provides a simple and effective framework for injecting domain knowledge into relation discovery.",
        "The first two baselines correspond to a setup where the number of sentence clusters K is set to the true number of relation types.",
        "This has the effect of lowering precision because each sentence must be assigned a cluster.",
        "To mitigate this impact, we experimented with using K + N clusters, with N ranging from 1 to 30.",
        "In each case, we then keep only the K largest clusters.",
        "For the earthquake dataset, increasing N improves performance until some point, after which performance degrades.",
        "However, the best F-Score corresponding to the optimal number of clusters is 42.2, still far below our model's 66.0 F-score.",
        "For the finance domain, increasing the number of clusters hurts performance.",
        "Our results show a large gap in F-score between the sentence and token-level evaluations for both the USP baseline and our model.",
        "A qualitative analysis of the results indicates that our model often picks up on regularities that are difficult to distinguish without relation-specific supervision.",
        "For earthquake, a location may be annotated as \"the Philippine island of Mindoro\" while we predict just the word \"Min-doro.\"",
        "For finance, an index change can be annotated as \"30 points, or 0.8 percent,\" while our model identifies \"30 points\" and \"0.8 percent\" as separate relations.",
        "In practice, these outputs are all plausible discoveries, and a practitioner desiring specific outputs could impose additional constraints to guide relation discovery toward them.",
        "The Impact of Constraints To understand the impact of the declarative constraints, we perform an ablation analysis on the constraint sets.",
        "We consider removing the constraints on syntactic patterns (no-syn) and the constraints disallowing relations to overlap (no-sep) from the full domain-independent model.",
        "We also try a version with hard syntactic constraints (hard-syn), which requires that every extraction match one of the three syntactic patterns specified by the syntactic constraint.",
        "Table 3's bottom section presents the results of this evaluation.",
        "The model's performance degrades when either of the two constraint sets are removed, demonstrating that the constraints are in fact beneficial for relation discovery.",
        "Additionally, in the hard-syn case, performance drops dramatically for finance",
        "Table 3: Top section: our model, with and without domain-specific constraints (DSC).",
        "Middle section: The three baselines.",
        "Bottom section: ablation analysis of constraint sets for our model.",
        "For all scores, higher is better.",
        "while remaining almost unchanged for earthquake.",
        "This suggests that formulating constraints as soft inequalities on posterior expectations gives our model the flexibility to accommodate both the underlying signal in the data and the declarative constraints.",
        "Comparison against Supervised CRF Our final set of experiments compares a semi-supervised version of our model against a conditional random field (CRF) model.",
        "The CRF model was trained using the same features as our model's argument features.",
        "To incorporate training examples in our model, we simply treat annotated relation instances as observed variables.",
        "For both the baselines and our model, we experiment with using up to 10 annotated documents.",
        "At each of those levels of supervision, we average results over 10 randomly drawn training sets.",
        "At the sentence level, our model compares very favorably to the supervised CRF.",
        "For finance, it takes at least 10 annotated documents (corresponding to roughly 130 annotated relation instances) for the CRF to match the semi-supervised model's performance.",
        "For earthquake, using even 10 annotated documents (about 71 relation instances) is not sufficient to match our model's performance.",
        "At the token level, the supervised CRF baseline is far more competitive.",
        "Using a single labeled document (13 relation instances) yields superior performance to either of our model variants for finance, while four labeled documents (29 relation instances) do the same for earthquake.",
        "This result is not surprising – our model makes strong domain-independent assumptions about how underlying patterns of regularities in the text connect to relation expression.",
        "Without domain-specific supervision such assumptions are necessary, but they can prevent the model from fully utilizing available labeled instances.",
        "Moreover, being able to annotate even a single document requires a broad understanding of every relation type germane to the domain, which can be infeasible when there are many unfamiliar, complex domains to process.",
        "In light of our strong sentence-level performance, this suggests a possible human-assisted application: use our model to identify promising relation-bearing sentences in a new domain, then have a human annotate those sentences for use by a supervised approach to achieve optimal token-level extraction."
