        "Whereas philosophers and linguists have proposed several theories, along with models to represent the meaning of text, the field of computational linguistics is still far from doing this automatically.",
        "The ambiguity of language, the need to detect implicit knowledge, and the demand for common-sense knowledge and reasoning are a few of the difficulties to overcome.",
        "Substantial progress has been made, though, especially on detection of semantic relations, ontologies and reasoning methods.",
        "Negation is present in all languages and it is always the case that statements are affirmative by default.",
        "Negation is marked and it typically signals something unusual or an exception.",
        "It may be present in all units of language, e.g., words {incredible), clauses {He doesnf have friends).",
        "Negation and its correlates (truth values, lying, irony, false or contradictory statements) are exclusive characteristics of humans (Horn, 1989; Horn and Kato, 2000).",
        "Negation is fairly well-understood in grammars; the valid ways to express a negation are documented.",
        "However, there has not been extensive research on detecting it, and more importantly, on representing the semantics of negation.",
        "Negation has been largely ignored within the area of semantic relations.",
        "At first glance, one would think that interpreting negation could be reduced to finding negative keywords, detect their scope using syntactic analysis and reverse its polarity.",
        "Actually, it is more complex.",
        "Negation plays a remarkable role in text understanding and it poses considerable challenges.",
        "Detecting the scope of negation in itself is challenging: All vegetarians do not eat meat means that vegetarians do not eat meat and yet All that glitters is not gold means that it is not the case that all that glitters is gold (so out of all things that glitter, some are gold and some are not).",
        "In the former example, the universal quantifier all has scope over the negation; in the latter, the negation has scope over all.",
        "In logic, two negatives always cancel each other out.",
        "On the other hand, in language this is only theoretically the case: she is not unhappy does not mean that she is happy; it means that she is not fully unhappy, but she is not happy either.",
        "Some negated statements carry a positive implicit meaning.",
        "For example, cows do not eat meat implies that cows eat something other than meat.",
        "Otherwise, the speaker would have stated cows do not eat.",
        "A clearer example is the correct and yet puzzling statement tables do not eat meat.",
        "This sentence sounds unnatural because of the underlying positive statement (i.e., tables eat something other than meat).",
        "Negation can express less than or in between when used in a scalar context.",
        "For example, John does not have three children probably means that he has either one or two children.",
        "Contrasts may use negation to disagree about a statement and not to negate it, e.g., That place is not big, it is massive defines the place as massive, and therefore, big."
