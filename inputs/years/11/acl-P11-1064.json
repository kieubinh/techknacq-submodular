        "The training of translation models for phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems (Koehn et al., 2003) takes unaligned bilingual training data as input, and outputs a scored table of phrase pairs.",
        "This phrase table is traditionally generated by going through a pipeline of two steps, first generating word (or minimal phrase) alignments, then extracting a phrase table that is consistent with these alignments.",
        "However, as DeNero and Klein (2010) note, this two step approach results in word alignments that are not optimal for the final task of generating phrase tables that are used in translation.",
        "As a solution to this, they proposed a supervised discriminative model that performs joint word alignment and phrase extraction, and found that joint estimation of word alignments and extraction sets improves both word alignment accuracy and translation results.",
        "In this paper, we propose the first unsupervised approach to joint alignment and extraction of phrases at multiple granularities.",
        "This is achieved by constructing a generative model that includes phrases at many levels of granularity, from minimal phrases all the way up to full sentences.",
        "The model is similar to previously proposed phrase alignment models based on inversion transduction grammars (ITGs) (Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009), with one important change: ITG symbols and phrase pairs are generated in the opposite order.",
        "In traditional ITG models, the branches of a biparse tree are generated from a nonterminal distribution, and each leaf is generated by a word or phrase pair distribution.",
        "As a result, only minimal phrases are directly included in the model, while larger phrases must be generated by heuristic extraction methods.",
        "In the proposed model, at each branch in the tree, we first attempt to generate a phrase pair from the phrase pair distribution, falling back to ITG-based divide and conquer strategy to generate phrase pairs that do not exist (or are given low probability) in the phrase distribution.",
        "We combine this model with the Bayesian non-parametric Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997; Teh, 2006), realizing ITG-based divide and conquer through a novel formulation where the Pitman-Yor process uses two copies of itself as a base measure.",
        "As a result of this modeling strategy, phrases of multiple granularities are generated, and thus memorized, by the Pitman-Yor process.",
        "This makes it possible to directly use probabilities of the phrase model as a replacement for the phrase table generated by heuristic extraction techniques.",
        "Using this model, we perform machine translation experiments over four language pairs.",
        "We observe that the proposed joint phrase alignment and extraction approach is able to meet or exceed results attained by a combination of GIZA++ and heuristic phrase extraction with significantly smaller phrase table size.",
        "We also find that it achieves superior BLEU scores over previously proposed ITG-based phrase alignment approaches."

        "This is the first reported result in which an unsupervised phrase alignment model has built a phrase table directly from model probabilities and achieved results that compare to heuristic phrase extraction.",
        "It can also be seen that the phrase table created by the proposed method is approximately 5 times smaller than that obtained by the traditional pipeline.",
        "In addition, HIER significantly outperforms FLAT when using the model probabilities.",
        "This confirms that phrase tables containing only minimal phrases are not able to achieve results that compete with phrase tables that use multiple granularities.",
        "Somewhat surprisingly, HLEN consistently slightly underperforms HIER.",
        "This indicates potential gains to be provided by length-based parameter tuning were outweighed by losses due to the increased complexity of the model.",
        "In particular, we believe the necessity to combine probabilities from multiple Pt>l models into a single phrase table may have resulted in a distortion of the phrase probabilities.",

        "It can also be seen that combining phrase tables from multiple samples improved the BLEU score for HLEN, but not for HIER.",
        "This suggests that for hier, most of the useful phrase pairs discovered by the model are included in every iteration, and the increased recall obtained by combining multiple samples does not consistently outweigh the increased confusion caused by the larger phrase table.",
        "We also evaluated the effectiveness of modelbased phrase extraction compared to heuristic phrase extraction.",
        "Using the alignments from HIER, we created phrase tables using model probabilities (MOD), and heuristic extraction on words (HEUR-W), blocks (HEUR-B), and minimal phrases (HEUR-P) as described in Section 5.",
        "The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3.",
        "It can be seen that model-based phrase extraction using hier outperforms or insignificantly underperforms heuristic phrase extraction over all experimental settings, while keeping the phrase table to a fraction of the size of most heuristic extraction methods.",
