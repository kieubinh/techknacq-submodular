        "Unsupervised induction of dependency parsers is a major NLP task that attracts a substantial amount of research (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen et al., 2008; Headden et al., 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a; Gillenwater et al., 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010; Blunsom and Cohn, 2010, inter alia).",
        "Parser quality is usually evaluated by comparing its output to a gold standard whose annotations are linguistically motivated.",
        "However, there are cases in which there is no linguistic consensus as to what the correct annotation is (Kubler et al., 2009).",
        "Examples include which verb is the head in a verb group structure (e.g., \"can\" or \"eat\" in \"can eat\"), and which",
        "* Omri Abend is grateful to the Azrieli Foundation for the award of an Azrieli Fellowship.",
        "noun is the head in a sequence ofproper nouns (e.g., annotations as (linguistically) problematic.",
        "For such cases, evaluation measures should not punish the algorithm for deviating from the gold standard.",
        "In this paper we show that the evaluation measures reported in current works are highly sensitive to the annotation in problematic cases, and propose a simple new measure that greatly neutralizes the problem.",
        "We start from the following observation: for three leading algorithms (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set (at most 18 out of a few thousands) of parameters can be found whose modification dramatically improves the standard evaluation measures (the attachment score measure by 9.3-15.1%, and the undirected measure by a smaller but still significant 1.3-7.7%).",
        "The phenomenon is implementation independent, occurring with several algorithms based on a fundamental probabilistic dependency model .",
        "We show that these parameter changes can be mapped to edge direction changes in local structures in the dependency graph, and that these correspond to problematic annotations.",
        "Thus, the standard evaluation measures do not reflect the true quality of the evaluated algorithm.",
        "We explain why the standard undirected evaluation measure is in fact sensitive to such edge direction changes, and present a new evaluation measure, Neutral Edge Direction (ned), which greatly alleviates the problem by ignoring the edge direction in local structures.",
        "Using ned, manual modifications of model parameters always yields small performance differences.",
        "Moreover, ned sometimes punishes such manual parameter tweaking by yielding worse results.",
        "We explain this behavior using an experiment revealing that n ed always prefers the structures that are more consistent with the modeling assumptions lying in the basis of the algorithm.",
        "When manual parameter modification is done against this preference, the ned results decrease.",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows.",
        "First, we show the impact of a small number of annotation decisions on the performance of unsupervised dependency parsers.",
        "Second, we observe that often these decisions are linguistically controversial and therefore this impact is misleading.",
        "This reveals a problem in the common evaluation of unsupervised dependency parsing.",
        "This is further demonstrated by noting that recent papers evaluate the task using three gold standards which differ in such decisions and which yield substantially different results.",
        "Third, we present the ned measure, which is agnostic to errors arising from choosing the non-gold direction in such cases.",

        "We start with a few definitions.",
        "Consider Figure 1(a) that shows a dependency structure on the words w1,w2,w3.",
        "Edge flipping (henceforth, edge-flip) the edge w2^w1 is the following modification of a parse tree: (1) setting w2's parent as w1 (instead of the other way around), and (2) setting w1 's parent as w3 (instead of the edge w3^w2).",
        "Figure 1(b) shows the dependency structure after the edge-flip.",
        "Note that (1) imposes setting a new parent to w2, as otherwise it would have had no parent.",

        "Since unsupervised dependency parsers are generally structure prediction models, the predictions of the parse edges are not independent.",

        "This is reflected by a high value of Pattach(TO\\VB,L), a low value of Pattach (VB \\TO, R), since \"to\" tends to be a left dependent of the verb and not the other way around, and a low value of PSTOP(VB, L,N), as the verb usually has at least one left argument (i.e., \"to\").",

        "On the other hand, w3 is assigned w2's gold parent, w1.",
        "This is considered an error, since w1 is neither w3's gold parent (as it is w2), nor its gold child.",

        "Consider again Figure 3, where we assume that 3(a) is the gold standard and that 3(b) is the induced parse.",
        "Much like undirected evaluation, ned will mark the attachment of w2 as correct, since its induced parent is its gold child.",
        "However, unlike undirected evaluation, w3's induced attachment will also be marked as correct, as its induced parent is its gold grandparent.",
        "Now consider another induced parse in which the direction of the edge between w2 and w3 is switched and the w3's parent is set to be some other word, w4 (Figure 3(c)).",
        "This should be marked as an error, even if the direction of the edge between w2 and w3 is controversial, since the structure [w2,w3] is no longer a dependent of w1.",
        "It is indeed a ned error.",
        "Note that undirected evaluation gives the parses in Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c) the same score, while if the structure [w2,w3] is problematic, there is a major difference in their correctness.",
        "Discussion.",
        "Problematic structures are ubiquitous, with more than 40% of the tokens in PTB WSJ appearing in at least one of them (see Section 3).",
        "Therefore, even a substantial difference in the attachment between two parsers is not necessarily indicative of a true quality difference.",
        "However, an attachment score difference that persists under ned is an indication of a true quality difference, since generally problematic structures are local (i.e., obtained by an edge-flip) and ned ignores such errors.",
        "Reporting ned alone is insufficient, as obviously the edge direction does matter in some cases.",
        "For example, in adjective-noun structures (e.g., \"big house\"), the correct edge direction is widely agreed upon (\"big'Whouse\") (Kübler et al., 2009), and thus choosing the wrong direction should be considered an error.",
        "Therefore, we suggest evaluating using both ned and attachment score in order to get a full picture of the parser's performance.",
        "A possible criticism on ned is that it is only indifferent to alternative annotations in structures of size 2 (e.g., \"to eat\") and does not necessarily handle larger problematic structures, such as coordinations",
