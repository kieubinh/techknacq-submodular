        "This paper presents a model of disfluency detection based on the noisy channel framework, which/ specifically targets the repair disfluencies.",

        "The largest available language models are based on written text: we investigate the effect of written text language models as opposed to language models based on speech transcripts.",
        "Second, we develop a new set of reranker features explicitly designed to capture important properties of speech repairs.",
        "Many of these features are lexically grounded and provide a large performance increase.",
        "Third, we utilise a loss function, approximate expected f-score, that explicitly targets the asymmetric evaluation metrics used in the disfluency detection task.",
        "We explain how to optimise this loss function, and show that this leads to a marked improvement in disfluency detection.",
        "This is consistent with Jansche (2005) and Smith and Eisner (2006), who observed similar improvements when using approximate f-score loss for other problems.",
        "Similarly we introduce a loss function based on the edit-f-score in our domain.",

        "We built language models from a variety of speech and non-speech corpora, and examine the effect they have on disfluency detection.",
        "We use language models derived from different larger corpora effectively in a maximum reranker setting.",
        "We show that the actual choice for a language model seems to be less relevant and newswire text can be used equally well for modelling fluent speech.",
        "We describe different features to improve disflu-ency detection even further.",
        "Especially these features seem to boost performance significantly.",
        "Finally we investigate the effect of different loss functions.",
        "We observe that using a loss function directly optimising our interest yields a performance increase which is at least at large as the effect of using very large language models.",
        "We obtained an f-score which outperforms other models reported in literature operating on identical7 data, even though we use vastly fewer features than others do."
