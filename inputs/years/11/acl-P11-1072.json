        "Hybrid word/sub-word recognizers can produce a sequence of sub-word units in place of OOV words.",
        "Ideally, the recognizer outputs a complete word for in-vocabulary (IV) utterances, and sub-word units for OOVs.",

        "As an uncommon English word, it is unlikely to be in the vocabulary of an English recognizer.",
        "While a LVCSR system would output the closest known words (e.x.",
        "\"slow it dawn\"), a hybrid system could output a sequence of multi-phoneme units: s_l_ow, b_ax, d_ae_n.",
        "The latter is more useful for automatically recovering the word's orthographic form, identifying that an OOV was spoken, or improving performance of a spoken term detection system with OOV queries.",
        "In fact, hybrid systems have improved OOV spoken term detection (Mamou et al., 2007; Parada et al., 2009), achieved better phone error rates, especially in OOV regions (Rastrow et al., 2009b), and obtained state-of-the-art performance for OOV detection (Parada et al., 2010).",
        "Hybrid recognizers vary in a number of ways: sub-word unit type: variable-length phoneme units (Rastrow et al., 2009a; Bazzi and Glass, 2001) or joint letter sound sub-words (Bisani and Ney, 2005); unit creation: data-driven or linguistically motivated (Choueiter, 2009); and how they are incorporated in LVCSR systems: hierarchical (Bazzi, 2002) or flat models (Bisani and Ney, 2005).",
        "In this work, we consider how to optimally create sub-word units for a hybrid system.",
        "These units are variable-length phoneme sequences, although in principle our work can be use for other unit types.",

        "These units typically represent the most frequent phoneme sequences in English words.",

        "We can see that the proposed system increases the Hits by over 8% absolute, while increasing the False Alarms by 0.3%.",
        "Interestingly, the average sub-word length for the proposed units exceeded that of the baseline units by 0.3 phones (Baseline 5K average length was 2.92, while that of This Paper 5K was 3.2).",

        "Similar to Broadcast News results, we found that the learned sub-words provide larger coverage of OOV regions in MIT Lectures domain.",
        "These results suggest that the proposed sub-words are not simply modeling the training OOVs (named-entities) better than the baseline sub-words, but also describe better novel unexpected words.",
        "Furthermore, including context features does not seem as helpful.",
        "We conjecture that this is due to the higher WER and the less structured nature of the domain: i.e. ungrammatical sentences, disfluencies, incomplete sentences, making it more difficult to predict OOVs based on context.",
