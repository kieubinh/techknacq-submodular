        "This paper focuses on identifying, extracting and evaluating features related to syntactic complexity of spontaneous spoken responses as part of an effort to expand the current feature set of an automated speech scoring system in order to cover additional aspects considered important in the construct of communicative competence.",
        "Our goal is to find effective features, selected from a large set of features proposed previously and some new features designed in analogous ways from a syntactic complexity perspective that correlate well with human ratings of the same spoken responses, and to build automatic scoring models based on the most promising features by using machine learning methods.",
        "On human transcriptions with manually annotated clause and sentence boundaries, our best scoring model achieves an overall Pearson correlation with human rater scores of r=0.49 on an unseen test set, whereas correlations of models using sentence or clause boundaries from automated classifiers are around r=0.2."

        "Past efforts directed at automated scoring of speech have used mainly features related to fluency (e.g., speaking rate, length and distribution of pauses), pronunciation (e.g., using log-likelihood scores from the acoustic model of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system), or prosody (e.g., information related to pitch contours or syllable stress) (e.g., Bernstein, 1999; Bernstein et al., 2000; Bernstein et al., 2010; Cucchiarini et al., et al., 2009).",
        "While this approach is a good match to most of the important properties related to low entropy speech (i.e., speech which is highly predictable), such as reading a passage aloud, it lacks many important aspects of spontaneous speech which are relevant to be evaluated both by a human rater and an automated scoring system.",
        "Examples of such aspects of speech, which are considered part of the construct of \"communicative competence (Bach-man, 1990), include grammatical accuracy, syntactic complexity, vocabulary diversity, and aspects of spoken discourse structure, e.g., coherence and cohesion.",
        "These different aspects of speaking proficiency are often highly correlated in a non-native speaker (Xi and Mollaun, 2006; Bernstein et al., 2010), and so scoring models built solely on features of fluency and pronunciation may achieve reasonably high correlations with holistic human rater scores.",
        "However, it is important to point out that such systems would still be unable to assess many important aspects of the speaking construct and therefore cannot be seen as ideal from a validity point of view.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to address one of these important aspects of spoken language in more detail, namely syntactic complexity.",
        "This paper can be seen as a first step toward including features related to this part of the speaking construct into an already existing automated speech scoring system for spontaneous speech which so far mostly uses features related to fluency and pronunciation (Zechner et al., 2009).",
        "We use data from the speaking section of the TOEFLÂ® Practice Online (TPO) test, which is a low stakes practice test for non-native speakers where they are asked to provide six spontaneous speech samples of about one minute in length each in response to a variety of prompts.",
        "Some prompts may be simple questions, and others may involve reading or listening to passages first and then answering related questions.",
        "All responses were scored holistically by human raters according to predefined scoring rubrics (i.e., specific scoring guidelines) on a scale of 1 to 4, 4 being the highest proficiency level.",
        "In our automated scoring system, the first component is an ASR system that decodes the digitized speech sample, generating a time-annotated hypothesis for every response.",
        "Next, fluency and pronunciation features are computed based on the ASR output hypotheses, and finally a multiple regression scoring model, trained on human rater scores, computes the score for a given spoken response (see Zechner et al.",
        "(2009) for more details).",
        "We conducted the study in three steps: (1) finding important measures of syntactic complexity from second language acquisition (SLA) and English language learning (ELL) literature, and extending this feature set based on our observations of the TPO data in analogous ways; (2) computing features based on transcribed speech responses and selecting features with highest correlations to human rater scores, also considering their comparative values for native speakers taking the same test; and (3) building scoring models for the selected subset of the features to generate a proficiency score for each speaker, using all six responses of that speaker.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we will address related work in syntactic complexity (Section 2), introduce the speech data sets of our study (Section 3), describe the methods we used for feature extraction (Section 4), provide the experiment design and results (Section 5), analyze and discuss the results in Section 6, before concluding the paper (Section 7)."

        "Syntactic complexity is defined as \"the range of forms that surface in language production and the degree of sophistication of such forms\" (Ortega, 2003).",
        "It is an important factor in the second language assessment construct as described in Bach-man's (1990) conceptual model of language ability, and therefore is often used as an index of language proficiency and development status of L2 learners.",
        "Various studies have proposed and investigated measures of syntactic complexity as well as examined its predictiveness for language proficiency, in both L2 writing and speaking settings, which will be reviewed respectively.",
        "Wolfe-Quintero et al.",
        "(1998) reviewed a number of grammatical complexity measures in L2 writing from thirty-nine studies, and their usage for predicting language proficiency was discussed.",
        "Some examples of syntactic complexity measures are: mean number of clauses per T-unit, mean length of clauses, mean number of verbs per sentence, etc.",
        "The various measures can be grouped into two categories: (1) clauses, sentences, and T-units in terms of each other; and (2) specific grammatical structures (e.g., passives, nominals) in relation to clauses, sentences, or T-units (Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998).",
        "Three primary methods of calculating syntactic complexity measures are frequency, ratio, and index, where frequency is the count of occurrences of a specific grammatical structure, ratio is the number of one type of unit divided by the total number of another unit, and index is computing numeric scores by specific formulae (Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998).",
        "For example, the measure \"mean number of clauses per T-unit\" is obtained by using the ratio calculation method and the clause and T-unit grammatical structures.",
        "Some structures such as clauses and T-units only need shallow linguistic processing to acquire, while some require parsing.",
        "There are numerous combinations for measures and we need empirical evidence to select measures with the highest performance.",
        "There have been a series of empirical studies examining the relationship of syntactic complexity measures to L2 proficiency using real-world data (Cooper, 1976; Larsen-Freeman, 1978; Perkins, 1980; Ho-Peng, 1983; Henry, 1996; Ortega, 2003; Lu, 2010).",
        "The studies investigate measures that highly correlate with proficiency levels or distinguish between different proficiency levels.",
        "Many T-unit related measures were identified as statistically significant indicators to L2 proficiency, such as mean length of T-unit (Henry, 1996; Lu, 2010), mean number of clauses per T-unit (Cooper, 1976; Lu, 2010), mean number of complex nominals per T-unit (Lu, 2010), or the mean number of error-free T-units per sentence (Ho-Peng, 1983).",
        "Other significant measures are mean length of clause (Lu, 2010), or frequency of passives in composition (Kameen, 1979).",
        "Speaking",
        "Syntactic complexity analysis in speech mainly inherits measures from the writing domain, and the abovementioned measures can be employed in the same way on speech transcripts for complexity computation.",
        "A series of studies have examined relations between the syntactic complexity of speech and the speakers' holistic speaking proficiency levels (Halleck, 1995; Bernstein et al., 2010; Iwashita, 2006).",
        "Three objective measures of syntactic complexity, including mean T-unit length, mean error-free T-unit length, and percent of error-free T-units were found to correlate with holistic evaluations of speakers in Halleck (1995).",
        "Iwashita's (2006) study on Japanese L2 speakers found that length-based complexity features (i.e., number of T-units and number of clauses per T-unit) are good predictors for oral proficiency.",
        "In studies directly employing syntactic complexity measures in other contexts, ratio-based measures are frequently used.",
        "Examples are mean length of utterance (Condouris et al., 2003), word count or tree depth (Roll et al., 2007), or mean length of T-units and mean number of clauses per T-unit (Bernstein et al., 2010).",
        "Frequency-based measures were used less, such as number of full phrases in",
        "Roll et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "The speaking output is usually less clean than writing data (e.g., considering disfluencies such as false starts, repetitions, filled pauses etc.).",
        "Therefore we may need to remove these disfluencies first before computing syntactic complexity features.",
        "Also, importantly, ASR output does not contain interpunctuation but both for sentential-based features as well as for parser-based features, the boundaries of clauses and sentences need to be known.",
        "For this purpose, we will use automated classifiers that are trained to predict clause and sentence boundaries, as described in Chen et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "With previous studies providing us a rich pool of complexity features, additionally we also develop features analogous to the ones from the literature, mostly by using different calculation methods.",
        "For instance, the frequency of Prepositional Phrases (PPs) is a feature from the literature, and we add some variants such as number of PPs per clause as a new feature to our extended feature set.",
        "Through this literature review, we identified some important features that were frequently used in previous studies in both L2 speaking and writing, such as length of sentences and number of clauses per sentence.",
        "In addition, we also collected candidate features that were less frequently mentioned in the literature, in order to start with a larger field of potential candidate features.",
        "We further extended the feature set by inspecting our data, described in the following section, and created suitable additional features by means of analogy.",
        "This process resulted in a set of 91 features, 11 of which are related to clausal and sentential unit measurements (frequency-based) and 80 to measurements within such units (ratio-based).",
        "From the perspective of extracting measures, in our study, some measures can be computed using only clause and sentence boundary information, and some can be derived only if the spoken responses are syntactically parsed.",
        "In our feature set, there are two types of features: clause and sentence boundary based (26 in total) and parsing based (65).",
        "The features will be described in detail in Section 4.",
        "Our data set contains (1) 1,060 non-native speech responses of 189 speakers from the TPO test (NN set), and (2) 100 responses from 48 native speakers that took the same test (Nat set).",
        "All responses were verbatim transcribed manually and scored holistically by human raters.",
        "(We only made use of the scores for the non-native data set in this study, since we purposefully selected speakers with perfect or near perfect scores for the Nat set from a larger native speech data set.)",
        "As mentioned above, there are four proficiency levels for human scoring, levels 1 to 4, with higher levels indicating better speaking proficiency.",
        "The NN set was randomly partitioned into a training (NN-train) and a test set with 760 and 300 responses, respectively, and no speaker overlap.",

        "Sets 1-3 are based on human transcriptions, whereas sets 4 and 5 are based on ASR output.",
        "Further, set 1 contains human annotated clause and sentence boundaries, whereas the other 4 sets have clause or sentence boundaries predicted by a classifier.",
        "All human transcribed files from the NN data set were annotated for clause boundaries, clause types, and disfluencies by human annotators (see Chen et al.",
        "(2010)).",
        "For the Nat data set, all of the 100 transcribed responses were annotated in the same manner by a human annotator.",
        "They are not used for any training purposes but serve as a comparative reference for syntactic complexity features derived from the non-native corpus.",
        "The NN-train set was used both for training clause and sentence boundary classifiers, as well as for feature selection and training of the scoring models.",
        "The two boundary detectors were machine learning based Hidden Markov Models, trained by using a language model derived from the 760 training files which had sentence and clause boundary labels (NN-train; see also Chen et al.",
        "(2010)).",
        "Since a speaker's response to a single test item can be quite short (fewer than 100 words in many cases), it may contain only very few syntactic complexity features we are looking for.",

        "However, if we aggregate responses of a single speaker, we have a better chance of finding a larger number of syntactic complexity features in the aggregated file.",

        "We first selected features showing high correlation to human assigned scores.",

        "As introduced in Section 3, we have one training set (N=137 speakers with all of their responses combined) for model building and five testing sets (N=52 for each of them) for evaluation.",
        "The publicly available machine learning package Weka was used in our experiments (Hall et al.",
        "2009).",
        "We experimented with two algorithms in Weka: multiple regression (called \"LinearRegression\" in Weka) and decision tree (called \"M5P\"in Weka).",
        "The score values to be predicted are real numbers (i.e., non-integer), because we have to compute the average score of one speaker's responses.",
        "Our initial runs showed that decision tree models were consistently outperformed by multiple regression (MR) models and thus decided to only focus on MR models henceforth.",
        "We set the \"AttributeSelectionMethod\" parameter in Weka's LinearRegression algorithm to all 3 of its possible values in turn: (Model-1) M5 method; (Model-2) no attribute selection; and (Model-3) greedy method.",
        "The resulting three multiple regression models were then tested against the five testing sets.",
        "Overall, correlations for all models for the NN-test-1-Hum set were between 0.45 and 0.49, correlations for sets NN-test-2-CB and NNtest-3-SB (human transcript based, and using automated boundaries) around 0.2, and for sets NN-test-4-ASR-CB and NN-test-5-ASR-SB (ASR hypotheses, and using automated boundaries), the correlations were not significant.",
        "Model-2 (using all 17 features) had the highest correlation on NN-test-1-Hum and we provide correlation results of this model in Table 3.",

        "As we can see from the result table (Table 3) in the previous section, using only syntactic complexity features, based on clausal or parse tree information derived from human transcriptions of spoken test responses, can predict holistic human rater scores for combined speaker responses over a whole test with an overall correlation of r=0.49.",
        "While this is a promising result for this study with a focus on a broad spectrum of syntactic complexity features, the results also show significant limitations for an immediate operational use of such features.",
        "First, the imperfect prediction of clause and sentence boundaries by the two automatic classifiers causes a substantial degradation of scoring model performance to about r=0.2, and secondly, the rather high error rate of the ASR system (50.5%) does not allow for the computation of features that would result in any significant correlation with human scores.",
        "We want to note here that while ASR systems can be found that exhibit WERs below 10% for certain tasks, such as restricted dictation in low-noise environments by native speakers, our ASR task is significantly harder in several ways: (1) we have to recognize non-native speak-ers'rresponses where speakers have a number of different native language backgrounds; (2) the proficiency level of the test takers varies widely; and (3) the responses are spontaneous and unconstrained in terms of vocabulary.",
        "As for the automatic clause and sentence boundary classifiers, we can observe (in Table 4) that although the sentence boundary classifier has a slightly higher F-score than the clause boundary classifier, errors in sentence boundary detection have more negative effects on the accuracy of score prediction than those made by the clause boundary classifier.",
        "In fact, the lower F-score of the latter is mainly due to its lower precision which indicates that there are more spurious clause boundaries in its output which apparently cause little harm to the feature extraction processes.",
        "Among the 17 final features, 3 of them are frequency-based and the remaining 14 are ratio-based, which mirrors our findings from previous work that frequency features have been used less successfully than ratio features.",
        "As for ratio features, 5 of them are grammatical structure counts against sentence units, 4 are counts against T-units, and only 1 is based on counts against clause units.",
        "The feature set covers a wide range of grammatical structures, such as T-units, verb phrases, noun phrases, complex nominals, adjective clauses, coordinate clauses, prepositional phrases, etc.",
        "While this wide coverage provides for richness of the construct of syntactic complexity, some of the features exhibit relatively high correlation with each other which reduces their overall contributions to the scoring model's performance.",
        "Going through the workflow of our system, we find at least five major stages that can generate errors which in turn can adversely affect feature computation and scoring model building.",
        "Errors may appear in each stage of our workflow, passing or even enlarging their effects from previous stages to later stages:",
        "1) grammatical errors by the speakers (test takers);",
        "2) errors by the ASR system;",
        "3) sentence/clause boundary detection errors;",
        "4) parser errors; and",
        "5) rule extraction errors.",

        "In this paper, we investigated associations between speakers' syntactic complexity features and their speaking proficiency scores provided by human raters.",
        "By exploring empirical evidence from non-native and native speakers' data sets of spontaneous speech test responses, we identified 17 features related to clause types and parse trees as effective predictors of human speaking scores.",
        "The features were implemented based on Lu's L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer toolkit (Lu, 2011) to be automatically extracted from human or ASR transcripts.",
        "Three multiple regression models were built from non-native speech training data with different parameter setup and were tested against five testing sets with different preprocessing steps.",
        "The best model used the complete set of 17 features and exhibited a correlation with human scores of r=0.49 on human transcripts with boundary annotations.",
        "When using automated classifiers to predict clause or sentence boundaries, correlations with human scores are around r=0.2.",
        "Our experiments indicate that by enhancing the accuracy of the two main automated preprocessing components, namely ASR and automatic sentence and clause boundary detectors, scoring model performance will increase substantially, as well.",
        "Furthermore, this result demonstrates clearly that syntactic complexity features can be devised that are able to predict human speaking proficiency scores.",
        "Since this is a preliminary study, there is ample space to improve all major stages in the feature extraction process.",
        "The errors listed in the previous section are potential working directions for preprocessing enhancements prior to machine learning.",
        "Among the five types of errors, we can work on improving the accuracy of the speech recognizer, sentence and clause boundary detectors, parser, and feature extraction rules; as for the grammatical errors produced by test takers, we are envisioning to automatically identify and correct such errors.",
        "We will further experiment with syntactic complexity measures to balance construct richness and model simplicity.",
        "Furthermore, we can also experiment with additional types of machine learning models and tune parameters to derive scoring models with better performance."
