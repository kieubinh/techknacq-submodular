        "The pitch-accent model is decoupled from the main ASR system, thus allowing us to develop it independently.",
        "N-best hypotheses from recognizers are rescored by additional scores that measure the correlation of the pitch-accent patterns between the acoustic signal and lexical cues.",
        "To test the robustness of our algorithm, we use two different data sets and recognition setups: the first one is English radio news data that has pitch accent labels, but the recognizer is trained from a small amount of data and has high error rate; the second one is English broadcast news data using a state-of-the-art SRI recognizer.",
        "Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to reduce word error rate relatively by about 3%.",

        "Prosody refers to the suprasegmental features of natural speech, such as rhythm and intonation, since it normally extends over more than one phoneme segment.",
        "Speakers use prosody to convey paralinguistic information such as emphasis, intention, attitude, and emotion.",
        "Humans listening to speech with natural prosody are able to understand the content with low cognitive load and high accuracy.",
        "However, most modern ASR systems only use an acoustic model and a language model.",
        "Acoustic information in ASR is represented by spectral features that are usually extracted over a window length of a few tens of milliseconds.",
        "They miss useful information contained in the prosody of the speech that may help recognition.",
        "Recently a lot of research has been done in automatic annotation of prosodic events (Wightman and Ostendorf, 1994; Sridhar et al., 2008; Anan-thakrishnan and Narayanan, 2008; Jeon and Liu, 2009).",
        "They used acoustic and lexical-syntactic cues to annotate prosodic events with a variety of machine learning approaches and achieved good performance.",
        "There are also many studies using prosodic information for various spoken language understanding tasks.",
        "However, research using prosodic knowledge for speech recognition is still quite limited.",
        "In this study, we investigate leveraging prosodic information for recognition in an n-best rescoring framework.",
        "Previous studies showed that prosodic events, such as pitch-accent, are closely related with acoustic prosodic cues and lexical structure of utterance.",
        "The pitch-accent pattern given acoustic signal is strongly correlated with lexical items, such as syllable identity and canonical stress pattern.",
        "Therefore as a first study, we focus on pitch-accent in this paper.",
        "We develop two separate pitch-accent detection models, using acoustic (observation model) and lexical information (expectation model) respectively, and propose a scoring method for the correlation of pitch-accent patterns between the two models for recognition hypotheses.",
        "The n-best list is rescored using the pitch-accent matching scores combined with the other scores from the ASR system (acoustic and language model scores).",
        "We show that our method yields a word error rate (WER) reduction of about 3.64% and 2.07% relatively on two baseline ASR systems, one being a state-of-the-art recognizer for the broadcast news domain.",
        "The fact that it holds across different baseline systems suggests the possibility that prosody can be used to help improve speech recognition performance.",

        "The use of prosody in speech understanding applications has been quite extensive.",
        "A variety of applications have been explored, such as sentence and topic segmentation (Shriberg et al., 2000; Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2006), word error detection (Litman et al., 2000), dialog act detection (Sridhar et al., 2009), speaker recognition (Shriberg et al., 2005), and emotion recognition (Benus et al., 2007), just to name a few.",
        "Incorporating prosodic knowledge is expected to improve the performance of speech recognition.",
        "However, how to effectively integrate prosody within the traditional ASR framework is a difficult problem, since prosodic features are not well defined and they come from a longer region, which is different from spectral features used in current ASR systems.",
        "Various research has been conducted trying to incorporate prosodic information in ASR.",
        "One way is to directly integrate prosodic features into the ASR framework (Vergyri et al., 2003; Ostendorf et al., 2003; Chen and Hasegawa-Johnson, 2006).",
        "Such efforts include prosody dependent acoustic and pronunciation model (allophones were distinguished according to different prosodic phenomenon), language model (words were augmented by prosody events), and duration modeling (different prosodic events were modeled separately and combined with conventional HMM).",
        "This kind of integration has advantages in that spectral and prosodic features are more tightly coupled and jointly modeled.",
        "Alternatively, prosody was modeled independently from the acoustic and language models of ASR and used to rescore recognition hypotheses in the second pass.",
        "This approach makes it possible to independently model and optimize the prosodic knowledge and to combine with ASR hypotheses without any modification of the conventional ASR modules.",
        "In order to improve the rescoring performance, various prosodic knowledge was studied.",
        "(Ananthakrishnan and Narayanan, 2007) used acoustic pitch-accent pattern and its sequential information given lexical cues to rescore n-best hypotheses.",
        "(Kalinli and Narayanan, 2009) used acoustic prosodic cues such as pitch and duration along with other knowledge to choose a proper word among several candidates in confusion networks.",
        "Prosodic boundaries based on acoustic cues were used in (Szaszak and Vicsi, 2007).",
        "We take a similar approach in this study as the second approach above in that we develop prosodic models separately and use them in a rescoring framework.",

        "In our approach, we explicitly model the symbolic prosodic events based on acoustic and lexical information.",

        "We treat pitch-accent detection as a binary classification task, that is, a classifier is used to determine whether the base unit is prominent or not.",
        "Since pitch-accent is usually carried by syllables, we use syllables as our units, and the syllable definition of each word is based on CMU pronunciation dictionary which has lexical stress and syllable boundary marks (Bartlett et al., 2009).",
        "We separately develop acoustic-prosodic and lexical-prosodic models and use the correlation between the two models for each syllable to rescore the n-best hypotheses of baseline ASR systems.",
        "Similar to most previous work, the prosodic features we use include pitch, energy, and duration.",
        "We also add delta features of pitch and energy.",
        "Duration information for syllables is derived from the speech waveform and phone-level forced alignment of the transcriptions.",
        "In order to reduce the effect by both inter-speaker and intra-speaker variation, both pitch and energy values are normalized (z-value) with utterance specific means and variances.",
        "For pitch, energy, and their delta values, we apply several categories of 12 functions to generate derived features.",
        "â€¢ Statistics (7): minimum, maximum, range, mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis value.",
        "These are used widely in prosodic event detection and emotion detection.",
        "â€¢ Contour (5): This is approximated by taking 5 leading terms in the Legendre polynomial expansion.",
        "The approximation of the contour using the Legendre polynomial expansion has been successfully applied in quantitative phonetics (Grabe et al., 2003) and in engineering applications (Dehak et al., 2007).",
        "Each term models a particular aspect of the contour, such as the slope, and information about the curvature.",

        "Normalization (z-value) is performed based on statistics for each syllable and vowel.",
        "The relative value is the difference between the normalized current duration and the following one.",
        "In the above description, we assumed that the event of a syllable is only dependent on its observations, and did not consider contextual effect.",
        "To alleviate this restriction, we expand the features by incorporating information about the neighboring syllables.",
        "Based on the study in (Jeon and Liu, 2010) that evaluated using left and right contexts, we choose to use one previous and one following context in the features.",
        "The total number of features used in this study is 162.",
        "There is a very strong correlation between pitch-accent in an utterance and its lexical information.",
        "Previous studies have shown that the lexical features perform well for pitch-accent prediction.",
        "The detailed features for training the lexical-prosodic model are as follows.",
        "â€¢ Syllable identity: We kept syllables that appear more than 5 times in the training corpus.",
        "The other syllables that occur less are collapsed into one syllable representation.",
        "â€¢ Vowel phone identity: We used vowel phone identity as a feature.",
        "â€¢ Lexical stress: This is a binary feature to represent if the syllable corresponds to a lexical stress based on the pronunciation dictionary.",
        "â€¢ Boundary information: This is a binary feature to indicate if there is a word boundary before the syllable.",
        "For lexical features, based on the study in (Jeon and Liu, 2010), we added two previous and two following contexts in the final features.",
        "We choose to use a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for the prosodic model based on previous work on prosody labeling study in (Jeon and Liu, 2010).",

        "We use function Vi (i = 1, 2) to represent that only a single view is used for training h1 or h2.",
        "These two classifiers are used to make predictions for the unlabeled set U, and only when they agree on the prediction for a sample, their predicted class is used as the label for this sample.",
        "Then among these self-labeled samples, the most confident ones by one classifier are added to the data set Li for training the other classifier.",

        "For the newly selected Dhi, the distribution of the positive and negative examples is the same as that of the training data Li.",
        "This co-training method is expected to cope with two problems in prosodic model training.",

        "The goal of the co-training algorithm is to learn from the difference of each classifier, thus it can improve the performance as well as reduce the mismatch of two classifiers.",

        "The WER is reduced by 0.29% (2.07% relative).",
        "This error reduction is lower than that in the first ASR system.",
        "There are several possible reasons.",
        "First, the baseline ASR performance is higher, making further improvement hard; second, and more importantly, the prosody models do not match well to the test domain.",

        "Results are based on the second ASR system.",

        "Most of the error reduction came from substitution and insertion errors.",
        "Deletion error rate did not change much or sometimes even increased.",
        "For a better understanding of the improvement using the prosody model, we analyzed the pattern of corrections (the new hypothesis after rescoring is correct while the original 1-best is wrong) and errors.",

        "For both bits, 1 represents pitch-accent, and 0 indicates none.",
        "These hard decisions are obtained by setting a threshold of 0.5 for the posterior probabilities from the acoustic or lexical models.",
        "For example, when the acoustic classifier predicts a syllable as pitch-accented and the lexical one as not accented, '10' marker is assigned to the syllable.",
        "The number of such pairs of pitch-accent markers is the same as the number of syllables in a word.",

        "This was to verify that the range of the weighting factor X estimated on the development data (using the original, not the modified prosody scores for all candidates) was reasonable to choose proper hypothesis among all the candidates.",

        "This hypothesis has the highest prosodic scores, but lowest ASR score.",
        "This result showed that if the prosodic models were accurate enough, the correct candidate could be chosen using our rescoring framework.",

        "This was to test that our model could pick up correct candidate using only the prosodic score.",
        "We found that for 26% of the utterances, the reference transcript was chosen as the best one.",
        "This was significantly better than random selection (i.e., 1/100), suggesting the benefit of the prosody model; however, this percentage is not very high, implying the limitation of prosodic information for ASR or the current imperfect prosodic models.",
        "In the third experiment, we replaced the 100thcandidate with the reference transcript and kept its ASR score.",
        "When using our prosody rescoring approach, we obtained a relative error rate reduction of 6.27%.",
        "This demonstrates again that our rescor-ing method works well - if the correct hypothesis is on the list, even though with a low ASR score, using prosodic information can help identify the correct candidate.",
        "Overall the performance improvement we obtained from rescoring by incorporating prosodic information is very promising.",
        "Our evaluation using two different ASR systems shows that the improvement holds even when we use a state-of-the-art recognizer and the training data for the prosody model does not come from the same corpus.",
        "We believe the consistent improvements we observed for different conditions show that this is a direction worthy of further investigation."
