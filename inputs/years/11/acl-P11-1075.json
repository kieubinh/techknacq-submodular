        "The automatic coding of clinical documents is an important task for today's healthcare providers.",
        "Though it can be viewed as multi-label document classification, the coding problem has the interesting property that most code assignments can be supported by a single phrase found in the input document.",
        "We propose a Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Model (LT-HMM) that leverages these phrases to improve coding accuracy.",
        "The LT-HMM works in two stages: first, a lexical match is performed against a term dictionary to collect a set of candidate codes for a document.",
        "Next, a discriminative HMM selects the best subset of codes to assign to the document by tagging candidates as present or absent.",
        "By confirming codes proposed by a dictionary, the LT-HMM can share features across codes, enabling strong performance even on rare codes.",
        "In fact, we are able to recover codes that do not occur in the training set at all.",
        "Our approach achieves the best ever performance on the 2007 Medical NLP Challenge test set, with an F-measure of 89.84."

        "The clinical domain presents a number of interesting challenges for natural language processing.",
        "Conventionally, most clinical documentation, such as doctor's notes, discharge summaries and referrals, are written in a free-text form.",
        "This narrative form is flexible, allowing healthcare professionals to express any kind of concept or event, but it is not particularly suited for large-scale analysis, search, or decision support.",
        "Converting clinical narratives into a structured form would support essential activities such as administrative reporting, quality control, biosurveillance and biomedical research (Meystre et al., 2008).",
        "One way of representing a document is to code the patient's conditions and the performed procedures into a nomenclature of clinical codes.",
        "The International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) are the official administrative coding schemes for healthcare organizations in several countries, including the US and Canada.",
        "Typically, coding is performed by trained coding professionals, but this process can be both costly and error-prone.",
        "Automated methods can speed-up the coding process, improve the accuracy and consistency of internal documentation, and even result in higher reimbursement for the healthcare organization (Benson, 2006).",
        "Traditionally, statistical document coding is viewed as multi-class multi-label document classification, where each clinical free-text document is labelled with one or several codes from a pre-defined, possibly very large set of codes (Patrick et al., 2007; Suominen et al., 2008).",
        "One classification model is learned for each code, and then all models are applied in turn to a new document to determine which codes should be assigned to the document.",
        "The drawback of this approach is poor predictive performance on low-frequency codes, which are ubiquitous in the clinical domain.",
        "This paper presents a novel approach to document coding that simultaneously models code-specific as well as general patterns in the data.",
        "This allows us to predict any code label, even codes for which no training data is available.",
        "Our approach, the lexically-triggered HMM (LT-HMM), is based on the fact that a code assignment is often indicated by short lexical triggers in the text.",
        "Consequently, a two-stage coding method is proposed.",
        "First, the LT-HMM identifies candidate codes by matching terms from a medical terminology dictionary.",
        "Then, it confirms or rejects each of the candidates by applying a discriminative sequence model.",
        "In this architecture, low-frequency codes can still be matched and confirmed using general characteristics of their trigger's local context, leading to better prediction performance on these codes."

        "Document coding is a special case of multi-class multi-label text classification.",
        "Given a fixed set of possible codes, the ultimate goal is to assign a set of codes to documents, based on their content.",
        "Furthermore, we observe that for each code assigned to a document, there is generally at least one corresponding trigger term in the text that accounts for the code's assignment.",
        "For example, if an ICD-9-CM coding professional were to see \"allergic bronchitis\" somewhere in a clinical narrative, he or she would immediately consider adding code 493.9 (Asthma, unspecified) to the document's code set.",
        "The presence of these trigger terms separates document coding from text classification tasks, such as topic or genre classification, where evidence for a particular label is built up throughout a document.",
        "However, this does not make document coding a term recognition task, concerned only with the detection of triggers.",
        "Codes are assigned to a document as a whole, and code assignment decisions within a document may interact.",
        "It is an interesting combination of sentence and document-level processing.",
        "Formally, we define the document coding task as follows: given a set of documents X and a set of available codes C, assign to each document x% a subset of codes C C C. We also assume access to a (noisy) mechanism to detect candidate triggers in a document.",
        "In particular, we will assume that an (incomplete) dictionary D(c) exists for each code c G C, which lists specific code terms associated with c. To continue our running example: D (493.9) would include the term \"allergic bronchitis\".",
        "Each code can have several corresponding terms while each term indicates the presence of exactly one code.",
        "A candidate code c is proposed each time a term from D(c) is found in a document.",
        "The presence of a term from D(c) does not automatically imply the assignment of code c to a document.",
        "Even with extremely precise dictionaries, there are three main reasons why a candidate code may not appear in a document's code subset.",
        "1.",
        "The context of the trigger term might indicate the irrelevancy of the code.",
        "In the clinical domain, such irrelevancy can be specified by a negative or speculative statement (e.g., \"evaluate for pneumonia\") or a family-related context (e.g., \"family history of diabetes\").",
        "Only definite diagnosis of the patient should be coded.",
        "2.",
        "There can be several closely related candidate codes; yet only one, the best fitted code should be assigned to the document.",
        "For example, the triggers \"left-sided flank pain\" (code 789.09) and \"abdominal pain\" (code 789.00) may both appear in the same clinical report, but only the most specific code, 789.09, should end up in the document code set.",
        "3.",
        "The domain can have code dependency rules.",
        "For example, the ICD-9-CM coding rules state that no symptom codes should be given to a document if a definite diagnosis is present.",
        "That is, if a document is coded with pneumonia, it should not be coded with a fever or cough.",
        "On the other hand, if the diagnosis is uncertain, then codes for the symptoms should be assigned.",
        "This suggests a paradigm where a candidate code, suggested by a detected trigger term, is assessed in terms of both its local context (item 1) and the presence of other candidate codes for the document (items 2 and 3).",
        "As a specific application we have chosen the task of assigning ICD-9-CM codes to free-form clinical narratives.",
        "We use the dataset collected for the 2007 Medical NLP Challenge organized by the Computational Medicine Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, hereafter refereed to as \"CMC Challenge\" (Pestian et al., 2007).",
        "For this challenge, 1954 radiology reports on outpatient chest x-ray and renal procedures were collected, disambiguated, and anonymized.",
        "The reports were annotated with ICD-9-CM codes by three coding companies, and the majority codes were selected as a gold standard.",
        "In total, 45 distinct codes were used.",
        "For this task, our use of a dictionary to detect lexical triggers is quite reasonable.",
        "The medical domain is rich with manually-created and carefully-maintained knowledge resources.",
        "In particular, the ICD-9-CM coding guidelines come with an index file that contains hundreds of thousands of terms mapped to corresponding codes.",
        "Another valuable resource is Metathesaurus from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Lindberg et al., 1993).",
        "It has millions of terms related to medical problems, procedures, treatments, organizations, etc.",
        "Often, hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare organizations maintain their own vocabularies to introduce consistency in their internal and external documentation and to support reporting, reviewing, and meta-analysis.",
        "This task has some very challenging properties.",
        "As mentioned above, the ICD-9-CM coding rules create strong code dependencies: codes are assigned to a document as a set and not individually.",
        "Furthermore, the code distribution throughout the CMC training documents has a very heavy tail; that is, there are a few heavily-used codes and a large number of codes that are used only occasionally.",
        "An ideal approach will work well with both high-frequency and low-frequency codes."

        "This approach is feasible for the small code set used in the challenge, but it is questionable in real-life settings where thousands of codes need to be considered.",
        "Later, the winning team showed how their hand-crafted rules can be built in a semi-automatic way: the initial set of rules adopted from the official coding guidelines were automatically extended with additional synonyms and code dependency rules generated from the training data (Farkas and Szarvas, 2008).",
        "Statistical systems trained on only text-derived features (such as n-grams) did not show good performance due to a wide variety of medical language and a relatively small training set (Goldstein et al., 2007).",
        "This led to the creation of hybrid systems: symbolic and statistical classifiers used together in an ensemble or cascade (Aronson et al., 2007; Crammer et al., 2007) or a symbolic component providing features for a statistical component (Patrick et al., 2007; Suominen et al., 2008).",
        "Strong competition systems had good answers for dealing with negative and speculative contexts, taking advantage of the competition's limited set of possible code combinations, and handling of low-frequency codes.",

        "We combine a symbolic component that matches lexical strings of a document against a medical dictionary to determine possible codes (Lussier et al., 2000; Kevers and Medori, 2010) and a statistical component that finalizes the assignment of codes to the document.",
        "Our statistical component is similar to that of Crammer et al.",
        "(2007), in that we train a single model for all codes with codespecific and generic features.",
        "However, Crammer et al.",
        "(2007) did not employ our lexical trigger step or our sequence-modeling formulation.",

        "The data consists of 978 training and 976 test medical records labelled with one or more ICD-9-CM codes from a set of 45 codes.",
        "The data statistics are presented in Table 2.",
        "The training and test sets have similar, very imbalanced distributions of codes.",
        "In particular, all codes in the test set have at least one training example.",
        "Moreover, for any code subset assigned to a test document there is at least one training document labelled with the same code subset.",
        "Notably, more than half of the codes have less than 10 instances in both training and test sets.",
        "Following the challenge's protocol, we use micro-averaged F1-measure for evaluation.",
        "As the first baseline for comparison, we built a one-classifier-per-code statistical system.",
        "A document's code subset is implied by the set of classifiers that assign it a positive label.",
        "The classifiers use a feature set designed to mimic our LT-HMM as closely as possible, including n-grams, dictionary matches, ConText output, and symptom/disease semantic types.",

        "Unlike our approach, this baseline cannot share features across codes, and it does not allow coding decisions for a document to inform one another.",
        "It also cannot propose codes that have not been seen in the training data as it has no model for these codes.",
        "However, one should note that it is a very strong baseline.",
        "Like our proposed system, it is built with many features derived from dictionary matches and their contexts, and thus it shares many of our system's strengths.",
        "In fact, this baseline system outperforms all published statistical approaches tested on the CMC data.",
        "Our second baseline is a symbolic system, designed to evaluate the quality of our rule-based components when used alone.",
        "It is based on the same hand-crafted dictionary, filtered according to the ConText algorithm and four code dependency rules from (Farkas and Szarvas, 2008).",
        "These rules address the problem of overcoding: some symptom codes should be omitted when a specific disease code is present.",
        "This symbolic system has access to the same hand-crafted resources as our LT-HMM and, therefore, has a good chance of predicting low-frequency and unseen codes.",
        "However, it lacks the flexibility of our statistical solution to accept or reject code candidates based on the whole document text, which prevents it from compensating for dictionary or ConText errors.",
        "Similarly, the structure of the code dependency rules may not provide the same flexibility as our features that look at other detected triggers and previous code assignments.",
        "We evaluate the proposed approach on both the training set (using 10-fold cross-validation) and the test set (Table 3).",
        "The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LT-HMM approach over the one-per-code statistical scheme as well as our symbolic baseline.",
        "Furthermore, the new approach shows the best results ever achieved on the dataset, beating the top-performing system in the challenge, a symbolic method.",
        "Table 3: Micro-averaged F1-scores for statistical and symbolic baselines, the proposed LT-HMM approach, and the best CMC hand-crafted rule-based system.",
        "Our system employs a number of emission feature templates.",
        "We measure the impact of each by removing the template, re-training, and testing on the challenge test data, as shown in Table 4.",
        "By far the most important component of our system is the output of the ConText algorithm.",
        "We also tested a version of the system that does not create a parallel code-specific feature set by appending the candidate code to emission features.",
        "This system tags code-candidates without any code-specific components, but it still does very well, outperforming the baselines.",
        "Removing the sequence-based transition features from our system has only a small impact on accuracy.",
        "This is because several of our emission features look at features of other candidate codes.",
        "This provides a strong approximation to the actual tagging decisions for these candidates.",
        "If we remove the ConText features, the HMM's transition features become more important (compare line 2 of Table 4 to line 7).",

        "In this way, the LT-HMM captures the strengths of both approaches.",

        "The micro-averaged results for the remaining 13 low-frequency codes are shown in Table 6, with the results from the symbolic baseline and from our system trained on the complete training data provided for comparison.",
        "We were able to recover 49% of the test-time occurrences of codes withheld from training, while maintaining our full system's precision.",
        "Considering that traditional statistical strategies would lead to recall dropping uniformly to 0, this is a vast improvement.",
        "However, the symbolic baseline recalls 80% of occurrences in aggregate, indicating that we are not yet making optimal use of the dictionary for cases when a code is missing from the training data.",
        "By holding out only correct occurrences of a code c, our system becomes biased against it: all trigger terms for c that are found in the training data must be labelled absent.",
        "Nonetheless, out of the 13 codes with dictionary matches, there were 9 codes that we were able to recall at a rate of 50% or more, and 5 codes that achieved 100% recall."

        "We have presented the lexically-triggered HMM, a novel and effective approach for clinical document coding.",
        "The LT-HMM takes advantage of lexical triggers for clinical codes by operating in two stages: first, a lexical match is performed against a trigger term dictionary to collect a set of candidates codes for a document; next, a discriminative HMM selects the best subset of codes to assign to the document.",
        "Using both generic and code-specific features, the LT-HMM outperforms a traditional one-per-code statistical classification method, with substantial improvements on low-frequency codes.",
        "Also, it achieves the best ever performance on a common testbed, beating the top-performer of the 2007 CMC Challenge, a hand-crafted rule-based system.",
        "Finally, we have demonstrated that the LT-HMM can correctly predict codes never seen in the training set, a vital characteristic missing from previous statistical methods.",
        "In the future, we would like to augment our dictionary-based matching component with entity-recognition technology.",
        "It would be interesting to model triggers as latent variables in the document coding process, in a manner similar to how latent subjective sentences have been used in document-level sentiment analysis (Yessenalina et al., 2010).",
        "This would allow us to employ a learned matching component that is trained to compliment our classification component."
