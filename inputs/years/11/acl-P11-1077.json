        "We investigate whether wording, stylistic choices, and online behavior can be used to predict the age category of blog authors.",
        "Our hypothesis is that significant changes in writing style distinguish pre-social media bloggers from post-social media blog-gers.",
        "Through experimentation with a range of years, we found that the birth dates of students in college at the time when social media such as AIM, SMS text messaging, MySpace and Facebook first became popular, enable accurate age prediction.",

        "The evolution of the internet has changed the way that people communicate.",
        "The introduction of instant messaging, forums, social networking and blogs has made it possible for people of every age to become authors.",
        "The users of these social media platforms have created their own form of unstructured writing that is best characterized as informal.",
        "Even how people communicate has dramatically changed, with multitasking increasing and responses generated immediately.",
        "We should be able to exploit those differences to automatically determine from blog posts whether an author is part of a pre-or post-social media generation.",
        "This problem is called age prediction and raises two main questions:",
        "• Is there a point in time that proves to be a significantly better dividing line between pre and post-social media generations?",
        "• What features of communication most directly reveal the generation in which a blog-ger was born?",
        "We hypothesize that the dividing line(s) occur when people in generation Y, or the millennial generation, (born anywhere from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s) were typical college-aged students (18-22).",
        "We focus on this generation due to the rise of popular social media technologies such as messaging and online social networks sites that occurred during that time.",
        "Therefore, we experimented with binary classification into age groups using all birth dates from 1975 through 1988, thus including students from generation Y who were in college during the emergence of social media technologies.",
        "We find five years where binary classification is significantly more accurate than other years: 1977, 1979, and 1982-1984.",
        "The appearance of social media technologies such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), weblogs, SMS text messaging, Face-book and MySpace occurred when people with these birth dates were in college.",
        "We explore two of these years in more detail, 1979 and 1984, and examine a wide variety of features that differ between the pre-social media and post-social media bloggers.",
        "We examine lexical-content features such as collocations and part-of-speech collocations, lexical-stylistic features such as internet slang and capitalization, and features representing online behavior such as time of post and number of friends.",
        "We find that both stylistic and content features have a significant impact on age prediction and show that, for unseen blogs, we are able to classify authors as born before or after 1979 with 80% accuracy and born before or after 1984 with 82% accuracy.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we first discuss work to date on age prediction for blogs and then present the features that we extracted, which is a larger set than previously explored.",
        "We then turn separately to three experiments.",
        "In the first, we implement a prior approach to show that we can produce a similar outcome.",
        "In the second, we show how the accuracy of age prediction changes over time and pinpoint when major changes occur.",
        "In the last experiment, we describe our age prediction experiments in more detail for the most significant years."

        "They aimed at binary prediction of age, classifying LiveJournal bloggers as either over or under 18, but were unable to automatically predict age with more accuracy than a baseline model that always chose the majority class.",

        "They can distinguish between bloggers in the 10's and in the 30's with relatively high accuracy (above 96%) but many 30s are misclassified as 20s, which results in a overall accuracy of 76.2%.",

        "We chose the later age groups because this study is based on blogs updated in 2009-10 which is 5-6 years later and thus, the 13-17 age group is now 18-22 and so on.",

        "However, many 38-42s are misclassified as 28-32s with an accuracy of 72.1%, yielding overall accuracy of 67%.",

        "We experimented with style and content features and found that both help improve accuracy.",
        "Figure 3 shows that content helps more than style, but style helps more as age decreases.",

        "Figure 5 compares the significant years 1977,1979, and 1982-1984 against when each technology was created or became popular amongst college aged students.",
        "We find that all the technologies had an effect on one or more of those years.",
        "AIM and weblogs coincide with the earlier shifts at 1977 and 1979, SMS messaging coincide with both the earlier and later shifts at 1979 and 1982, and the social networking sites, MySpace and Facebook coincide with the later shifts of 1982770 1984.",
        "On the other hand, web forums and Twitter each coincide with only one outlying year which suggests that either they had less of an impact on writing style or, in the case of Twitter, the change has not yet been transferred to other writing forms.",

        "This means the BOW does a better job of picking topics than interests.",
