        "Coreference resolution (CoRe) is the process of finding markables (noun phrases) referring to the same real world entity or concept.",
        "Until recently, most approaches tried to solve the problem by binary classification, where the probability of a pair of markables being coreferent is estimated from labeled data.",
        "Alternatively, a model that determines whether a markable is coreferent with a preceding cluster can be used.",
        "For both pair-based and cluster-based models, a well established feature model plays an important role.",
        "Typical systems use a rich feature space based on lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge.",
        "Most commonly used features are described by Soon et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "Most existing systems are supervised systems, trained on human-labeled benchmark data sets for English.",
        "These systems use linguistic features based on number, gender, person etc.",
        "It is a challenge to adapt these systems to new domains, genres and languages because a significant human labeling effort is usually necessary to get good performance.",
        "To address this challenge, we pursue an unsupervised self-training approach.",
        "We train a classifier on a corpus that is automatically labeled using association information.",
        "Self-training approaches usually include the use of some manually labeled data.",
        "In contrast, our self-trained system is not trained on any manually labeled data and is therefore a completely unsupervised system.",
        "Although training on automatically labeled data can be viewed as a form of supervision, we reserve the term supervised system for systems that are trained on manually labeled data.",
        "The key novelty of our approach is that we bootstrap a competitive CoRe system from association information that is mined from an unlabeled corpus in a completely unsupervised fashion.",
        "While this method is shallow, it provides valuable information for CoRe because it considers the actual identity of the words in question.",
        "Consider the pair of markables (Obama, President).",
        "It is a likely coref-erence pair, but this information is not accessible to standard CoRe systems because they only use string-based features (often called lexical features), named entity features and semantic word class features (e.g., from WordNet) that do not distinguish, say, Obama from Hawking.",
        "In our approach, word association information is used for clustering markables in unsupervised learning.",
        "Association information is calculated as association scores between heads ofmarkables as described below.",
        "We view association information as an example of a shallow feature space which contrasts with the rich feature space that is generally used in CoRe.",
        "Our experiments are conducted using the MCORE system (\"Modular COreference REso-lution\").",
        "MCORE can operate in three different settings: unsupervised (subsystem A-INF), supervised (subsystem SUCRE (Kobdani and Schütze, 2010)), and self-trained (subsystem UNSEL).",
        "The unsupervised subsystem A-INF (\"Association INFormation\") uses the association scores between heads as the distance measure when clustering markables.",
        "SUCRE (\"SUpervised Coreference REsolution\") is trained on a labeled corpus (manually or automatically labeled) similar to standard CoRe systems.",
        "Finally, the unsupervised self-trained subsystem UNSEL (\"UNsupervised SELf-trained\") uses the unsupervised subsystem A-INF to automatically label an unlabeled corpus that is then used as a training set for SUCRE.",
        "Our main contributions in this paper are as follows:",
        "1.",
        "We demonstrate that word association information can be used to develop an unsupervised model for shallow coreference resolution (subsystem A-INF).",
        "2.",
        "We introduce an unsupervised self-trained method (UNSEL) that takes a two-learner two-feature-space approach.",
        "The two learners are A-INF and SUCRE.",
        "The feature spaces are the shallow and rich feature spaces.",
        "3.",
        "We show that the performance of UNSEL is better than the performance of other unsupervised systems when it is self-trained on the automatically labeled corpus and uses the leveraging effect of a rich feature space.",
        "4.",
        "MCORE is a flexible and modular framework that is able to learn from data with different quality and domain.",
        "Not only is it able to deal with shallow information spaces (A-INF), but it can also deliver competitive results for rich feature spaces (SUCRE and UNSEL).",

        "These researchers show that a \"deterministic\" system (essentially a rule-based system) that uses a rich feature space including lexical, syntactic and semantic features can improve CoRe performance.",
        "Almost all CoRe systems, including ours, use a limited number of rules or filters, e.g., to implement binding condition A that reflexives must have a close antecedent in some sense of \"close\".",
        "In our view, systems that use a few basic filters are fundamentally different from carefully tuned systems with a large number of complex rules, some of which use specific lexical information.",
        "A limitation of complex rule-based systems is that they require substantial effort to encode the large number of deterministic constraints that guarantee good performance.",
        "Moreover, these systems are not adaptable (since they are not machine-learned) and may have to be rewritten for each new domain, genre and language.",

        "When we increase the number of input articles, recall rapidly increases and precision rapidly decreases up to about 10,000 articles.",
        "Increase and decrease continue more slowly after that.",

        "It is apparent from this table that our supervised and unsupervised self-trained models outperform Relax, SUCRE2010 and Tanl-1.",
        "We should make clear that we did not use the test set for development to ensure a fair comparison with the participant systems at SemEval-2010.",
        "Table 1 shows that the unsupervised self-trained system (UNSEL) does a lot worse than the supervised system (SUCRE) on ACE.",
        "In contrast, UNSEL performs almost as well as SUCRE on OntoNotes (Table 2), for both gold and automatic settings: F1 differences range from +.1 (Automatic, B) to -1.3 (Gold, MUC).",
        "We suspect that this is partly due to the much higher proportion of singletons in OntoNotes than in ACE-2: 85.2% the automatic labeling by A-INF introduces a bias for singletons when UNSEL is self-trained.",
        "Another reason is that the OntoNotes training set is about 4 times larger than each of BNEWS, NWIRE and",
        "NPAPER training sets.",
        "With more training data, UNSEL can correct more of its precision and recall errors.",
        "For an unsupervised approach, which only needs unlabeled data, there is little cost to creating large training sets.",
        "Thus, this comparison of ACE-2/Ontonotes results is evidence that in a realistic scenario using association information in an unsupervised self-trained system is almost as good as a system trained on manually labeled data.",
        "It is important to note that the comparison of SUCRE to UNSEL is the most direct comparison of supervised and unsupervised CoRe learning we are aware of.",
        "The two systems are identical with the single exception that they are trained on manual vs. automatic coreference labels."

        "We first developed a simple unsupervised model for shallow CoRe that only uses association information for finding coreference chains.",
        "We then introduced an unsupervised self-trained approach where a supervised model is trained on a corpus that was automatically labeled by the unsupervised model based on the association information.",
        "The results of the experiments indicate that the performance of the unsupervised self-trained approach is better than the performance of other unsupervised learning systems.",
        "In addition, we showed that our system is a flexible and modular framework that is able to learn from data with different quality (perfect vs noisy markable detection) and domain; and is able to deliver good results for shallow information spaces and competitive results for rich feature spaces.",
        "Finally, our framework is the first CoRe system that is designed to support three major modes of machine learning equally well: supervised, self-trained and unsupervised."
