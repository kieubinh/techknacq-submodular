        "To date, studies of morphological analysis and dependency parsing have been pursued more or less independently.",
        "Morphological taggers disambiguate morphological attributes such as part-of-speech (POS) or case, without taking syntax into account (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2000; Hajic et al., 2001); dependency parsers commonly assume the \"pipeline\" approach, relying on morphological information as part of the input (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "This approach serves many languages well, especially those with less morphological ambiguity.",
        "In English, for example, accuracy of POS tagging has risen above 97% (Toutanova et al., 2003), and that of dependency parsing has reached the low nineties (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "For these languages, there may be little to be gained to justify the computational cost of incorporating syntactic inference during the morphological tagging task; conversely, it is doubtful that errorful morphological information is a main cause of errors in English dependency parsing.",
        "However, the pipeline approach seems more problematic for morphologically-rich languages with substantial interactions between morphology and syntax (Tsarfaty, 2006).",
        "Consider the Latin sentence, Una dies omnis potuit praecurrere amantis, 'One day was able to make up for all the lovers'.",
        "As shown in Table 1, the adjective omnis ('all') is ambiguous in number, gender, and case; there are seven valid analyses.",
        "From the perspective of a finite-state morphological tagger, the most attractive analysis is arguably the singular nominative, since omnis is immediately followed by the singular verb potuit ('could').",
        "Indeed, the baseline tagger used in this study did make this decision.",
        "Given its nominative case, the pipeline parser assigned the verb potuit to be its head; the two words form the typical subject-verb relation, agreeing in number.",
        "Unfortunately, as shown in Figure 1, the word omnis in fact modifies the noun amantis, at the end of the sentence.",
        "As a result, despite the distance between them, they must agree in number, gender and case, i.e., both must be plural masculine (or feminine) accusative.",
        "The pipeline parser, acting on the input that omnis is nominative, naturally did not see",
        "Table 1: The Latin sentence \"Una dies omnis potuit praecurrere amantis\", meaning 'One day was able to make up for all the lovers', shown with glosses and possible morphological analyses.",
        "The correct analyses are shown in bold.",
        "The word omnis has 7 possible combinations of number, gender and case, while amantis has 5.",
        "Disambiguation partly depends on establishing amantis as the head of omnis, and so the two must agree in all three attributes.",
        "this agreement, and therefore did not consider this syntactic relation likely.",
        "Such a dilemma is not uncommon in languages with relatively free word order.",
        "On the one hand, it appears difficult to improve morphological tagging accuracy on words like omnis without syntactic knowledge; on the other hand, a parser cannot reliably disambiguate syntax unless it has accurate morphological information, in this example the agreement in number, gender, and case.",
        "In this paper we propose to attack this chicken-and-egg problem with a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological and syntactic properties of a sentence, given its words as input.",
        "In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, the model outperforms both a baseline tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.",
        "After a description of previous work (§2), the joint model (§3) will be contrasted with the baseline pipeline model (§4).",
        "Experimental results (§5-6) will then be presented, followed by conclusions and future directions."

        "As seen in Table 3, the joint model outperformsthe baseline tagger in all attributes in Latin morphological disambiguation.",
        "Among words not covered by the morphological database, accuracy in POS is slightly better, but lower for case, gender and number.",
        "The joint model made the most gains on adjectives and participles.",
        "Both parts-of-speech are particularly ambiguous: according to MORPHEUS, 43% of the adjectives can be interpreted as another POS, most frequently nouns; while participles have an average of 5.5 morphological interpretations.",
        "Both also often have identical forms for different genders, numbers and cases.",
        "In these situations, syntactic considerations help nudge the joint model to the correct interpretations.",
        "Experiments on the other three languages bear out similar results: the joint model improves morphological disambiguation.",
        "The performance of Czech (Table 4) exhibits the closest analogue to Latin: gender, number, and case are much less accurately predicted than are the other morphological attributes.",
        "Like Latin, Czech lacks definite and indefinite articles to provide high-confidence cues for noun phrase boundaries.",
        "The Ancient Greek treebank comprises both archaic texts, before the development of a definite article, and later classic Greek, which has a definite article; Hungarian has both a definite and an indefinite article.",
        "In both languages (Tables 5 and 6), noun and adjective gender, number, and case are more accurately predicted than in Czech and Latin.",
        "The verbal system of ancient Greek, in contrast, is more complex than that of the other languages, so mood, voice, and tense accuracy are lower.",
        "In addition to morphological disambiguation, we also measured the performance of the joint model on dependency parsing of Latin and the other languages.",
        "The baseline pipeline parser (§4.2) yielded 61.00% head selection accuracy (i.e., unlabeled attachment score, UAS), outperformed by the joint model at 61.88%.",
        "The joint model showed similar improvements in Ancient Greek, Hungarian, and Czech.",
        "Wrong decisions made by the baseline tagger often misled the pipeline parser.",
        "For adjectives, the example shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 is a typical scenario, where an accusative adjective was tagged as nominative, and was then misanalyzed by the parser as modifying a verb (as a subject) rather than modifying an accusative noun.",
        "For participles modifying a noun, the wrong noun was often chosen based on inaccurate morphological information.",
        "In these cases, the joint model, entertaining all morphological possibilities, was able to find the combination of links and morphological analyses that are collectively more likely.",
        "The accuracy figures of our baselines are comparable, but not identical, to their counterparts reported in (Bamman and Crane, 2008).",
        "The differences may partially be attributed to the different morphological tagger used, and the different learning algorithm, namely Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) in (McDonald et al., 2005) rather than maximum likelihood.",
        "More importantly, the Latin Dependency Treebank has grown from about 30K at the time of the previous work to 53K at present, resulting in significantly different training and testing material.",
        "Gold Pipeline Parser When given perfect morphological information, the Latin parser performs at 65.28% accuracy in head selection.",
        "Despite the oracle morphology, the head selection accuracy is still below other languages.",
        "This is hardly surprising, given the relatively small training set, and that the \"the most difficult languages are those that combine a relatively free word order with a high degree of inflection\", as observed at the recent dependency parsing shared task (Nivre et al., 2007); both of these are characteristics of Latin.",
        "A particularly troublesome structure is coordination; the most frequent link errors all involve either a parent or a child as a conjunction.",
        "In a list of words, all words and coordinators depend on the final coordinator.",
        "Since the factors in our model consult only one link at a time, they do not sufficiently capture this kind of structures.",
        "Higher-order features, particularly those concerned with links with grandparents and siblings, have been shown to benefit dependency parsing (Smith and Eisner, 2008) and may be able to address this issue."

        "We have proposed a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures.",

        "This model may be refined by incorporating richer features and improved decoding.",
