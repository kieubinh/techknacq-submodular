        "An enduring problem in statistical machine translation is sparsity.",
        "The word alignment models of modern MT systems attempt to capture p(ei\\fj), the probability that token ej is a translation of f. Underlying these models is the assumption that the word-based tokenization of each sentence is, if not optimal, at least appropriate for specifying a conceptual mapping between the two languages.",
        "However, when translating between unrelated languages - a common task - disparate morphological systems can place an asymmetric conceptual burden on words, making the lexicon of one language much more coarse.",
        "This intensifies the problem of sparsity as the large number of word forms created through morphologically productive processes hinders attempts to find concise mappings between concepts.",
        "For instance, Bulgarian adjectives may contain markings for gender, number, and definiteness.",
        "The following tree illustrates nine realized forms of the Bulgarian word for red, with each leaf listing the definite and indefinite markings.",

        "cherven(iq)(iqt) chervena(ta) cherveno(to) cherveni(te)",
        "Contrast this with English, in which this information is marked either on the modified word or by separate function words.",
        "In comparison to a language which isn't morphologically productive on adjectives, the alignment model must observe nine times as much data (assuming uniform distribution of the inflected forms) to yield a comparable statistic.",
        "In an area of research where the amount of data available plays a large role in a system's overall performance, this sparsity can be extremely problematic.",
        "Further complications are created when lexical sparsity is compounded with the desire to build up alignments over increasingly larger contiguous phrases.",
        "To address this issue we propose an alternative to word alignment: morpheme alignment, an alignment that operates over the smallest meaningful subsequences of words.",
        "By striving to keep a direct 1-to-1 mapping between corresponding semantic units across languages, we hope to find better estimates",
        "Figure 1: A depiction of morpheme-level alignment.",
        "Here dark lines indicate the more stem-focused alignment strategy of a traditional word or phrasal alignment model, while thin lines indicate a more fine-grained alignment across morphemes.",
        "In the alignment between English and Bulgarian (a) the morpheme-specific alignment reduces sparsity in the adjective and noun (red flowers) by isolating the stems from their inflected forms.",
        "Despite Arabic exhibiting templatic morphology, there are still phenomena which can be accounted for with a simpler segmentational approach.",
        "The Arabic alignment (b) demonstrates how the plural marker on English they would normally create sparsity by being marked in three additional places, two of them inflections in larger wordforms.",
        "for the alignment statistics.",
        "Our results show that this improves alignment quality.",
        "In the following sections we describe an unsupervised dynamic graphical model approach to monolingual morphological segmentation and bilingual morpheme alignment using a linguistically motivated statistical model.",
        "In a bilingual setting, the model relies on morpho-syntactic and lexical source-side information (part-of-speech, morphological segmentation, dependency analysis) while learning a morpheme segmentation over the target language.",
        "In a monolingual setting we introduce effective use of context by feature-rich modeling of the probabilities of morphemes, morpheme-transitions, and word boundaries.",
        "These additional sources of information provide powerful bias for unsupervised learning, without increasing the asymptotic running time of the inference algorithm.",
        "Used as a monolingual model, our system significantly improves the state-of-the-art segmentation performance on three Arabic and Hebrew datasets.",
        "Used as a bilingual model, our system outperforms the state-of-the-art WDHMM (He, 2007) word alignment model as measured by alignment error rate (AER).",
        "In agreement with some previous work on to-kenization/morpheme segmentation for alignment (Chung and Gildea, 2009; Habash and Sadat, 2006), we find that the best segmentation for alignment does not coincide with the gold-standard segmentation and our bilingual model does not outperform our monolingual model in segmentation F-Measure."

        "(iv) we enrich the hidden state space of the model to encode morpheme types {prefix,suffix,stem}, in addition to morpheme alignment and segmentation information.",
        "Before defining our model formally, we introduce some notation.",
        "Each possible morphological segmentation and alignment for a given sentence pair can be described by the following random variables:",
        "Let ß1ß2 ■ ■ ■ ßI denote I morphemes in the segmentation of the target sentence.",
        "For the Example in Figure 1 (a) I=5 and ß1=cherven, ß2=i ■ ■ ■ , and ß5=ia.",

        "The c and wb variables are observed.",
        "Let s1s2 ■ ■ ■St denote Bernoulli segmentation variables indicating whether there is a morpheme boundary after the corresponding character.",
        "The values of the hidden segmentation variables s together with the values of the observed c and wb variables uniquely define the values of the morpheme variables ßi and the word boundary variables bj.",

        "Let tai = [ai,ti], i = 1 ■ ■ ■I indicate a factored state where ai represents one of the J source words (or NULL) and ti represents one of the three morpheme types {prefix,suffix,stem}.",
        "ai is the source morpheme aligned to ßi and ti is the type of ßi.",
        "We are finally ready to define the desired probability of target morphemes, morpheme types, alignments, and word boundaries given source:",
        "We now describe each of the factors used by our model in more detail.",
        "The formulation makes explicit the full extent of dependencies we have explored in this work.",
        "By simplifying the factors we can recover several previously used models for monolingual segmentation and bilingual joint segmentation and alignment.",
        "We discuss the relationship of this model to prior work and study the impact of the novel components in our experiments.",
        "When the source sentence is assumed to be empty (and thus contains no morphemes to align to) our model turns into a monolingual morpheme segmentation model, which we show exceeds the performance of previous state-of-the-art models.",
        "When we remove the word boundary component, reduce the order of the alignment transition, omit the morphological type component of the state space, and retain only minimal dependencies in the morpheme translation model, we recover the joint tokenization and alignment model based on IBM Model-1 proposed by (Chung and Gildea, 2009).",
        "In the model equation, PT denotes the morpheme translation probability.",
        "The standard dependence on the aligned source morpheme is represented as a dependence on the state tai and the whole annotated source sentence e. We experimented with multiple options for the amount of conditioning context to be included.",
        "When most context is used, there is a bigram dependency of target language morphemes as well as dependence on two previous boundary variables and dependence on the aligned source morpheme eai as well as its POS tag.",
        "When multiple conditioning variables are used we assume a special linearly interpolated backoff form of the model, similar to models routinely used in language modeling.",
        "As an example, suppose we estimate the morpheme translation probability as PT(ßi\\eai,ti).",
        "We estimate this in the M-step, given expected joint counts c(ßi, eai, ti) and marginal counts derived from these as follows:",
        "The lower order distributions are estimated recursively in a similar way:",
        "For Po we used a unigram character language model.",
        "This hierarchical smoothing can be seen as an approximation to hierarchical Dirichlet priors with maximum aposteriori estimation.",
        "Note how our explicit treatment of word boundary variables bi allows us to use a higher order dependence on these variables.",
        "If word boundaries are treated as morphemes on their own, we would need to have a four-gram model on target morphemes to represent this dependency which we are now representing using only a bigram model on hidden morphemes.",
        "The PB distribution denotes the probability of generating word boundaries.",
        "As a sequence model of sentences the basic hidden semi-markov model completely ignores word boundaries.",
        "However, they can be powerful predictors of morpheme segments (by for example, indicating that common prefixes follow word boundaries, or that common suffixes precede them).",
        "The log-linear model of (Poon et al., 2009) uses word boundaries as observed left and right context features, and Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) includes boundaries as special boundary symbols which can inform about the morpheme state of a morpheme (but not its identity).",
        "Our model includes a special generative process for boundaries which is conditioned not only on the previous morpheme state but also the previous two morphemes and other boundaries.",
        "Due to the fact that boundaries are observed their inclusion in the model does not increase the complexity of inference.",
        "The inclusion of this distribution lets us estimate the likelihood of a word consisting of one,two,three, or more morphemes.",
        "It also allows the estimation of likelihood that particular morphemes are in the beginning/middle/end of words.",
        "Through the included factored state variable tai word boundaries can also inform about the likelihood of a morpheme aligned to a source word of a particular pos tag to end a word.",
        "We discuss the particular conditioning context for this distribution we found most helpful in our experiments.",
        "Similarly to the PT distribution, we make use of multiple context vectors by hierarchical smoothing of distributions of different granularities.",
        "Pd indicates the distortion modeling distribution we use.",
        "Traditional distortion models represent P (a,j \\dj-i, e), the probability of an alignment given the previous alignment, to bias the model away from placing large distances between the aligned tokens of consecutively sequenced tokens.",
        "In addition to modeling a larger state space to also predict morpheme types, we extend this model by using a special log-linear model form which allows the integration of rich morpho-syntactic context.",
        "Log-linear models have been previously used in unsupervised learning for local multinomial distributions like this one in e.g. (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010), and for global distributions in (Poon et al., 2009).",
        "The special log-linear form allows the inclusion of features targeted at learning the transitions among morpheme types and the transitions between corresponding source morphemes.",
        "The set of features with example values for this model is depicted in Table 3.",
        "The example is focussed on the features firing for the transition from the Bulgarian suffix te aligned to the first English morpheme ßi-1 = te, ti-i=suffix, ai-i=1, to the Bulgarian root tsvet aligned to the third English morpheme ßi = tsvet, ti=root, ai=3.",
        "The first feature is the absolute difference between ai and ai-1 + 1 and is similar to information used in other HMM word alignment models (Och and Ney, 2000) as well as phrasetranslation models (Koehn, 2004).",
        "The alignment positions ai are defined as indices of the aligned source morphemes.",
        "We additionally compute distortion in terms of distance in number of source words that are skipped.",
        "This distance corresponds to the feature name word distance.",
        "Looking at both kinds of distance is useful to capture the intuition that consecutive morphemes in the same target word should prefer to have a higher proximity of their aligned source words, as compared to consecutive morphemes which are not part of the same target word.",
        "The binned distances look at the sign of the distortion and bin the jumps into 5 bins, pooling the distances greater than 2 together.",
        "The feature same target word indicates whether the two consecu-",
        "Figure 3: Features in log-linear distortion model firing for the transition from te:suffix:1 to tsvet:root:3 in the example sentence pair in Figure 1a.",
        "tive morphemes are part of the same word.",
        "In this case, they are not.",
        "This feature is not useful on its own because it does not distinguish between different alignment possibilities for tai, but is useful in conjunction with other features to differentiate the transition behaviors within and across target words.",
        "The dep relation feature indicates the direct dependency relation between the source words containing the aligned source morphemes, if such relationship exists.",
        "We also represent alignments to null and have one null for each source word, similarly to (Och and Ney, 2000) and have a feature to indicate null .",
        "Additionally, we make use of several feature conjunctions involving the null, same target word, and distance features.",
        "Following (Chung and Gildea, 2009) and (Liang and Klein, 2009) we use an exponential length penalty on morpheme lengths to bias the model away from the maximum likelihood under-segmentation solution.",
        "The form of the penalty is:",

        "We fit this parameter using an annotated development set, to optimize morpheme-segmentation F1.",
        "The model is extremely sensitive to this value and performs quite poorly if such penalty is not used.",
        "We perform inference by EM training on the aligned sentence pairs.",
        "In the E-step we compute expected counts of all hidden variable configurations that are relevant for our model.",

        "Even though the inference algorithm is low polynomial it is still much more expensive than the inference for an HMM model for word-alignment without segmentation.",

        "However, in both the Arabic and Hebrew S&B tasks we find that a tendency to over-segment certain characters off of their correct morphemes and on to other frequently occurring, yet incorrect, particles is actually the cause of many of these isolated errors.",
