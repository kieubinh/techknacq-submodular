        "Grammatical error correction (GEC) has been recognized as an interesting as well as commercially attractive problem in natural language processing (NLP), in particular for learners of English as a foreign or second language (EFL/ESL).",
        "Despite the growing interest, research has been hindered by the lack of a large annotated corpus of learner text that is available for research purposes.",
        "As a result, the standard approach to GEC has been to train an off-the-shelf classifier to re-predict words in non-learner text.",
        "Learning GEC models directly from annotated learner corpora is not well explored, as are methods that combine learner and non-learner text.",
        "Furthermore, the evaluation of GEC has been problematic.",
        "Previous work has either evaluated on artificial test instances as a substitute for real learner errors or on proprietary data that is not available to other researchers.",
        "As a consequence, existing methods have not been compared on the same test set, leaving it unclear where the current state of the art really is.",
        "In this work, we aim to overcome both problems.",
        "First, we present a novel approach to GEC based on Alternating Structure Optimization (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005).",
        "Our approach is able to train models on annotated learner corpora while still taking advantage of large non-learner corpora.",
        "Second, we introduce the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE), a fully annotated one million words corpus of learner English available for research purposes.",
        "We conduct an extensive evaluation for article and preposition errors using six different feature sets proposed in previous work.",
        "We compare our proposed ASO method with two baselines trained on non-learner text and learner text, respectively.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive comparison of different feature sets on real learner text which is another contribution of our work.",
        "Our experiments show that our proposed ASO algorithm significantly improves over both baselines.",
        "It also outperforms two commercial grammar checking software packages in a manual evaluation.",

        "The seminal work on grammatical error correction was done by Knight and Chander (1994) on article errors.",
        "Subsequent work has focused on designing better features and testing different classifiers, including memory-based learning (Minnen et al., 2000), decision tree learning (Nagata et al., 2006; Gamon et al., 2008), and logistic regression (Lee, on preposition errors has used a similar classification approach and mainly differs in terms of the features employed (Chodorow et al., 2007; Gamon et al., 2008; Lee and Knutsson, 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Tetreault et al., 2010; De Felice, 2008).",
        "All of the above works only use non-learner text for training.",
        "Recent work has shown that training on annotated learner text can give better performance (Han et al., 2010) and that the observed word used by the writer is an important feature (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b).",
        "However, training data has either been small (Izumi et al., 2003), only partly annotated (Han et al., 2010), or artificially created (Ro-zovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a).",
        "Almost no work has investigated ways to combine learner and non-learner text for training.",
        "The only exception is Gamon (2010), who combined features from the output of logistic-regression classifiers and language models trained on non-learner text in a meta-classifier trained on learner text.",
        "In this work, we show a more direct way to combine learner and non-learner text in a single model.",
        "Finally, researchers have investigated GEC in connection with web-based models in NLP (Lapata 2008).",

        "A classifier is trained to re-predict the word given the surrounding context.",
        "The confusion set of possible classes is usually pre-defined.",
        "This selection task formulation is convenient as training examples can be created \"for free\" from any text that is assumed to be free of grammatical errors.",
        "We define the more realistic correction task as follows: given a particular word and its context, propose an appropriate correction.",
        "The proposed correction can be identical to the observed word, i.e., no correction is necessary.",
        "The main difference is that the word choice of the writer can be encoded as part of the features.",
        "For article errors, the classes are the three articles a, the, and the zero-article.",
        "This covers article insertion, deletion, and substitution errors.",
        "During training, each noun phrase (NP) in the training data is one training example.",
        "When training on learner text, the correct class is the article provided by the human annotator.",
        "When training on non-learner text, the correct class is the observed article.",

        "During testing, each NP in the test set is one test example.",
        "The correct class is the article provided by the human annotator when testing on learner text or the observed article when testing on non-learner text.",
        "The approach to preposition errors is similar to articles but typically focuses on preposition substitution errors.",
        "In our work, the classes are 36 frequent English prepositions (about, along, among, around, as, at, beside, besides, between, by, down, during, except for from in inside into of off on onto outside, over, through, to, toward, towards, under, underneath, until, up, upon, with, within, without), which we adopt from previous work.",

        "The results are shown in Table 2.",
