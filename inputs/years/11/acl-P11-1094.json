        "We show how to use the EM algorithm to learn the parameters of the noise model, using only a data set of erroneous sentences, given the proper language model.",

        "The process of editing written text is performed by humans on a daily basis.",
        "Humans work by first identifying the writer's intent, and then transforming the text so that it is coherent and error free.",
        "They can read text with several spelling errors and grammatical errors and still easily identify what the author originally meant to write.",
        "Unfortunately, current computer systems are still far from such capabilities when it comes to the task of recognizing incorrect text input.",
        "Various approaches have been taken, but to date it seems that even many spell checkers such as Aspell do not take context into consideration, which prevents them from finding misspellings which have the same form as valid words.",
        "Also, current grammar correction systems are mostly rule-based, searching the text for defined types of rule violations in the English grammar.",
        "While this approach has had some success in finding various grammatical errors, it is confined to specifically defined errors.",
        "In this paper, we approach this problem by modeling various types of human errors using a noisy channel model (Shannon, 1948).",
        "Correct sentences are produced by a predefined generative probabilistic model, and lesioned by the noise model.",
        "We learn the noise model parameters using an expectation-maximization (EM) approach (Dempster et al., 1977; Wu, 1983).",
        "Our model allows us to deduce the original intended sentence by looking for the the highest probability parses over the entire sentence, which leads to automated whole sentence spelling and grammar correction based on contextual information.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss previous work, followed by an explanation of our model and its implementation in Sections 3 and 4.",
        "In Section 5 we present a novel technique for evaluating the task of automated grammar and spelling correction, along with the data set we collected for our experiments.",
        "Our experiment results and discussion are in Section 6.",
        "Section 7 concludes this paper."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "Much of the previous work in the domain of automated grammar correction has focused on identifying grammatical errors.",
        "Chodorow and Leacock (2000) used an unsupervised approach to identifying grammatical errors by looking for contextual cues in a Â±2 word window around a target word.",
        "To identify errors, they searched for cues which did not appear in the correct usage of words.",
        "Eeg-olofsson and Knutsson (2003) used rule-based methods to approach the problem of discovering preposition and determiner errors of L2 writers, and various classifier-based methods using Maximum Entropy models have also been proposed (Izumi et al., 2003; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; De Felice and Pulman, 2008).",
        "Some classifier-based methods can be used not only to identify errors, but also to determine suggestions for corrections by using the scores or probabilities from the classifiers for other possible words.",
        "While this is a plausible approach for grammar correction, there is one fundamental difference between this approach and the way humans edit.",
        "The output scores of classifiers do not take into account the observed erroneous word, changing the task of editing into a fill-in-the-blank selection task.",
        "In contrast, editing makes use of the writer's erroneous word which often encompasses information neccessary to correctly deduce the writer's intent.",
        "Generation-based approaches to grammar correction have also been taken, such as Lee and Sen-eff (2006), where sentences are paraphrased into an over-generated word lattice, and then parsed to select the best rephrasing.",
        "As with the previously mentioned approaches, these approaches often have the disadvantage of ignoring the writer's selected word when used for error correction instead of just error detection.",
        "Other work which relates to automated grammar correction has been done in the field of machine translation.",
        "Machine translation systems often generate output which is grammatically incorrect, and automated post-editing systems have been created to address this problem.",
        "For instance, when translating Japanese to English, the output sentence needs to be edited to include the correct articles, since the Japanese language does not contain articles.",
        "Knight and Chander (1994) address the problem of selecting the correct article for MT systems.",
        "These types of systems could also be used to facilitate grammar correction.",
        "While grammar correction can be used on the out-935 put of MT systems, note that the task of grammar correction itself can also be thought of as a machine translation task, where we are trying to 'translate' a sentence from an 'incorrect grammar' language to a 'correct grammar' language.",
        "Under this idea, the use of statistical machine translation techniques to correct grammatical errors has also been explored.",
        "Brockett et al.",
        "(2006) uses phrasal SMT techniques to identify and correct mass noun errors of ESL students.",
        "Desilets and Hermet (2009) use a round-trip translation from L2 to L1 and back to L2 to correct errors using an SMT system, focusing on errors which link back to the writer's native language.",
        "Despite the underlying commonality between the tasks of machine translation and grammar correction, there is a practical difference in that the field of grammar correction suffers from a lack of good quality parallel corpora.",
        "While machine translation has taken advantage of the plethora of translated documents and books, from which various corpora have been built, the field of grammar correction does not have this luxury.",
        "Annotated corpora of grammatical errors do exist, such as the NICT Japanese Learner of English corpus and the Chinese Learner English Corpus (Shichun and Huizhong, 2003), but the lack of definitive corpora often makes obtaining data for use in training models a task within itself, and often limits the approaches which can be taken.",
        "Using classification or rule-based systems for grammatical error detection has proven to be successful to some extent, but many approaches are not sufficient for real-world automated grammar correction for various of reasons.",
        "First, as we have already mentioned, classification systems and generation-based systems do not make full use of the given data when trying to make a selection.",
        "This limits the system's ability to make well-informed edits which match the writer's original intent.",
        "Second, many of the systems start with the assumption that there is only one type of error.",
        "However, ESL students often make several combined mistakes in one sentence.",
        "These combined mistakes can throw off error detection/correction schemes which assume that the rest of the sentence is correct.",
        "For example, if a student erroneously writes 'much poeple' instead of 'many people', a system trying to correct 'many/much' errors may skip correction of much to many because it does not have any reference to the misspelled word 'poeple'.",
        "Thus there are advantages in looking at the sentence as a whole, and creating models which allow several types of errors to occur within the same sentence.",
        "We now present our model, which supports the addition of various types of errors into one combined model, and derives its response by using the whole of the observed sentence."

        "Our noisy channel model consists of two main components, a base language model and a noise model.",
        "The base language model is a probabilistic language model which generates an 'error-free' sentence with a given probability.",
        "The probabilistic noise model then takes this sentence and decides whether or not to make it erroneous by inserting various types of errors, such as spelling mistakes, article choice errors, wordform choice errors, etc., based on its parameters (see Figure 1 for example).",
        "Using this model, we can find the posterior probability p(Scn-ig\\Sobs) using Bayes rule where S^ig is the original sentence created by our base language model, and Sobs is the observed erroneous sentence.",
        "For the language model, we can use various known probabilistic models which already have defined methods for learning the parameters, such as n-gram models or PCFGs.",
        "For the noise model, we need some way to learn the parameters for the mistakes that a group of specified writers (such as Korean ESL students) make.",
        "We address this issue in Section 4.",
        "Using this model, we can find the highest likelihood error-free sentence for an observed output sentence by tracing all possible paths from the language model through the noise model and ending in the observed sentence as output."

      "heading": "4. Implementation",
      "text": [
        "To actually implement our model, we use a bigram model for the base language model, and various noise models which introduce spelling errors, article choice errors, preposition choice errors, etc.",
        "All models are implemented using weighted finite-state tranducers (wFST).",
        "For operations on the wF-STs, we use OpenFST (Allauzen et al., 2007), along with expectation semiring code supplied by Markus Dryer for Dreyer et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "The base language model is a bigram model implemented by using a weighted finite-state transducer (wFST).",
        "The model parameters are learned from the British National Corpus modified to use American English spellings with Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "To lower our memory usage, only bigrams whose words are found in the observed sentences, or are determined to be possible candidates for the correct words of the original sentence (due to the noise models) are used.",
        "While we use a bigram model here for simplicity, any probabilistic language model having a tractable intersection with wFSTs could be used.",
        "For the bigram model, each state in the wFST represents a bigram context, except the end state.",
        "The arcs of the wFST are set so that the weight is the bigram probability of the output word given the context specified by the from state, and the output word is a word of the vocabulary.",
        "Thus, given a set of n words in the vocabulary, the language model wFST had one start state, from which n arcs extended to each of their own context states.",
        "From each of these nodes, n + 1 arcs extend to each of the n context states and the end state.",
        "Thus the number of states in the language model is n + 2 and the number of arcs is O(n).",
        "For our noise model, we created a weighted finite-state transducer (wFST) which accepts error-free input, and outputs erroneous sentences with a specified probability.",
        "To model various types of human errors, we created several different noise models and composed them together, creating a layered noise model.",
        "The noise models we implement are spelling errors, article choice errors, preposition choice errors, and insertion errors, which we will explain in more detail later in this section.",
        "The basic design of each noise wFST starts with an initial state, which is also the final state of the wFST.",
        "For each word found in the language model, an arc going from the initial state to itself is created, with the input and output values set as the word.",
        "These arcs model the case of no error being made.",
        "In addition to these arcs, arcs representing prediction errors are also inserted.",
        "For example, in the article choice error model, an arc is added for each possible (input, output) article pair, such as a:an for making the mistake of writing an instead of a.",
        "The weights of the arcs are the probabilities of introducing errors, given the input word from the language model.",
        "For example, the noise model shown in Figure 2 shows a noise model in which a will be written correctly with a probability of 0.9, and will be changed to an or the with probabilities 0.03 and 0.07, respectively.",
        "For this model to work correctly, the setting of the probabilities for each error is required.",
        "How this is done is explained in Section 4.3.",
        "The spelling error noise model accounts for spelling errors made by writers.",
        "For spelling errors, we allowed all spelling errors which were a Damerau-Levenshtein distance of 1 (Damerau, 1964; Levenshtein, 1966).",
        "While allowing a DL distance of 2 or higher may likely have better performance, the model was constrained to a distance of 1 due to memory constraints.",
        "We specified one parameter \\n for each possible word length n. This parameter is the total probability of making a spelling error for a given word length.",
        "For each word length distributed the probability of each possible spelling error equally.",
        "Thus for word length n, we have n deletion errors, 25n substitution errors, n â 1 transposition errors, and 26(n + 1) insertion errors, and the probability for each possible error is .OK. â Xr\\ .oa,.",
        "-i\\.",
        "We set the maximum word length for spelling errors to 22, giving us 22 parameters.",
        "The article choice error noise model simulates incorrect selection of articles.",
        "In this model we learn n( n â 1) parameters, one for each article pair.",
        "Since there are only 3 articles (a, an, the), we only have 6 parameters for this model.",
        "The preposition choice error noise model simulates incorrect selection of prepositions.",
        "We take the 12 most commonly misused prepositions by ESL writers (Gamon et al., 2009) and specify one parameter for each preposition pair, as we do in the article choice error noise model, giving us a total of 132 parameters.",
        "The wordform choice error noise model simulates choosing the incorrect wordform of a word.",
        "For example, choosing the incorrect tense of a verb (e.g. went â go), or the incorrect number marking on a noun or verb (e.g. are â is) would be a part of this model.",
        "This error model has one parameter for every number of possible inflections, up to a maximum of 12 inflections, giving us 12 parameters.",
        "The parameter is the total probability of choosing the wrong inflection of a word, and the probability is spread evenly between each possible inflection.",
        "We used CELEX (Baayen et al., 1995) to find all the possible wordforms of each observed word.",
        "The word insertion error model simulates the addition of extraneous words to the original sentence.",
        "We create a list of words by combining the prepositions and articles found in the article choice and preposition choice errors.",
        "We assume that the words on the list have a probability of being inserted erroneously.",
        "There is a parameter for each word, which is the probability of that word being inserted.",
        "Thus we have 15 parameters for this noise model.",
        "To achieve maximum performance, we wish to learn the parameters of the noise models.",
        "If we had a large set of erroneous sentences, along with a handannotated list of the specific errors and their corrections, it would be possible to do some form of supervised learning to find the parameters.",
        "We looked at the NICT Japanese Learner of English (JLE) corpus, which is a corpus of transcripts of 1,300 Japanese learners' English oral proficiency interview.",
        "This corpus has been annotated using an error tagset (Izumi et al., 2004).",
        "However, because the JLE corpus is a set of transcribed sentences, it is in a different domain from our task.",
        "The Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC) contains erroneous sentences which have been annotated, but the CLEC corpus had too many manual errors, such as typos, as well as many incorrect annotations, making it very difficult to automate the processing.",
        "Many of the corrections themselves were also incorrect.",
        "We were not able to find of a set of annotated errors which fit our task, nor are we aware that such a set exists.",
        "Instead, we collected a large data set of possibly erroneous sentences from Korean ESL students (Section 5.1).",
        "Since these sentences are not annotated, we need to use an unsupervised learning method to learn our parameters.",
        "To learn the parameters of the noise models, we assume that the collected sentences are random output of our model, and train our model using the EM algorithm.",
        "This was done by making use of the V-expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002).",
        "The V-expectation semiring is a semiring in which the weight is defined as R>0 x V, where R can be used to keep track of the probability, and V is a vector which can be used to denote arc traversal counts or feature counts.",
        "The weight for each of the arcs in the noise models was set so that the real value was the probability and the vector V denoted which choice (having a specified error or not) was made by selecting the arc.",
        "We create a generative language-noise model by composing the language model wFST with the noise model wFSTs, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "By using the expectation semiring, we can keep track of the probability of each path going over an erroneous^g",
        "Figure 3: Example of language model (top) and noise model (middle) wFST composition.",
        "The vector of the V-expectation semiring weight is in brackets.",
        "The first value of the vector denotes no error being made on writing 'a' and the second value denotes the error of writing 'an' instead of 'a'",
        "arc or non-erroneous arc.",
        "Once our model is set up for the E step using the initial parameters, we must compute the expected number of noise model arc traversals for use in calculating our new parameters.",
        "To do this, we need to find all possible paths resulting in the observed sentence as output, for each observed sentence.",
        "Then, for each possible path, we need to calculate the probability of the path given the output sentence, and get the expected counts of going over each erroneous and error-free arc to learn the parameters of the noise model.",
        "To find a wFST with just the possible paths for each observed sentence, we can compose the language-noise wFST with the observed sentence wFST.",
        "The observed sentence wFST is created in the following manner.",
        "Given an observed sentence, an initial state is created.",
        "For each word in the sentence, in the order appearing in the sentence, a new state is added, and an arc is created going from the previously added state to the newly added state.",
        "The new arc takes the observed word as input and also uses it as output.",
        "The weight/probability for each arc is set to 1.",
        "Composing the sentence wFST with the language-noise wFST has the effect of restricting the new wFST to only have sentences which output the observed sentence from the language-noise wFST.",
        "We now have a new wFST where all valid paths are the paths which can produce the observed sentence.",
        "To find the total weight of all paths, we first change all input and output symbols into the empty string.",
        "Since all arcs in this wFST are epsilon arcs, we can use the epsilon-removal operation (Mohri, 2002), which will reduce the wFST to one state with no arcs.",
        "This operation combines the total weight of all paths into the final weight of the sole state, giving us the total expectation value for that sentence.",
        "By doing this for each sentence, and adding the expectation values for each sentence, we can easily compute the expectation step, from which we can find the maximizing parameters and update our parameters accordingly.",
        "Once the parameters are learned, we can use our model to find the maximum likelihood error-free sentence.",
        "This is done by again creating the language model and noise model with the learned parameters, but this time we set the weights of the noise model to just the probabilities, using the log semiring, since we do not need to keep track of expected values.",
        "We also set the language model input for each arc to be the same word as the output, instead of using an empty string.",
        "Once again, we compose the language model with the noise models.",
        "We create a sentence wFST using the observed sentence we wish to correct, the same way the observed sentence wFST for training was created.",
        "This is now composed with the language-noise wFST.",
        "Now all we need to do is find the shortest path (when using minus-log probabilities) of the new wFST, and the input to that path will be our corrected sentence."

        "These were collected from open web postings by Korean ESL students asking for advice on their writing samples.",
        "In order to automate the process, a program was written to download the posts, and discard the posts that were deemed too short to be TOEFL writing samples^^",
        "Also discarded were the posts that had a \"[re\" or \"re..\" in the title.",
        "Next, all sentences containing Korean were removed, after which some characters were changed so that they were in ASCII form.",
        "The remaining text was separated into sentences solely by punctuation marks ., /, and ?.",
        "This resulted in the 478,350 sentences stated above.",
        "Due to the process, some of the sentences collected are actually sentence fragments, where punctuation had been misused.",
        "For training and evaluation purposes, the data set was split into a test set with 504 randomly selected sentences, an evaluation set of 1017 randomly selected sentences, and a training set composed of the remaining sentences.",
        "In the current literature, grammar correction tasks are often manually evaluated for each output correction, or evaluated by taking a set of proper sentences, artificially introducing some error, and seeing how well the algorithm fixes the error.",
        "Manual evaluation of automatic corrections may be the best method for getting a more detailed evaluation, but to do manual evaluation for every test output requires a large amount of human resources, in terms of both time and effort.",
        "In the case where artificial lesioning is introduced, the lesions may not always reflect the actual errors found in human data, and it is difficult to replicate the actual tendency of humans to make a variety of different mistakes in a single sentence.",
        "Thus, this method of evaluation, which may be suitable for evaluating the correction performance of specific grammatical errors, would not be fit for evaluating our model's overall performance.",
        "For evaluation of the given task, we have incorporated evaluation techniques based on current evaluation techniques used in machine translation, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).",
        "Machine translation addresses the problem of changing a sentence in one language to a sentence of another.",

        "Each sentence was given to 8 workers, giving us a set of 8 or fewer corrected sentences for each erroneous sentence.",
        "We asked workers not to completely rewrite the sentences, but to maintain the original structure as much as possible.",
        "Each hit was comprised of 6 sentences, and the reward for each hit was 10 cents.",
        "To ensure the quality of our manually corrected sentences, a native English speaker research assistant went over each of the 'corrected' sentences and marked them as correct or incorrect.",
        "We then removed all the incorrect 'corrections'.",
        "Using our manually corrected reference sentences, we evaluate our model's correction performance using METEOR and BLEU.",
        "Since METEOR and BLEU are fully automated after we have our reference translations (manual corrections), we can run evaluation on our tests without any need for further manual input.",
        "While these two evaluation methods were created for machine translation, they also have the potential of being used in the field of grammar correction evaluation.",
        "One difference between machine translation and our task is that finding the right lemma is in itself something to be rewarded in MT, but is not sufficient for our task.",
        "In this respect, evaluation of grammar correction should be more strict.",
        "Thus, for METEOR, we used the 'exact' module for evaluation.",

        "It is also notable that finding corrections for the sentences is a much easier task than finding various correct translations, since the task of editing is much easier and can be done by a much larger set of qualified people."

        "Aspell lists the suggested spelling corrections of misspelled words in a ranked order, so we replaced each misspelled word found by Aspell with the word with the highest rank (lowest score) for the Aspell corrections.",
        "One difference between Aspell and our model is that Aspell only corrects words which do not appear in the dictionary, while our method looks at all words, even those found in the dictionary.",
        "Thus our model can correct words which look correct by themselves, but seem to be incorrect due to the bigram context.",
        "Another difference is that Aspell has the capability to split words, whereas our model does not allow the insertion of spaces.",
        "A comparison of the scores is shown in Table 2.",
        "We can see that our model has better performance, due to better word selection, despite the advantage that Aspell has by using phonological information to find the correct word, and the disadvantage that our model is restricted to spellings which are within a Damerau-Levenstein distance of 1.",
        "This is due to the fact that our model is context-sensitive, and can use other information in addition to the misspelled word.",
        "For example, the sentence 'In contast, high prices of products would be the main reason for dislike.'",
        "was edited in Aspell by changing 'con-tast' to 'contest', while our model correctly selected 'contrast'.",
        "The sentence 'So i can reach the theater in ten minuets by foot' was not edited by Aspell, but our model changed 'minuets' to 'minutes'.",
        "Another difference that can be seen by looking through the results is that Aspell changes every word not found in the dictionary, while our algorithm allows words it has not seen by treating them as unknown tokens.",
        "Since we are using smoothing, these tokens are left in place if there is no other high probability bigram to take its place.",

        "We have introduced a novel way of finding grammar and spelling corrections, which uses the EM algorithm to train the parameters of our noisy channel approach.",
        "One of the benefits of this approach is that it does not require a parallel set of erroneous sentences and their corrections.",
        "Also, our model is not confined to a specific error, and various error models may be added on.",
        "For training our noise model, all that is required is finding erroneous data sets.",
        "Depending on which domain you are training on, this can also be quite feasible as we have shown by our collection of Korean ESL students' erroneous writing samples.",
        "Our data set could have been for ESL students of any native language, or could also be a data set of other groups such as young native English speakers, or the whole set of English speakers for grammar correction.",
        "Using only these data sets, we can train our noisy channel model, as we have shown using a bigram language model, and a wFST for our noise model.",
        "We have also shown how to use weighted finite-state transducers and the expectation semiring, as well as wFST algorithms implemented in OpenFST to train the model using EM.",
        "For evaluation, we have introduced a novel way of evaluating grammar corrections, using MT evaluation methods, which we have not seen in other grammar correction literature.",
        "The produced corrections show the restrictions of using a bigram language model.",
        "For future work, we plan to use a more accurate language model, and add more types of complex error models, such as word deletion and word ordering error models to improve performance and address other types of errors."
