        "Perhaps the most obvious and far-reaching application is geographic information retrieval (Ding et al., 2000; Martins, 2009; Andogah, 2010), with applications like MetaCarta's geographic text search (Rauch et al., 2003) and NewsStand (Teitler et al., 2008); these allow users to browse and search for content through a geocentric interface.",
        "The Perseus project performs automatic toponym resolution on historical texts in order to display a map with each text showing the locations that are mentioned (Smith and Crane, 2001); Google Books also does this for some books, though the toponyms are identified and resolved quite crudely.",

        "Determining a single location of a document is only a well-posed problem for certain documents, generally of fairly small size, but there are a number of natural situations in which such collections arise.",
        "For example, a great number of articles in Wikipedia have been manually geotagged; this allows those articles to appear in their geographic locations while geobrowsing in an application like Google Earth.",

        "For document geoloca-tion, Overell uses a simple model that makes use only of the metadata available (article title, incoming and outgoing links, etc.",
        ") – the actual article text is not used at all.",

        "Performance is measured both on geo-tagged Wikipedia articles (Overell, 2009) and tweets (Eisenstein et al., 2010).",

        "Wikipedia articles generally cover a single subject; in addition, most articles that refer to geographically fixed subjects are geotagged with their coordinates.",
        "Such articles are well-suited as a source of supervised content for document geolocation purposes.",
        "Furthermore, the existence of versions in multiple languages means that the techniques in this paper can easily be extended to cover documents written in many of the world's most common languages.",
        "Wikipedia's geotagged articles encompass more than just cities, geographic formations and landmarks.",
        "For example, articles for events (like the shooting of JFK) and vehicles (such as the frigate USS Constitution) are geotagged.",
        "The latter type of article is actually quite challenging to geolocate based on the text content: though the ship is moored in Boston, most of the page discusses its role in various battles along the eastern seaboard of the USA.",
        "However, such articles make up only a small fraction of the geotagged articles.",
        "For the experiments in this paper, we used a full dump of Wikipedia from September 4, 2010.",
        "Included in this dump is a total of 10,355,226 articles, of which 1,019,490 have been geotagged.",
        "Excluding various types of special-purpose articles used primarily for maintaining the site (specifically, redirect articles and articles outside the main namespace), the dump includes 3,431,722 content-bearing articles, of which 488,269 are geotagged.",
        "It is necessary to process the raw dump to obtain the plain text, as well as metadata such as geo-tagged coordinates.",

        "Automatically-processed versions of the English-language Wikipedia site are provided by Metaweb, which at first glance promised to significantly simplify the preprocessing.",
        "Unfortunately, these versions still need significant processing and they incorrectly eliminate some of the important metadata.",

        "(2010) use Gaussian distributions to model the locations of Twitter users in the United States of America.",
        "This appears to work reasonably well for that restricted region, but is likely to run into problems when predicting locations for anywhere on earth – instead, spherical distributions like the von Mises-Fisher distribution would need to be employed.",
        "We take here the simpler alternative of discretiz-ing the earth's surface with a geodesic grid; this allows us to predict locations with a variety of standard approaches over discrete outcomes.",
        "There are many ways of constructing geodesic grids.",

        "(2009), we use the simplest strategy: a grid of square cells of equal degree, such as 1° by 1°.",
        "This produces variable-size regions that shrink latitudinally, becoming progressively smaller and more elongated the closer they get towards the poles.",
        "Other strategies, such as the quaternary triangular mesh (Dutton, 1996), preserve equal area, but are considerably more complex to implement.",
        "Given that most of the populated regions of interest for us are closer to the equator than not and that we use cells of quite fine granularity (down to 0.05°), the simple grid system was preferable.",
        "With such a discrete representation of the earth's surface, there are four distributions that form the core of all our geolocation methods.",
        "The first is a standard multinomial distribution over the vocabulary for every cell in the grid.",
        "Given a grid G with cells Cj and a vocabulary V with words Wj, we have 6Cij = P(wj |cj).",
        "The second distribution is the equivalent distribution for a single test document dk, i.e. 9dkj = P(wj|dk).",
        "The third distribution is the reverse of the first: for a given word, its distribution over the earth's cells, Kj = P(c |wj).",
        "The final distribution is over the cells, y% = P(ci).",
        "This grid representation ignores all higher level regions, such as states, countries, rivers, and mountain ranges, but it is consistent with the geocod-ing in both the Wikipedia and Twitter datasets.",
        "Nonetheless, note that the Kj for words referring to such regions is likely to be much flatter (spread out) but with most of the mass concentrated in a set of connected cells.",

        "The geolocation methods predict a cell c for a document, and the latitude and longitude of the degree-midpoint of the cell is used as the predicted location.",
        "Prediction error is the great-circle distance from these predicted locations to the locations given by the gold standard.",
        "The use of cell midpoints provides a fair comparison for predictions with different cell sizes.",
        "This differs from the evaluation metrics used by Serdyukov et al.",
        "(2009), which are all computed relative to a given grid size.",
        "With their metrics, results for different granularities cannot be directly compared because using larger cells means less ambiguity when choosing c. With our distance-based evaluation, large cells are penalized by the distance from the midpoint to the actual location even when that location is in the same cell.",
        "Smaller cells reduce this penalty and permit the word distributions 9Cij to be much more specific for each cell, but they are harder to predict exactly and suffer more from sparse word counts compared to courser granularity.",
        "For large datasets like Wikipedia, fine-grained grids work very well, but the trade-off between resolution and sufficient training material shows up more clearly for the smaller Twitter dataset."

        "Location error on these is usually quite large.",
        "However, prediction is quite good for ships that were sunk in particular battles which are described in detail on the page; examples are the USS Gambier Bay, USS Hammann (DD412), and the HMS Majestic (1895).",
        "Another situation that gives good results is when a ship is retired in a location where it is a prominent feature and is thus mentioned in the training set at that location.",
        "An example is the USS Turner Joy, which is in Bremerton, Washington and figures prominently in the page for Bremerton (which is in the training set).",
        "Another interesting aspect of geolocating ship articles is that ships tend to end up sunk in remote battle locations, such that their article is the only one located in the cell covering the location in the training set.",
        "Ship terminology thus dominates such cells, with the effect that our models often (incorrectly) geolocate test articles about other ships to such locations (and often about ships with similar properties).",
        "This also leads to generally more accurate geolocation of HMS ships over USS ships; the former seem to have been sunk in more concentrated regions that are themselves less spread out globally."

        "We have shown that automatic identification of the location of a document based only on its text can be performed with high accuracy using simple supervised methods and a discrete grid representation of the earth's surface.",
        "All of our methods are simple to implement, and both training and testing can be easily parallelized.",
        "Our most effective geolocation strategy finds the grid cell whose word distribution has the smallest KL divergence from that of the test document, and easily beats several effective baselines.",
        "We predict the location of Wikipedia pages to a median error of 11.8 km and mean error of 221 km.",
        "For Twitter, we obtain a median error of 479 km and mean error of 967 km.",
        "Using naive Bayes and a simple averaging of word-level cell distributions also both worked well; however, KL was more effective, we believe, because it weights the words in the document most heavily, and thus puts less importance on the less specific word distributions of each cell.",
        "Though we only use text, link-based predictions using the follower graph, as Backstrom et al.",
        "(2010) do for Facebook, could improve results on the Twitter task considered here.",
        "It could also help with Wikipedia, especially for buildings: for example, the page for Independence Hall in Philadelphia links to geotagged \"friend\" pages for Philadelphia, the Liberty Bell, and many other nearby locations and buildings.",
        "However, we note that we are still primarily interested in geolocation with only text because there are a great many situations in which such linked structure is unavailable.",
        "This is especially true for historical corpora like those made available by the Perseus project.",
        "The task of identifying a single location for an entire document provides a convenient way of evaluating approaches for connecting texts with locations, but it is not fully coherent in the context of documents that cover multiple locations.",
        "Nonetheless, both the average cell probability and naive Bayes models output a distribution over all cells, which could be used to assign multiple locations.",
        "Furthermore, these cell distributions could additionally be used to define a document level prior for resolution of individual toponyms.",
        "Though we treated the grid resolution as a parameter, the grids themselves form a hierarchy of cells containing finer-grained cells.",
        "Given this, there are a number of obvious ways to combine predictions from different resolutions.",
        "For example, given a cell of the finest grain, the average cell probability and naive Bayes models could successively back off to the values produced by their coarser-grained containing cells, and KL divergence could be summed from finest-to-coarsest grain.",
        "Another strategy for making models less sensitive to grid resolution is to smooth the per-cell word distributions over neighboring cells; this strategy improved results on Flickr photo geolocation for Serdyukov et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "An additional area to explore is to remove the bag-of-words assumption and take into account the ordering between words.",
        "This should have a number of obvious benefits, among which are sensitivity to multi-word toponyms such as New York, collocations such as London, Ontario or London in Ontario, and highly indicative terms such as egg cream that are made up of generic constituents."
