        "In contrast to work in relation discovery that focuses on learning atomic facts (Banko et al., 2007a; Carlson et al., 2010), templates can extract a richer representation of a particular domain.",
        "However, unlike relation discovery, most template-based IE approaches assume foreknowledge of the domain's templates.",
        "Very little work addresses how to learn the template structure itself.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to perform the standard template filling task, but to first automatically induce the templates from an unlabeled corpus.",

        "A semantic role, such as target, is a cluster of syntactic functions of the template's event words (e.g., the objects of detonate and explode).",
        "Our goal is to characterize a domain by learning this template structure completely automatically.",
        "We learn templates by first clustering event words based on their proximity in a training corpus.",
        "We then use a novel approach to role induction that clusters the syntactic functions of these events based on selectional preferences and coreferring arguments.",
        "The induced roles are template-specific (e.g., perpetrator), not universal (e.g., agent or patient) or verb-specific.",

        "Learned patterns represent binary relations, and they show how to construct tables of extracted entities for these relations.",
        "Our approach draws on this idea of using un-labeled documents to discover relations in text, and of defining semantic roles by sets of entities.",

        "We will extend their work by showing how to learn without these assumptions, obviating the need for redundant documents, and learning templates with any type and any number of slots.",
