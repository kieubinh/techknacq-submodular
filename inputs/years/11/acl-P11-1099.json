        "We investigate a new task in the computational analysis of arguments: the classification of arguments by the argumentation schemes that they use.",
        "An argumentation scheme, informally, is a framework or structure for a (possibly defeasible) argument; we will give a more-formal definition and examples in Section 3.",
        "Our work is motivated by the need to determine the unstated (or implicitly stated) premises that arguments written in natural language normally draw on.",
        "Such premises are called enthymemes.",
        "For instance, the argument in Example 1 consists of one explicit premise (the first sentence) and a conclusion (the second sentence):",
        "Example 1 [Premise:] The survival of the entire world is at stake.",
        "[Conclusion:] The treaties and covenants aiming for a world free ofnuclear arsenals and other conventional and biological weapons ofmass destruction should be adhered to scrupulously by all nations.",
        "Another premise is left implicit – \"Adhering to those treaties and covenants is a means ofrealizing survival of the entire world\".",
        "This proposition is an enthymeme of this argument.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to reconstruct the en-thymemes in an argument, because determining these unstated assumptions is an integral part of understanding, supporting, or attacking an entire argument.",
        "Hence reconstructing enthymemes is an important problem in argument understanding.",
        "We believe that first identifying the particular argumentation scheme that an argument is using will help to bridge the gap between stated and unstated propositions in the argument, because each argumentation scheme is a relatively fixed \"template\" for arguing.",
        "That is, given an argument, we first classify its argumentation scheme; then we fit the stated propositions into the corresponding template; and from this we infer the enthymemes.",
        "In this paper, we present an argument scheme classification system as a stage following argument detection and proposition classification.",
        "First in Section 2 and Section 3, we introduce the background to our work, including related work in this field, the two core concepts of argumentation schemes and scheme-sets, and the Araucaria dataset.",
        "In Section 4 and Section 5 we present our classification system, including the overall framework, data preprocessing, feature selection, and the experimental setups.",
        "In the remaining section, we present the essential approaches to solve the leftover problems of this paper which we will study in our future work, and discuss the experimental results, and potential directions for future work."

        "And the portion below the dashed round-rectangle represents our long-term goal – to reconstruct the implicit premise(s) in an argument, given its argumentation scheme and its explicit conclusion and premise(s) as input.",
        "Since argument detection and classification are not the topic of this paper, we assume here that the input conclusion and premise(s) have already been retrieved, segmented, and classified, as for example by the methods of Mochales and Moens (see Section 2 above).",
        "And the scheme template fitter is the topic of our ongoing work.",
        "From all arguments in Araucaria, we first extract those annotated in accordance with Walton's scheme-set.",
        "Then we break each complex AU node into several simple AUs where no conclusion or premise proposition nodes have embedded AU nodes.",
        "From these generated simple arguments, we extract those whose scheme falls into one of the five most frequent schemes as described in Table 1.",
        "Furthermore, we remove all enthymemes that have been inserted by the annotator and ignore any argument with a missing conclusion, since the input to our proposed classifier, as depicted in Figure 1, cannot have any access to unstated argumentative propositions.",
        "The resulting preprocessed dataset is composed of 393 arguments, of which 149, 106, 53, 44, and 41 respectively belong to the five schemes in the order shown in Table 1.",
        "The features used in our work fall into two categories: general features and scheme-specific features.",
        "General features are applicable to arguments belonging to any of the five schemes (shown in Table 2).",
        "For the features conLoc, premLoc, gap, and lenRat, we have two versions, differing in terms of their basic measurement unit: sentence-based and token-based.",
        "The final feature, type, indicates whether the premises contribute to the conclusion in a linked or convergent order.",
        "A linked argument (LA) is one that has two or more interdependent premise propositions, all of which are necessary to make the conclusion valid, whereas in a convergent argument (CA) exactly one premise proposition is sufficient to do so.",
        "Since it is observed that there exists a strong correlation between type and the particular scheme employed while arguing, we believe type can be a good indicator of argumentation scheme.",
        "However, although this feature is available to us because it is included in the Araucaria annotations, its value cannot be obtained from raw text as easily as other features mentioned above; but it is possible that we will in the future be able to determine it automatically by taking advantage of some scheme-independent cues such as the discourse relation between the conclusion and the premises.",
        "Scheme-specific features are different for each scheme, since each scheme has its own cue phrases or patterns.",
        "The features for each scheme are shown in Table 3 (for complete lists of features see Feng (2010)).",

        "The task of the argument template fitter is to map each explicitly stated conclusion and premise into the corresponding position in its scheme template and to extract the information necessary for en-thymeme reconstruction.",
        "Here we propose a syntax-based approach for this stage, which is similar to tasks in information retrieval.",
        "This can be best explained by the argument in Example 1, which uses the particular argumentation scheme practical reasoning.",

        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to classify argumentation schemes.",
        "In our experiments, we have focused on the five most frequently used schemes in Walton's scheme-set, and conducted two kinds of classification: in one-against-others classification, we achieved over 90% best average accuracies for two schemes, with other three schemes in the 60s to 70s; and in pairwise classification, we obtained 80% to 90% best average accuracies for most scheme pairs.",
        "The poor performance of our classification system on other experimental setups is partly due to the lack oftrain-ing examples or to insufficient world knowledge.",
        "Completion of our scheme classification system will be a step towards our ultimate goal of reconstructing the enthymemes in an argument by the procedure depicted in Figure 1.",
        "Because of the significance of enthymemes in reasoning and arguing, this is crucial to the goal of understanding arguments.",
        "But given the still-premature state of research of argumentation in computational linguistics, there are many practical issues to deal with first, such as the construction of richer training corpora and improvement of the performance of each step in the procedure."
