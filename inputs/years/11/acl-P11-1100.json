        "In contrast, other relations (e.g., Elaboration and Evidence) usually order their nucleus before the satellite.",
        "If a text that uses non-canonical relation orderings is rewritten to use canonical orderings, it often improves text quality and coherence.",

        "The model is motivated by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995), which states that subsequent sentences in a locally coherent text are likely to continue to focus on the same entities as in previous sentences.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata op-erationalized Centering Theory by creating an entity grid model to capture discourse entity transitions at the sentence-to-sentence level, and demonstrated their model's ability to discern coherent texts from incoherent ones.",
        "Barzilay and Lee (2004) proposed a domain-dependent HMM model to capture topic shift in a text, where topics are represented by hidden states and sentences are observations.",
        "The global coherence of a text can then be summarized by the overall probability of topic shift from the first sentence to the last.",
        "Following these two directions, Soricut and Marcu (2006) and Eisner et al.",
        "(2007) combined the entity-based and HMM-based models and demonstrated that these two models are complementary to each other in coherence assessment.",
        "Our approach differs from these models in that it introduces and operationalizes another indicator of discourse coherence, by modeling a text's discourse relation transitions.",
        "Karamanis (2007) has tried to integrate local discourse relations into the Centering-based coherence metrics for the task of information ordering, but was not able to obtain improvement over the baseline method, which is partly due to the much smaller data set and the way the discourse relation information is utilized in heuristic constraints and rules.",
        "To implement our proposal, we need to identify the text's discourse relations.",
        "This task, discourse parsing, has been a recent focus of study in the natural language processing (NLP) community, largely enabled by the availability of large-scale discourse annotated corpora (Wellner and Pustejovsky, 2007; Elwell and Baldridge, 2008; Lin et al., 2009; Pitler et al., 2009; Pitler and Nenkova, 2009; Lin et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010).",
