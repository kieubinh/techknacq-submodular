        "In this work, we seek to formalize the ways speakers position themselves in discourse.",
        "We do this in a way that maintains a notion of discourse structure, and which can be aggregated to evaluate a speaker's overall stance in a dialogue.",
        "We define the body of work in positioning to include any attempt to formalize the processes by which speakers attempt to influence or give evidence of their relations to each other.",
        "Constructs such as Initiative and Control (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988), which attempt to operationalize the authority over a discourse's structure, fall under the umbrella of positioning.",
        "As we construe positioning, it also includes work on detecting certainty and confusion in speech (Liscombe et al., 2005), which models a speaker's understanding of the information in their statements.",
        "Work in dialogue act tagging is also relevant, as it seeks to describe the actions and moves with which speakers display these types of positioning (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "To complement these bodies of work, we choose to focus on the question of how speakers position themselves as authoritative in a discourse.",
        "This means that we must describe the way speakers introduce new topics or discussions into the discourse; the way they position themselves relative to that topic; and how these functions interact with each other.",
        "While all of the tasks mentioned above focus on specific problems in the larger rhetorical question of speaker positioning, none explicitly address this framing of authority.",
        "Each does have valuable ties to the work that we would like to do, and in section 2, we describe prior work in each of those areas, and elaborate on how each relates to our questions.",
        "We measure this as an authoritativeness ratio.",
        "Of the contentful dialogue moves made by a speaker, in what fraction of those moves is the speaker positioned as the primary authority on that topic?",
        "To measure this quantitatively, we introduce the Negotiation framework, a construct from the field of systemic functional linguistics (SFL), which addresses specifically the concepts that we are interested in.",
        "We present a reproducible formulation of this sociolinguistics research in section 3, along with our preliminary findings on reliability between human coders, where we observe inter-rater agreement of 0.71.",
        "Applying this coding scheme to data, we see strong correlations with important motivational constructs such as Self-Efficacy (Bandura, 1997) as well as learning gains.",
        "Next, we address automatic coding of the Negotiation framework, which we treat as a twodimensional classification task.",
        "One dimension is a set of codes describing the authoritative status of a contribution.",
        "The other dimension is a segmentation task.",
        "We impose constraints on both of these models based on the structure observed in the work of SFL.",
        "These constraints are formulated as boolean statements describing what a correct label sequence looks like, and are imposed on our model using an Integer Linear Programming formulation (Roth and Yih, 2004).",
        "In section 5, this model is evaluated on a subset of the MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) and shows a high correlation with human judgements of authoritativeness (r = 0.947).",

      "text": [
        "The Negotiation framework, as formulated by the SFL community, places a special emphasis on how speakers function in a discourse as sources or recipients of information or action.",
        "We break down this concept into a set of codes, one code per contribution.",
        "Before we break down the coding scheme more concretely in section 3, it is important to understand why we have chosen to introduce a new framework, rather than reusing existing computational work.",
        "Much work has examined the emergence of discourse structure from the choices speakers make at the linguistic and intentional level (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986).",
        "For instance, when a speaker asks a question, it is expected to be followed with an answer.",
        "In discourse analysis, this notion is described through dialogue games (Carlson, 1983), while conversation analysis frames the structure in terms of adjacency pairs (Schegloff, 2007).",
        "These expectations can be viewed under the umbrella of conditional relevance (Levinson, 2000), and the exchanges can be labelled discourse segments.",
        "In prior work, the way that people influence discourse structure is described through the two tightly-related concepts of initiative and control.",
        "A speaker who begins a discourse segment is said to have initiative, while control accounts for which speaker is being addressed in a dialogue (Whittaker and Sten-ton, 1988).",
        "As initiative passes back and forth between discourse participants, control over the conversation similarly transfers from one speaker to another (Walker and Whittaker, 1990).",
        "This relation is often considered synchronous, though evidence suggests that the reality is not straightforward (Jordan and Di Eugenio, 1997).",
        "Research in initiative and control has been applied in the form of mixed-initiative dialogue systems (Smith, 1992).",
        "This is a large and active field, with applications in tutorial dialogues (Core, 2003), human-robot interactions (Peltason and Wrede, 2010), and more general approaches to effective turn-taking (Selfridge and Heeman, 2010).",
        "However, that body of work focuses on influencing discourse structure through positioning.",
        "The question that we are asking instead focuses on how speakers view their authority as a source of information about the topic of the discourse.",
        "In particular, consider questioning in discourse.",
        "In mixed-initiative analysis of discourse, asking a question always gives you control of a discourse.",
        "There is an expectation that your question will be followed by an answer.",
        "A speaker might already know the answer to a question they asked - for instance, when a teacher is verifying a student's knowledge.",
        "However, in most cases asking a question represents a lack of authority, treating the other speakers as a source for that knowledge.",
        "While there have been preliminary attempts to separate out these specific types of positioning in initiative, such as Chu-Carroll and Brown (1998), it has not been studied extensively in a computational setting.",
        "Another similar thread of research is to identify a speaker's certainty, that is, the confidence of a speaker and how that self-evaluation affects their language (Pon-Barry and Shieber, 2010).",
        "Substantial work has gone into automatically identifying levels of speaker certainty, for example in Liscombe difference between our work and this body of literature is that work on certainty has rarely focused on how state translates into interaction between speakers (with some exceptions, such as the application of certainty to tutoring dialogues (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2009)).",
        "Instead, the focus is on the person's self-evaluation, independent of the influence on the speaker's positioning within a discourse.",
        "Dialogue act tagging seeks to describe the moves people make to express themselves in a discourse.",
        "This task involves defining the role of each contribution based on its function (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "We know that there are interesting correlations between these acts and other factors, such as learning gains (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2006) and the relevance of a contribution for summarization (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003).",
        "However, adapting dialogue act tags to the question of how speakers position themselves is not straightforward.",
        "In particular, the granularity of these tagsets, which is already a highly debated topic (Popescu-Belis, 2008), is not ideal for the task we have set for ourselves.",
        "Many dialogue acts can be used in authoritative or non-authoritative ways, based on context, and can position a speaker as either giver or receiver of information.",
        "Thus these more general tagsets are not specific enough to the role of authority in discourse.",
        "Each of these fields of prior work is highly valuable.",
        "However, none were designed to specifically describe how people present themselves as a source or recipient of knowledge in a discourse.",
        "Thus, we have chosen to draw on a different field of sociolinguistics.",
        "Our formalization of that theory is described in the next section."

        "We now present the Negotiation framework, which we use to answer the questions left unanswered in the previous section.",
        "Within the field of SFL, this framework has been continually refined over the last three decades (Berry, 1981; Martin, 1992; Martin, 2003).",
        "It attempts to describe how speakers use their role as a source of knowledge or action to position themselves relative to others in a discourse.",
        "Applications of the framework include distinguishing between focus on teacher knowledge and student reasoning (Veel, 1999) and distribution of authority in juvenile trials (Martin et al., 2008).",
        "The framework can also be applied to problems similar to those studied through the lens of initiative, such as the distinction between authority over discourse structure and authority over content (Martin, 2000).",
        "A challenge of applying this work to language technologies is that it has historically been highly qualitative, with little emphasis placed on reproducibility.",
        "We have formulated a pared-down, reproducible version of the framework, presented in Section 3.1.",
        "Evidence of the usefulness of that formulation for identifying authority, and of correlations that we can study based on these codes, is presented briefly in Section 3.2.",
        "The codes that we can apply to a contribution using the Negotiation framework are comprised of four main codes, K1, K2, A1, and A2, and two additional codes, ch and o.",
        "This is a reduction over the many task-specific or highly contextual codes used in the original work.",
        "This was done to ensure that a machine learning classification task would not be overwhelmed with many infrequent classes.",
        "The main codes are divided by two questions.",
        "First, is the contribution related to exchanging information, or to exchanging services and actions?",
        "If the former, then it is a K move (knowledge); if the latter, then an A move (action).",
        "Second, is the contribution acting as a primary actor, or secondary?",
        "In the case of knowledge, this often correlates to the difference between assertions (K1) and queries (K2).",
        "For instance, a statement of fact or opinion is a K1: g K1 well i've got a great viewpoint here just below the east lake By contrast, asking for someone else's knowledge or opinion is a K2:",
        "g K2 what have you got underneath the",
        "east lake f K1 rocket launch In the case of action, the codes usually correspond to narrating action (A1) and giving instructions (A2), as below:_ g A2 go almost to the edge of the lake f A1 yeah A challenge move (ch) is one which directly contradicts the content or assertion of the previous line, or makes that previous contribution irrelevant.",
        "For instance, consider the exchange below, where an instruction is rejected because its presuppositions are broken by the challenging statement.",
        "g A2 then head diagonally down towards the bottom of the dead tree f chi have don't have a dead tree i have a dutch elm",
        "All moves that do not fit into one of these categories are classified as other (o).",
        "This includes back-channel moves, floor-grabbing moves, false starts, and any other non-contentful contributions.",
        "This theory makes use of discourse segmentation.",
        "Research in the SFL community has focused on intra-segment structure, and empirical evidence from this research has shown that exchanges between speakers follow a very specific pattern:",
        "Table 1: The six codes in our coding scheme, along with their frequency in our corpus of twenty conversations.",
        "That is to say, each segment contains a primary move (a K1 or an A1) and an optional preceding secondary move, with other non-contentful moves interspersed throughout.",
        "A single statement of fact would be a K1 move comprising an entire segment, while a single question/answer pair would be a K2 move followed by a K1.",
        "Longer exchanges of many lines obviously also occur.",
        "We iteratively developed a coding manual which describes, in a reproducible way, how to apply the codes listed above.",
        "The six codes we use, along with their frequency in our corpus, are given in Table 1.",
        "In the next section, we evaluate the reliability and utility of hand-coded data, before moving on to automation in section 4.",
        "This coding scheme was evaluated for reliability on two corpora using Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960).",
        "Within the social sciences community, a kappa above 0.7 is considered acceptable.",
        "Two conversations were each coded by hand by two trained annotators.",
        "The first conversation was between three students in a collaborative learning task; inter-rater reliability kappa for Negotiation labels was 0.78.",
        "The second conversation was from the MapTask corpus, and kappa was 0.71.",
        "Further data was labelled by hand by one trained annotator.",
        "In our work, we label conversations using the coding scheme above.",
        "To determine how well these codes correlate with other interesting factors, we choose to assign a quantitative measure of authoritativeness to each speaker.",
        "This measure can then be compared to other features of a speaker.",
        "To do this, we use the coded labels to assign an Authoritativeness Ratio to each speaker.",

        "Within these four main labels, there are clearly two that appear \"dominant\" - statements of fact or opinion, and commands or instructions - and two that appear less dominant - questions or requests for information, and narration of an action.",
        "We sum these together to reach a single numeric value for each speaker's projection of authority in the dialogue.",
        "The full details of our external validations of this approach are available in Howley et al.",
        "(2011).",
        "To summarize, we considered two data sets involving student collaborative learning.",
        "The first data set consisted of pairs of students interacting over two days, and was annotated for aggressive behavior, to assess warning factors in social interactions.",
        "Our analysis showed that aggressive behavior correlated with authoritativeness ratio (p < .05), and that less aggressive students became less authoritative in the second day (p < .05, effect size .15<r).",
        "The second data set was analyzed for Self-Efficacy - the confidence of each student in their own ability (Bandura, 1997) - as well as actual learning gains based on pre-and post-test scores.",
        "We found that the Authoritativeness ratio was a significant predictor of learning gains (r = .41, p < .04).",

        "Secondly, we use Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960) to judge improvement in accuracy over chance.",
        "The final evaluation is the rcoefficient computed between predicted and actual Authoritativeness ratios per speaker.",
        "This represents how much variance in authoritativeness is accounted for in the predicted ratios.",
        "This final metric is the most important for measuring reproducibility of human analyses of speaker authority in conversation.",
        "We use SIDE for feature extraction (Mayfield and Rose, 2010), SVM-Light for machine learning",
        "Table 2: Performance evaluation for our models.",
        "Each line is significantly improved in both accuracy and r error from the previous line (p < .01).",
        "(Joachims, 1999), and Learning-Based Java for ILP inference (Rizzolo and Roth, 2010).",
        "Performance is evaluated by 20-fold cross-validation, where each fold is trained on 19 conversations and tested on the remaining one.",
        "Statistical significance was calculated using a student's paired t-test.",
        "For accuracy and kappa, n = 20 (one data point per conversation) and for r, n = 40 (one data point per speaker).",
        "All classification results are given in Table 2 and charts showing correlation between predicted and actual speaker Authoritativeness ratios are shown in Figure 1.",
        "We observe that the baseline bag-of-words model performs well above random chance (kappa of 0.465); however, its accuracy is still very low and its ability to predict Authoritativeness ratio of a speaker is not particularly high (r of 0.354 with ratios from manually labelled data).",
        "We observe a significant improvement when ILP constraints are applied to this model.",
        "The contextual model described in section 4.2 performs better than our baseline constrained model.",
        "However, the gains found in the contextual model are somewhat orthogonal to the gains from using ILP constraints, as applying those constraints to the contextual model results in further performance gains (and a high r coefficient of 0.947).",
        "Our segmentation model was evaluated based on exact matches in boundaries.",
        "Switching from baseline to contextual features, we observe an improvement in accuracy of 2.6%.",

        "In this work we have presented one formulation of authority in dialogue.",
        "This formulation allows us to describe positioning in discourse in a way that is complementary to prior work in mixed-initiative dialogue systems and analysis of speaker certainty.",
        "Our model includes a simple understanding of discourse structure while also encoding information about the types of moves used, and the certainty of a speaker as a source ofinformation.",
        "This formulation is reproducible by human coders, with an inter-rater reliability of0.71.",
        "We have then presented a computational model for automatically applying these codes per contribution.",
        "In our best model, we see a good 68.4% accuracy on a six-way individual contribution labelling task.",
        "More importantly, this model replicates human analyses of authoritativeness very well, with an rcoefficient of 0.947.",
        "There is room for improvement in our model in future work.",
        "Further use of contextual features will more thoroughly represent the information we want our model to take into account.",
        "Our segmentation accuracy is also fairly low, and further examination ofsegmentation accuracy using amore sophisticated evaluation metric, such as WindowDiff(Pevznerand Hearst, 2002), would be helpful.",
        "In general, however, we now have an automated model that is reliable in reproducing human judgments of authoritativeness.",
        "We are now interested in how we can apply this to the larger questions of positioning we began this paper by asking, especially in describing speaker positioning at various instants throughout a single discourse.",
        "This will be the main thrust of our future work."
