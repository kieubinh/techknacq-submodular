        "Research in machine translation has focused broadly on two main goals, improving word choice and improving word order in translation output.",
        "Current machine translation metrics rely upon indirect methods for measuring the quality of the word order, and their ability to capture the quality of word order is poor (Birch et al., 2010).",
        "There are currently two main approaches to evaluating reordering.",
        "The first is exemplified by the Bleu score (Papineni et al., 2002), which counts the number of matching n-grams between the reference and the hypothesis.",
        "Word order is captured by the proportion of longer n-grams which match.",
        "This method does not consider the position of matching words, and only captures ordering differences if there is an exact match between the words in the translation and the reference.",
        "Another approach is taken by two other commonly used metrics, METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and TER (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "They both search for an alignment between the translation and the reference, and from this they calculate a penalty based on the number of differences in order between the two sentences.",
        "When block moves are allowed the search space is very large, and matching stems and synonyms introduces errors.",
        "Importantly, none of these metrics capture the distance by which words are out oforder.",
        "Also, they conflate reordering performance with the quality of the lexical items in the translation, making it difficult to tease apart the impact of changes.",
        "More sophisticated metrics, such as the RTE metric (Pad√≥ et al., 2009), use higher level syntactic or semantic analysis to determine the grammaticality of the output.",
        "These approaches require annotation and can be very slow to run.",
        "For most research, shallow metrics are more appropriate.",
        "We introduce a novel shallow metric, the Lexical Reordering Score (LRscore), which explicitly measures the quality of word order in machine translations and interpolates it with a lexical metric.",
        "This results in a simple, decomposable metric which makes it easy for researchers to pinpoint the effect of their changes.",
        "In this paper we show that the LRscore is more consistent with human judgements than other metrics for five out of eight different language pairs.",
        "We also apply the LRscore during Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) to see whether information on reordering allows the translation model to produce better reorderings.",
        "We show that humans prefer the output of systems trained with the LRscore 52.5% as compared to 43.9% when training with the Bleu score.",
        "Furthermore, training with the LRscore does not result in lower Bleu scores.",
        "The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the reordering and lexical metrics that are used and how they are combined.",
        "Section 3 presents the experiments on consistency with human judgements and describes how to train the language independent parameter of the LRscore.",
        "Section 4 reports the results of the experiments on MERT.",

        "In this section we present the LRscore which measures reordering using permutation distance metrics.",
        "These reordering metrics have been demonstrated to correlate strongly with human judgements of word order quality (Birch et al., 2010).",
        "The LRscore combines the reordering metrics with lexical metrics to provide a complete metric for evaluating machine translations.",
        "The relative ordering of words in the source and target sentences is encoded in alignments.",
        "We can interpret alignments as permutations which allows us to apply research into metrics for ordered encodings to measuring and evaluating reorderings.",
        "We use distance metrics over permutations to evaluate reordering performance.",
        "Figure 1 shows three permutations.",
        "Each position represents a source word and each value indicates the relative positions of the aligned target words.",
        "In Figure 1 (a) represents the identity permutation, which would result from a monotone alignment, (b) represents a small reordering consisting of two words whose orders are inverted, and (c) represents a large reordering where the two halves of the sentence are inverted in the target.",
        "A translation can potentially have many valid word orderings.",
        "However, we can be reasonably certain that the ordering of the reference sentence must be acceptable.",
        "We therefore compare the ordering",

        "Bullet points highlight non-sequential neighbours.",
        "of a translation with that of the reference sentence.",
        "Where multiple references exist, we select the closest, i.e. the one that gives the best score.",
        "The underlying assumption is that most reasonable word orderings should be fairly similar to the reference, which is a necessary assumption for all automatic machine translation metrics.",
        "Permutations encode one-one relations, whereas alignments contain null alignments and one-many, many-one and many-many relations.",
        "We make some simplifying assumptions to allow us to work with permutations.",
        "Source words aligned to null are assigned the target word position immediately after the target word position of the previous source word.",
        "Where multiple source words are aligned to the same target word or phrase, a many-to-one relation, the target ordering is assumed to be monotone.",
        "When one source word is aligned to multiple target words, a one-to-many relation, the source word is assumed to be aligned to the first target word.",
        "These simplifications are chosen so as to reduce the alignment to a bijective relationship without introducing any extraneous reorderings, i.e. they encode a basic monotone ordering assumption.",
        "We choose permutation distance metrics which are sensitive to the number of words that are out of order, as humans are assumed to be sensitive to the number of words that are out of order in a sentence.",
        "The two permutations we refer to, n and a, are the source-reference permutation and the source-translation permutation.",
        "The metrics are normalised so that 0 means that the permutations are completely inverted, and 1 means that they are identical.",
        "We report these scores as percentages.",
        "The Hamming distance (Hamming, 1950) measures the number of disagreements between two permutations.",
        "It is defined as follows:",
        "Kendall's tau distance is the minimum number of transpositions of two adjacent symbols necessary to transform one permutation into another (Kendall, 1938).",
        "It represents the percentage of pairs of elements which share the same order between two permutations.",

        "where zij",
        "Kendalls tau seems particularly appropriate for measuring word order differences as the relative ordering words is taken into account.",
        "However, most human and machine ordering differences are much closer to monotone than to inverted.",
        "The range of values of Kendall's tau is therefore too narrow and close to 1.",
        "For this reason we take the square root of the standard metric.",
        "This adjusted dk is also more correlated with human judgements of reordering quality (Birch et al., 2010).",
        "We use the example in Figure 1 to highlight the problem with current MT metrics, and to demonstrate how the permutation distance metrics are calculated.",
        "In Table 1 we present the metric results for the example permutations.",
        "The metrics are calculated by comparing the permutation string with the monotone permutation.",
        "(a) receives the best score for all metrics as it is compared to itself.",
        "Bleu and METEOR fail to recognise that (b) represents a small reordering and (c) a large reordering and they assign a lower score to (b).",
        "The reason for this is that they are sensitive to breaks in order, but not to the actual word order differences.",
        "Bleu matches more n-grams for (c) and consequently assigns it a higher score.",
        "METEOR counts the number of blocks that the translation is broken into, in order to align it with the source.",
        "(b) is aligned using four blocks, whereas (c) is aligned using only two blocks.",
        "TER counts the number of edits, allowing for block shifts, and applies one block shift for each example, resulting in an equal score for (b) and (c).",
        "Both the Hamming distance dh and the Kendall's tau distance dk correctly assign (c) a worse score than (b).",
        "Note that for (c), the Hamming distance was not able to reward the permutation for the correct relative ordering of words within the two large blocks and gave (c) a score of 0, whereas Kendall's tau takes relative ordering into account.",
        "Wong and Kit (2009) also suggest a metric which combines a word choice and a word order component.",
        "They propose a type of F-measure which uses a matching function M to calculate precision and recall.",
        "M combines the number of matched words, weighted by their tfidf importance, with their position difference score, and finally subtracting a score for unmatched words.",
        "Including unmatched words in the M function undermines the interpretation of the supposed F-measure.",
        "The reordering component is the average difference of absolute and relative word positions which has no clear meaning.",

        "This paper demonstrates that the LRscore metric is more consistent with human preference judgements of machine translation quality than other machine translation metrics.",
