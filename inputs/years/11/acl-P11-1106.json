        "In most formal theories of human sentence comprehension, input recognition and syntactic analysis are taken to be distinct processes, with the only feedback from syntax to recognition being prospective prediction of likely upcoming input (Jurafsky, 1996; Narayanan and Jurafsky, 1998, 2002; Hale, 2001, 2006; Levy, 2008a).",
        "Yet a system making optimal use of all available information might be expected to perform fully joint inference on sentence identity and structure given perceptual input, using linguistic knowledge both prospectively and retrospectively in drawing inferences as to how raw input should be segmented and recognized as a sequence of linguistic tokens, and about the degree to which each input token should be trusted during grammatical analysis.",
        "Formal models of such joint inference over uncertain input have been proposed (Levy, 2008b), and corroborative empirical evidence exists that strong coherence of current input with a perceptual neighbor of previous input may induce confusion in com-prehenders as to the identity of that previous input (Connine et al., 1991; Levy et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper we explore a more dramatic prediction of such an uncertain-input theory: that, when faced with sufficiently biasing input, comprehen-ders might under some circumstances adopt a grammatical analysis inconsistent with the true raw input comprising a sentence they are presented with, but consistent with a slightly perturbed version of the input that has higher prior probability.",
        "If this is the case, then subsequent input strongly disconfirm-ing this \"hallucinated\" garden-path analysis might be expected to induce the same effects as seen in classic cases of garden-path disambiguation traditionally studied in the psycholinguistic literature.",
        "We explore this prediction by extending the rational uncertain-input model of Levy (2008b), integrating it with surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a), which successfully accounts for and quantifies traditional garden-path disambiguation effects; and by testing predictions of the extended model in a self-paced reading study.",
        "Section 2 reviews surprisal theory and how it accounts for traditional garden-path effects.",
        "Section 3 provides background information on garden-path effects relevant to the current study, describes how we might hope to reveal com-prehenders' use of grammatical knowledge to revise beliefs about the identity of previous linguistic surface input and adopt grammatical analyses inconsistent with true input through a controlled experiment, and informally outlines how such belief revisions might arise as a side effect in a general theory of rational comprehension under uncertain input.",
        "Section 4 defines and estimates parameters for a model instantiating the general theory, and describes the predictions of the model for the experiment described in Section 3 (along with the inference procedures required to determine those predictions).",

        "The surprisal theory of incremental sentence-processing difficulty (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a) posits that the cognitive effort required to process a given word Wj of a sentence in its context is given by the simple information-theoretic measure of the log of the inverse of the word's conditional probability (also called its \"surprisal\" or \"Shannon information content\") in its intra-sentential context and extra-sentential context Ctxt:",
        "(in the rest of this paper, we consider isolated-sentence comprehension and ignore Ctxt.)",
        "The theory derives empirical support not only from controlled experiments manipulating grammatical context but also from broad-coverage studies of reading times for naturalistic text (Demberg and Keller, 2008; Boston et al., 2008; Frank, 2009; Roark et al., 2009), including demonstration that the shape of the relationship between word probability and reading time is indeed log-linear (Smith and Levy, 2008).",
        "Surprisal has had considerable success in accounting for one of the best-known phenomena in psycholinguistics, the garden-path sentence (Frazier, 1979), in which a local ambiguity biases the comprehender's incremental syntactic interpretation so strongly that upon encountering disambiguating input the correct interpretation can only be recovered with great effort, if at all.",
        "The most famous example is (1) below (Bever, 1970):",
        "(1) The horse raced past the barn fell.",
        "where the context before the final word is strongly biased toward an interpretation where raced is the main verb of the sentence (MV; Figure 1a), the intended interpretation, where raced begins a reduced relative clause (RR; Figure 1b) and fell is the main verb, is extremely difficult to recover.",
        "Letting Tj range over the possible incremental syntactic analyses of words w1...6 preceding fell, under surprisal the conditional probability of the disambiguating continuation fell can be approximated as",
        "For all possible predisambiguation analyses Tj, either the analysis is disfavored by the context (P(Tj \\wl„6) is low) or the analysis makes the disambiguating word unlikely (P(fell\\Tj, Wl„6) is low).",
        "Since every summand in the marginalization of Equation (I) has a very small term in it, the total marginal probability is thus small and the surprisal is high.",
        "Hale (2001) demonstrated that surprisal thus predicts strong garden-pathing effects in the classic sentence The horse raced past the barn fell on basis of the overall rarity of reduced relative clauses alone.",
        "More generally, Jurafsky (1996) used a combination of syntactic probabilities (reduced RCs are rare) and argument-structure probabilities (raced is usually intransitive) to estimate the probability ratio of the two analyses of pre-disambiguation context in Figure 1 as roughly 82:1, putting a lower bound on the additional surprisal incurred at fell for the reduced-RC variant over the unreduced variant (The horse that was raced past the barn fell) of 6.4 bits."

        "In incremental comprehension, the phrase the socks is ambiguous between being the NP object of the preceding subordinate-clause verb mending versus being the subject of the main clause (in which case mending has a Zero object); in sentences like (2) the initial bias is toward the NP interpretation.",
        "The main-clause verb fell disambiguates, ruling out the initially favored NP analysis.",
        "It has been known since Frazier and Rayner (1982) that this effect of garden-path disambiguation can be measured in reading times on the main-clause verb (see also Mitchell, 1987; Ferreira and Henderson, 1993; Adams et al., 1998; Sturt et al., 1999; Hill and Murray, 2000; Christianson et al., 2001; van Gompel and Pickering, 2001; Tabor and Hutchins, 2004; Staub, 2007).",
        "Small changes to the context can have huge effects on comprehenders' initial interpretations, however.",
        "It is unusual for sentence-initial subordinate clauses not to end with a comma or some other type of punctuation (searches in the parsed Brown corpus put the rate at about 18%); empirically it has consistently been found that a comma eliminates the garden-path effect in NP/Z sentences:",
        "(3) While Mary was mending, the socks fell off her lap.",
        "Understanding sentences like (3) is intuitively much easier, and reading times at the disambiguating verb are reliably lower when compared with (2).",

        "[w]ith a comma after mending, there would be no syntactic garden path left to",
        "In a surprisal model with clean, veridical input, Fodor's conclusion is exactly what is predicted: separating a verb from its direct object with a comma effectively never happens in edited, published written English, so the conditional probability of the NP analysis should be close to zero.",
        "When uncertainty about surface input is introduced, however – due to visual noise, imperfect memory representations, and/or beliefs about possible speaker error – analyses come into play in which some parts of the true string are treated as if they were absent.",
        "In particular, because the two sentences are perceptual neighbors, the pre-disambiguation garden-path analysis of (2) may be entertained in (3).",
        "We can get a tighter handle on the effect of input uncertainty by extending Levy (2008b)'s analysis of the expected beliefs of a comprehender about the sequence of words constituting an input sentence to joint inference over both sentence identity and sentence structure.",
        "For a true sentence w* which yields perceptual input I, joint inference on sentence identity w and structure T marginalizing over I yields:",
        "where PT (I\\w*) is the true model of noise (perceptual inputs derived from the true sentence) and PC (•) terms reflect the comprehender's linguistic knowledge and beliefs about the noise processes intervening between intended sentences and perceptual input.",
        "w* and w must be conditionally independent given I since w* is not observed by the comprehen-der, giving us (through Bayes' Rule):",
        "For present purposes we constrain the comprehen-der's model of noise so that T and I are conditionally independent given w, an assumption that can be relaxed in future work.",
        "This allows us the further simplification to",
        "That is, a comprehender's average inferences about sentence identity and structure involve a tradeoff between (i) the prior probability of a grammatical derivation given a speaker's linguistic knowledge and (ii) the fidelity of the derivation's yield to the true sentence, as measured by a combination of true noise processes and the comprehender's beliefs about those processes.",
        "through manipulating prior grammatical probabilities",
        "Returning to our discussion of the NP/Z ambiguity, the relative ease of comprehending (3) entails an interpretation in the uncertain-input model that the cost of infidelity to surface input is sufficient to prevent comprehenders from deriving strong belief in a hallucinated garden-path analysis of (3) pre-disambiguation in which the comma is ignored.",
        "At the same time, the uncertain-input theory predicts that if we manipulate the balance of prior grammatical probabilities PC (T, w) strongly enough (term (i) in Equation (II)), it may shift the comprehender's beliefs toward a garden-path interpretation.",
        "This observation sets the stage for our experimental manipulation, illustrated below:",
        "(4) As the soldiers marched, toward the tank lurched an injured enemy combatant.",
        "Example (4) is qualitatively similar to (3), but with two crucial differences.",
        "First, there has been locative inversion (Bolinger, 1971; Bresnan, 1994) in the main clause: a locative PP has been fronted before the verb, and the subject NP is realized postverbally.",
        "Locative inversion is a low-frequency construction, hence it is crucially disfavored by the comprehender's prior over possible grammatical structures.",
        "Second, the subordinate-clause verb is no longer transitive, as in (3); instead it is intransitive but could itself take the main-clause fronted PP as a dependent.",
        "Taken together, these properties should shift comprehenders' posterior inferences given prior grammatical knowledge and pre-disambiguation input more sharply than in (3) toward the input-unfaithful interpretation in which the immediately preverbal main-clause constituent (toward the tank in (4)) is interpreted as a dependent of the subordinate-clause verb, as if the comma were absent.",
        "If comprehenders do indeed seriously entertain such interpretations, then we should be able to find the empirical hallmarks (e.g., elevated reading times) of garden-path disambiguation at the main-clause verb lurched, which is incompatible with the \"hallucinated\" garden-path interpretation.",
        "Empirically, however, it is important to disentangle these empirical hallmarks of garden-path disambiguation from more general disruption that may be induced by encountering locative inversion itself.",
        "We address this issue by introducing a control condition in which a postverbal PP is placed within the subordinate clause:",
        "(5) As the soldiers marched into the bunker, toward the tank lurched an injured enemy combatant.",

        "Language is redundant: the content of one part of a sentence carries predictive value both for what will precede and what will follow it.",
        "For this reason, and because the path from a speaker's intended utterance to a comprehender's perceived input is noisy and error-prone, a comprehension system making optimal use of available information would use current input not only for forward prediction but also to assess the veracity of previously encountered input.",
        "Here we have developed a theory of how such an adaptive error-correcting capacity is a consequence of noisy-channel inference, with a comprehender's beliefs regarding sentence form and structure at any moment in incremental comprehension reflecting a balance between fidelity to perceptual input and a preference for structures with higher prior probability.",
        "As a consequence of this theory, certain types of sentence contexts will cause the drive toward higher prior-probability analyses to overcome the drive to maintain fidelity to input, undermining the comprehender's belief in an earlier part of the input actually perceived in favor of an analysis unfaithful to part of the true input.",
        "If subsequent input strongly disconfirms this incorrect interpretation, we should see behavioral signatures of classic garden-path disambiguation.",
        "Within the theory, the size of this \"hallucinated\" garden-path effect is indexed by the surprisal value under uncertain input, marginalizing over the actual sentence observed.",
        "Based on a model implementing theory we designed a controlled psycholinguistic experiment making specific predictions regarding the role of fine-grained grammatical context in modulating comprehenders' strength of belief in a highly specific bit of linguistic input – a comma marking the end of a sentence-initial subordinate clause – and tested those predictions in a self-paced reading experiment.",
        "As predicted by the theory, reading times at the word disambiguating the \"hallucinated\" garden-path were inflated relative to control conditions.",
        "These results contribute to the theory of uncertain-input effects in online sentence processing by suggesting that comprehenders may be induced not only to entertain but to adopt relatively strong beliefs in grammatical analyses that require modification of the surface input itself.",
        "Our results also bring a new degree of nuance to surprisal theory, demonstrating that perceptual neighbors of true preceding input may need to be taken into account in order to estimate how surprising a comprehender will find subsequent input to be.",
        "Beyond the domain of psycholinguistics, the methods employed here might also be usefully applied to practical problems such as parsing of degraded or fragmentary sentence input, allowing joint constraint derived from grammar and available input to fill in gaps (Lang, 1988).",
        "Of course, practical applications of this sort would raise challenges of their own, such as extending the grammar to broader coverage, which is delicate here since the surface input places a weaker check on overgeneration from the grammar than in traditional probabilistic parsing.",
        "Larger grammars also impose a technical burden since parsing uncertain input is in practice more computationally intensive than parsing clean input, raising the question of what approximate-inference algorithms might be well-suited to processing uncertain input with grammatical knowledge.",
        "Answers to this question might in turn be of interest for sentence processing, since the exhaustive-parsing idealization employed here is not psychologically plausible.",
        "It seems likely that human comprehension involves approximate inference with severely limited memory that is nonetheless highly optimized to recover something close to the intended meaning of an utterance, even when the recovered meaning is not completely faithful to the input itself.",
        "Arriving at models that closely approximate this capacity would be of both theoretical and practical value."
