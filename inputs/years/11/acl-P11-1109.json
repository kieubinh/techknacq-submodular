        "Natural language allows us to express the same information in many ways, which makes natural language processing (NLP) a challenging area.",
        "Accordingly, many researchers have recognized that automatic paraphrasing is an indispensable component of intelligent NLP systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1991; McKeown et al., 2002; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Kauchak and Barzi-lay, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2006) and have tried to acquire a large amount of paraphrase knowledge, which is a key to achieving robust automatic paraphrasing, from corpora (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Barzi-lay and McKeown, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003).",
        "We propose a method to extract phrasal paraphrases from pairs of sentences that define the same concept.",
        "The method is based on our observation that two sentences defining the same concept can be regarded as a parallel corpus since they largely convey the same information using different expressions.",
        "Such definition sentences abound on the Web.",
        "This suggests that we may be able to extract a large amount of phrasal paraphrase knowledge from the definition sentences on the Web.",
        "For instance, the following two sentences, both of which define the same concept \"osteoporosis\", include two pairs of phrasal paraphrases, which are indicated by underlines © and ©, respectively.",
        "(1) a. Osteoporosis is a disease that © decreases the quantity of bone and © makes bones fragile.",
        "b. Osteoporosis is a disease that © reduces bone mass and © increases the risk of bone fracture.",
        "We define paraphrase as a pair of expressions between which entailment relations of both directions hold.",
        "(Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010).",
        "Our objective is to extract phrasal paraphrases from pairs of sentences that define the same concept.",
        "We propose a supervised method that exploits various kinds of lexical similarity features and contextual features.",
        "Sentences defining certain concepts are acquired automatically on a large scale from the Web by applying a quite simple supervised method.",
        "Previous methods most relevant to our work used parallel corpora such as multiple translations of the same source text (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) or automatically acquired parallel news texts (Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004).",
        "The former requires a large amount of manual labor to translate the same texts in several ways.",
        "The latter would suffer from the fact that it is not easy to automatically retrieve large bodies of parallel news text with high accuracy.",
        "On the contrary, recognizing definition sentences for the same concept is quite an easy task at least for Japanese, as we will show, and we were able to find a huge amount of definition sentence pairs from normal Web texts.",
        "In our experiments, about 30 million definition sentence pairs were extracted from 6 x 10Web documents, and the estimated number of paraphrases recognized in the definition sentences using our method was about 300,000, for a precision rate of about 94%.",
        "Also, our experimental results show that our method is superior to well-known competing methods (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Koehn et al., 2007) for extracting paraphrases from definition sentence pairs.",
        "Our evaluation is based on bidirectional checking of entailment relations between paraphrases that considers the context dependence of a paraphrase.",
        "Note that using definition sentences is only the beginning of our research on paraphrase extraction.",
        "We have a more general hypothesis that sentences fulfilling the same pragmatic function (e.g. definition) for the same topic (e.g. osteoporosis) convey mostly the same information using different expressions.",
        "Such functions other than definition may include the usage of the same Linux command, the recipe for the same cuisine, or the description of related work on the same research issue.",

        "The existing work for paraphrase extraction is categorized into two groups.",
        "The first involves a distributional similarity approach pioneered by Lin and Pantel (2001).",
        "Basically, this approach assumes that two expressions that have a large distributional similarity are paraphrases.",
        "There are also variants of this approach that address entailment acquisition (Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Bhagat et al., 2007; Szpektor and",
        "Dagan, 2008; Hashimoto et al., 2009).",
        "These methods can be applied to a normal monolingual corpus, and it has been shown that a large number of paraphrases or entailment rules could be extracted.",
        "However, the precision of these methods has been relatively low.",
        "This is due to the fact that the evidence, i.e., distributional similarity, is just indirect evidence of paraphrase/entailment.",
        "Accordingly, these methods occasionally mistake antonymous pairs for para-phrases/entailment pairs, since an expression and its antonymous counterpart are also likely to have a large distributional similarity.",
        "Another limitation of these methods is that they can find only paraphrases consisting of frequently observed expressions since they must have reliable distributional similarity values for expressions that constitute paraphrases.",
        "The second category is a parallel corpus approach (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004).",
        "Our method belongs to this category.",
        "This approach aligns expressions between two sentences in parallel corpora, based on, for example, the overlap of words/contexts.",
        "The aligned expressions are assumed to be paraphrases.",
        "In this approach, the expressions do not need to appear frequently in the corpora.",
        "Furthermore, the approach rarely mistakes antonymous pairs for paraphrases/entailment pairs.",
        "However, its limitation is the difficulty in preparing a large amount of parallel corpora, as noted before.",
        "We avoid this by using definition sentences, which can be easily acquired on a large scale from the Web, as parallel corpora.",
        "Murata et al.",
        "(2004) used definition sentences in two manually compiled dictionaries, which are considerably fewer in the number of definition sentences than those on the Web.",
        "Thus, the coverage of their method should be quite limited.",
        "Furthermore, the precision of their method is much poorer than ours as we report in Section 4.",
        "For a more extensive survey on paraphrasing methods, see Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) and Madnani and Dorr (2010)."

        "Our method, targeting the Japanese language, consists of two steps: definition sentence acquisition and paraphrase extraction.",
        "We describe them below.",
        "We acquire sentences that define a concept (definition sentences) as in Example (2), which defines \"#",
        "fflUSË\" (osteoporosis), from the 6 x 10 Web pages (Akamine et al., 2010) and the Japanese Wikipedia.",
        "(Osteoporosis is a disease that makes bones fragile.)",
        "Fujii and Ishikawa (2002) developed an unsupervised method to find definition sentences from the Web using 18 sentential templates and a language model constructed from an encyclopedia.",
        "On the other hand, we developed a supervised method to achieve a higher precision.",
        "We use one sentential template and an SVM classifier.",
        "Specifically, we first collect definition sentence candidates by a template \"TNP t tt.",
        "*\", where ~ is the beginning of sentence and NP is the noun phrase expressing the concept to be defined followed by a particle sequence, \"t\" (comitative) and \"tt\" (topic) (and optionally followed by comma), as exemplified in (2).",
        "As a result, we collected 3,027,101 sentences.",
        "Although the particle sequence tends to mark the topic of the definition sentence, it can also appear in interrogative sentences and normal assertive sentences in which a topic is strongly emphasized.",
        "To remove such non-definition sentences, we classify the candidate sentences using an SVM classifier with a polynominal kernel (d = 2).",
        "Since Japanese is a head-final language and we can judge whether a sentence is interrogative or not from the last words in the sentence, we included morpheme N-grams and bag-of-words (with the window size of N) at the end of sentences in the feature set.",
        "The features are also useful for confirming that the head verb is in the present tense, which definition sentences should be.",
        "Also, we added the morpheme N-grams and bag-of-words right after the particle sequence in the feature set since we observe that non-definition sentences tend to have interrogative related words like \"M\" (what) or \"^W\" ((what) on earth) right after the particle sequence.",
        "We chose 5 as N from our preliminary experiments.",
        "Our training data was constructed from 2,911 sentences randomly sampled from all of the collected sentences.",
        "61.1% of them were labeled as positive.",
        "In the 10-fold cross validation, the classifier's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 were 89.4, 90.7, 92.2, and 91.4, respectively.",
        "Using the classifier, we acquired 1,925,052 positive sentences from all of the collected sentences.",
        "After adding definition sentences from Wikipedia articles, which are typically the first sentence of the body of each article (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007), we obtained a total of 2,141,878 definition sentence candidates, which covered 867,321 concepts ranging from weapons to rules of baseball.",
        "Then, we coupled two definition sentences whose defined concepts were the same and obtained 29,661,812 definition sentence pairs.",
        "Obviously, our method is tailored to Japanese.",
        "For a language-independent method of definition acquisition, see Navigli and Velardi (2010) as an example.",
        "Paraphrase extraction proceeds as follows.",
        "First, each sentence in a pair is parsed by the dependency parser KNP and dependency tree fragments that constitute linguistically well-formed constituents are extracted.",
        "The extracted dependency tree fragments are called candidate phrases hereafter.",
        "We restricted candidate phrases to predicate phrases that consist of at least one dependency relation, do not contain demonstratives, and in which all the leaf nodes are nominal and all of the constituents are consecutive in the sentence.",
        "KNP indicates whether each candidate phrase is a predicate based on the POS of the head morpheme.",
        "Then, we check all the pairs of candidate phrases between two definition sentences to find paraphrase pairs.In (1), repeated in (3), candidate phrase pairs to be checked include (© decreases the quantity of bone, © reduces bone mass), (© decreases the quantity of bone, © increases the risk of bone fracture), (© makes bones fragile, © reduces bone mass), and (© makes bones fragile, © increases the risk of bone fracture).",
        "(3) a. Osteoporosis is a disease that © decreases the quantity of bone and © makes bones fragile.",
        "b. Osteoporosis is a disease that © reduces bone mass and © increases the risk of bone fracture.",
        "The paraphrase checking of candidate phrase pairs is performed by an SVM classifier with a linear kernel that classifies each pair of candidate phrases into a paraphrase or a non-paraphrase.",
        "Candidate phrase pairs are ranked by their distance from the SVM's hyperplane.",
        "Features for the classifier are based on our observation that two candidate phrases tend to be paraphrases if the candidate phrases themselves are sufficiently similar and/or their surrounding contexts are sufficiently similar.",

        "In this experiment, we evaluated the unsupervised version of our method in addition to the supervised one described in Section 3.2, in order to compare it fairly with the other methods.",
        "The unsupervised method works in the same way as the supervised one, except that it ranks candidate phrase pairs by the sum of all 17 feature values, instead of the distance from the SVM's hyperplane.",
        "In other words, no supervised learning is used.",
        "All the feature values are weighted with 1, except for f8 and f , which are weighted with – 1 since they indicate the unlikelihood of a candidate phrase pair being paraphrases.",

        "This is intended to check whether extracted paraphrases are also valid for contexts other than those from which they are extracted.",
        "The evaluation proceeds as follows.",
        "For the top m paraphrase pairs of each method (in the case of the BM method, randomly sampled m pairs were used, since the method does not rank paraphrase pairs), we retrieved a sentence pair (s1} s2) for each paraphrase pair (p1,p2) from the Web, such that s1 contains p1 and s2 contains p2.",
        "In doing so, we make sure that neither si nor s2 are the definition sentences from which p1 and p2 are extracted.",
        "For each method, we randomly sample n samples from all of the paraphrase pairs (p1 ,p2) for which both s1 and s2 are retrieved.",
        "Then, from each (p1,p2) and (s1,s2), we create two paraphrase sentence pairs (s1, s'2) by exchanging p1 and p2 between s1 and s2.",
        "All samples, each consisting of (p1,p2), (s1}s2), and (s1, s'2), are checked by three human annotators to determine whether s1 entails s1 and s2 entails s'2 so that entailment relations of both directions are verified.",
        "In advance of evaluation annotation, all the evaluation samples are shuffled so that the annotators cannot find out which sample is given by which method for fairness.",
        "We regard each paraphrase pair as correct if at least two annotators judge that entailment relations of both directions hold for it.",
        "You may wonder whether only one pair of sentences (s1}s2) is enough for evaluation since a correct (wrong) paraphrase pair might be judged as wrong (correct) accidentally.",

        "Remember that this is the result of using 100,000 definition sentence pairs.",
        "Thus, we estimate that Sup can extract about 300,000 paraphrase pairs with a precision rate of about 94%, if we use all 29,661,812 definition sentence pairs that we acquired.",

        "As the examples indicate, many of the extracted paraphrases are not specific to definition sentences and seem very reusable.",
        "However, there are few paraphrases involving metaphors or idioms in the outputs due to the nature of definition sentences.",
        "In this regard, we do not claim that our method is almighty.",

        "Second, we plan to induce paraphrase rules from paraphrase instances.",
        "Though our method can extract a variety of paraphrase instances on a large scale, their coverage might be insufficient for real NLP applications since some paraphrase phenomena are highly productive.",
        "Therefore, we need paraphrase rules in addition to paraphrase instances.",

        "Finally, as mentioned in Section 1, the work in this paper is only the beginning of our research on paraphrase extraction.",
