        "Learning From Collective Human Behavior to Introduce Diversity in Lexical Choice",
        "We analyze collective discourse, a collective human behavior in content generation, and show that it exhibits diversity, a property of general collective systems.",
        "Using extensive analysis, we propose a novel paradigm for designing summary generation systems that reflect the diversity of perspectives seen in real-life collective summarization.",
        "We analyze 50 sets of summaries written by human about the same story or artifact and investigate the diversity of perspectives across these summaries.",
        "We show how different summaries use various phrasal information units (i.e., nuggets) to express the same atomic semantic units, called factoids.",
        "Finally, we present a ranker that employs distributional similarities to build a network of words, and captures the diversity of perspectives by detecting communities in this network.",
        "Our experiments show how our system outperforms a wide range of other document ranking systems that leverage diversity."

        "In sociology, the term collective behavior is used to denote mass activities that are not centrally coordinated (Blumer, 1951).",
        "Collective behavior is different from group behavior in the following ways: (a) it involves limited social interaction, (b) membership is fluid, and (c) it generates weak and unconventional norms (Smelser, 1963).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the computational analysis of collective discourse, a collective behavior seen in interactive content contribution and text summarization in online social media.",
        "In collective discourse each individual's behavior is largely independent of that of other individuals.",
        "In social media, discourse (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) is often a collective reaction to an event.",
        "One scenario leading to collective reaction to a well-defined subject is when an event occurs (a movie is released, a story occurs, a paper is published) and people independently write about it (movie reviews, news headlines, citation sentences).",
        "This process of content generation happens over time, and each person chooses the aspects to cover.",
        "Each event has an onset and a time of death after which nothing is written about it.",
        "Tracing the generation of content over many instances will reveal temporal patterns that will allow us to make sense of the text generated around a particular event.",
        "To understand collective discourse, we are interested in behavior that happens over a short period of time.",
        "We focus on topics that are relatively well-defined in scope such as a particular event or a single news event that does not evolve over time.",
        "This can eventually be extended to events and issues that are evolving either in time or scope such as elections, wars, or the economy.",
        "In social sciences and the study of complex systems a lot of work has been done to study such collective systems, and their properties such as self-organization (Page, 2007) and diversity (Hong and Page, 2009; Fisher, 2009).",
        "However, there is little work that studies a collective system in which members individually write summaries.",
        "In most of this paper, we will be concerned with developing a complex systems view of the set of collectively written summaries, and give evidence of the diversity of perspectives and its cause.",
        "We believe that out experiments will give insight into new models of text generation, which is aimed at modeling the process of producing natural language texts, and is best characterized as the process of making choices between alternate linguistic realizations, also known as lexical choice (Elhadad, 1995; Barzi-lay and Lee, 2002; Stede, 1995)."

        "In summarization, a number of previous methods have focused on diversity.",
        "(Mei et al., 2010) introduce a diversity-focused ranking methodology based on reinforced random walks in information networks.",
        "Their random walk model introduces the rich-gets-richer mechanism to PageRank with reinforcements on transition probabilities between vertices.",
        "A similar ranking model is the Grasshopper ranking model (Zhu et al., 2007), which leverages an absorbing random walk.",
        "This model starts with a regular time-homogeneous random walk, and in each step the node with the highest weight is set as an absorbing state.",
        "The multi-view point summarization of opinionated text is discussed in (Paul et al., 2010).",
        "Paul et al.",
        "introduce Comparative LexRank, based on the LexRank ranking model (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "Their random walk formulation is to score sentences and pairs of sentences from opposite viewpoints (clusters) based on both their representativeness of the collection as well as their contrastiveness with each other.",
        "Once a lexical similarity graph is built, they modify the graph based on cluster information and perform LexRank on the modified cosine similarity graph.",
        "The most well-known paper that address diversity in summarization is (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), which introduces Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR).",
        "This method is based on a greedy algorithm that picks sentences in each step that are the least similar to the summary so far.",
        "There are a few other diversity-focused summarization systems like C-LexRank (Qazvinian and Radev, 2008), which employs document clustering.",
        "These papers try to increase diversity in summarizing documents, but do not explain the type of the diversity in their inputs.",
        "In this paper, we give an insightful discussion on the nature of the diversity seen in collective discourse, and will explain why some of the mentioned methods may not work under such environments.",
        "In prior work on evaluating independent contributions in content generation, Voorhees (Voorhees, 1998) studied IR systems and showed that relevance judgments differ significantly between humans but relative rankings show high degrees of stability across annotators.",
        "However, perhaps the closest work to this paper is (van Halteren and Teufel, 2004) in which 40 Dutch students and 10 NLP researchers were asked to summarize a BBC news report, resulting in 50 different summaries.",
        "Teufel and van Halteren also used 6 DUC-provided summaries, and annotations from 10 student participants and 4 additional researchers, to create 20 summaries for another news article in the DUC datasets.",
        "They calculated the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996; Krippendorff, 1980) and observed high agreement, indicating that the task of atomic semantic unit (factoid) extraction can be robustly performed in naturally occurring text, without any copy-editing.",
        "The diversity of perspectives and the unprecedented growth of the factoid inventory also affects evaluation in text summarization.",
        "Evaluation methods are either extrinsic, in which the summaries are evaluated based on their quality in performing a specific task (Sparck-Jones, 1999) or intrinsic where the quality of the summary itself is evaluated, regardless of any applied task (van Halteren and Teufel, 2003; Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).",
        "These evaluation methods assess the information content in the summaries that are generated automatically.",
        "Finally, recent research on analyzing online social media shown a growing interest in mining news stories and headlines because of its broad applications ranging from \"meme\" tracking and spike detection (Leskovec et al., 2009) to text summarization (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005).",
        "In similar work on blogs, it is shown that detecting topics (Kumar et al., 2003; Adar et al., 2007) and sentiment (Pang and Lee, 2004) in the blogosphere can help identify influential bloggers (Adar et al., 2004; Java et al., 2006) and mine opinions about products (Mishne and Glance, 2006)."

        "Each cluster consists of a number of unique summaries (headlines or citations) about the same artifact (non-evolving news story or scientific paper) written by different people.",

        "Therefore, we follow (van Halteren and Teufel, 2003) and make the following distinction.",
        "We define a nugget to be a phrasal information unit.",

        "f2 : {2007 world series, world series win, world series} f5 : {fans celebrate}",
        "This example suggests that different headlines on the same story written independently of one another use different phrases (nuggets) to refer to the same semantic unit (e.g., \"red sox\" vs. \"boston\" vs. \"boston red sox\") or to semantic units corresponding to different aspects of the story (e.g., \"37 arrests\" vs. \"rockies\").",
        "In the former case different nuggets are used to represent the same factoid, while in the latter case different nuggets are used to express different factoids.",
        "This analogy is similar to the definition of factoids in (van Halteren and Teufel, 2004).",

        "However, as the last citation shows, a citation sentence, unlike news headlines, may cover no information about the target paper.",

        "In the headlines datasets, where most of the headlines cover some factoids about the story, we expect this method to perform reasonably well since randomization will increase the chances of covering headlines that focus on different factoids.",

        "Our experiments on two different categories of human-written summaries (headlines and citations) showed that a lot of the diversity seen in human summarization comes from different nuggets that may actually represent the same semantic information (i.e., factoids).",
        "We showed that the factoids exhibit a skewed distribution model, and that the size of the nugget inventory asymptotic behavior even with a large number of summaries.",
        "We also showed high variation in summary quality across different summaries in terms of pyramid score, and that the information covered by reading n summaries has a rapidly growing asymptotic behavior as n increases.",
        "Finally, we proposed a ranking system that employs word distributional similarities to identify semantically equivalent words, and compared it with a wide range of summarization systems that leverage diversity.",
        "In the future, we plan to move to content from other collective systems on Web.",
        "In order to generalize our findings, we plan to examine blog comments, online reviews, and tweets (that discuss the same URL).",
        "We also plan to build a generation system that employs the Yule model (Yule, 1925) to determine the importance of each aspect (e.g. who, when, where, etc.)",
        "in order to produce summaries that include diverse aspects of a story.",
        "Our work has resulted in a publicly available dataset of 25 annotated news clusters with nearly 1 , 400 headlines, and 25 clusters of citation sentences with more than 900 citations.",
        "We believe that this dataset can open new dimensions in studying diversity and other aspects of automatic text generation."
