        "The event extraction task in ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) evaluation involves three challenging issues: distinguishing events of different types, finding the participants of an event and determining the roles of the participants.",
        "The recent researches on the task show the availability of transductive inference, such as that of the following methods: cross-document, cross-sentence and cross-event inferences.",
        "Transductive inference is a process to use the known instances to predict the attributes of unknown instances.",
        "As an example, given a target event, the cross-event inference can predict its type by well using the related events co-occurred with it within the same document.",
        "From the sentence:",
        "(1)He left the company.",
        "it is hard to tell whether it is a Transport event in ACE, which means that he left the place; or an End-Position event, which means that he retired from the company.",
        "But cross-event inference can use a related event \"Then he went shopping\" within the same document to identify it as a Transport event correctly.",
        "As the above example might suggest, the availability of transductive inference for event extraction relies heavily on the known evidences of an event occurrence in specific condition.",
        "However, the evidence supporting the inference is normally unclear or absent.",
        "For instance, the relation among events is the key clue for cross-event inference to predict a target event type, as shown in the inference process of the sentence (1).",
        "But event relation extraction itself is a hard task in Information Extraction.",
        "So cross-event inference often suffers from some false evidence (viz., misleading by unrelated events) or lack of valid evidence (viz., unsuccessfully extracting related events).",
        "In this paper, we propose a new method of transductive inference, named cross-entity inference, for event extraction by well using the relations among entities.",
        "This method is firstly motivated by the inherent ability of entity types in revealing event types.",
        "From the sentences:",
        "(2) He left the bathroom.",
        "(3) He left Microsoft.",
        "it is easy to identify the sentence (2) as a Transport event in ACE, which means that he left the place, because nobody would retire (End-Position type) from a bathroom.",
        "And compared to the entities in sentence (1) and (2), the entity \"Microsoff\" in (3) would give us more confidence to tag the \"left\" event as an End-Position type, because people are used to giving the full name of the place where they retired.",
        "The cross-entity inference is also motivated by the phenomenon that the entities of the same type often attend similar events.",
        "That gives us a way to predict event type based on entity-type consistency.",
        "From the sentence:",
        "(4) Obama beats McCain.",
        "it is hard to identify it as an Elect event in ACE, which means Obama wins the Presidential Election, or an Attack event, which means Obama roughs somebody up.",
        "But if we have the priori knowledge that the sentence \"Bush beats McCain\" is an Elect event, and \"Obama\" was a presidential contender just like \"Bush\" (strict type consistency), we have ample evidence to predict that the sentence (4) is also an Elect event.",
        "Indeed above cross-entity inference for eventtype identification is not the only use of entity-type consistency.",
        "As we shall describe below, we can make use of it at all issues of event extraction:",
        "• For event type: the entities of the same type are most likely to attend similar events.",
        "And the events often use consistent or synonymous trigger.",
        "• For event argument (participant): the entities of the same type normally co-occur with similar participants in the events of the same type.",
        "• For argument role: the arguments of the same type, for the most part, play the same roles in similar events.",
        "With the help of above characteristics of entity, we can perform a step-by-step inference in this order:",
        "• Step 1: predicting event type and labeling trigger given the entities of the same type.",
        "• Step 2: identifying arguments in certain event given priori entity type, event type and trigger that obtained by step 1.",
        "• Step 3: determining argument roles in certain event given entity type, event type, trigger and arguments that obtained by step 1 and step 2.",
        "On the basis, we give a blind cross-entity inference method for event extraction in this paper.",
        "In the method, we first regard entities as queries to retrieve their related documents from large-scale language resources, and use the global evidences of the documents to generate entity-type descriptions.",
        "Second we determine the type consistency of entities by measuring the similarity of the type descriptions.",
        "Finally, given the priori attributes of events in the training data, with the help of the entities of the same type, we perform the step-by-step cross-entity inference on the attributes of test events (candidate sentences).",
        "In contrast to other transductive inference methods on event extraction, the cross-entity inference makes every effort to strengthen effects of entities in predicting event occurrences.",
        "Thus the inferential process can benefit from following aspects: 1) less false evidence, viz. less false entity-type consistency (the key clue of cross-entity inference), because the consistency can be more precisely determined with the help of fully entity-type description that obtained based on the related information from Web; 2) more valid evidence, viz. more entities of the same type (the key references for the inference), because any entity never lack its congeners."

        "• Event trigger: the main word that most clearly expresses an event occurrence (An ACE event trigger is generally a verb or a noun).",
        "• Event arguments: the entity mentions that are involved in an event (viz., participants).",
        "• Argument roles: the relation of arguments to the event where they participate.",
        "• Event mention: a phrase or sentence within which an event is described, including trigger and arguments.",
        "The 2005 ACE evaluation had 8 types of events, with 33 subtypes; for the purpose of this paper, we will treat these simply as 33 separate event types and do not consider the hierarchical structure among them.",
        "Besides, the ACE evaluation plan defines the following standards to determine the correctness of an event extraction:",
        "• A trigger is correctly labeled if its event type and offset (viz., the position of the trigger word in text) match a reference trigger.",
        "• An argument is correctly identified if its event type and offsets match any of the reference argument mentions, in other word, correctly recognizing participants in an event.",
        "• An argument is correctly classified if its role matches any of the reference argument mentions.",

        "They used this technique to augment an information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints.",
        "Ji and Grishman (2008) were inspired from the hypothesis of \"One Sense Per Discourse\" (Yarowsky, 1995); they extended the scope from a single document to a cluster of topic-related documents and employed a rule-based approach to propagate consistent trigger classification and event arguments across sentences and documents.",
        "Combining global evidence from related documents with local decisions, they obtained an appreciable improvement in both event and event argument identification.",
        "Patwardhan and Riloff (2009) proposed an event extraction model which consists of two components: a model for sentential event recognition, which offers a probabilistic assessment of whether a sentence is discussing a domain-relevant event; and a model for recognizing plausible role fillers, which identifies phrases as role fillers based upon the assumption that the surrounding context is discussing a relevant event.",
        "This unified probabilistic model allows the two components to jointly make decisions based upon both the local evidence surrounding each phrase and the \"peripheral vision\".",

      "text": [
        "In event extraction, current transductive inference methods focus on the issue that many events are missing or spuriously tagged because the local information is not sufficient to make a confident decision.",
        "The solution is to mine credible evidences of event occurrences from global information and regard that as priori knowledge to predict unknown event attributes, such as that of cross-document and cross-event inference methods.",
        "However, by analyzing the sentence-level baseline event extraction, we found that the entities within a sentence, as the most important local information, actually contain sufficient clues for event detection.",
        "It is only based on the premise that we know the backgrounds of the entities beforehand.",
        "For instance, if we knew the entity \"vesuvius\" is an active volcano, we could easily identify",
        "Arguments",
        "the word \"erupt\", which co-occurred with the entity, as the trigger of a \"volcanic eruption\" event but not that of a \"spotty rash\".",
        "In spite of that, it is actually difficult to use an entity to directly infer an event occurrence because we normally don't know the inevitable connection between the background of the entity and the event attributes.",
        "But we can well use the entities of the same background to perform the inference.",
        "In detail, if we first know entity(a) has the same background with entity(b), and we also know that entity(a), as a certain role, participates in a specific event, then we can predict that entity(b) might par-ticiptes in a similar event as the same role.",

        "(5) American case for war against Saddam.",

        "Within the ACE corpus, there is a strong entity consistency: if one entity mention appears in a type of event, other entity mentions of the same type will appear in similar events, and even use the same word to trigger the events.",

        "On the basis, given an entity mention in the candidate and its type (see the pretreatment process in section 5.1), the argument classifier could predict whether other entity mentions co-occur with it in such a domain, if yes, all the mentions will be the arguments of the candidate.",
        "In other words, if we know an entity of a certain type participates in some event, we will think of what entities also should participate in the event.",

        "Some minor features, such as another binary indicator of whether arguments co-occur with trigger in the same clause (see Table 7).",
        "For a candidate event mention, the arguments that given by the second step (argument classifier) provide important contextual information for predicting what role the local entity (also one of the arguments) takes on.",

        "For instance, if the Arg1 and Arg2 co-occur in an Attack event mention, we will have more confidence in the Victim role of Argl.",
        "Besides, as discussed in section 4, entities of the same type normally take on the same role in similar events, especially when they co-occur with similar arguments in the events (see Table 2).",

        "First, some triggers are common words which often mislead the extraction of candidate event mention, such as \"it\", \"this\", \"what\", etc.",
        "These words only appear in a few event mentions as trigger, but when they once appear in trigger list, a large quantity of noisy sentences will be regarded as candidates because of their commonness in sentences.",
        "Second, some arguments might be tagged as more than one role in specific event mentions, but as ACE event guideline, one argument only takes on one role in a sentence.",
        "So we need to remove those with low confidence.",
        "A confidence coefficient is used to distinguish the correct triggers and roles from wrong ones.",
        "The coefficient calculate the frequency of a trigger (or a role) appearing in specific domain of event mentions and that in whole training corpus, then combines them to represent its confidence degree, just like TFIDF algorithm.",
        "Thus, the more typical triggers (or roles) will be given high confidence.",
        "Based on the coefficient, we use a SVM-based classifier to determine the reportable events.",

        "We use the rest of the ACE training corpus (549 documents) as training data for our event extraction system.",
        "To compare with the reported work on cross-event inference (Liao, 2010) and its sentence-level baseline system, we cross-validate our method on 10 separate sets of 40 ACE texts, and report the optimum, worst and mean performances (see Table 8) on the data by using Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-measure (F).",
        "In addition, we also report the performance of two human annotators on 40 ACE newswire texts (a random blind test set): one knows the rules of event extraction; the other knows nothing about it.",
        "From the results presented in Table 8, we can see that using the cross-entity inference, we can improve the F score of sentence-level event extraction for trigger classification by 8.59%, argument classification by 11.86%, and role classification by 11.9% (mean performance).",

        "We obtained 129 entity subtypes from training set.",
        "By randomly inspecting 10 subtypes, we found nearly every subtype involves no less than 19.2% noises.",
        "For example, the subtype 1 of \"Air\" in Table 5 lost the entities of \"MiGs\" and \"enemy planes\", but involved \"terrorist\", \"Saddam\", etc (See Table 9).",
        "Therefore, we manually clustered the subtypes and retry the step-by-step cross-entity inference.",
        "The results (denoted as \"Visible 1\") are shown in Table 10, within which, we additionally show the performance of the inference on the rough entity types provided by ACE (denoted as \"Visible 2\"), such as the type of \"Air\", \"Population-Center\", \"Exploding\", etc., which normally can be divided into different more cohesive subtypes.",
        "And the \"Blind\" in Table 10 denotes the performances on our subtypes obtained by CLUTO.",
        "It is surprised that the performances (see Table 10, F-score) on \"Visible 1\" entity subtypes are just a little better than \"Blind\" inference.",
        "So it seems that the noises in our blind entity types (CLUTO clusters) don't hurt the inference much.",

        "We propose a blind cross-entity inference method for event extraction, which well uses the consistency of entity mention to achieve sentence-level trigger and argument (role) classification.",
        "Experiments show that the method has better performance than cross-document and cross-event inferences in ACE event extraction.",
        "The inference presented here only considers the helpfulness of entity types of arguments to role classification.",
        "But as a superior feature, contextual roles can provide more effective assistance to role determination of local argument.",
        "For instance, when an Attack argument appears in a sentence, a Target might be there.",
        "So if we firstly identify simple roles, such as the condition that an argument has only a single role, and then use the roles as priori knowledge to classify hard ones, may be able to further improve performance."
