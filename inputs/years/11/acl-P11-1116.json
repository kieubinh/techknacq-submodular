        "From the viewpoint of entity classification, the problem is to automatically assign fine-grained class labels to terms.",
        "There have been a number of approaches (Hearst 1992; Pantel & Ravichandran 2004; Snow et al., 2005; Durme & Paşca, 2008; Talukdar et al., 2008) to address the problem.",

        "Although some degree of success has been achieved with these efforts, the results are still far from perfect, in terms of both recall and precision.",
        "As will be demonstrated in this paper, even by processing a large corpus of 500 million web pages with the most popular patterns, we are not able to extract correct labels for many (especially rare) entities.",
        "Even for popular terms, incorrect results often appear in their label lists.",
        "The basic philosophy in existing hyponymy extraction approaches (and also many other text-mining methods) is counting: count the number of supporting sentences.",
        "Here a supporting sentence of a term-label pair is a sentence from which the pair can be extracted via an extraction pattern.",
        "We demonstrate that the specific way of counting has a great impact on result quality, and that the state-of-the-art counting methods are not optimal.",
        "Specifically, we examine the problem from the viewpoint of probabilistic evidence combination and find that the probabilistic assumption behind simple counting is the statistical independence between the observations of supporting sentences.",
        "By assuming a positive correlation between supporting sentence observations and adopting properly designed nonlinear combination functions, the results precision can be improved.",
        "It is hard to extract correct labels for rare terms from a web corpus due to the data sparseness problem.",
        "To address this issue, we propose an evidence propagation algorithm motivated by the observation that similar terms tend to share common hy-pernyms.",
        "For example, if we already know that 1) Helsinki and Tampere are cities, and 2) Porvoo is similar to Helsinki and Tampere, then Porvoo is very likely also a city.",
        "This intuition, however, does not mean that the labels of a term can always be transferred to its similar terms.",
        "For example, Mount Vesuvius and Kilimanjaro are volcanoes and Lhotse is similar to them, but Lhotse is not a volcano.",
        "Therefore we should be very conservative and careful in hypernym propagation.",
        "In our propagation algorithm, we first construct some pseudo supporting sentences for a term from the supporting sentences of its similar terms.",
        "Then we calculate label scores for terms by performing nonlinear evidence combination based on the (pseudo and real) supporting sentences.",
        "Such a nonlinear propagation algorithm is demonstrated to perform better than linear propagation.",
        "Experimental results on a publicly available collection of 500 million web pages with hypernym labels annotated for 300 terms show that our nonlinear evidence fusion and propagation significantly improve the precision and coverage of the extracted hyponymy data.",

        "The core idea is to keep a term-label pair (T, L) only if the number of terms having the label L in the term Ts cluster is above a threshold and if L is not the label of too many clusters (otherwise the pair will be discarded).",
        "In contrast, we are able to add new (high-quality) labels for a term with our evidence propagation method.",

        "For two supporting sentences the correlation between them may depend on whether they correspond to the same pattern.",
        "In Section 5.1, our nonlinear evidence fusion formulas are constructed by making specific assumptions about the correlation between intra-pattern supporting sentences and inter-pattern ones.",
        "Then in Section 5.2, we introduce our evidence propagation technique in which the evidence of a (T, L) pair is propagated to the terms similar to T.",
        "For a term-label pair (T, L), assuming K patterns are used for hyponymy extraction and the supporting sentences discovered with pattern i are, where mi is the number of supporting sentences corresponding to pattern i.",
        "Also assume the gain score of ShJ is xy, i.e., x1,J=G(A\\S1,J).",
        "Generally speaking, supporting sentences corresponding to the same pattern typically have a higher correlation than the sentences corresponding to different patterns.",
        "This can be verified by the data in Table-2.",
        "By ignoring the inter-pattern correlations, we make the following simplified assumption:",
        "Assumption: Supporting sentences corresponding to the same pattern are correlated, while those of different patterns are independent.",
        "According to this assumption, our label-scoring function is,",
        "In the simple case that x y = I D F(L ), if the h function of Formula 4.12 is adopted, then,",
        "We use an example to illustrate the above formula.",
        "Example: For term T and label L1, assume the numbers of the supporting sentences corresponding to the six pattern types in Table 1 are (4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4), which means the number of supporting sentences discovered by each pattern type is 4.",
        "Also assume the supporting-sentence-count vector of label L2 is (25, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).",
        "If we use Formula 5.3 to compute the scores of L1 and L2, we can have the following (ignoring IDF for simplicity),",
        "One the other hand, if we simply count the total number of supporting sentences, the score of L2 will be larger.",
        "The rationale implied in the formula is: For a given term T, the labels supported by multiple types of patterns tend to be more reliable than those supported by a single pattern type, if they have the same number of supporting sentences.",
        "According to the evidence fusion algorithm described above, in order to extract term labels reliably, it is desirable to have many supporting sentences of different types.",
        "This is a big challenge for rare terms, due to their low frequency in sentences (and even lower frequency in supporting sentences because not all occurrences can be covered by patterns).",
