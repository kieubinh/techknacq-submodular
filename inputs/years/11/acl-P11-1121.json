        "The more detailed an annotation scheme is, the more information it can contain and the more difficult identifying errors is, and vice versa.",
        "For POS/parsing annotation, there are also a number of annotation schemes including the Brown tag set, the Claws tag set, and the Penn Treebank tag set.",
        "However, none of them are designed to be used for learner corpora.",
        "In other words, a variety of linguistic phenomena occur in learner corpora which the existing annotation schemes do not cover.",

        "Grammatical errors prevent us applying existing annotation schemes, too.",

        "As a result, there are at least two possibilities for tagging: success/NN and success/VB.",

        "One solution is to split them to obtain the correct strings and then tag them with a normal scheme.",

        "The 170 essays in the shallow-parsed corpus was used for evaluating existing POS-tagging techniques on texts written by learners.",
        "It consisted of 2,411 sentences and 22,452 tokens.",
        "HMM-based and CRF-based POS taggers were tested on the shallow-parsed corpus.",
        "The former was implemented using tri-grams by the author.",
        "It was trained on a corpus consisting of English learning materials (213,017 tokens).",
        "The latter was CRFTag-ger, which was trained on the WSJ corpus.",
        "Both use the Penn Treebank POS tag set.",
        "The performance was evaluated using accuracy defined by",
        "number of tokens correctly POS-tagged number of tokens",
        "If the number of tokens in a sentence was different in the human annotation and the system output, the sentence was excluded from the calculation.",
        "This discrepancy sometimes occurred because the tokenization of the system sometimes differed from that of the human annotators.",
        "As a result, 19 and 126 sentences (215 and 1,352 tokens) were excluded from the evaluation in the HMM-based and CRF-based POS taggers, respectively.",
        "Table 4 shows the results.",
        "The second column corresponds to accuracies on a native-speaker corpus (sect.",
        "00 of the WSJ corpus).",
        "The third column corresponds to accuracies on the learner corpus.",
        "As shown in Table 4, the CRF-based POS tagger suffers a decrease in accuracy as expected.",
        "Interestingly, the HMM-based POS tagger performed better on the learner corpus.",
        "This is perhaps because it was trained on a corpus consisting of English learning materials whose distribution of vocabulary was expected to be relatively similar to that of the learner corpus.",
        "By contrast, it did not perform well on the native-speaker corpus because the size of the training corpus was relatively small and the distribution of vocabulary was not similar, and thus unknown words often appeared.",
        "This implies that selecting appropriate texts as a training corpus may improve the performance.",
        "Number of essays",
        "233",
        "Number of writers",
        "25",
        "Number of sentences",
        "3,199",
        "Number of words",
        "25,537",
        "Table 5 shows the top five POSs mistakenly tagged as other POSs.",
        "An obvious cause of mistakes in both taggers is that they inevitably make errors in the POSs that are not defined in the Penn Treebank tag set, that is, UK and CE.",
        "A closer look at the tagging results revealed that phenomena which were common to the writing of learners were major causes of other mistakes.",
        "Errors in capitalization partly explain why the taggers made so many mistakes in NN (singular nouns).",
        "They often identified erroneously capitalized common nouns as proper nouns as in This Summer/NNP Vaca-tion/NNP.",
        "Spelling errors affected the taggers in the same way.",
        "Grammatical errors also caused confusion between POSs.",
        "For instance, omission of a certain word often caused confusion between a verb and an adjective as in I frightened/VBD.",
        "which should be I (was) frightened/JJ.",
        "Another interesting case is expressions that learners overuse (e.g., and/CC so/RB on/RB and so/JJ so/JJ).",
        "Such phrases are not erroneous but are relatively infrequent in native-speaker corpora.",
        "Therefore, the taggers tended to identify their POSs according to the surface information on the tokens themselves when such phrases appeared in the learner corpus (e.g., and/CC so/RB on/IN and so/RB so/RB).",
        "We should be aware that tokenization is also problematic although failures in tokenization were excluded from the accuracies.",
        "The influence of the decrease in accuracy on other NLP tasks is expected to be task and/or method dependent.",
        "Methods that directly use or handle sequences of POSs are likely to suffer from it.",
        "An example is the error detection method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000), which identifies unnatural sequences of POSs as grammatical errors in the writing of learners.",
        "As just discussed above, existing techniques often fail in sequences of POSs that have a grammatical error.",
        "For instance, an existing POS tagger likely tags the sentence Ifrightened.",
        "as I/PRP frightened/VBD ./.",
        "as we have just seen, and in turn the error detection method cannot identify it as an error because the sequence PRP VBD is not unnatural; it would correctly detect it if the sentence were correctly tagged as I/PRP frightened/JJ ./.",
        "For the same reason, the decrease in accuracy may affect the methods (Aarts and Granger, 1998; Granger, 1998; Tono, 2000) for extracting interesting sequences of POSs from learner corpora; for example, BOS PRP JJ is an interesting sequence but is never extracted unless the phrase is correctly POS-tagged.",
        "It requires further investigation to reveal how much impact the decrease has on these methods.",
        "By contrast, error detection/correction methods based on the bag-of-word features (or feature vectors) are expected to suffer less from it since mistakenly POS-tagged tokens are only one of the features.",
        "At the same time, we should notice that if the target errors are in the tokens that are mistakenly POS-tagged, the detection will likely fail (e.g., verbs should be correctly identified in tense error detection).",
        "In addition to the above evaluation, we attempted to improve the POS taggers using the transformation-based POS-tagging technique (Brill, 1994).",
        "In the technique, transformation rules are obtained by comparing the output of a POS tagger and the human annotation so that the differences between the two are reduced.",
        "We used the shallowparsed corpus as a test corpus and the other manually POS-tagged corpus created in the pilot study described in Subsect.",

        "We again used the shallow-parsed corpus as a test corpus.",
        "The essays contained 3,589 head nouns.",
        "We implemented an HMM-based chunker using 5-grams whose input is a sequence of POSs, which was obtained by the HMM-based POS tagger described in the previous subsection.",

        "The performance was evaluated by recall and precision defined by",

        "Table 7 shows the results.",
        "To our surprise, the chunker performed better than we had expected.",
        "A possible reason for this is that sentences written by learners of English tend to be shorter and simpler in terms of their structure.",
        "The results in Table 7 also enable us to quantitatively estimate expected improvement in error detection/correction which is achieved by improving chunking.",
        "To see this, let us define the following symbols: r: Recall of head noun identification, Ä: recall of error detection without chunking error, recall of error detection with chunking error.",
        "and are interpreted as the true recall of error detection and its observed value when chunking error exists, respectively.",

        "ing errors exist and recall of head noun identification is just as in this evaluation.",
