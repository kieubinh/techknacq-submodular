        "In natural language processing research, translations are most often used in statistical machine translation (SMT), where systems are trained using bilingual sentence-aligned parallel corpora.",
        "SMT owes its existence to data like the Canadian Hansards (which by law must be published in both French and English).",
        "SMT can be applied to any language pair for which there is sufficient data, and it has been shown to produce state-of-the-art results for language pairs like",
        "Arabic-English, where there is ample data.",
        "However, large bilingual parallel corpora exist for relatively few languages pairs.",
        "There are various options for creating new training resources for new language pairs.",
        "These include harvesting the web for translations or comparable corpora (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Smith et al., 2010; Uszkoreit et al., 2010), improving SMT models so that they are better suited to the low resource setting (Al-Onaizan et al., 2002; Probst et al., 2002; Oard et al., 2003; Niessen and Ney, 2004), or designing models that are capable of learning translations from monolingual corpora (Rapp, 1995; Fung and Yee, 1998; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "Relatively little consideration is given to the idea of simply hiring translators to create parallel data, because it would seem to be prohibitively expensive.",
        "For example, Germann (2001) estimated the cost of hiring professional translators to create a Tamil-English corpus at $0.36/word.",
        "At that rate, translating enough data to build even a small parallel corpus like the LDC's 1.5 million word Urdu-English corpus would exceed half a million dollars.",
        "In this paper we examine the idea of creating low cost translations via crowdscouring.",
        "We use Amazon's Mechanical Turk to hire a large group of nonprofessional translators, and have them recreate an Urdu-English evaluation set at a fraction of the cost of professional translators.",
        "The original dataset already has professionally-produced reference translations, which allows us to objectively and quantitatively compare the quality of professional and nonprofessional translations.",
        "Although many of the individual non-expert translators produce low-quality, disfluent translations, we show that it is possible to",
        "Figure 1: A comparison of professional translations provided by the LDC to non-professional translations created on Mechanical Turk.",
        "get high quality translations in aggregate by soliciting multiple translations, redundantly editing them, and then selecting the best of the bunch.",
        "To select the best translation, we use a machine-learning-inspired approach that assigns a score to each translation we collect.",
        "The scores discriminate acceptable translations from those that are not (and competent translators from those who are not).",
        "The scoring is based on a set of informative, intuitive, and easy-to-compute features.",

        "• Sentence length features: a good translation tends to be comparable in length to the source sentence, whereas an overly short or long translation is probably bad.",

        "The oracles indicate that there is usually an acceptable translation from the Turkers for any given sentence.",
        "Since the oracles select from a small group of only 4 translations per source segment, they are not overly optimistic, and rather reflect the true potential of the collected translations.",

        "Figure 4: BLEU scores for the five rightmost setups from Figure 3, constrained over the original translations.",
        "adding more features being somewhat orthogonal.",
        "Finally, we performed a series of experiments exploring the calibration feature, varying the amount of gold-standard references from 10% all the way up to 80%.",
        "As expected, the performance improved as more references were used to calibrate the translators (Figure 5).",
        "What's particularly important about this experiment is that it shows the added benefit of the other features: We would have to use 30%-40% of the references to get the same benefit obtained from combining the non-calibration features and only 10% for the calibration feature (dashed line in the Figure; BLEU = 39.06).",
        "While the combined cost of our data collection effort ($2,500; see 3.4) is quite low considering the amount of collected data, it would be more attractive if the cost could be reduced further without losing much in translation quality.",
        "To that end, we investigated lowering cost along two dimensions: eliminating the need for professional translations, and decreasing the amount of edited translations.",

        "The 10% point (BLEU = 37.82) and the dashed line (BLEU = 39.06) correspond to the two rightmost bars of Figure 3.",
        "The professional translations are used in our approach for computing the worker calibration feature (subsection 4.3) and for tuning the weights of the other features.",
        "We use a relatively small amount for this purpose, but we investigate a different setup whereby no professional translations are used at all.",
        "This eliminates the worker calibration feature, but, perhaps more critically, the feature weights must be set in a different fashion, since we cannot optimize BLEU on reference data anymore.",
        "Instead, we use the rank labels (from 3.3) as a proxy for BLEU, and set the weights so that better ranked translations receive higher scores.",
        "Note that the rank features will also be excluded in this setup, since they are perfect predictors of rank labels.",
        "On the one hand, this means no rank labels need to be collected, other than for a small set used for weight tuning, further reducing the cost of data collection.",
        "However, this leads to a significant drop in performance, yielding a BLEU score of 34.86.",
        "Another alternative for cost reduction would be to reduce the number of collected edited translations.",
        "To that end, we first investigate completely eliminating the editing phase, and considering only unedited translations.",
        "In other words, the selection will be over a group of four English sentences rather than 14 sentences.",
        "Completely eliminating the edited translations has an adverse effect, as expected (Figure 4).",
        "Another option, rather than eliminating the editing phase altogether, would be to consider the edited translations of only the translation receiving the best rank labels.",
        "This would reflect a data collection process whereby the editing task is delayed until after the rank labels are collected, with the rank labels used to determine which translations are most promising to post-edit (in addition to using the rank labels for the ranking features).",
        "Using this approach enables us to greatly reduce the number of edited translations collected, while maintaining good performance, obtaining a BLEU score of 38.67.",
        "It is therefore our recommendation that crowd-sourced translation efforts adhere to the following pipeline: collect multiple translations for each source sentence, collect rank labels for the translations, and finally collect edited versions of the top ranked translations."
