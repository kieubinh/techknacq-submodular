        "Syntactic parsing has made tremendous progress in the past 2 decades (Magerman, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003; Carreras et al., 2008), and accurate syntactic parsing is often assumed when developing other natural language applications.",
        "On the other hand, there are plenty of language applications where basic syntactic information is insufficient.",
        "For instance, in question answering, it is highly desirable to have the semantic information of a syntactic constituent, e.g., a noun-phrase (NP) is a person or an organization; an adverbial phrase is locative or temporal.",
        "As syntactic information has been widely used in machine translation systems (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Xiong et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2008; Chiang, 2010; Shen et al., 2010), an interesting question is to predict whether or not a syntactic constituent is projectable across a language pair.",
        "Such problems can be abstracted as adding additional annotations to an existing tree structure.",
        "For example, the English Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) contains function tags and many carry semantic information.",
        "To add semantic information to the basic syntactic trees, a logical step is to predict these function tags after syntactic parsing.",
        "For the problem of predicting projectable syntactic constituent, one can use a sentence alignment tool and syntactic trees on source sentences to create training data by annotating a tree node as projectable or not.",
        "A generic tree annotator can also open the door ofsolv-ing other natural language problems so long as the problem can be cast as annotating tree nodes.",
        "As one such example, we will present how to predict empty elements for the Chinese language.",
        "Some of the above-mentioned problems have been studied before: predicting function tags were studied in (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000; Blaheta, 2003; Lintean and Rus, 2007a), and results of predicting and recovering empty elements can be found in (Dienes et al., 2003; Schmid, 2006; Campbell, 2004).",
        "In this work, we will show that these seemingly unrelated problems can be treated uniformly as adding annotations to an existing tree structure, which is the first goal of this work.",
        "Second, the proposed generic tree annotator can also be used to solve new problems: we will show how it can be used to predict projectable syntactic constituents.",
        "Third, the uniform treatment not only simplifies the model building process, but also affords us to concentrate on discovering most useful features for a particular application which often leads to improved performances, e.g, we find some features are very effective in predicting function tags and our system has significant lower error rate than (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000; Lintean and Rus, 2007a).",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes our tree annotator, which is a conditional log-linear model.",
        "Section 3 describes the features used in our system.",
        "Next, three applications of the proposed tree annotator are presented in Section 4: predicting English function tags, predicting Chinese empty elements and predicting Arabic pro-jectable constituents.",

As an example, Figure 1 shows a syntactic parse tree with the prefix order (i.e., the number at the upright corner of each non-terminal node), where child nodes are visited recursively from left to right before the parent node is visited.",
