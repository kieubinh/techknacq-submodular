        "Translation consistency is an important factor for large-scale translation, especially for domain-specific translations in an industrial environment.",
        "For example, in the translation of technical documents, lexical as well as structural consistency is essential to produce a fluent target-language sentence.",
        "Moreover, even in the case of translation errors, consistency in the errors (e.g. repetitive error patterns) are easier to diagnose and subsequently correct by translators.",
        "* This work was done while the first author was in the Centre for Next Generation Localisation at Dublin City University.",
        "In phrase-based SMT, translation models and language models are automatically learned and/or generalised from the training data, and a translation is produced by maximising a weighted combination of these models.",
        "Given that global contextual information is not normally incorporated, and that training data is usually noisy in nature, there is no guarantee that an SMT system can produce translations in a consistent manner.",
        "On the other hand, TM systems - widely used by translators in industrial environments for enterprise localisation by translators - can shed some light on mitigating this limitation.",
        "TM systems can assist translators by retrieving and displaying previously translated similar 'example' sentences (displayed as source-target pairs, widely called 'fuzzy matches' in the localisation industry (Sikes, 2007)).",
        "In TM systems, fuzzy matches are retrieved by calculating the similarity or the so-called 'fuzzy match score' (ranging from 0 to 1 with 0 indicating no matches and 1 indicating a full match) between the input sentence and sentences in the source side of the translation memory.",
        "When presented with fuzzy matches, translators can then avail of useful chunks in previous translations while composing the translation of a new sentence.",
        "Most translators only consider a few sentences that are most similar to the current input sentence; this process can inherently improve the consistency of translation, given that the new translations produced by translators are likely to be similar to the target side of the fuzzy match they have consulted.",
        "Previous research as discussed in detail in Section 2 has focused on using fuzzy match score as a threshold when using the target side of the fuzzy matches to constrain the translation of the input sentence.",
        "In our approach, we use a more finegrained discriminative learning method to determine whether the target side of the fuzzy matches should be used as a constraint in translating the input sentence.",
        "We demonstrate that our method can consistently improve translation quality.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we begin by briefly introducing related research in Section 2.",
        "We present our discriminative learning method for consistent translation in Section 3 and our feature design in Section 4.",
        "We report the experimental results in Section 5 and conclude the paper and point out avenues for future research in Section 6."

        "Despite the fact that TM and MT integration has long existed as a major challenge in the localisation industry, it has only recently received attention in mainstream MT research.",
        "One can loosely combine TM and MT at sentence (called segments in TMs) level by choosing one of them (or both) to recommend to the translators using automatic classifiers (He et al., 2010), or simply using fuzzy match score or MT confidence measures (Specia et al., 2009).",
        "One can also tightly integrate TM with MT at the sub-sentence level.",
        "The basic idea is as follows: given a source sentence to translate, we firstly use a TM system to retrieve the most similar 'example' source sentences together with their translations.",
        "If matched chunks between input sentence and fuzzy matches can be detected, we can directly reuse the corresponding parts of the translation in the fuzzy matches, and use an MT system to translate the remaining chunks.",
        "As a matter of fact, implementing this idea is pretty straightforward: a TM system can easily detect the word alignment between the input sentence and the source side of the fuzzy match by retracing the paths used in calculating the fuzzy match score.",
        "To obtain the translation for the matched chunks, we just require the word alignment between source and target TM matches, which can be addressed using state-of-the-art word alignment techniques.",
        "More importantly, albeit not explicitly spelled out in previous work, this method can potentially increase the consistency of translation, as the translation of new input sentences is closely informed and guided (or constrained) by previously translated sentences.",
        "There are several different ways of using the translation information derived from fuzzy matches, with the following two being the most widely adopted: 1) to add these translations into a phrase table as in (Bicici and Dymetman, 2008; Simard and Isabelle, 2009), or 2) to mark up the input sentence using the relevant chunk translations in the fuzzy match, and to use an MT system to translate the parts that are not marked up, as in (Smith and Clark, 2009; Koehn and Senellart, 2010; Zhechev and van Genabith, 2010).",
        "It is worth mentioning that translation consistency was not explicitly regarded as their primary motivation in this previous work.",
        "Our research follows the direction of the second strand given that consistency can no longer be guaranteed by constructing another phrase table.",
        "However, to categorically reuse the translations of matched chunks without any differentiation could generate inferior translations given the fact that the context of these matched chunks in the input sentence could be completely different from the source side of the fuzzy match.",
        "To address this problem, both (Koehn and Senellart, 2010) and (Zhechev and van Genabith, 2010) used fuzzy match score as a threshold to determine whether to reuse the translations of the matched chunks.",
        "For example, (Koehn and Senellart, 2010) showed that reusing these translations as large rules in a hierarchical system (Chiang, 2005) can be beneficial when the fuzzy match score is above 70%, while (Zhechev and van Genabith, 2010) reported that it is only beneficial to a phrase-based system when the fuzzy match score is above 90%.",
        "Despite being an informative measure, using fuzzy match score as a threshold has a number of limitations.",
        "Given the fact that fuzzy match score is normally calculated based on Edit Distance (Lev-enshtein, 1966), a low score does not necessarily imply that the fuzzy match is harmful when used to constrain an input sentence.",
        "For example, in longer sentences where fuzzy match scores tend to be low, some chunks and the corresponding translations within the sentences can still be useful.",
        "On the other hand, a high score cannot fully guarantee the usefulness of a particular translation.",
        "We address this problem using discriminative learning."

        "The classification result of each set of parameters is evaluated by cross validation on the training set.",
        "The SVM classifier will thus be able to predict the usefulness of the TM fuzzy match, and determine whether the input sentence should be marked up using relevant phrase pairs derived from the fuzzy match before sending it to the SMT system for translation.",
        "The classifier uses features such as the fuzzy match score, the phrase and lexical translation probabilities of these relevant phrase pairs, and additional syntactic dependency features.",
        "Ideally the classifier will decide to mark up the input sentence if the translations of the marked phrases are accurate when taken contextual information into account.",

        "To further validate our assumption, we analyse the training sentences by grouping them according to their fuzzy match score ranges.",

        "We can see that for sentences with fuzzy match scores lower than 0.8, more sentences can be better translated without markup.",
        "For sentences where fuzzy match scores are within the range (0.8,0.9], more sentences can be better translated with markup.",
        "However, within the range (0.9, 1.0], surprisingly, actually more sentences receive better translation without markup.",
        "This indicates that fuzzy match score is not a good measure to predict whether fuzzy matches are beneficial when used to constrain the translation of an input sentence.",

        "In this paper, we introduced a discriminative learning method to tightly integrate fuzzy matches retrieved using translation memory technologies with phrase-based SMT systems to improve translation consistency.",
        "We used an SVM classifier to predict whether phrase pairs derived from fuzzy matches could be used to constrain the translation of an input sentence.",
        "A number of feature functions including a series of novel dependency features were used to train the classifier.",
        "Experiments demonstrated that discriminative learning is effective in improving translation quality and is more informative than the fuzzy match score used in previous research.",
        "We report a statistically significant 0.9 absolute improvement in BLEU score using a procedure to promote translation consistency.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, the potential improvement in sentence-level translation consistency using our method can be attributed to the fact that the translation of new input sentences is closely informed and guided (or constrained) by previously translated sentences using global features such as dependencies.",
        "However, it is worth noting that the level of gains in translation consistency is also dependent on the nature of the TM itself; a self-contained coherent TM would facilitate consistent translations.",
        "In the future, we plan to investigate the impact of TM quality on translation consistency when using our approach.",
        "Furthermore, we will explore methods to promote translation consistency at document level.",
        "Moreover, we also plan to experiment with phrase-by-phrase classification instead of sentence-by-sentence classification presented in this paper, in order to obtain more stable classification results.",
        "We also plan to label the training examples using other sentence-level evaluation metrics such as Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), and to incorporate features that can measure syntactic similarities in training the classifier, in the spirit of (Owczarzak et al., 2007).",
        "Currently, only a standard phrase-based SMT system is used, so we plan to test our method on a hierarchical system (Chiang, 2005) to facilitate direct comparison with (Koehn and Senellart, 2010).",
        "We will also carry out experiments on other data sets and for more language pairs."
