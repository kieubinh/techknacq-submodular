        "We presented a confusion forest based method for system combination in which system outputs are merged into a packed forest using their syntactic similarity.",
        "The forest construction is treated as a generation from a CFG compiled from the parsed outputs.",
        "Our experiments indicate comparable performance to a strong confusion network baseline with smaller space, and statistically significant gains in some language pairs.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first work to directly introduce syntactic consensus to system combination by encoding multiple system outputs into a single forest structure.",
        "We believe that the confusion forest based approach to system combination has future exploration potential.",
        "For instance, we did not employ syntactic features in Section 5.2 which would be helpful in discriminating hypotheses in larger forests.",
        "We would also like to analyze the trade-offs, if any, between parsing errors and confusion forest constructions by controlling the parsing qualities.",
        "As an alternative to the grammar-based forest generation, we are investigating an edit distance measure for tree alignment, such as tree edit distance (Bille, 2005) which basically computes insertion/deletion/replacement of nodes in trees."
