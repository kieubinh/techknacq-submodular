        "System combination is built on top of the TV-best outputs generated by multiple component systems (Rosti et al., 2007; He et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009b) which aligns multiple hypotheses to build confusion networks as new search spaces, and outputs the highest scoring paths as the final translations.",
        "Consensus decoding, on the other hand, can be based on either single or multiple systems: single system based methods (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; et al., 2009) re-rank translations produced by a single SMT model using either n-gram posteriors or expected n-gram counts.",
        "Because hypotheses generated by a single model are highly correlated, improvements obtained are usually small; recently, dedicated efforts have been made to extend it from single system to multiple systems (Li et al., 2009a; DeNero et al., 2010; Duan et al., 2010).",
        "Such methods select translations by optimizing consensus models over the combined hypotheses using all component systems' posterior distributions.",

        "Motivation and Overview",
        "SMT models based on different paradigms have emerged in the last decade using fairly different levels of linguistic knowledge.",
        "Motivated by the success of system combination research, the key contribution of this work is to make more effective use of the extended search spaces from different SMT models in decoding phase directly, rather than just post-processing their final outputs.",
        "We first begin with a brief review of single system based SMT decoding, and then illustrate major challenges to this end.",
        "Given a source sentence , an SMT decoder seeks for a target translation that best matches as its translation by maximizing the following conditional probability:",
        "where is the feature vector that includes a set of system specific features, is the weight vector, is a derivation that can yield and is defined as a sequence of translation rule applications .",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a decoding example, in which the final translation is generated by recursively composing partial hypotheses that cover different ranges of the source sentence until the whole input sentence is fully covered, and the feature vector of the final translation is the aggregation of feature vectors of all partial hypotheses used.",
        "However, hypotheses generated by different SMT systems cannot be combined directly to form new translations because of two major issues:",
        "The first one is the heterogeneous structures of different SMT models.",
        "For example, a string-to-tree system cannot use hypotheses generated by a phrase-based system in decoding procedure, as such hypotheses are based on flat structures, which cannot provide any additional information needed in the syntactic model.",
        "The second one is the incompatible feature spaces of different SMT models.",
        "For example, even if a phrase-based system can use the lexical forms of hypotheses generated by a syntax-based system without considering syntactic structures, the feature vectors of these hypotheses still cannot be aggregated together in any trivial way, because the feature sets of SMT models based on different paradigms are usually inconsistent.",
        "To address these two issues discussed above, we propose HM decoding that performs translation reconstruction using hypotheses generated by multiple component systems.",
        "Our method involves two decoding stages depicted as follows:",
