        "Component systems can have varied decoding strategies; we only require that each system produce an N-best list (or a lattice) of translations.",
        "This flexibility allows the technique to be applied quite broadly.",
        "For instance, Leusch et al.",
        "(2010) generate intermediate translations in several pivot languages, translate them separately into the target language, and generate a consensus translation out of these using a system combination technique.",
        "Likewise, these pivot translations could be combined via MBR system combination.",
        "MBR system combination has two significant advantages over current approaches to system combination.",
        "First, it does not rely on hypothesis alignment between outputs of individual systems.",
        "Aligning translation hypotheses can be challenging and has a substantial effect on combination performance (He et al., 2008).",
        "Instead of aligning the sentences, we view the sentences as vectors of n-gram counts and compute the expected statistics of the BLEU score to compute the Bayes gain.",
        "Second, we do not need to pick a backbone system for combination.",
        "Choosing a backbone system can also be challenging and also affects system combination performance (He and Toutanova, 2009).",
        "MBR system combination sidesteps this issue by working directly on the conjoined evidences space produced by the outputs of the component systems, and allows the consensus model to express system preferences via scaling factors.",
        "Despite its simplicity, MBR system combination provides strong performance by leveraging different consensus, decoding and training techniques.",
        "It outperforms best MAX or MBR derivation on each of the component systems.",
        "In addition, it obtains state-of-the-art performance in a constrained setting better suited for dominant system combination techniques."
