        "Although these formalisms present simple and precise mechanisms for describing the basic recursive structure ofsentences, they are not powerful enough to model some important features of natural language syntax.",
        "For example, Chiang (2006) points out that the translation of languages that can stack an unbounded number of clauses in an \"inside-out\" way (Wu, 1997) provably goes beyond the expressive power of synchronous CFG and TSG.",

        "Synchronous tree adjoining grammars (TAG) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) are a good candidate.",
        "As a formal tree rewriting system, TAG (Joshi et al., 1975; Joshi, 1985) provides a larger domain of locality than CFG to state linguistic dependencies that are far apart since the formalism treats trees as basic building blocks.",

        "Synchronous TAG generalizes TAG by allowing the construction of a pair of trees using the TAG operations of substitution and adjoining on tree pairs.",
        "The idea of using synchronous TAG in machine translation has been pursued by several researchers (Abeille et al., 1990; Prigent, 1994; Dras, 1999), but only recently in its probabilistic form (Nesson et al., 2006; De-Neefe and Knight, 2009).",
