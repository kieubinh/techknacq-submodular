        "Language model is one of the most important knowledge sources for statistical machine translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "The standard gram language model (Goodman, 2001) assigns probabilities to hypotheses in the target language conditioning on a context history of the preceding 1 words.",
        "Along with the efforts that advance translation models from word-based paradigm to syntax-based philosophy, in recent years we have also witnessed increasing efforts dedicated to extend standard gram language models for SMT.",
        "We roughly categorize these efforts into two directions: data-volume-oriented and data-depth-oriented.",
        "In the first direction, more data is better.",
        "In order to benefit from monolingual corpora (LDC news data or news data collected from web pages) that consist of billions or even trillions of English words, huge language models are built in a distributed manner (Zhang et al., 2006; Brants et al., 2007).",
        "Such language models yield better translation results but at the cost of huge storage and high computation.",
        "The second direction digs deeply into monolingual data to build linguistically-informed language models.",
        "For example, Charniak et al.",
        "(2003) present a syntax-based language model for machine translation which is trained on syntactic parse trees.",
        "Again, Shen et al.",
        "(2008) explore a dependency language model to improve translation quality.",
        "To some extent, these syntactically-informed language models are consistent with syntax-based translation models in capturing long-distance dependencies.",
        "In this paper, we pursue the second direction without resorting to any linguistic resources such as a syntactic parser.",
        "With a belief that a language model that embraces a larger context provides better prediction ability, we learn additional information from training data to enhance conventional n-gram language models and extend their ability to capture richer contexts and long-distance dependencies.",
        "In particular, we integrate backward n-grams and mutual information (MI) triggers into language models in SMT.",
        "In conventional n-gram language models, we look at the preceding n – 1 words when calculating the probability of the current word.",
        "We henceforth call the previous n – 1 words plus the current word as forward n-grams and a language model built on forward n-grams as forward n-gram language model.",
        "Similarly, backward n-grams refer to the succeeding n – 1 words plus the current word.",
        "We train a backward n-gram language model on backward n-grams and integrate the forward and backward language models together into the decoder.",
        "In doing so, we attempt to capture both the preceding and succeeding contexts of the current word.",
        "Different from the backward n-gram language model, the MI trigger model still looks at previous contexts, which however go beyond the scope of forward n-grams.",
        "If the current word is indexed as wi, the farthest word that the forward n-gram includes is wi-n+i.",
        "However, the MI triggers are capable of detecting dependencies between Wi and words from Wi to win.",
        "By these triggers ({wk – wi}, 1 < k < i – n), we can capture long-distance dependencies that are outside the scope of forward n-grams.",
        "We integrate the proposed backward language model and the MI trigger model into a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system.",
        "We evaluate the effectiveness of both models on Chinese-to-English translation tasks with large-scale training data.",
        "Compared with the baseline which only uses the forward language model, our experimental results show that the additional backward language model is able to gain about 0.5 BLEU points, while the MI trigger model gains about 0.4 BLEU points.",
        "When both models are integrated into the decoder, they collectively improve the performance by up to 1 BLEU point.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we will briefly introduce related work and show how our models differ from previous work.",
        "Section 3 and 4 will elaborate the backward language model and the MI trigger model respectively in more detail, describe the training procedures and explain how the models are integrated into the phrase-based decoder.",
        "Section 5 will empirically evaluate the effectiveness of these two models.",
        "Section 6 will conduct an in-depth analysis.",

        "The latter model measures the mutual information of distance-dependent trigger pairs.",
        "Our MI trigger model is mostly inspired by the work of these two papers, especially by Zhou's MI-Ngram model (2004).",
        "The difference is that our model is distance-independent and, of course, we are interested in an SMT problem rather than a speech recognition one.",

        "This resembles the way in which the forward language model probability in the future cost is computed in the standard phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al.,",
