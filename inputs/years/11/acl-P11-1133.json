        "Rare words have long been a challenge to translate automatically using statistical methods due to their low occurrences.",
        "However, the Zipf's Law claims that, for any corpus of natural language text, the frequency of a word wn (n being its rank in the frequency table) will be roughly twice as high as the frequency of word wn+\\.",
        "The logical consequence is that in any corpus, there are very few frequent words and many rare words.",
        "We propose a novel approach to extract rare word translations from comparable corpora, relying on two main features.",
        "The first feature is the context-vector similarity (Fung, 2000; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002;",
        "Laroche and Langlais, 2010): each word is characterized by its context in both source and target corpora, words in translation should have similar context in both languages.",
        "The second feature follows the assumption that specific terms and their translations should appear together often in documents on the same topic, and rarely in non-related documents.",
        "This is the general assumption behind early work on bilingual lexicon extraction from parallel documents using sentence boundary as the context window size for cooccurrence computation, we suggest to extend it to aligned comparable documents using document as the context window.",
        "This document context is too large for co-occurrence computation of functional words or high frequency content words, but we show through observations and experiments that this window size is appropriate for rare words.",
        "Both these features are unreliable when the number of occurrences of words are low.",
        "We suggest however that they are complementary and can be used together in a machine learning approach.",
        "Moreover, we suggest that the model trained for one pair of languages can be successfully applied to extract translations from another pair of languages.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section, we discuss the challenge of rare lexicon extraction, explaining the reasons why classic approaches on comparable corpora fail at dealing with rare words.",
        "We then discuss in section 3 the concept of aligned comparable documents and how we exploited those documents for bilingual lexicon extraction in section 4.",

        "There are few previous works focusing on the extraction of rare word translations, especially from comparable corpora.",
        "One of the earliest works is from (Pekar et al., 2006).",
        "They emphasized the fact that the context-vector based approach, used for processing comparable corpora, perform quite unreliably on all but the most frequent words.",
        "In a nutshell, this approach proceeds by gathering the context of words in source and target languages inside context-vectors, then compares source and target context-vectors using similarity measures.",
        "In a monolingual context, such an approach is used to automatically get synonymy relationship between words to build thesaurus (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "In the multilingual case, it is used to extract translations, that is, pairs of words with the same meaning in source and target corpora.",
        "It relies on the Firthien hypothesis that you shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, 1957).",
        "To show that the frequency of a word influences its alignment, (Pekar et al., 2006) used six pairs of comparable corpora, ranking translations according to their frequencies.",
        "The less frequent words are ranked around 100-160 by their algorithm, while the most frequent ones typically appear at rank 20-40.",
        "We ran a similar experiment using a French-English comparable corpus containing medical documents, all related to the topic of breast cancer, all manually classified as scientific discourse.",
        "The French part contains about 530,000 words while the English part contains about 7.4 millions words.",
        "For this experiment though, we sampled the English part to obtain a 530,000-words large corpus, matching the size of the French part.",
        "Using an implementation of the context-vector similarity, we show in figure 1 that frequent words (above 400 occurrences in the corpus) reach a 60% precision whereas rare words (below 15 occurrences) are correctly aligned in only 5% of the time.",
        "These results can be explained by the fact that, for the vector comparison to be efficient, the information they store has to be relevant and discriminatory.",

        "impossible to get a precise description of the typical context of this word, and therefore its description is likely to be very different for source and target words in translation.",
        "We confirmed this result with another observation on the full English part of the previous corpus, randomly split in 14 samples of the same size.",
        "The context-vectors for very frequent words, such as cancer (between 3,000 and 4,000 occurrences in each sample) are very similar across the subsets.",
        "Less frequent words, such as abnormality (between 70 and 16 occurrences in each sample) have very unstable context-vectors, hence a lower similarity across the subsets.",

        "These comparable documents, when concatenated together in order, form an aligned comparable corpus.",

        "Different approaches have been proposed for bilingual lexicon extraction from parallel corpora, relying on the assumption that a word has one sense, one translation, no missing translation, and that its translation appears in aligned parallel sentences (Fung, 2000).",
        "Therefore, translations can be extracted by comparing the distribution of words across the sentences.",
        "For example, (Gale and Church, 1991) used a derivative of the % statistics to evaluate the association between words in aligned region of parallel documents.",
        "Such association scores evaluate the strength of the relation between events.",
        "In the case of parallel sentences and lexicon extraction, they measure how often two words appear in aligned sentences, and how often one appears without the other.",
        "More precisely, they will compare their number of co-occurrences against the expected number of cooccurrences under the null-hypothesis that words are randomly distributed.",
        "If they appear together more often than expected, they are considered as associated (Evert, 2008).",
        "We focus in this work on rare words, more precisely on specialized terminology.",
        "We define them as the set of terms that appear from 1 (hapaxes) to 5 times.",
        "We use a strategy similar to the one applied on parallel sentences, but rely on aligned documents.",
        "Our hypothesis is very similar: words in translation should appear in aligned comparable documents.",
        "We used the Jaccard similarity (eq.",
        "1) to evaluate the association between words among aligned comparable documents.",
        "In the general case, this measure would not give relevant scores due to frequency issue: it produces the same scores for two words that appear always together, and never one without the other, disregarding the fact that they appear 500 times or one time only.",
        "Other association scores generally rely on occurrence and cooccurrence counts to tackle this issue (such as the log-likelihood, eq.",
        "2).",
        "In our case, the number of co-occurrences will be limited by the number of occurrences of the words, from 1 to 5.",
        "Therefore, the Jaccard similarity efficiently reflects what we want to observe.",
        "A score of 1 indicates a perfect association (words always appear together, never one without the other), the more one word appears without the other, the lower the score.",
        "We implemented the context-vector similarity in a way similar to (Morin et al., 2007).",
        "In all experiments, we used the same set of parameters, as they yielded the best results on our corpora.",
        "We built the context-vectors using nouns only as seed lexicon, with a window size of 20.",
        "Source context-vectors are translated in the target language using the resources presented in the next section.",
        "We used the log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993, eq.",
        "2) for context-vector normalization (O is the observed number of co-occurrence in the corpus, E is the expected number of co-occurrences under the null hypothesis).",
        "We used the Cosine similarity (eq.",
        "3) for context-vector comparisons.",
        "We suggest to incorporate both the context-vector similarity and the co-occurrence features in a machine learning approach.",
        "This approach consists of training a classifier on positive examples of translation pairs, and negative examples of non-translations pairs.",
        "The trained model (in our case, a decision tree) is then used to tag an unknown pair of words as either \"Translation\" or \"Non-Translation\".",
        "One potential problem for building the training set, as pointed out for example by (Zhao and Ng, 2007) is this: we have a limited number of positive examples, but a very large amount of non-translation examples as obviously is the case for rare word translations in any training corpus.",
        "Including two many negative examples in the training set would lead the classifier to label every pairs as \"Non-Translation\".",
        "To tackle this problem, (Zhao and Ng, 2007) tuned the imbalance of positive/negative ratio by resampling the positive examples in the training set.",
        "We chose to reduce the set of negative examples, and found that a ratio of five negative examples to one positive is optimal in our case.",
        "A lower ratio improves precision but reduces recall for the \"Translation\" class.",
        "It is also desirable that the classifier focuses on discriminating between confusing pairs of translations.",
        "As most of the negative examples have a null co-occurrence score and a null context-vector similarity, they are excluded from the training set.",
        "The negative examples are randomly chosen among those that fulfill the following constraints:",
        "• non-null features ;",
        "• ratio of number of occurrences between source/target words higher than 0.2 and lower than 5.",
        "We use the J48 decision tree algorithm, in the Weka environment (Hall et al., 2009).",
        "Features are computed using the Jaccard similarity (section 3) for the co-occurrence model, and the implementation of the context-vector similarity presented in section 4.2.",
        "Even though the context vector similarity has been shown to achieve different accuracy depending on the pair of languages involved, the co-occurrence model is totally language independent.",
        "In the case of binary classification of translations, the two models are complementary to each other: word pairs with null co-occurrence are not considered by the context model while the context vector model gives more semantic information than the co-occurrence model.",
        "For these reasons, we suggest that it is possible to use a decision tree trained on one pair of languages to extract translations from another pair of languages.",
        "A similar approach is proposed in (Alfonseca et al., 2008): they present a word decomposition model designed for German language that they successfully applied to other compounding languages.",
        "Our approach consists in training a decision tree on a pair of languages and applying this model to the classification of unknown pairs of words in another pair of languages.",
        "Such an approach is especially useful for prospecting new translations from less known languages, using a well known language as training.",

        "We presented a new approach for extracting translations of rare words among aligned comparable documents.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first high accuracy extraction of rare lexicon from non-parallel documents.",
        "We obtained a F-Measure ranging from about 80% (French-English, Chinese-English) to 97% (French-Spanish).",
        "We also obtained good results for extracting lexicon for a pair of languages, using a decision tree trained with the data computed on another pair of languages.",
        "We yielded a 77% F-Measure for the extraction of Chinese-English lexicon, using Spanish-French for training the model.",
        "On top of these promising results, our approach presents several other advantages.",
        "First, we showed that it works well on automatically built corpora which require minimal human intervention.",
        "Aligned comparable documents can easily be collected and are available in large volumes.",
        "Moreover, the proposed machine learning method incorporating both context-vector and co-occurrence model has shown to give good results on pairs of languages that are very different from each other, such as Chinese-English.",
        "It is also applicable across different training and testing language pairs, making it possible for us to find rare word translations even for languages without training data.",
        "The co-occurrence model is completely language independent and have been shown to give good results on various pairs of languages, including Chinese-English."
