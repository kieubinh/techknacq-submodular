        "Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) has been proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010) as an extension of Textual Entailment (Dagan and Glickman, 2004) that consists in deciding, given two texts T and H in different languages, if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T. The task is inherently difficult, as it adds issues related to the multilingual dimension to the complexity of semantic inference at the textual level.",
        "For instance, the reliance of current monolingual TE systems on lexical resources (e.g. WordNet, VerbOcean, FrameNet) and deep processing components (e.g. syntactic and semantic parsers, co-reference resolution tools, temporal expressions recognizers and normalizers) has to confront, at the cross-lingual level, with the limited availability of lexical/semantic resources covering multiple languages, the limited coverage of the existing ones, and the burden of integrating language-specific components into the same cross-lingual architecture.",
        "As a first step to overcome these problems, (Mehdad et al., 2010) proposes a \"basic solution\", that brings CLTE back to the monolingual scenario by translating H into the language of T. Despite the advantages in terms of modularity and portability of the architecture, and the promising experimental results, this approach suffers from one main limitation which motivates the investigation on alternative solutions.",
        "Decoupling machine translation (MT) and TE, in fact, ties CLTE performance to the availability of MT components, and to the quality of the translations.",
        "As a consequence, on one side translation errors propagate to the TE engine hampering the entailment decision process.",
        "On the other side such unpredictable errors reduce the possibility to control the behaviour of the engine, and devise ad-hoc solutions to specific entailment problems.",
        "This paper investigates the idea, still unexplored, of a tighter integration of MT and TE algorithms and techniques.",
        "Our aim is to embed cross-lingual processing techniques inside the TE recognition process in order to avoid any dependency on external MT components, and eventually gain full control of the system's behaviour.",
        "Along this direction, we start from the acquisition and use of lexical knowledge, which represents the basic building block of any TE system.",
        "Using the basic solution proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010) as a term of comparison, we experiment with different sources of multilingual lexical knowledge to address the following questions:",
        "(1) What is the potential of the existing multilingual lexical resources to approach CLTE?",
        "To answer this question we experiment with lexical knowledge extracted from bilingual dictionaries, and from a multilingual lexical database.",
        "Such experiments show two main limitations of these resources, namely: i) their limited coverage, and ii) the difficulty to capture contextual information when only associations between single words (or at most named entities and multiword expressions) are used to support inference.",
        "(2) Does MT provide useful resources or techniques to overcome the limitations of existing resources?",
        "We envisage several directions in which inputs from MT research may enable or improve CLTE.",
        "As regards the resources, phrase and paraphrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora can be exploited as an effective way to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference.",
        "As regards the algorithms, statistical models based on cooccurrence observations, similar to those used in MT to estimate translation probabilities, may contribute to estimate entailment probabilities in CLTE.",
        "Focusing on the resources direction, the main contribution of this paper is to show that the lexical knowledge extracted from parallel corpora allows to significantly improve the results achieved with other multilingual resources.",
        "(3) In the cross-lingual scenario, can we achieve results comparable to those obtained in monolingual TE?",
        "Our experiments show that, although CLTE seems intrinsically more difficult, the results obtained using phrase and paraphrase tables are better than those achieved by average systems on monolingual datasets.",
        "We argue that this is due to the fact that parallel corpora are a rich source of cross-lingual paraphrases with no equivalents in monolingual TE.",
        "(4) Can parallel corpora be useful also for monolingual TE?",
        "To answer this question, we experiment on monolingual RTE datasets using paraphrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora.",
        "Our results improve those achieved with the most widely used resources in monolingual TE, namely WordNet, Verbocean, and Wikipedia.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 shortly overviews the role of lexical knowledge in textual entailment, highlighting a gap between TE and CLTE in terms of available knowledge sources.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 address the first three questions, giving motivations for the use ofbilingual parallel corpora in CLTE, and showing the results of our experiments.",
        "Section 5 addresses the last question, reporting on our experiments with paraphrase tables extracted from phrase tables on the monolingual RTE datasets.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper, and outlines the directions of our future research."

        "Such information ranges from i) lexical paraphrases (textual equivalences between terms) to ii) lexical relations preserving entailment between words, and iii) wordlevel similarity/relatedness scores.",
        "WordNet, the most widely used resource in TE, provides all the three types of information.",
        "Synonymy relations can be used to extract lexical paraphrases indicating that words from the text and the hypothesis entail each other, thus being interchangeable.",

        "It can be used as an alternative source of entailment rules, or to determine the semantic overlap between texts and hypotheses.",
        "Wikipedia is often used to extract probabilistic entailment rules based word similar-ity/relatedness scores.",
        "Despite the consensus on the usefulness of lexical knowledge for textual inference, determining the actual impact of these resources is not straightforward, as they always represent one component in complex architectures that may use them in different ways.",
        "As emerges from the ablation tests reported in (Bentivogli et al., 2010), even the most common resources proved to have a positive impact on some systems and a negative impact on others.",
        "Some previous works (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Zhao et al., 2009; Kouylekov et al., 2009) indicate, as main limitations of the mentioned resources, their limited coverage, their low precision, and the fact that they are mostly suitable to capture relations mainly between single words.",
        "Addressing CLTE we have to face additional and more problematic issues related to: i) the stronger need of lexical knowledge, and ii) the limited availability of multilingual lexical resources.",
        "As regards the first issue, it's worth noting that in the monolingual scenario simple \"bag of words\" (or \"bag of n-grams\") approaches are per se sufficient to achieve results above baseline.",
        "In contrast, their application in the cross-lingual setting is not a viable solution due to the impossibility to perform direct lexical matches between texts and hypotheses in different languages.",
        "This situation makes the availability of multilingual lexical knowledge a necessary condition to bridge the language gap.",
        "However, with the only exceptions represented by WordNet and Wikipedia, most of the aforementioned resources are available only for English.",
        "Multilingual lexical databases aligned with the English WordNet (e.g. MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002)) have been created for several languages, with different degrees of coverage.",
        "As an example, the 57,424 synsets of the Spanish section of MultiWordNet aligned to English cover just around 50% of the WordNet's synsets, thus making the coverage issue even more problematic than for TE.",
        "As regards Wikipedia, the cross-lingual links between pages in different languages offer a possibility to extract lexical knowledge useful for CLTE.",
        "However, due to their relatively small number (especially for some languages), bilingual lexicons extracted from Wikipedia are still inadequate to provide acceptable coverage.",

        "In addition, in order to experiment with different phrase tables providing different degrees of coverage and precision, we extracted 7 phrase tables by pruning the initial one on the direct phrase translation probabilities of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5.",

        "The comparison with the results achieved on monolingual data obtained by automatically translating the Spanish hypotheses (RTE3-G row in Table 2) leads to four main observations.",
        "First, we notice that dealing with MT-derived inputs, the optimal pruning threshold changes from 0.2 to 0.1, leading to the highest accuracy of 63.50%.",
        "This suggests that the noise introduced by incorrect translations can be tackled by increasing the coverage of the paraphrase table.",
        "Second, in line with the findings of (Mehdad et al., 2010), the results obtained over the MT-derived corpus are equal to those we achieve over the original RTE3 dataset (i.e. 63.50%).",
        "Third, the accuracy obtained over the CLTE corpus using combined phrase and paraphrase tables (62.88%, as reported in Table 1) is comparable to the best result gained over the automatically translated dataset (63.50%).",
        "In all the other cases, the use of phrase and paraphrase tables on CLTE data outperforms the results achieved on the same data after translation.",
        "Finally, it's worth remarking that applying our phrase matching method on the translated dataset without any additional source of knowledge would result in an overall accuracy of 62.12%, which is lower than the result obtained using only phrase tables on cross-lingual data (62.62%).",
        "This demonstrates that phrase tables can successfully replace MT systems in the CLTE task.",
        "In light of this, we suggest that extracting lexical knowledge from parallel corpora is a preferable solution to approach CLTE.",
        "One of the main reasons is that placing a black-box MT system at the front-end of the entailment process reduces the possibility to cope with wrong translations.",
        "Furthermore, the access to MT components is not easy (e.g. Google Translate limits the number and the size of queries, while open source MT tools cover few language pairs).",
        "Moreover, the task of developing a full-fledged MT system often requires the availability of parallel corpora, and is much more complex than extracting lexical knowledge from them."

        "In this paper we approached the cross-lingual Textual Entailment task focusing on the role of lexical knowledge extracted from bilingual parallel corpora.",
        "One of the main difficulties in CLTE raises from the lack of adequate knowledge resources to bridge the lexical gap between texts and hypotheses in different languages.",
        "Our approach builds on the intuition that the vast amount of knowledge that can be extracted from parallel data (in the form of phrase and paraphrase tables) offers a possible solution to the problem.",
        "To check the validity of our assumptions we carried out several experiments on an English-Spanish corpus derived from the RTE3 dataset, using phrasal matches as a criterion to approximate entailment.",
        "Our results show that phrase and paraphrase tables allow to: i) outperform the results achieved with the few multilingual lexical resources available, and ii) reach performance levels above the average scores obtained by participants in the monolingual RTE3 challenge.",
        "These improvements can be explained by the fact that the lexical knowledge extracted from parallel data provides good coverage both at the level of single words, and at the level of phrases.",
        "As a further contribution, we explored the application of paraphrase tables extracted from parallel data in the traditional monolingual scenario.",
        "Contrasting results with those obtained with the most widely used resources in TE, we demonstrated the effectiveness of paraphrase tables as a mean to overcome the bias towards single words featured by the existing resources.",
        "Our future work will address both the extraction of lexical information from bilingual parallel corpora, and its use for TE and CLTE.",
        "On one side, we plan to explore alternative ways to build phrase and paraphrase tables.",
        "One possible direction is to consider linguistically motivated approaches, such as the extraction of syntactic phrase tables as proposed by (Yamada and Knight, 2001).",
        "Another interesting direction is to investigate the potential of paraphrase patterns (i.e. patterns including part-of-speech slots), extracted from bilingual parallel corpora with the method proposed by (Zhao et al., 2009).",
        "On the other side we will investigate more sophisticated methods to exploit the acquired lexical knowledge.",
        "As a first step, the probability scores assigned to phrasal entries will be considered to perform weighted phrase matching as an improved criterion to approximate entailment."
