        "How is language influenced by the speaker's sociocultural identity?",
        "Quantitative sociolinguistics usually addresses this question through carefully crafted studies that correlate individual demographic attributes and linguistic variables – for example, the interaction between income and the \"dropped r\" feature of the New York accent (Labov, 1966).",
        "But such studies require the knowledge to select the \"dropped r\" and the speaker's income, from thousands of other possibilities.",
        "In this paper, we present a method to acquire such patterns from raw data.",
        "Using multi-output regression with structured sparsity, our method identifies a small subset of lexical items that are most influenced by demographics, and discovers conjunctions of demographic attributes that are especially salient for lexical variation.",
        "Sociolinguistic associations are difficult to model, because the space of potentially relevant interactions is large and complex.",
        "On the linguistic side there are thousands of possible variables, even if we limit ourselves to unigram lexical features.",
        "On the demographic side, the interaction between demographic attributes is often non-linear: for example, gender may negate or amplify class-based language differences (Zhang, 2005).",
        "Thus, additive models which assume that each demographic attribute makes a linear contribution are inadequate.",
        "In this paper, we explore the large space of potential sociolinguistic associations using structured sparsity.",
        "We treat the relationship between language and demographics as a set of multi-input, multioutput regression problems.",
        "The regression coefficients are arranged in a matrix, with rows indicating predictors and columns indicating outputs.",
        "We apply a composite regularizer that drives entire rows of the coefficient matrix to zero, yielding compact, interpretable models that reuse features across different outputs.",
        "If we treat the lexical frequencies as inputs and the author's demographics as outputs, the induced sparsity pattern reveals the set of lexical items that is most closely tied to demographics.",
        "If we treat the demographic attributes as inputs and build a model to predict the text, we can incrementally construct a conjunctive feature space of demographic attributes, capturing key non-linear interactions.",
        "The primary purpose of this research is exploratory data analysis to identify both the most linguistic-salient demographic features, and the most demographically-salient words.",
        "However, this model also enables predictions about demographic features by analyzing raw text, potentially supporting applications in targeted information extraction or advertising.",
        "On the task of predicting demographics from text, we find that our sparse model yields performance that is statistically indistinguishable from the full vocabulary, even with a reduction in the model complexity an order of magnitude.",
        "On the task of predicting text from author demographics, we find that our incrementally constructed feature set obtains significantly better perplexity than a linear model of demographic attributes.",
        "Our dataset is derived from prior work in which we gathered the text and geographical locations of 9,250 microbloggers on the website twitter, com (Eisenstein et al., 2010).",
        "Bloggers were selected from a pool of frequent posters whose messages include metadata indicating a geographical location within a bounding box around the continental United States.",
        "We limit the vocabulary to the 5,418 terms which are used by at least 40 authors; no stoplists are applied, as the use of standard or nonstandard orthography for stopwords (e.g., to vs. 2) may convey important information about the author.",

        "There are 33,178 such areas in the USA (the 9,250 mi-crobloggers in our dataset occupy 3,458 unique ZC-TAs), and they are designed to contain roughly equal numbers of inhabitants and demographically-homogeneous populations.",
        "The demographic attributes that we consider in this paper are shown in Table 1.",
        "All attributes are based on self-reports.",

        "While geographical aggregate statistics are frequently used to proxy for individual socioeconomic status in research areas such as public health (e.g., Rushton, 2008), it is clear that interpretation must proceed with caution.",

        "The selection of both words and demographic features can be framed in terms of multi-output regression with structured sparsity.",
        "To select the lexical indicators that best predict demographics, we construct a regression problem in which term frequencies are the predictors and demographic attributes are the outputs; to select the demographic features that predict word use, this arrangement is reversed.",
        "Through structured sparsity, we learn models in which entire sets of coefficients are driven to zero; this tells us which words and demographic features can safely be ignored.",
        "This section describes the model and implementation for output-regression with structured sparsity; in Section 4 and 5 we give the details of its application to select terms and demographic features.",
        "Formally, we consider the linear equation Y = XB + e, where,",
        "• Y is the dependent variable matrix, with dimensions N x T, where N is the number of samples and T is the number of output dimensions (or tasks);",
        "• X is the independent variable matrix, with dimensions N x P, where P is the number of input dimensions (or predictors);",
        "• B is the matrix of regression coefficients, with dimensions P x T;",
        "• e is a N x T matrix in which each element is noise from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution.",
        "We would like to solve the unconstrained optimization problem, where ||A||F indicates the squared Frobenius norm J2i J2j aij, and the function R(B) defines a norm on the regression coefficients B. Ridge regression applies the l2 norm R(B) = J2Ï=i\\Jbpt, and lasso regression applies the li norm R(B) = J2t=iJ2p in both cases, it is possible to decompose the multi-output regression problem, treating each output dimension separately.",
        "However, our working hypothesis is that there will be substantial correlations across both the vocabulary and the demographic features – for example, a demographic feature such as the percentage of Spanish speakers will predict a large set of words.",
        "Our goal is to select a small set of predictors yielding good performance across all output dimensions.",
        "Thus, we desire structured sparsity, in which entire rows of the coefficient matrix B are driven to zero.",
        "Structured sparsity is not achieved by the lasso's li norm.",
        "The lasso gives element-wise sparsity, in which many entries of B are driven to zero, but each predictor may have a non-zero value for some output dimension.",
        "To drive entire rows of B to zero, we require a composite regularizer.",
        "We consider the li)00norm, which is the sum of l0 norms across output dimensions: R(B) = J maxp bpt (Turlach et al., 2005).",
        "This norm, which corresponds to a multi-output lasso regression, has the desired property of driving entire rows of B to zero.",
        "There are several techniques for solving the li)00normalized regression, including interior point methods (Turlach et al., 2005) and projected gradient (Duchi et al., 2008; Quattoni et al., 2009).",
        "We choose the blockwise coordinate descent approach of Liu et al.",
        "(2009) because it is easy to implement and efficient: the time complexity of each iteration is independent of the number of samples.",
        "Due to space limitations, we defer to Liu et al.",
        "(2009) for a complete description of the algorithm.",
        "However, we note two aspects of our implementation which are important for natural language processing applications.",
        "The algorithm's efficiency is accomplished by precomputing the matrices C = XXTY and D = XTX, where XX and Y are the standardized versions of X and Y, obtained by subtracting the mean and scaling by the variance.",
        "Explicit mean correction would destroy the sparse term frequency data representation and render us unable to store the data in memory; however, we can achieve the same effect by computing C = XTY – NxTy, where x and y are row vectors indicating the means of X and Y respectively.",
        "We can similarly compute D = XTX - NXTX.",
        "If the number of predictors is too large, it may not be possible to store the dense matrix D in memory.",
        "We have found that approximation based on the truncated singular value decomposition provides an effective trade-off of time for space.",
        "Specifically, we compute XTX œ",
        "usvt (usvt)t = u (svtvstut) = um.",
        "Lower truncation levels are less accurate, but are faster and require less space: for K singular values, the storage cost is O(KP), instead of O(P); the time cost increases by a factor of K. This approximation was not necessary in the experiments presented here, although we have found that it performs well as long as the regularizer is not too close to zero.",
        "The regularization constant A can be computed using cross-validation.",
        "As A increases, we reuse the previous solution of B for initialization; this \"warm start\" trick can greatly accelerate the computation of the overall regularization path (Friedman et al., 2010).",
        "At each Aj, we solve the sparse multi-output regression; the solution Bi defines a sparse set of predictors for all tasks.",
        "We then use this limited set of predictors to construct a new input matrix Xi, which serves as the input in a standard ridge regression, thus refitting the model.",
        "The tuning set performance of this regression is the score for Ai.",
        "Such post hoc refitting is often used in tandem with the lasso and related sparse methods; the effectiveness of this procedure has been demonstrated in both theory (Wasserman and Roeder, 2009) and practice (Wu et al., 2010).",

        "In a mixture model, each component must define a distribution over all demographic variables, which may be difficult to estimate in a high-dimensional setting.",
        "Early examples of the use of sparsity in natural language processing include maximum entropy classification (Kazama and Tsujii, 2003), language modeling (Goodman, 2004), and incremental parsing (Riezler and Vasserman, 2004).",
