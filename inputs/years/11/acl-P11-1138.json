        "Wikification is the task of identifying and linking expressions in text to their referent Wikipedia pages.",
        "Recently, Wikification has been shown to form a valuable component for numerous natural language processing tasks including text classification (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007b; Chang et al., 2008), measuring semantic similarity between texts (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007a), cross-document co-reference resolution (Finin et al., 2009; Mayfield et al., 2009), and other tasks (Kulkarni et al., 2009).",
        "Previous studies on Wikification differ with respect to the corpora they address and the subset of expressions they attempt to link.",
        "For example, some studies focus on linking only named entities, whereas others attempt to link all \"interesting\" expressions, mimicking the link structure found in Wikipedia.",
        "Regardless, all Wikification systems are faced with a key Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W) task.",
        "In the D2W task, we're given a text along with explicitly identified substrings (called mentions) to disambiguate, and the goal is to output the corresponding Wikipedia page, if any, for each mention.",
        "For example, given the input sentence \"I am visiting friends in <Chicago>,\" we output http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago - the Wikipedia page for the city of Chicago, Illinois, and not (for example) the page for the 2002 film of the same name.",
        "Local D2W approaches disambiguate each mention in a document separately, utilizing clues such as the textual similarity between the document and each candidate disambiguation's Wikipedia page.",
        "Recent work on D2W has tended to focus on more sophisticated global approaches to the problem, in which all mentions in a document are disambiguated simultaneously to arrive at a coherent set of disambiguations (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han and Zhao, 2009).",
        "For example, if a mention of \"Michael Jordan\" refers to the computer scientist rather than the basketball player, then we would expect a mention of \"Monte Carlo\" in the same document to refer to the statistical technique rather than the location.",

        "The mention \"Jiangsu\" is unambiguous.",
        "The correct mapping from mentions to titles is marked by heavy edges",
        "In this paper, we analyze global and local approaches to the D2W task.",
        "Our contributions are as follows: (1) We present a formulation of the D2W task as an optimization problem with local and global variants, and identify the strengths and the weaknesses of each, (2) Using this formulation, we present a new global D2W system, called GLOW.",
        "In experiments on existing and novel D2W data sets,GLOW is shown to outperform the previous state-of-the-art system of (Milne and Witten, 2008b), (3) We present an error analysis and identify the key remaining challenge: determining when mentions refer to concepts not captured in Wikipedia."

        "Often, mentions correspond to a concept without a Wikipedia page; we treat this case by adding a special null title to the set W.",
        "The D2W task can be visualized as finding a many-to-one matching on a bipartite graph, with mentions forming one partition and Wikipedia titles the other (see Figure 1).",

        "Local D2W approaches, exemplified by (Bunescu and Paşca, 2006) and (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007), utilize 0 functions that assign higher scores to titles with content similar to that of the input document.",

        "2 is NP-hard, and approximations are required (Cucerzan, 2007).",
        "The common approach is to utilize the Wikipedia link graph to obtain an estimate pairwise relatedness between titles jj(ti, tj ) and to efficiently generate a disambiguation context r', a rough approximation to the optimal r .",

        "The two critical components of a global approach are the semantic relatedness function jj between two titles, and the disambiguation context r'.",
        "In (Milne and Witten, 2008b), the semantic context is defined to be a set of \"unambiguous surface forms\" in the text, and the title relatedness j is computed as Normalized Google Distance (NGD) (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007).",
        "On the other hand, in (Cucerzan, 2007) the disambiguation context is taken to be all plausible disambiguations of the named entities in the text, and title relatedness is based on the overlap in categories and incoming links.",

        "One explanation for the decrease is that the linker is trained on Wikipedia, but is being tested on non-Wikipedia text which has different characteristics.",

        "However, when compared with mentions from general text, Wikipedia mentions are disproportionately likely to have corresponding Wikipedia pages.",
