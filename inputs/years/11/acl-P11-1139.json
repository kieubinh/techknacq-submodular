        "Word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are necessary initial steps for more advanced Chinese language processing tasks, such as parsing and semantic role labeling.",
        "Joint approaches that resolve the two tasks simultaneously have received much attention in recent research.",
        "Previous work has shown that joint solutions led to accuracy improvements over pipelined systems by avoiding segmentation error propagation and exploiting POS information to help segmentation.",
        "A challenge for joint approaches is the large combined search space, which makes efficient decoding and structured learning of parameters very hard.",
        "Moreover, the representation ability of models is limited since using rich contextual word features makes the search intractable.",
        "To overcome such efficiency and effectiveness limitations, the approximate inference and reranking techniques have been explored in previous work (Zhang and Clark, 2010; Jiang et al., 2008b).",
        "In this paper, we present an effective and efficient solution for joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "Our work is motivated by several characteristics of this problem.",
        "First of all, a majority of words are easy to identify in the segmentation problem.",
        "For example, a simple maximum matching segmenter can achieve an f-score of about 90.",
        "We will show that it is possible to improve the efficiency and accuracy by using different strategies for different words.",
        "Second, segmenters designed with different views have complementary strength.",
        "We argue that the agreements and disagreements of different solvers can be used to construct an intermediate sub-word structure for joint segmentation and tagging.",
        "Since the sub-words are large enough in practice, the decoding for POS tagging over sub-words is efficient.",
        "Finally, the Chinese language is characterized by the lack of morphology that often provides important clues for POS tagging, and the POS tags contain much syntactic information, which need context information within a large window for disambiguation.",
        "For example, Huang et al.",
        "(2007) showed the effectiveness of utilizing syntactic information to rerank POS tagging results.",
        "As a result, the capability to represent rich contextual features is crucial to a POS tagger.",
        "In this work, we use a representation-efficiency tradeoff through stacked learning, a way of approximating rich non-local features.",
        "This paper describes a novel stacked sub-word model.",
        "Given multiple word segmentations of one sentence, we formally define a sub-word structure that maximizes the agreement of non-word-break positions.",
        "Based on the sub-word structure, joint word segmentation and POS tagging is addressed as a two step process.",
        "In the first step, one word-based segmenter, one character-based segmenter and one local character classifier are used to produce coarse segmentation and POS information.",
        "The results of the three predictors are then merged into sub-word sequences, which are further bracketed and labeled with POS tags by a fine-grained sub-word tagger.",
        "If a string is consistently segmented as a word by the three segmenters, it will be a correct word prediction with a very high probability.",
        "In the sub-word tagging phase, the fine-grained tagger mainly considers its POS tag prediction problem.",
        "For the words that are not consistently predicted, the fine-grained tagger will also consider their bracketing problem.",
        "The coarse-to-fine scheme significantly improves the efficiency of decoding.",
        "Furthermore, in the sub-word tagging step, word features in a large window can be approximately derived from the coarse segmentation and tagging results.",
        "To train a good sub-word tagger, we use the stacked learning technique, which can effectively correct the training/test mismatch problem.",
        "We conduct our experiments on the Penn Chinese Treebank and compare our system with the state-of-the-art systems.",
        "We present encouraging results.",
        "Our system achieves an f-score of 98.17 for the word segmentation task and an f-score of 94.02 for the whole task, resulting in relative error reductions of 14.1% and 5.5% respectively over the best system reported in the literature.",

        "Given a sequence of characters c = (ci,c#c), the task of word segmentation and POS tagging is to predict a sequence of word and POS tag pairs y = ((wi,pi), (w#y,p#y)), where Wi is a word, pi is its POS tag, and a \"#\" symbol denotes the number of elements in each variable.",
        "In order to avoid error propagation and make use of POS information for word segmentation, the two tasks should resolved jointly.",
        "Previous research has shown that the integrated methods outperformed pipelined systems (Ng and Low, 2004; Jiang et al., 2008a; Zhang and Clark, 2008).",
        "Two kinds of approaches are popular for joint word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "The first is the \"character-based\" approach, where basic processing units are characters which compose words.",
        "In this kind of approach, the task is formulated as the classification of characters into POS tags with boundary information.",
        "Both the IOB2 representation (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and the Start/End representation (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are popular.",
        "For example, the label B-NN indicates that a character is located at the begging of a noun.",
        "Using this method, POS information is allowed to interact with segmentation.",
        "Note that word segmentation can also be formulated as a sequential classification problem to predict whether a character is located at the beginning of, inside or at the end of a word.",
        "This character-by-character method for segmentation was first proposed in (Xue, 2003), and was then further used in POS tagging in (Ng and Low, 2004).",
        "One main disadvantage of this model is the difficulty in incorporating the whole word information.",
        "The second kind of solution is the \"word-based\" method, where the basic predicting units are words themselves.",
        "This kind of solver sequentially decides whether the local sequence of characters makes up a word as well as its possible POS tag.",
        "In particular, a word-based solver reads the input sentence from left to right, predicts whether the current piece of continuous characters is a word token and which class it belongs to.",
        "Solvers may use previously predicted words and their POS information as clues to find a new word.",
        "After one word is found and classified, solvers move on and search for the next possible word.",
        "This word-by-word method for segmentation was first proposed in (Zhang and Clark, 2007), and was then further used in POS tagging in (Zhang and Clark, 2008).",
        "In our previous work(Sun, 2010), we presented a theoretical and empirical comparative analysis of character-based and word-based methods for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "We showed that the two methods produced different distributions of segmentation errors in a way that could be explained by theoretical properties of the two models.",
        "A system combination method that leverages the complementary strength of word-based and character-based segmentation models was also successfully explored in their work.",
        "Different from our previous focus, the diversity of different models designed with different views is utilized to construct sub-word structures in this work.",
        "We will discuss the details in the next section.",
        "Stacked generalization is a meta-learning algorithm that was first proposed in (Wolpert, 1992) and (Breiman, 1996).",
        "The idea is to include two \"levels\" of predictors.",
        "The first level includes one or more predictors g1, ...gK : Rd – R; each receives input x G Rd and outputs a prediction gk (x).",
        "The second level consists of a single function h : Rd+K – R that takes as input (x, g1(x),gK(x)) and outputs a final prediction y = h(x, g1(x),gK(x)).",
        "Training is done as follows.",
        "The training data S = {(xt, yt) : t G [1, T]} is split into L equal-sized disjoint subsets S1,SL.",
        "Then functions g1,gL(where gl = (gl1, ...,glK)) are seperately trained on S – Sl, and are used to construct the augmented dataset S = {((xt, y},..., yf ), yt) : ytk = gfc (xt) and xt G Si}.",
        "Finally, eachgk is trained on the original dataset and the second level predictor h is trained on S. The intent of the cross-validation scheme is that yj is similar to the prediction produced by a predictor which is learned on a sample that does not include xt.",
        "Stacked learning has been applied as a system ensemble method in several NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition (Wu et al., 2003) and dependency parsing (Nivre and McDonald, 2008).",
        "This framework is also explored as a solution for learning nonlocal features in (Torres Martins et al., 2008).",

        "For segmentation, a token is considered to be correct if its boundaries match the boundaries of a word in the gold standard.",
        "For the whole task, both the boundaries and the POS tag have to be correctly identified.",
        "Table 3 shows the performance on the development data set of the three coarse-grained solvers.",
        "In this paper, we use 20 iterations to train Segw and SegCfor all experiments.",
        "Even only locally trained, the character classifier SegTagL still significantly outperforms the two state-of-the-art segmenters Segw and SegC.",
        "This good performance indicates that the POS information is very important for word segmentation.",
        "Since the base predictors to generate coarse information are two word segmenters and a local character classifier, the coarse decoding is efficient.",
        "If the length of sub-words is too short, i.e. the decoding path for sub-word sequences are too long, the decoding of the fine-grained stage is still hard.",
        "Although we cannot give a theoretical average length of sub-words, we can still show the empirical one.",
        "The average length of sub-words on the development set is 1.64, while the average length of words is 1.69.",
        "The number of all IOB-style POS tags is 59 (when using 5-fold cross-validation to generate stacked training samples).",
        "The number of all POS tags is 35.",
        "Empirically, the decoding over sub-words is x ( || )n+1times as slow as the decoding over words, where n is the order of the markov model.",
        "When a first order markov model is used, this number is 2.93.",
        "These statistics empirically suggest that the decoding over sub-word sequence can be efficient.",
        "On the other hand, the sub-word sequences are not perfect in the sense that they do not promise to recover all words because of the errors made in the first step.",
        "Similarly, we can only show the empirical upper bound of the sub-word tagging.",
        "The oracle performance of the final POS tagging on the development data set is shown in Table 4.",
        "The upper bound indicates that the coarse search procedure does not lose too much.",
        "One main disadvantage of character-based approach is the difficulty to incorporate word features.",
        "Since the sub-words are on average close to words, sub-word features are good approximations of word features.",
        "Table 5 shows the effect that features within different window size has on the sub-word tagging task.",
        "In this table, the symbol \"C\" means sub-word content features while the symbol \"T\" means IOB-style POS tag features.",
        "The number indicates the length of the window.",
        "For example, \"C:±1\" means that the tagger uses one preceding sub-word and one succeeding sub-word as features.",
        "From this table, we can clearly see the impact of features derived from neighboring sub-words.",
        "There is a significant increase between \"C:±2\" and \"C:±1\" models.",
        "This confirms our motivation that longer history and future features are crucial to the Chinese POS tagging problem.",
        "It is the main advantage of our model that making rich contextual features applicable.",
        "In all previous solutions, only features within a short history can be used due to the efficiency limitation.",

        "We showed that this sub-word structure could explore the complementary strength of different systems designed with different views.",
        "Moreover, the POS tagging could be efficiently and effectively resolved over sub-word sequences.",
        "To train a good sub-word tagger, we introduced a stacked learning procedure.",
        "Experiments showed that our approach was superior to the existing approaches reported in the literature.",
        "Machine learning and statistical approaches encounter difficulties when the input/output data have a structured and relational form.",
        "Research in empirical Natural Language Processing has been tackling these complexities since the early work in the field.",
        "Recent work in machine learning has provided several paradigms to globally represent and process such data: linear models for structured prediction, graphical models, constrained conditional models, and reranking, among others.",
        "A general expressivity-efficiency trade off is observed.",
        "Although the stacked sub-word model is an ad hoc solution for a particular problem, namely joint word segmentation and POS tagging, the idea to employ system ensemble and stacked learning in general provides an alternative for structured problems.",
        "Multiple \"cheap\" coarse systems are used to provide diverse outputs, which may be inaccurate.",
        "These outputs are further merged into an intermediate representation, which allows an extractive system to use rich contexts to predict the final results.",
        "A natural avenue for future work is the extension of our method to other NLP tasks."
