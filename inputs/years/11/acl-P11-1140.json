        "A compound is a lexeme that consists of more than one stem.",
        "Informally, a compound is a combination of two or more words that function as a single unit of meaning.",
        "Some compounds are written as space-separated words, which are called open compounds (e.g. hard drive), while others are written as single words, which are called closed compounds (e.g. wallpaper).",
        "In this paper, we shall focus only on closed compounds because open compounds do not require further splitting.",
        "The objective of compound splitting is to split a compound into its corresponding sequence of constituents.",
        "If we look at how compounds are created from lexemes in the first place, we find that for some languages, compounds are formed by concatenating existing words, while in other languages compounding additionally involves certain morphological operations.",
        "These morphological operations can become very complex as we illustrate in the following case studies.",
        "Below, we look at splitting compounds from 3 different languages.",
        "The examples introduce in part the notation used for the decision rule outlined in Section 3.1.",
        "The word flowerpot can appear as a closed or open compound in English texts.",
        "To automatically split the closed form we have to try out every split point and choose the split with minimal costs according to a cost function.",
        "Let's assume that we already know that flowerpot must be split into two parts.",
        "Then we have to position two split points that mark the end of each part (one is always reserved for the last character position).",
        "The number of split points is denoted by K (i.e. K = 2), while the position of split points is denoted by n1 and n2.",
        "Since flowerpot consists of 9 characters, we have 8 possibilities to position split point n1 within the characters c1,... ,c8.",
        "The final split point corresponds with the last character, that is, n2 = 9.",
        "Trying out all possible single splits results in the following candidates:",
        "flowerpot – f + lowerpot flowerpot – fl + owerpot flowerpot – flower + pot flowerpot – flowerpo +1",
        "If we associate each compound part candidate with a cost that reflects how frequent this part occurs in a large collection of English texts, we expect that the correct split flower + pot will have the lowest cost.",
        "The previous example covered a case where the compound is constructed by directly concatenating the compound parts.",
        "While this works well for English, other languages require additional morphological operations.",
        "To demonstrate, we look at the German compound Verkehrszeichen (traffic sign) which consists of the two nouns Verkehr (traffic) and Zeichen (sign).",
        "Let's assume that we want to split this word into 3 parts, that is, K = 3.",
        "Then, we get the following candidates.",
        "Verkehrszeichen – V + e + rkehrszeichen Verkehrszeichen – V + er + kehrszeichen the compound part candidates to be transformed by some morphological operation, we can lookup the transformed compound parts in a dictionary or determine their frequencies in some large collection of Greek texts.",
        "Let's assume that we need only one split point.",
        "Then this yields the following compound part candidates:",
        "XapiÖKorjio Xapxi + Koim",
        "Verkehrszeichen – Verkehr + s + zeichen",
        "Verkehrszeichen – Verkehrszeich + e + n",
        "Using the same procedure as described before, we can lookup the compound parts in a dictionary or determine their frequency from large text collections.",
        "This yields the optimal split points n1 = 7,n2 = 8,n3 = 15.",
        "The interesting part here is the additional s morpheme, which is called a linking morpheme, because it combines the two compound parts to form the compound Verkehrszeichen.",
        "If we have a list of all possible linking morphemes, we can hypothesize them between two ordinary compound parts.",
        "The previous example required the insertion of a linking morpheme between two compound parts.",
        "We shall now look at a more complicated morphological operation.",
        "The Greek compound xapiÖKouio (cardboard box) consists of the two parts xapi1 (paper) and kout1 (box).",
        "Here, the problem is that the parts xapiÖ and Kojio are not valid words in Greek.",
        "To lookup the correct words, we must substitute the suffix of the compound part candidates with some other morphemes.",
        "Ifwe allow",
        "Here, gk : s/t denotes the kth compound part which is obtained by replacing string s with string t in the original string, resulting in the transformed part gk.",
        "Our goal is to design a language-independent compound splitter that is useful for machine translation.",
        "The previous examples addressed the importance of a cost function that favors valid compound parts versus invalid ones.",
        "In addition, the examples have shown that, depending on the language, the morphological operations can become very complex.",
        "For most Germanic languages like Danish, German, or Swedish, the list of possible linking morphemes is rather small and can be provided manually.",
        "However, in general, these lists can become very large, and language experts who could provide such lists might not be at our disposal.",
        "Because it seems infeasible to list the morphological operations explicitly, we want to find and extract those operations automatically in an unsupervised way and provide them as an additional knowledge source to the decompounding algorithm.",
        "Another problem is how to evaluate the quality of the compound splitter.",
        "One way is to compile for every language a large collection of compounds together with their valid splits and to measure the proportion of correctly split compounds.",
        "Unfortunately, such lists do not exist for many languages.",
        "While the training algorithm for our compound splitter shall be unsupervised, the evaluation data needs to be verified by human experts.",
        "Since we are interested in improving machine translation and to circumvent the problem of explicitly annotating compounds, we evaluate the compound splitter within a machine translation task.",
        "By decompounding training and test data of a machine translation system, we expect an increase in the number of matching phrase table entries, resulting in better translation quality measured in BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "If BLEU score is sensitive enough to measure the quality improvements obtained from decompounding, there is no need to generate a separate gold standard for compounds.",
        "Finally, we do not want to split non-compounds and named entities because we expect them to be translated non-compositionally.",
        "For example, the German word Deutschland (Germany) could be split into two parts Deutsch (German) + Land (country).",
        "Although this is a valid split, named entities should be kept as single units.",
        "An example for a non-compound is the German participle vereinbart (agreed) which could be wrongly split into the parts Verein (club) + Bart (beard).",
        "To avoid overly eager splitting, we will compile a list ofnon-compounds in an unsupervised way that serves as an exception list for the compound splitter.",
        "To summarize, we aim to solve the following problems:",
        "• Define a cost function that favors valid compound parts and rejects invalid ones.",
        "• Learn morphological operations, which is important for languages that have complex compound forming processes.",
        "• Apply compound splitting to machine translation to aid in translation of compounds that have not been seen in the bilingual training data.",
        "• Avoid splitting non-compounds and named entities as this may result in wrong translations."

        "We are given a phrase table that provides translations for phrases from a source language l into English and from English into l. Under the assumption that English does not contain many closed compounds, we can search the phrase table for those single-token source words f in language l, which translate into multi-token English phrases e1,... ,en for n > 1.",

        "This filtering pass has the advantage of outputting only those compound part candidates which were actually used to split words from web texts.",
        "The thresholding also further reduces the risk of introducing noise.",
        "Another advantage is that since the set of parts output in the first pass may contain a high number of compounds, the filter is able to remove a large number of these compounds by examining relative frequencies.",
        "In our experiments, we have assumed that compound part frequencies are higher than the compound frequency and so remove words from the part list that can themselves be split and have a relatively high frequency.",
        "Finally, after removing the low frequency compound parts, we obtain the final compound splitter vocabulary.",
        "To avoid eager splitting of non-compounds and named entities, we use a variant of the procedure described in Section 4.1.1.",
        "By emitting all those source words that translate with high probability into single-token English words, we obtain a list of words that should not be split.",

        "The number of remaining Greek characters in the translation output was reduced from 6, 715 in the baseline system to 3, 624 in the system which used decompounding.",
        "In addition, a few other metrics like the number of source words that consisted of more than 15 characters decreased as well.",
        "Because we do not know how many compounds are actually contained in the Greek source sentences and because the frequency of using compounds might vary across languages, we cannot expect the same performance gains across languages belonging to different language families.",
        "An interesting observation is, however, that if one language from a language family shows performance gains, then there are performance gains for all the languages in that family.",
        "We also investigated the effect of not using any morphological operations.",
        "Disallowing all morphological operations accounts for a loss of 0.1 - 0.2 BLEU points across translation systems and increases the compound parts vocabulary lists by up to 20%, which means that most of the gains can be achieved with simple concatenation.",
        "The exception lists were generated according to the procedure described in Section 4.4.",
        "Since we aimed for precision rather than recall when constructing these lists, we inserted only those source",

        "We have presented a language-independent method for decompounding that improves translations for compounds that otherwise rarely occur in the bilingual training data.",
        "We learned a set of morphological operations from a translation phrase table and determined suitable compound part candidates from monolingual data in a two pass process.",
        "This allowed us to learn morphemes and operations for languages where these lists are not available.",
        "In addition, we have used the bilingual information stored in the phrase table to avoid splitting non-compounds as well as frequent named entities.",
        "All knowledge sources were combined in a cost function that was applied in a compound splitter based on dynamic programming.",
        "Finally, we have shown this improves translation performance on languages from different language families.",
        "The weights were not optimized in a systematic way but set manually to their respective values.",
        "In the future, the weights of the cost function should be learned automatically by optimizing an appropriate error function.",
