        "Previous research has mostly focused on relations between particular kind of arguments, e.g., semantic roles, noun compounds.",
        "Notwithstanding their significance, they target a fairly narrow text semantics compared to the broad semantics encoded in text.",

        "An algebra for composing semantic primitives is defined, allowing to automatically determine the primitives values for the composition of any two relations.",
        "The CSR algorithm makes use of the extended definition and algebra to discover inference axioms in an unsupervised manner.",
        "Its usefulness is shown using a set of eight common relations, obtaining 78 axioms.",
        "Empirical evaluation shows the axioms add 2.32% of relations in relative terms with an overall accuracy of 0.88, more than what state-of-the-art semantic parsers achieve.",
        "The framework presented is completely independent of any particular set of relations.",
        "Even though different sets may call for different ontologies and primitives, we believe the model is generally applicable; the only requirement is to use the extended definition.",
        "This is a novel way of retrieving semantic relations in the field of computational linguistics."
