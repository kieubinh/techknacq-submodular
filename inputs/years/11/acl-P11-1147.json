        "The goal of Learning by Reading (LbR) is to enable a computer to learn about a new domain and then to reason about it in order to perform such tasks as question answering, threat assessment, and explanation (Strassel et al., 2010).",
        "This requires joint efforts from Information Extraction, Knowledge Representation, and logical inference.",
        "All these steps depend on the system having access to basic, often unstated, foundational knowledge about the domain.",
        "Most documents, however, do not explicitly mention this information in the text, but assume basic background knowledge about the domain, such as positions (\"quarterback\"), titles (\"winner\"), or actions (\"throw\") for sports game reports.",
        "Without this knowledge, the text will not make sense to the reader, despite being well-formed English.",
        "Luckily, the information is often implicitly contained in the document or can be inferred from similar texts.",
        "Our system automatically acquires domain-specific knowledge (classes and actions) from large amounts of unlabeled data, and trains a probabilistic model to determine and apply the most informative classes (quarterback, etc.)",
        "at appropriate levels of generality for unseen data.",
        "E.g., from sentences such as \"Steve Young threw a pass to Michael Holt\", \"Quarterback Steve Young finished strong\", and \"Michael Holt, the receiver, left early\" we can learn the classes quarterback and receiver, and the proposition \"quarterbacks throw passes to receivers\".",
        "We will thus assume that the implicit knowledge comes in two forms: actions in the form of predicate-argument structures, and classes as part of the source data.",
        "Our task is to identify and extract both.",
        "Since LbR systems must quickly adapt and scale well to new domains, we need to be able to work with large amounts of data and minimal supervision.",
        "Our approach produces simple propositions about the domain (see Figure 1 for examples of actual propositions learned by our system).",
        "American football was the first official evaluation domain in the DARPA-sponsored Machine Reading program, and provides the background for a number of LbR systems (Mulkar-Mehta et al., 2010).",
        "Sports is particularly amenable, since it usually follows a finite, explicit set of rules.",
        "Due to its popularity, results are easy to evaluate with lay subjects, and game reports, databases, etc.",
        "provide a large amount of data.",
        "The same need for basic knowledge appears in all domains, though.",
        "In music, musicians play instruments, in electronics, components constitute circuits, circuits use electricity, etc.",
        "Teams beat teams Teams play teams Quarterbacks throw passes Teams win games Teams defeat teams Receivers catch passes Quarterbacks complete passes Quarterbacks throw passes to receivers Teams play games Teams lose games",
        "Figure 1: The ten most frequent propositions discovered by our system for the American football domain",
        "Our approach differs from verb-argument identification or Named Entity (NE) tagging in several respects.",
        "While previous work on verb-argument selection (Pardo et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2010) uses fixed sets of classes, we cannot know a priori how many and which classes we will encounter.",
        "We therefore provide a way to derive the appropriate classes automatically and include a probability distribution for each of them.",
        "Our approach is thus less restricted and can learn context-dependent, finegrained, domain-specific propositions.",
        "While a NE-tagged corpus could produce a general proposition like \"PERSON throws to PERSON\", our method enables us to distinguish the arguments and learn \"quarterback throws to receiver\" for American football and \"outfielder throws to third base\" for baseball.",
        "While in NE tagging each word has only one correct tag in a given context, we have hierarchical classes: an entity can be correctly labeled as a player or a quarterback (and possibly many more classes), depending on the context.",
        "By taking context into account, we are also able to label each sentence individually and account for unseen entities without using external resources.",
        "Our contributions are:",
        "• we use unsupervised learning to train a model that makes use of automatically extracted classes to uncover implicit knowledge in the form of predicate-argument propositions",
        "• we evaluate the explanatory power, generalization capability, and sensibility of the propositions using both statistical measures and human judges, and compare them to several baselines",
        "• we provide a model and a set of propositions that can be used to improve the performance of end-to-end LbR systems via textual enrichment."

        "The resulting corpus comprises 1,359,709 sentences from game reports, background stories, and opinion pieces.",
        "In a first step, we parse all documents with the Stanford dependency parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006) (see Figure 2, step 1).",
        "The output is lemmatized (collapsing \"throws\", \"threw\", etc., into \"throw\"), and marked for various dependencies (nsubj, amod, etc.).",
        "This enables us to extract the predicate argument structure, like subject-verb-object, or additional prepositional phrases (see Figure 2, step 2).",
        "These structures help to simplify the model by discarding additional words like modifiers, determiners, etc., which are not essential to the proposition.",
        "The same approach is used by (Brody, 2007).",
        "We also concatenate multiword names (identified by sequences of NNPs) with an underscore to form a single token (\"Steve/NNP Young/NNP\" – \"Steve-Young\").",
        "To derive the classes used for entities, we do not restrict ourselves to a fixed set, but derive a domain-specific set directly from the data.",
        "This step is performed simultaneously with the corpus generation described above.",
        "We utilize three syntactic constructions to identify classes, namely nominal modifiers, copula verbs, and appositions, see below.",

        "While we find it straightforward to collect classes for entities in this way, we did not find similar patterns for verbs.",

        "The total number of distinct classes for entities is 63, 942.",

        "Due to the unsupervised nature of the extraction process, many of the extracted classes are hapaxes and/or random noise.",
        "Most entities have only a small number of applicable classes (a football player usually has one main position, and a few additional roles, such as star, teammate, etc.).",
        "We handle this by limiting the number of classes considered to 3 per entity.",
        "This constraint reduces the total number of distinct classes to 26,165, and the average number of classes per entity to 2.53.",
        "The reduction makes for a more tractable model size without losing too much information.",
        "The class alphabet is still several magnitudes larger than that for NE or POS tagging.",
        "Alternatively, one could use external resources such as Wikipedia, Yago (Suchanek et al., 2007), or WordNet++ (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010) to select the most appropriate classes for each entity.",
        "This is likely to have a positive effect on the quality of the applicable classes and merits further research.",
        "Here, we focus on the possibilities of a self-contained system without recurrence to outside resources.",
        "The number of classes we consider for each entity also influences the number of possible propositions: if we consider exactly one class per entity, there will be little overlap between sentences, and thus no generalization possible – the model will produce many distinct propositions.",

        "It includes the risk, though, that one selects a set of bad annotators solely because they agree with one another.",
        "We use inter-annotator agreement to quantify the reliability of the judgments.",
        "Apart from the simple agreement measure, which records how often annotators choose the same value for an item, there are several statistics that qualify this measure by adjusting for other factors.",
        "One frequently used measure, Cohen's k, has the disadvantage that if there is prevalence of one answer, k will be low (or even negative), despite high agreement (Feinstein and Ci-cchetti, 1990).",

        "It assumes that expected agreement is a function of the number of choices rather than chance.",
        "It uses the same general formula as k, where Pq is the actual raw agreement measured, and Pe is the expected agreement.",
        "The difference with k is that Pe for the G-index is defined as Pe = 1/q, where q is the number of available categories, instead of expected chance agreement.",
        "Under most conditions, G and k are equivalent, but in the case of high raw agreement and few categories, G gives a more accurate estimation of the agreement.",
        "We thus report raw agreement, k, and G-index.",
        "Despite early spammer detection, there are still outliers in the final data, which have to be accounted for when calculating agreement.",
        "We take the same approach as in the statistical spammer detection and delete outliers that are more than one standard deviation below the rest of the annotators' average.",
        "The raw agreement for both samples combined is 0.82, G = 0.58, and k = 0.48.",
