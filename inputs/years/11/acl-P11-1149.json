        "Semantic parsing, the ability to transform Natural Language (NL) input into a formal Meaning Representation (MR), is one of the longest standing goals of natural language processing.",
        "The importance of the problem stems from both theoretical and practical reasons, as the ability to convert NL into a formal MR has countless applications.",
        "The term semantic parsing has been used ambiguously to refer to several semantic tasks (e.g., semantic role labeling).",
        "We follow the most common definition of this task: finding a mapping between NL input and its interpretation expressed in a well-defined formal MR language.",
        "Unlike shallow semantic analysis tasks, the output of a semantic parser is complete and unambiguous to the extent it can be understood or even executed by a computer system.",
        "Current approaches for this task take a data driven approach (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney, 2007), in which the learning algorithm is given a set of NL sentences as input and their corresponding MR, and learns a statistical semantic parser – a set of parameterized rules mapping lexical items and syntactic patterns to their MR.",
        "Given a sentence, these rules are applied recursively to derive the most probable interpretation.",
        "Since semantic interpretation is limited to the syntactic patterns observed in the training data, in order to work well these approaches require considerable amounts of annotated data.",
        "Unfortunately annotating sentences with their MR is a time consuming task which requires specialized domain knowledge and therefore minimizing the supervision effort is one of the key challenges in scaling semantic parsers.",
        "In this work we present the first unsupervised approach for this task.",
        "Our model compensates for the lack of training data by employing a self training protocol based on identifying high confidence self labeled examples and using them to retrain the model.",
        "We base our approach on a simple observation: semantic parsing is a difficult structured prediction task, which requires learning a complex model, however identifying good predictions can be done with a far simpler model capturing repeating patterns in the predicted data.",
        "We present several simple, yet highly effective confidence measures capturing such patterns, and show how to use them to train a semantic parser without manually annotated sentences.",
        "Our basic premise, that predictions with high confidence score are of high quality, is further used to improve the performance of the unsupervised training procedure.",
        "Our learning algorithm takes an EM-like iterative approach, in which the predictions of the previous stage are used to bias the model.",
        "While this basic scheme was successfully applied to many unsupervised tasks, it is known to converge to a sub optimal point.",
        "We show that by using confidence estimation as a proxy for the model's prediction quality, the learning algorithm can identify a better model compared to the default convergence criterion.",
        "We evaluate our learning approach and model on the well studied Geoquery domain (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2001), consisting of natural language questions and their prolog interpretations used to query a database consisting of U.S. geographical information.",

        "Our learning framework takes a self training approach in which the learner is iteratively trained over its own predictions.",
        "Successful application of this approach depends heavily on two important factors - how to select high quality examples to train the model on, and how to define the learning objective so that learning can halt once a good model is found.",
        "Both of these questions are trivially answered when working in a supervised setting: by using the labeled data for training the model, and defining the learning objective with respect to the annotated data (for example, loss-minimization in the supervised version of our system).",
        "In this work we suggest to address both of the above concerns by approximating the quality of the model's predictions using a confidence measure computed over the statistics of the self generated predictions.",
        "Output structures which fall close to the center of mass of these statistics will receive a high confidence score.",
        "The first issue is addressed by using examples assigned a high confidence score to train the model, acting as labeled examples.",
        "We also note that since the confidence score provides a good indication for the model's prediction performance, it can be used to approximate the overall model performance, by observing the model's total confidence score over all its predictions.",

        "We describe the details of integrating the confidence score into the learning framework in Sec. 3.1.",
        "Although using the model's prediction score (i.e., wT$(x, y, z)) as an indication of correctness is a natural choice, we argue and show empirically, that unsupervised learning driven by confidence estimation results in a better performing model.",
        "This empirical behavior also has theoretical justification: training the model using examples selected according to the model's parameters (i.e., the top ranking structures) may not generalize much further beyond the existing model, as the training examples will simply reinforce the existing model.",
        "The statistics used for confidence estimation are different than those used by the model to create the output structures, and can therefore capture additional information unobserved by the prediction model.",
        "This assumption is based on the well established idea of multi-view learning, applied successfully to many NL applications (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999).",
        "According to this idea if two models use different views of the data, each of them can enhance the learning process of the other.",
        "The success of our learning procedure hinges on finding good confidence measures, whose confidence prediction correlates well with the true quality of the prediction.",
        "The ability of unsupervised confidence estimation to provide high quality confidence predictions can be explained by the observation that prominent prediction patterns are more likely to be correct.",
        "If a non-random model produces a prediction pattern multiple times it is likely to be an indication of an underlying phenomenon in the data, and therefore more likely to be correct.",
        "Our specific choice of confidence measures is guided by the intuition that unlike structure prediction (i.e., solving the inference problem) which requires taking statistics over complex and intricate patterns, identifying high quality predictions can be done using much simpler patterns that are significantly easier to capture.",

        "While this is a natural convergence criterion, it provides no performance guarantees, and in practice it is very likely that the quality of the model (i.e., its performance) fluctuates during the learning process.",

        "The speciic learning algorithms used are discussed in Sec. 3.3.",
        "The training examples required for learning are obtained by selecting high conidence examples - the algorithm irst takes statistics over the current predicted set of output structures (line 7), and then based on these statistics computes a conidence score for each structure, selecting the top ranked ones as positive training examples, and if needed, the bottom ones as negative examples (line 8).",
        "The set of top conidence examples (for either correct or incorrect prediction), at iteration i of the algorithm, is denoted Sconf.",
        "The exact nature of the confidence computation is discussed in Sec. 3.2.",

        "Conidence estimation is calculated over a batch of input (x) - output (z) pairs.",
        "Each pair decomposes into smaller irst order and second order decisions (defined Sec. 2.2).",
        "Confidence estimation is done by computing the statistics of these decisions, over the entire set of predicted structures.",
        "In the rest of this section we introduce the conidence measures used by our system.",
        "Translation Model The irst approach essentially constructs a simpliied translation model, capturing word-to-predicate mapping patterns.",
        "This can be considered as an abstraction of the prediction model: we collapse the intricate feature representation into high level decisions and take statistics over these decisions.",
        "Since it takes statistics over considerably less variables than the actual prediction model, we expect this model to make reliable conidence predictions.",
        "We consider two variations of this approach, the irst constructs a unigram model over the irst order decisions and the second a bigram model over the second order decisions.",
        "Formally, given a set of predicted structures we deine the following conidence scores:",
        "Unigram Score:",
        "Bigram Score:",
        "Structural Proportion Unlike the irst approach which decomposes the predicted structure into individual decisions, this approach approximates the model's performance by observing global properties of the structure.",
        "We take statistics over the proportion between the number of predicates in z and the number of words in x.",
        "Given a set of structure predictions S, we compute this proportion for each structure (denoted as Prop(x, z)) and calculate the average proportion over the entire set (denoted as AvProp(S)).",
        "The conidence score assigned to a given structure (x, y) is simply the difference between its proportion and the averaged proportion, or formally",
        "This measure captures the global complexity of the predicted structure and penalizes structures which are too complex (high negative values) or too simplistic (high positive values).",
        "Combined The two approaches deined above capture different views of the data, a natural question is then - can these two measures be combined to provide a more powerful estimation?",
        "We suggest a third approach which combines the irst two approaches.",
        "It irst uses the score produced by the latter approach to ilter out unlikely candidates, and then ranks the remaining ones with the former approach and selects those with the highest rank.",
        "Given a set of self generated structures, the parameter vector can be updated (line 9 in Alg.",
        "1).",
        "We consider two learning algorithm for this purpose.",

        "The algorithm decomposes each predicted formula and its corresponding input sentence into a feature vector $(x, y, z) normalized by the size of the input sentence | x| , and assigns a binary label to this vector.",

        "The low performance of the PredictionScore model is also not surprising, and it demonstrates one of the key principles in conidence estimation - the score should be comparable across predictions done over different inputs, and not the same input, as done in PredictionScore model.",
        "(2) How does confidence driven sample selection contribute to the learning process?",
        "Comparing the systems driven by conidence sample-selection to the All Examples approach uncovers an interesting tradeoff between training with more (noisy) data and selectively training the system with higher quality examples.",
        "We argue that carefully selecting high quality training examples will result in better performance.",
        "The empirical results indeed support our argument, as the best performing model (Response Based) is achieved by sample selection with perfect knowledge of prediction correctness.",
        "The conidence-based sample selection system (Combined) is the best performing system out of all the self-trained systems.",
        "Nonetheless, the All Examples strategy performs well when compared to Comb ined, justifying a closer look at that aspect of our system.",
        "We argue that different conidence measures capture different properties of the data, and hypothesize that combining their scores will improve the resulting model.",
        "In Tab.",
        "3 we compare the results of the Combined measure to the results of its individual components - PROPORTION and BIGRAM.",
        "We compare these results both when using the binary and structured learning algorithms.",
        "Results show that using the Combined measure leads to an improved performance, better than any of the individual measures, suggesting that it can effectively exploit the properties of each confidence measure.",
        "Furthermore, Combined is the only sample selection strategy that outperforms ALL EXAMPLES.",
        "(3) Can confidence measures serve as a good proxy for the model's performance?",
        "In the unsupervised settings we study the learning process may not converge to an optimal model.",
        "We argue that by selecting the model that maximizes the averaged conidence score, a better model can be found.",
        "We validate this claim empirically in Tab.",
        "4.",
        "We compare the performance of the model selected using the conidence score to the performance of the i-nal model considered by the learning algorithm (see Sec. 3.1 for details).",
        "We also compare it to the best model achieved in any of the learning iterations.",
        "Since these experiments required running the learning algorithm many times, we focused on the binary learning algorithm as it converges considerably faster.",
        "In order to focus the evaluation on the effects of learning, we ignore the initial model generated manually (Initial Model) in these experiments.",
        "In order to compare models performance across the different iterations fairly, a uniform scale, such as UNIGRAM and BIGRAM, is required.",
        "In the case of the Combined measure we used the BiGRAM measure for performance estimation, since it is one of its underlying components.",
        "In the PRED.",
        "Score and Proportion models we used both their confidence prediction, and the simple Unigram conidence score to evaluate model performance (the latter appear in parentheses in Tab.",
        "4).",
        "Results show that the over overall confidence score serves as a reliable proxy for the model performance - using UNIGRAM and BIGRAM the framework can select the best performing model, far better than the performance of the default model to which the system converged.",

        "The dificulty of providing the required supervision motivated learning approaches using weaker forms of supervision.",
        "(Chen and Mooney, 2008; Liang et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009; Titov and Kozhevnikov, 2010) ground NL in an external world state directly referenced by the text.",
        "The NL input in our setting is not restricted to such grounded settings and therefore we cannot exploit this form ofsupervi-sion.",
        "Recent work (Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011) suggest using response-based learning protocols, which alleviate some of the supervision effort.",
        "This work takes an additional step in this direction and suggest an unsupervised protocol.",
        "Other approaches to unsupervised semantic analysis (Poon and Domingos, 2009; Titov and Kle-mentiev, 2011) take a different approach to semantic representation, by clustering semantically equivalent dependency tree fragments, and identifying their predicate-argument structure.",
        "While these approaches have been applied successfully to semantic tasks such as question answering, they do not ground the input in a well deined output language, an essential component in our task.",
        "Our unsupervised approach follows a self training protocol (Yarowsky, 1995; McClosky et al., 2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007b) enhanced with constraints restricting the output space (Chang et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2009).",
        "A Self training protocol uses its own predictions for training.",
        "We estimate the quality of the predictions and use only high conidence examples for training.",
        "This selection criterion provides an additional view, different than the one used by the prediction model.",
        "Multi-view learning is a well established idea, implemented in methods such as co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "Quality assessment of a learned model output was explored by many previous works (see (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006) for a survey), and applied to several NL processing tasks such as syntactic parsing (Reichart and Rappoport, 2007a; Yates et al., 2006), machine translation (Ueffing and Ney, 2007), speech (Koo et al., 2001), relation extraction (Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2007), IE (Culotta and and dialog systems (Lin and Weng, 2008).",
        "In addition to sample selection we use conidence estimation as a way to approximate the overall quality of the model and use it for model selection.",
        "This use of conidence estimation was explored in (Reichart et al., 2010), to select between models trained with different random starting points.",
        "In this work we integrate this estimation deeper into the learning process, thus allowing our training procedure to return the best performing model."

        "We introduced an unsupervised learning algorithm for semantic parsing, the irst for this task to the best of our knowledge.",
