        "The rapidly expanding e-commerce has facilitated consumers to purchase products online.",
        "More than $156 million online product retail sales have been done in the US market during 2009 (Forrester Research, 2009).",
        "Most retail Web sites encourage consumers to write reviews to express their opinions on various aspects of the products.",

        "on June 17, 20O9byclyni",
        "(b) Free Text Review",
        "huge collections of consumer reviews on the Web.",
        "These reviews have become an important resource for both consumers and firms.",
        "Consumers commonly seek quality information from online consumer reviews prior to purchasing a product, while many firms use online consumer reviews as an important resource in their product development, marketing, and consumer relationship management.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, most online reviews express consumers' overall opinion ratings on the product, and their opinions on multiple aspects of the product.",
        "While a product may have hundreds of aspects, we argue that some aspects are more important than the others and have greater influence on consumers' purchase decisions as well as firms' product development strategies.",
        "Take iPhone 3GS as an example, some aspects like \"battery\" and \"speed,\" are more important than the others like \"moisture sensor.\"",
        "Generally, identifying the important product aspects will benefit both consumers and firms.",
        "Consumers can conveniently make wise purchase decision by paying attentions on the important aspects, while firms can focus on improving the quality of these aspects and thus enhance the product reputation effectively.",
        "However, it is impractical for people to identify the important aspects from the numerous reviews manually.",
        "Thus, it becomes a compelling need to automatically identify the important aspects from consumer reviews.",
        "A straightforward solution for important aspect identification is to select the aspects that are frequently commented in consumer reviews as the important ones.",
        "However, consumers' opinions on the frequent aspects may not influence their overall opinions on the product, and thus not influence consumers' purchase decisions.",
        "For example, most consumers frequently criticize the bad \"signal connection\" of iPhone 4, but they may still give high overall ratings to iPhone 4.",
        "On the other hand, some aspects, such as \"design\" and \"speed,\" may not be frequently commented, but usually more important than \"signal connection.\"",
        "Hence, the frequency-based solution is not able to identify the truly important aspects.",
        "Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically identify the important product aspects from consumer reviews.",
        "Our assumption is that the important aspects of a product should be the aspects that are frequently commented by consumers, and consumers' opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product.",
        "Given the online consumer reviews of a specific product, we first identify the aspects in the reviews using a shallow dependency parser (Wu et al., 2009), and determine consumers' opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier.",
        "We then design an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously taking into account the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers' opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions.",
        "Specifically, we assume that consumer's overall opinion rating on a product is generated based on a weighted sum of his/her specific opinions on multiple aspects of the product, where the weights essentially measure the degree of importance of the aspects.",
        "A probabilistic regression algorithm is then developed to derive these importance weights by leveraging the aspect frequency and the consistency between the overall opinions and the weighted sum of opinions on various aspects.",
        "We conduct experiments on 11 popular products in four domains.",
        "The consumer reviews on these products are crawled from the prevalent forum Web sites (e.g., cnet.com and viewpoint.com etc.)",
        "More details of our review corpus are discussed in Section 3.",
        "The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on important aspects identification.",
        "Furthermore, we apply the aspect ranking results to the application of document-level sentiment classification by carrying out the term-weighting based on the aspect importance.",
        "The results show that our approach can improve the performance significantly.",
        "The main contributions of this paper include,",
        "1) We dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to automatically identify important aspects of a product from consumer reviews.",
        "2) We develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers' opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions.",
        "3) We apply aspect ranking results to the application of document-level sentiment classification, and improve the performance significantly.",
        "There is another work named aspect ranking (Snyder et al., 2007).",
        "The task in this work is different from ours.",
        "This work mainly focuses on predicting opinionated ratings on aspects rather than identifying important aspects.",

        "In this section, we first present some notations and then elaborate the key components of our approach, including the aspect identification, sentiment classification, and aspect ranking algorithm.",
        "Let R = {t\\, • • • , t\\r\\ } denotes a set of online consumer reviews of a specific product.",
        "Each review r G R is associated with an overall opinion rating Or, and covers several aspects with consumer comments on these aspects.",
        "Suppose there are m aspects A = {a\\, • • • ,am} involved in the review corpus R, where ak is the k-th aspect.",
        "We define ork as the opinion on aspect akin review r. We assume that the overall opinion rating Or is generated based on a weighted sum of the opinions on specific aspects ork (Wang et al., 2010).",
        "The weights are denoted as {u)rk}m=1, each of which essentially measures the degree of importance of the aspect akin review r. Our task is to derive the important weights of aspects, and identify the important aspects.",
        "Next, we will introduce the key components of our approach, including aspect identification that identifies the aspects akin each review r, aspect sentiment classification which determines consumers' opinions ork on various aspects, and aspect ranking algorithm that identifies the important aspects.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, there are usually two types of reviews, Pros and Cons review and free text reviews on the Web.",
        "For Pros and Cons reviews, the aspects are identified as the frequent noun terms in the reviews, since the aspects are usually noun or noun phrases (Liu, 2009), and it has been shown that simply extracting the frequent noun terms from the Pros and Cons reviews can get high accurate aspect terms (Liu el al., 2005).",
        "To identify the aspects in free text reviews, we first parse each review using the Stanford parser , and extract the noun phrases (NP) from the parsing tree as aspect candidates.",
        "While these candidates may contain much noise, we leverage the Pros and Cons reviews to assist identify aspects from the candidates.",
        "In particular, we explore the frequent noun terms in Pros and Cons reviews as features, and train a one-class SVM (Manevitz et al., 2002) to identify aspects in the candidates.",
        "While the obtained aspects may contain some synonym terms, such as \"earphone\" and \"headphone,\" we further perform synonym clustering to get unique aspects.",
        "Specifically, we first expand each aspect term with its synonym terms obtained from the synonym terms Web site , and then cluster the terms to obtain unique aspects based on unigram feature.",
        "Since the Pros and Cons reviews explicitly express positive and negative opinions on the aspects, respectively, our task is to determine the opinions in free text reviews.",
        "To this end, we here utilize Pros and Cons reviews to train a SVM sentiment classifier.",
        "Specifically, we collect sentiment terms in the Pros and Cons reviews as features and represent each review into feature vector using Boolean weighting.",
        "Note that we select sentiment terms as those appear in the sentiment lexicon provided by MPQA project (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "With these features, we then train a SVM classifier based on Pros and Cons reviews.",
        "Given a free text review, since it may cover various opinions on multiple aspects, we first locate the opinionated expression modifying each aspect, and determine the opinion on the aspect using the learned SVM classifier.",
        "In particular, since the opinionated expression on each aspect tends to contain sentiment terms and appear closely to the aspect (Hu and Liu, 2004), we select the expressions which contain sentiment terms and are at the distance of less than 5 from the aspect NP in the parsing tree.",
        "Generally, consumer's opinion on each specific aspect in the review influences his/her overall opinion on the product.",
        "Thus, we assume that the consumer gives the overall opinion rating Or based on the weighted sum of his/her opinion ork on each aspect ak: m=i ork, which can be rewritten as where u>r and or are the weight and opinion vectors.",
        "Inspired by the work of Wang et al.",
        "(2010), we view Or as a sample drawn from a Gaussian Distribution, with mean u>rTor and variance a,",
        "To model the uncertainty of the importance weights \"r in each review, we assume \"r as a sample drawn from a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution, with n as the mean vector and S as the covariance matrix,",
        "We further incorporate aspect frequency as a prior knowledge to define the distribution of u and S. Specifically, the distribution of u and S is defined based on its Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to a prior distribution with a mean vector u0 and an identity covariance matrix I in Eq.3.",
        "Each element in u0is defined as the frequency of the corresponding aspect: frequency (ak )/ E i=i frequency (ai).",
        "where KL(^ •) is the KL divergence, Q(u, S) denotes a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution, and p is a tradeoff parameter.",
        "Base on the above definition, the probability of generating the overall opinion rating Or on review r is given as, where * = u, S, a} are the model parameters.",
        "Next, we utilize Maximum Log-likelihood (ML) to estimate the model parameters given the consumer reviews corpus.",
        "In particular, we aim to find an optimal * to maximize the probability of observing the overall opinion ratings in the reviews corpus.",
        "(tr(S) + (uo – u)T I (uo – u)).",
        "For the sake of simplicity, we denote the objective function YlreR log(p(Or\\*,r)) as r(*).",
        "The derivative of the objective function with respect to each model parameter vanishes at the mini-mizer:",
        "dujr a ( r u) which lead to the following solutions:",
        "E (Or – \"r T Or ).",
        "We can see that the above parameters are involved in each other's solution.",
        "We here utilize Alternating Optimization technique to derive the optimal parameters in an iterative manner.",
        "We first hold the parameters u, S and a fixed and update the parameters \"r for each review r G R. Then, we update the parameters u, S and a with fixed \"r (r G R).",
        "These two steps are alternatively iterated until the Eq.5 converges.",
        "As a result, we obtain the optimal importance weights r which measure the importance of aspects in review r G R. We then compute the final importance score wk for each aspect ak by integrating its importance score in all the reviews as,",
        "It is worth noting that the aspect frequency is considered again in this integration process.",
        "According to the importance score Wk, we can identify important aspects."

        "These reviews were crawled from the prevalent forum Web sites, including cnet.com, viewpoints.com, reevoo.com and gsmarena.com.",
        "All of the reviews were posted between June, 2009 and Sep 2010.",
        "The aspects of the reviews, as well as the opinions on the aspects were manually annotated as the gold standard for evaluations.",
        "To examine the performance on aspect identification and sentiment classification, we employed Fi-measure, which was the combination of precision and recall, as the evaluation metric.",
        "To evaluate the performance on aspect ranking, we adopted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at top k (NDCG@k) (Jarvelin and Kekalainen, 2002) as the performance metric.",
        "Given an aspect ranking list a1} • • • ,ak, NDCG@k is calculated by where t(i) is the function that represents the reward given to the aspect at position i, Z is a normalization term derived from the top k aspects of a perfect ranking, so as to normalize NDCG@k to be within [0,1].",
        "This evaluation metric will favor the ranking which ranks the most important aspects at the top.",
        "For the reward t(i),we labeled each aspect as one of the three scores: Unimportant (score 1), Ordinary (score 2) and Important (score 3).",
        "Three volunteers were invited in the annotation process as follows.",
        "We first collected the top k aspects in all the rankings produced by various evaluated methods (maximum k is 15 in our experiment).",
        "We then sampled some reviews covering these aspects, and provided the reviews to each annotator to read.",
        "Each review contains the overall opinion rating, the highlighted aspects, and opinion terms.",
        "Afterward, the annotators were required to assign an importance score to each aspect.",

        "It is difficult to get the accurate overall opinion of the whole review without knowing the importance of these aspects.",
        "In addition, when we learn a document-level sentiment classifier, the features generated from unimportant aspects lack of discriminability and thus may deteriorate the performance of the classifier (Fang et al., 2010).",
        "While the important aspects and the sentiment terms on these aspects can greatly influence the overall opinions of the review, they are highly likely to be discriminative features for sentiment classification.",
        "These observations motivate us to utilize aspect ranking results to assist classifying the sentiment of review documents.",

        "p is set to 100.",
        "Based on the weighted features, we then trained a SVM classifier using the training reviews to determine the overall opinions on the testing reviews.",
        "For the performance comparison, we compared our approach against two baselines, including Boolean weighting method and frequency weighting (tf) method (Paltoglou et al., 2010) that do not utilize the importance of aspects.",
        "The comparison results are shown in Table 6.",

        "On the other hand, from the IA weighting formula, we observe that without using the important aspects, our term-weighting function will be equal to Boolean weighting.",

        "We have conducted experiments on 11 popular products in four domains.",
        "Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on important aspects identification.",
        "We have further applied the aspect ranking results to the application of document-level sentiment classification, and have significantly improved the classification performance.",
        "In the future, we will apply our approach to support other applications."
