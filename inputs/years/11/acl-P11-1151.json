        "The normalization techniques used for converting SVM outputs to graph weights are somewhat arbitrary.",

        "By applying alternative models, we have demonstrated the best recorded performance for collective classification of ConVote using bag-of-words features, beating the previous benchmark by nearly 6%.",
        "Moreover, each of the three alternative approaches trialed are theoretically superior to the minimum-cut approach approach for three main reasons: (1) they support multi-class classification; (2) they support negative and positive citations; (3) they require no parameter tuning.",
        "The superior performance of the dual-classifier approach with loopy belief propagation and mean-field suggests that either algorithm could be considered as a first choice for collective document classification.",
        "Their advantage is increased by their ability to output classification confidences as probabilities, while minimum-cut and the local formulations only give absolute class assignments.",
        "We do not dismiss the iterative-classifier approach entirely.",
        "The most compelling point in its favor is its ability to unify content only and citation features in a single classifier.",
        "Conceptually speaking, such an approach should allow the two types of features to interrelate in more nuanced ways.",
        "A case in point comes from our use of a fixed size context window to build a citation classifier.",
        "Future approaches may be able to do away with this arbitrary separation of features by training a local classifier to consider all words in terms of their impact on content-only classification and their relations to neighbors.",
        "Probabilistic SVM normalization offers a convenient, principled way of incorporating the outputs of an SVM classifier into a collective classifier.",
        "An opportunity for future work is to consider normalization approaches for other classifiers.",
        "For example, confidence-weighted linear classifiers (Dredze et al., 2008) have been shown to give superior performance to SVMs on a range of tasks and may therefore be a better choice for collective document classification.",
        "Of the three models trialled for local classifiers, context window features did best when measured in an oracle experiment, but citation count features did better when used in a collective classifier.",
        "We conclude that context window features are a more nuanced and powerful approach that is also more likely to suffer from data sparseness.",
        "Citation count features would have been the less effective in a scenario where the fact of the citation existing was less informative, for example, if a citation was 50% likely to indicate agreement rather than 80% likely.",
