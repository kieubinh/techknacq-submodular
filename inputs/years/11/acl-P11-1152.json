        "Building on earlier work that integrates different factors in language modeling, we view (i) backing off to a shorter history and (ii) class-based generalization as two complementary mechanisms of using a larger equivalence class for prediction when the default equivalence class is too small for reliable estimation.",
        "This view entails that the classes in a language model should be learned from rare events only and should be preferably applied to rare events.",
        "We construct such a model and show that both training on rare events and preferable application to rare events improve perplexity when compared to a simple direct interpolation of class-based with standard language models."

        "Language models, probability distributions over strings of words, are fundamental to many applications in natural language processing.",
        "The main challenge in language modeling is to estimate string probabilities accurately given that even very large training corpora cannot overcome the inherent sparseness of word sequence data.",
        "One way to improve the accuracy of estimation is class-based generalization.",
        "The idea is that even though a particular word sequence s may not have occurred in the training set (or too infrequently for accurate estimation), the occurrence of sequences similar to s can help us better estimate p(s).",
        "Plausible though this line of reasoning is, the language models most commonly used today do not incorporate class-based generalization.",
        "This is partially due to the additional cost of creating classes and using classes as part of the model.",
        "But an equally important reason is that most models that integrate class-based information do so by way of a simple interpolation and achieve only a modest improvement in performance.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new type of class-based language model.",
        "The key novelty is that we recognize that certain probability estimates are hard to improve based on classes.",
        "In particular, the best probability estimate for frequent events is often the maximum likelihood estimator and this estimator is hard to improve by using other information sources like classes or word similarity.",
        "We therefore design a model that attempts to focus the effect ofclass-based generalization on rare events.",
        "Specifically, we propose to employ the same strategy for this that history-length interpolated (HI) models use.",
        "We define HI models as models that interpolate the predictions of different-length histories, e.g., p(ws\\wiw2) = (1 – A1(w1w2) – A2(w1 w2))p'(w3) where p' is a simple estimate; in this section, we use p' = pML, the maximum likelihood estimate, as an example.",
        "Jelinek-Mercer (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980) and modified Kneser-Ney (Kneser and Ney, 1995) models are examples of HI models.",
        "HI models address the challenge that frequent events are best estimated by a method close to maximum likelihood by selecting appropriate values for the interpolation weights.",
        "For example, if w1w2w3is frequent, then A1 will be close to 1, thus ensuring that p(w3 \\w1 w2) œ pML(w3 \\w1 w2) and that the components pML(w3\\w2) and pML(w3), which are unhelpful in this case, will only slightly change the reliable estimate pml(w3\\ w1w2).",
        "The main contribution of this paper is to propose the same mechanism for class language models.",
        "In fact, we will use the interpolation weights of a KN model to determine how much weight to give to each component of the interpolation.",
        "The difference to a KN model is merely that the lower-order distribution is not the lower-order KN distribution (as in KN), but instead an interpolation of the lower-order KN distribution and a class-based distribution.",
        "We will show that this method of integrating history interpolation and classes significantly increases the performance of a language model.",
        "Focusing the effect of classes on rare events has another important consequence: if this is the right way of using classes, then they should not be formed based on all events in the training set, but only based on rare events.",
        "We show that doing this increases performance.",
        "Finally, we introduce a second discounting method into the model that differs from KN.",
        "This can be motivated by the fact that with two sources of generalization (history-length and classes) more probability mass should be allocated to these two sources than to the single source used in KN.",
        "We propose a polynomial discount and show a significant improvement compared to using KN discounting only.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work.",
        "Section 3 reviews the KN model and introduces two models, the Dupont-Rosenfeld model (a \"recursive\" model) and a toplevel interpolated model, that integrate the KN model (a history interpolation model) with a class model.",
        "Section 4 details our experimental setup.",
        "Results are presented in Section 5.",
        "Based on an analysis of strengths and weaknesses of Dupont-Rosenfeld and top-level interpolated models, we present a new polynomial discounting mechanism that does better than either in Section 6.",
        "Section 7 presents our conclusions."

        "A large number of different class-based models have been proposed in the literature.",
        "The well-known model by Brown et al.",
        "(1992) is a class sequence model, in which p(u\\w) is computed as the product of a class transition probability and an emission probability, p(g(u)\\g(w))p(u\\g(u)), where g(u) is the class of u.",
        "Other approaches condition the probability of a class on n-grams of lexical items (as opposed to classes) (Whittaker and Woodland, 2001; Emami and Jelinek, 2005; Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008).",
        "In this work, we use the Brown type of model: it is simpler and has fewer parameters.",
        "Models that condition classes on lexical n-grams could be extended in a way similar to what we propose here.",
        "Classes have been used with good results in a number of applications, e.g., in speech recognition (Yokoyama et al., 2003), sentiment analysis (Wie-gand and Klakow, 2008), and question answering (Momtazi and Klakow, 2009).",
        "Classes have also been shown to improve the performance ofexponential models (Chen, 2009).",
        "Our use of classes of lexical n-grams for n > 1 has several precedents in the literature (Suhm and",
        "Sagisaka, 2000; Justo and Torres, 2009).",
        "The novelty of our approach is that we integrate phrase-level classes into a KN model.",
        "Hierarchical clustering (McMahon and Smith, 1996; Zitouni and Zhou, 2007; Zitouni and Zhou, 2008) has the advantage that the size of the class to be used in a specific context is not fixed, but can be chosen at an optimal level of the hierarchy.",
        "There is no reason why our non-hierarchical flat model could not be replaced with a hierarchical model and we would expect this to improve results.",
        "The key novelty of our clustering method is that clusters are formed based on rare events in the training corpus.",
        "This type of clustering has been applied to other problems before, in particular to unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Schütze, 1995; Clark, 2003; Reichart et al., 2010).",
        "However, the importance of rare events for clustering in language modeling has not been investigated before.",
        "Our work is most similar to the lattice-based language models proposed by Dupont and Rosenfeld lattice-based language models further by allowing arbitrary factors in addition to words and classes.",
        "We use a special case oflattice-based language models in this paper.",
        "Our contributions are that we introduce the novel idea of rare-event clustering into language modeling and that we show that the modified model performs better than a strong word-trigram",
        "In this section, we introduce the three models that we compare in our experiments: Kneser-Ney model, Dupont-Rosenfeld model, and top-level interpolation model.",
        "Our baseline model is the modified Kneser-Ney (KN) trigram model as proposed by Chen and Goodman (1999).",
        "We give a comprehensive description of our implementation of KN because the details are important for the integration of the class model given below.",
        "We use the notation in Table 1.",
        "We estimate pkn on the training set as follows.",
        "The parameters d', d'', and d''' are the discounts for unigrams, bigrams and trigrams, respectively, as defined by Chen and Goodman (1996, p. 20, (26)).",
        "Note that our notation deviates from C&G in that they use the single symbol D1 for the three different values d'(1), d''(1), and d'''(1) etc.",
        "History-interpolated models attempt to find a good tradeoff between using a maximally informative history for accurate prediction of frequent events and generalization for rare events by using lower-order distributions; they employ this mechanism recursively by progressively shortening the history.",
        "The key idea ofthe improved model we will adopt is that class generalization ought to play the same role in history-interpolated models as the lower-order distributions: they should improve estimates for unseen and rare events.",
        "Following Dupont and Rosenfeld (1997), we implement this idea by linearly interpolating the class-based distribution with the lower order distribution, recursively at each level.",
        "For a trigram model, this means that we interpolate pKN(w3\\w2) and pB(w3\\w1w2) on the first backoff level and pKN(w3) and pB(w3\\w2) on the second backoff level, where pb is the (Brown) class model (see Section 4 for details on pb).",

        "This is not surprising as the class-based component of the model can only benefit rare events and it is therefore reasonable to estimate this component based on a corpus dominated by rare events.",

        "We found clear statistically significant evidence for both (i) and (ii).",
        "(i) Classes trained on unique-event corpora perform better than classes trained on all-event corpora.",
        "(ii) The pdr model (which adjusts the interpolation weight given to classes based on the prevalence of nonfrequent events following) is better than top-level model ptop (which uses a fixed weight for classes).",

        "Our results strongly suggest that the Dupont-Rosenfeld model is a superior model.",
        "A comparison of Dupont-Rosenfeld and top-level results suggested that the KN discount mechanism does not discount high-frequency events enough.",
        "We empirically determined that better discounts are obtained by letting the discount grow as a function of the count of the discounted event and implemented this as polynomial discounting, an arguably simpler way of discounting than Kneser-Ney discounting.",
        "The improvement of polynomial discounts vs. KN discounts was small, but statistically significant.",
        "In future work, we would like to find a theoretical justification for the surprising fact that polynomial discounting does at least as well as Kneser-Ney discounting.",
        "We also would like to look at other backoff mechanisms (in addition to history length and classes) and incorporate them into the model, e.g., similarity and topic.",
        "Finally, training classes on unique events is an extreme way of highly weighting rare events.",
        "We would like to explore training regimes that lie between unique-event clustering and all-event clustering and upweight rare events less.",
