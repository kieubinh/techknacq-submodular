        "English news documents or document sets by reading the corresponding Chinese summaries.",
        "A few pilot studies have investigated the task in recent years and exiting methods make use of either the information in the source language or the information in the target language after using machine translation.",
        "In particular, for the task of English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization, one method is to directly extract English summary sentences based on English features extracted from the English documents, and then automatically translate the English summary sentences into Chinese summary sentences.",
        "The other method is to automatically translate the English sentences into Chinese sentences, and then directly extract Chinese summary sentences based on Chinese features.",
        "The two methods make use of the information from only one language side.",
        "However, it is not very reliable to use only the information in one language, because the machine translation quality is far from satisfactory, and thus the translated Chinese sentences usually contain some errors and noises.",
        "For example, the English sentence \"Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area\" is automatically translated into the Chinese sentence \"ffgêttfifÈffî^MM.",
        "Arnims, BXjMmmmmMmxftm*, ïÊErïztiïlMMo \" by using Google Translate , but the Chinese sentence contains a few translation errors.",
        "Therefore, on the one side, if we rely only on the English-side information to extract Chinese",
        "summary sentences, we cannot guarantee that the automatically translated Chinese sentences for salient English sentences are really salient when these sentences may contain many translation errors and other noises.",
        "On the other side, if we rely only on the Chinese-side information to extract Chinese summary sentences, we cannot guarantee that the selected sentences are really salient because the features for sentence ranking based on the incorrectly translated sentences are not very reliable, either.",
        "In this study, we propose to leverage both the information in the source language and the information in the target language for cross-language document summarization.",
        "In particular, we propose two graph-based summarization methods (SimFusion and CoRank) for using both English-side and Chinese-side information in the task of English-to-Chinese cross-document summarization.",
        "The SimFusion method linearly fuses the English-side similarity and the Chinese-side similarity for measuring Chinese sentence similarity.",
        "The CoRank method adopts a co-ranking algorithm to simultaneously rank both English sentences and Chinese sentences by incorporating mutual influences between them.",
        "We use the DUC2001 dataset with manually translated reference Chinese summaries for evaluation.",
        "Experimental results based on the ROUGE metrics show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

      "text": [
        "As mentioned in Section 1, existing methods rely only on one-side information for sentence ranking, which is not very reliable.",
        "In order to leveraging both-side information for sentence ranking, we propose the following two methods to incorporate the bilingual information in different ways.",
        "This method uses the English-side information for Chinese sentence ranking in the graph-based framework.",
        "The sentence similarities in the two languages are fused in the method.",
        "In other words, when we compute the similarity value between two Chinese sentences, the similarity value between the corresponding two English sentences is used by linear fusion.",
        "Since sentence similarity evaluation plays a very important role in the graph-based ranking algorithm, this method can leverage both-side information through similarity fusion.",
        "Formally, given the Chinese document set Dcntranslated from an English document set, let Gcn=(Vcn, Ecn) be an undirected graph to reflect the relationships between the sentences in the Chinese document set.",
        "Vcn is the set of vertices and each vertex scni in Vcn represents a Chinese sentence.",
        "Ecnis the set of edges.",
        "Each edge ecnij in Ecn is associated with an affinity weight f(scni, scnj) between sentences scni and scnj (iij).",
        "The weight is computed by linearly combining the similarity value simcosine(scni, scnj) between the Chinese sentences and the similarity value simcosine(seni, senj) between the corresponding English sentences.",
        "where senj and seni are the source English sentences for scnj and scni.",
        "X G [0, 1] is a parameter to control the relative contributions of the two similarity values.",
        "The similarity values simcosine(scni, scnj) and simcosine(seni, senj) are computed by using the standard cosine measure.",
        "The weight for each term is computed based on the TFIDF formula.",
        "For Chinese similarity computation, Chinese word segmentation is performed.",
        "Here, we have f(scni, scnj)=f(scnj, scni) and let f(scni, scni)=0 to avcnoid self transition.",
        "We use an affinity matrix Mcn to describe Gcn with each entry corresponding to the weight of an edge in the graph.",
        "Mcn=(Mcnij)\\Vc^^,^Vc^\\ is defined as M^f/V^j).",
        "Then Mcn is normalized to mcn to make the sum of each row equal to 1.",
        "Based on matrix mcn, the saliency score Info-Score(scni) for sentence scni can be deduced from those of all other sentences linked with it and it can be formulated in a recursive form as in the PageRank algorithm:",
        "InfoScore(scn) = p £ InfoScore{sccn)- M",
        "where n is the sentence number, i.e. n= |Vcn|.",
        "j is the damping factor usually set to 0.85, as in the PageRank algorithm.",
        "For numerical computation of the saliency scores, we can iteratively run the above equation until convergence.",
        "For multi-document summarization, some sentences are highly overlapping with each other, and thus we apply the same greedy algorithm in Wan et al.",
        "(2006) to penalize the sentences highly overlapping with other highly scored sentences, and finally the salient and novel Chinese sentences are directly selected as summary sentences.",
        "This method leverages both the English-side information and the Chinese-side information in a co-ranking way.",
        "The source English sentences and the translated Chinese sentences are simultaneously ranked in a unified graph-based algorithm.",
        "The saliency of each English sentence relies not only on the English sentences linked with it, but also on the Chinese sentences linked with it.",
        "Similarly, the saliency of each Chinese sentence relies not only on the Chinese sentences linked with it, but also on the English sentences linked with it.",
        "More specifically, the proposed method is based on the following assumptions:",
        "Assumption 1: A Chinese sentence would be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient Chinese sentences; and an English sentence would be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient English sentences.",
        "Assumption 2: A Chinese sentence would be salient if it is heavily linked with salient English sentences; and an English sentence would be salient if it is heavily linked with salient Chinese sentences.",
        "The first assumption is similar to PageRank which makes use of mutual \"recommendations\" between the sentences in the same language to rank sentences.",
        "The second assumption is similar to HITS if the English sentences and the Chinese sentences are considered as authorities and hubs, respectively.",
        "In other words, the proposed method aims to fuse the ideas of PageRank and HITS in a unified framework.",
        "The mutual influences between the Chinese sentences and the English sentences are incorporated in the method.",
        "Figure 1 gives the graph representation for the method.",
        "Three kinds of relationships are exploited: the CN-CN relationships between Chinese sentences, the EN-EN relationships between English sentences, and the EN-CN relationships between English sentences and Chinese sentences.",
        "Formally, given an English document set Den and the translated Chinese document set Dcn, let G=(Ven, Vcn, Een, Ecn, Eencn) be an undirected graph to reflect all the three kinds of relationships between the sentences in the two document sets.",
        "Ve\" ={seni | 1<i<n} is the set of English sentences.",
        "Vcn={scni | 1<i<n} is the set of Chinese sentences.",
        "scni is the corresponding Chinese sentence translated from seni.",

        "Ecn is the edge set to reflect the relationships between the Chinese sentences.",
        "Eencnis the edge set to reflect the relationships between the English sentences and the Chinese sentences.",
        "Based on the graph representation, we compute the following three affinity matrices to reflect the three kinds of sentence relationships:",
        "Chinese sentences",
        "English Sentences",
        "1) Mcn=(Mcnv)nxn: This affinity matrix aims to reflect the relationships between the Chinese sentences.",

        "otherwise",
        "2) Mn=(MniJ)nxn: This affinity matrix aims to reflect the relationships between the English sentences.",
        "Each entry in the matrix corresponds to the cosine similarity between the two English sentences.",
        "Then Mcn is normalized to Mcn to make the sum of each row equal to 1.",
        "v [0, otherwise",
        "Then MF\" is normalized to Men to make the sum of each row equal to 1.",
        "3) Mencn=(Mencnij)nXn: This affinity matrix aims to reflect the relationships between the English sentences and the Chinese sentences.",
        "Each entry Mencnij in the matrix corresponds to the similarity between the English sentence seni and the Chinese sentence scnj.",
        "It is hard to directly compute the similarity between the sentences in different languages.",
        "In this study, the similarity value is computed by fusing the following two similarity values: the cosine similarity between the sentence seni and the corresponding source English sentence senJ for scnJ, and the cosine similarity between the corresponding translated Chinese sentence scni for seniand the sentence scnj.",
        "We use the geometric mean of the two values as the affinity weight.",
        "MTn =V simcos me (sen, sen ) x simcos me (scn, )",
        "Note that we have Mencny=Mencn]1 and",
        "Mencn=(Mencn)T. Then Mencn is normalized to Mencnto make the sum of each row equal to 1.",
        "We use two column vectors u=[u(scni)]ny.1 and v =[v(senj)]nx1 to denote the saliency scores of the Chinese sentences and the English sentences, respectively.",
        "Based on the three kinds of relationships, we can get the following four assumptions:",
        "After fusing the above equations, we can obtain the following iterative forms:",
        "And the matrix form is:",
        "u = a(MMcn ) T u + ß(MMencn ) T v where a and ß specify the relative contributions to the final saliency scores from the information in the same language and the information in the other language and we have a+ß=1.",
        "For numerical computation of the saliency scores, we can iteratively run the two equations until convergence.",
        "Usually the convergence of the iteration algorithm is achieved when the difference between the scores computed at two successive iterations for any sentences and words falls below a given threshold.",
        "In order to guarantee the convergence of the iterative form, u and v are normalized after each iteration.",
        "After we get the saliency scores u for the Chinese sentences, we apply the same greedy algorithm for redundancy removing.",
        "Finally, a few highly ranked sentences are selected as summary sentences."
