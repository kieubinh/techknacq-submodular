        "Dependency parsing is the task of building dependency links between words in a sentence, which has recently gained a wide interest in the natural language processing community.",
        "With the availability of large-scale annotated corpora such as Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), it is easy to train a high-performance dependency parser using supervised learning methods.",
        "However, current state-of-the-art statistical dependency parsers (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Hall et al., 2006) tend to have",
        "Correspondence author: jzhao@nlpr.ia.ac.cn",
        "lower accuracies for longer dependencies (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).",
        "The length of a dependency from word wi to word Wj is simply equal to \\i – j\\.",
        "Longer dependencies typically represent the modifier of the root or the main verb, internal dependencies of longer NPs or PP-attachment in a sentence.",
        "Figure 1 shows the F\\ score relative to the dependency length on the development set by using the graph-based dependency parsers (McDonald et that the parsers provide very good results for adjacent dependencies (96.89% for dependency length =1), while the dependency length increases, the accuracies degrade sharply.",
        "These longer dependencies are therefore a major opportunity to improve the overall performance of dependency parsing.",
        "Usually, these longer dependencies can be parsed dependent on the specific words involved due to the limited range of features (e.g., a verb and its modifiers).",
        "Lexical statistics are therefore needed for resolving ambiguous relationships, yet the lexical-ized statistics are sparse and difficult to estimate directly.",
        "To solve this problem, some information with different granularity has been investigated.",
        "Koo et al.",
        "(2008) proposed a semi-supervised dependency parsing by introducing lexical intermediaries at a coarser level than words themselves via a cluster method.",
        "This approach, however, ignores the selectional preference for word-to-word interactions, such as head-modifier relationship.",
        "Extra resources Fi = 2 x precision x recall/(precision + recall)",
        "Figure 1: F score relative to dependency length.",
        "beyond the annotated corpora are needed to capture the bi-lexical relationship at the word-to-word level.",
        "Our purpose in this paper is to exploit web-derived selectional preferences to improve the supervised statistical dependency parsing.",
        "All of our lexical statistics are derived from two kinds of web-scale corpus: one is the web, which is the largest data set that is available for NLP (Keller and Lapata, 2003).",
        "Another is a web-scale N-gram corpus, which is a N-gram corpus with N-grams of length 15 (Brants and Franz, 2006), we call it Google V1 in this paper.",
        "The idea is very simple: web-scale data have large coverage for word pair acquisition.",
        "By leveraging some assistant data, the dependency parsing model can directly utilize the additional information to capture the word-to-word level relationships.",
        "We address two natural and related questions which some previous studies leave open:",
        "Question I: Is there a benefit in incorporating web-derived selectional preference features for statistical dependency parsing, especially for longer dependencies?",
        "Question II: How well do web-derived selectional preferences perform on new domains?",
        "For Question I, we systematically assess the value of using web-scale data in state-of-the-art supervised dependency parsers.",
        "We compare dependency parsers that include or exclude selectional preference features obtained from web-scale corpus.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies directly address long dependencies of dependency parsing by using web-scale data.",
        "Most statistical parsers are highly domain dependent.",
        "For example, the parsers trained on WSJ text perform poorly on Brown corpus.",
        "Some studies have investigated domain adaptation for parsers (Mc-Closky et al., 2006; Daumé III, 2007; McClosky et al., 2010).",
        "These approaches assume that the parsers know which domain it is used, and that it has access to representative data in that domain.",
        "However, in practice, these assumptions are unrealistic in many real applications, such as when processing the heterogeneous genre of web texts.",
        "In this paper we incorporate the web-derived selectional preference features to design our parsers for robust open-domain testing.",
        "We conduct the experiments on the English Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "The results show that web-derived selectional preference can improve the statistical dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships.",
        "More importantly, when operating on new domains, the web-derived selectional preference features show great potential for achieving robust performance (Section 4.3).",
        "The remainder of this paper is divided as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives a brief introduction of dependency parsing.",
        "Section 3 describes the web-derived selectional preference features.",
        "Experimental evaluation and results are reported in Section 4.",
        "Finally, we discuss related work and draw conclusion in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively."

        "The parsing model can be defined as a conditional distribution p(y\\x; w) over each projective parse tree y for a particular sentence x, parameterized by a vector w. The probability of a parse tree is where Z(x; w) is the partition function and $ are part-factored feature functions that include head-modifier parts, sibling parts and grandchild parts.",

        "All of our selectional preference features described in this paper rely on probabilities derived from unla-beled data.",

        "All n-grams with lower counts are discarded.",
        "Co-occurrence probabilities can be calculated directly from the N-gram counts.",
        "Previous work on noun compounds bracketing has used adjacency model (Resnik, 1993) and dependency model (Lauer, 1995) to compute association statistics between pairs of words.",
        "In this paper we generalize the adjacency and dependency models by including the pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1900) between all pairs of words in the dependency tree:",
        "where p(\"x y\") is the co-occurrence probabilities.",
        "When use the Google V1 corpus, this probabilities can be calculated directly from the N-gram counts, while using the Google hits, we send the queries to the search engine Google and all the search queries are performed as exact matches by using quotation marks.",
        "The value of these features is the PMI, if it is defined.",

        "In deciding the dependency between the main verb hit and its argument headed preposition with, an example of the N-gram PMI features and the conjoin features with the baseline are shown in Table 1.",
        "Propositional phrase (PP) attachment is one of the hardest problems in English dependency parsing.",
        "An English sentence consisting of a subject, a verb, and a nominal object followed by a prepositional phrase is often ambiguous.",
        "Ambiguity resolution reflects the selectional preference between the verb and noun with their prepositional phrase.",
        "For example, considering the following two examples:",
        "(1) John hit the ball with the bat.",
        "(2) John hit the ball with the red stripe.",
        "In sentence (1), the preposition with depends on the main verb hit; but in sentence (2), the prepositional phrase is a noun attribute and the preposition with needs to depends on the word ball.",
        "To resolve this kind of ambiguity, there needs to measure the attachment preference.",

        "If both PMI features exist and PMIwith(hit,bat) > PMIwith(ball, bat), indicating to our dependency parsing model that the preposition word with depends on the verb hit is a good choice.",
        "While in sentence (2), the features include PMIwith(hit, stripe) and PMIwith(ball, stripe).",
        "We generate N-gram features by mimicking the template structure of the original baseline features.",
        "For example, the baseline feature set includes indicators for word-to-word and tag-to-tag interactions between the head and modifier of a dependency.",
        "In the N-gram feature set, we correspondingly introduce N-gram PMI for word-to-word interactions.",
        "The N-gram feature set for MSTParser is shown all features are conjoined with the direction of attachment as well as the distance between the two words creating the dependency.",
        "In between N-gram features, we include the form of word trigrams and PMI of the trigrams.",
        "The surrounding word N-gram features represent the local context of the selectional preference.",
        "Besides, we also present the second-order feature templates, including the sibling and grandchild features.",
        "These features are designed to disambiguate cases like coordinating conjunctions and prepositional attachment.",
        "Consider the examples we have shown in section 3.2.2, for sentence (1), the dependency graph path feature ball – with – bat should have a lower weight since ball rarely is modified by bat, but is often seen through them (e.g., a higher weight should be associated with hit – with – bat).",
        "In contrast, for sentence (2), our N-gram features will tell us that the prepositional phrase is much more likely to attach to the noun since the dependency graph path feature ball – with – stripe should have a high weight due to the high strength of selectional preference between ball and stripe.",
        "Web-derived selectional preference features based on PMI values are trickier to incorporate into the dependency parsing model because they are continuous rather than discrete.",
        "Since all the baseline features used in the literature (McDonald et al., 2005; Carreras, 2007) take on binary values of 0 or 1, there is a \"mis-match\" between the continuous and binary features.",
        "Log-linear dependency parsing model is sensitive to inappropriately scaled feature.",
        "To solve this problem, we transform the PMI values into a more amenable form by replacing the PMI values with their z-score.",
