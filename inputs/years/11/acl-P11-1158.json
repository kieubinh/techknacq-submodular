        "Efficient parsing of Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) is a longstanding problem in computational linguistics.",
        "Even with practical CCG that are strongly context-free (Fowler and Penn, 2010), parsing can be much harder than with Penn Treebank-style context-free grammars, since the number of nonterminal categories is generally much larger, leading to increased grammar constants.",
        "Where a typical Penn Treebank grammar may have fewer than 100 nonterminals (Hocken-maier and Steedman, 2002), we found that a CCG grammar derived from CCGbank contained nearly 1600.",
        "The same grammar assigns an average of 26 lexical categories per word, resulting in a very large space of possible derivations.",
        "The most successful strategy to date for efficient parsing of CCG is to first prune the set of lexical categories considered for each word, using the output of a supertagger, a sequence model over these categories (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999; Clark, 2002).",
        "Variations on this approach drive the widely-used, broad coverage C&C parser (Clark and Cur-ran, 2004; Clark and Curran, 2007).",
        "However, pruning means approximate search: if a lexical category used by the highest probability derivation is pruned, the parser will not find that derivation (ยง2).",
        "Since the supertagger enforces no grammaticality constraints it may even prefer a sequence of lexical categories that cannot be combined into any derivation (Figure 1).",
        "Empirically, we show that supertagging improves efficiency by an order of magnitude, but the tradeoff is a significant loss in accuracy (ยง3).",
        "Can we improve on this tradeoff?",
        "The line of investigation we pursue in this paper is to consider more efficient exact algorithms.",
        "In particular, we test different variants of the classical A* algorithm (Hart et al., 1968), which has met with success in Penn Treebank parsing with context-free grammars (Klein and Manning, 2003; Pauls and Klein, 2009a; Pauls and Klein, 2009b).",
        "We can substitute A* for standard CKY on either the unpruned set of lexical categories, or the pruned set resulting from su-",
        "Figure 1: The relationship between supertagger and parser search spaces based on the intersection of their corresponding tag sequences.",
        "pertagging.",
        "Our empirical results show that on the unpruned set of lexical categories, heuristics employed for context-free grammars show substantial speedups in hardware-independent metrics of parser effort (ยง4).",
        "To understand how this compares to the CKY baseline, we conduct a carefully controlled set of timing experiments.",
        "Although our results show that improvements on hardware-independent metrics do not always translate into improvements in CPU time due to increased processing costs that are hidden by these metrics, they also show that when the lexical categories are pruned using the output of a supertagger, then we can still improve efficiency by 15% with A* techniques (ยง5)."

        "CCG is a lexicalized grammar formalism encoding for each word lexical categories which are either basic (eg.",
        "NN, JJ) or complex.",
        "Complex lexical categories specify the number and directionality of arguments.",
        "For example, one lexical category (of over 100 in our model) for the transitive verb like is (S\\NP2)/NP\\, specifying the first argument as an NP to the right and the second as an NP to the left.",
        "In parsing, adjacent spans are combined using a small number of binary combinatory rules like forward application or composition on the spanning categories (Steedman, 2000; Fowler and Penn, 2010).",
        "In the first derivation below, (S\\NP)/NP and NP combine to form the spanning category S\\NP, which only requires an NP to its left to form a complete sentence-spanning S. The second derivation uses type-raising to change the category type of I.",
        "I like tea I like tea",
        "Because of the number of lexical categories and their complexity, a key difficulty in parsing CCG is that the number of analyses for each span of the sentence quickly becomes extremely large, even with efficient dynamic programming.",
        "Supertagging (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999) treats the assignment of lexical categories (or supertags) as a sequence tagging problem.",
        "Once the supertagger has been run, lexical categories that apply to each word in the input sentence are pruned to contain only those with high posterior probability (or other figure of merit) under the supertagging model (Clark and Curran, 2004).",
        "The posterior probabilities are then discarded; it is the extensive pruning of lexical categories that leads to substantially faster parsing times.",
        "Pruning the categories in advance this way has a specific failure mode: sometimes it is not possible to produce a sentence-spanning derivation from the tag sequences preferred by the supertagger, since it does not enforce grammaticality.",
        "A workaround for this problem is the adaptive supertagging (AST) approach of Clark and Curran (2004).",
        "It is based on a step function over supertagger beam ratios, relaxing the pruning threshold for lexical categories whenever the parser fails to find an analysis.",
        "The process either succeeds and returns a parse after some iteration or gives up after a predefined number of iterations.",
        "As Clark and Curran (2004) show, most sentences can be parsed with a very small number of supertags per word.",
        "However, the technique is inherently approximate: it will return a lower probability parse under the parsing model if a higher probability parse can only be constructed from a supertag sequence returned by a subsequent iteration.",
        "In this way it prioritizes speed over accuracy, although the tradeoff can be modified by adjusting the beam step function.",
        "Irrespective of whether lexical categories are pruned in advance using the output of a supertagger, the CCG parsers we are aware of all use some variant of the CKY algorithm.",
        "Although CKY is easy to implement, it is exhaustive: it explores all possible analyses of all possible spans, irrespective of whether such analyses are likely to be part of the highest probability derivation.",
        "Hence it seems natural to consider exact algorithms that are more efficient than CKY.",
        "A* search is an agenda-based best-first graph search algorithm which finds the lowest cost parse exactly without necessarily traversing the entire search space (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "In contrast to CKY, items are not processed in topological order using a simple control loop.",
        "Instead, they are processed from a priority queue, which orders them by the product of their inside probability and a heuristic estimate of their outside probability.",
        "Provided that the heuristic never underestimates the true outside probability (i.e. it is admissible) the solution is guaranteed to be exact.",
        "Heuristics are model specific and we consider several variants in our experiments based on the CFG heuristics developed by Klein and",

        "Parsing results for the AST settings (Tables 4 and 5) confirm that it improves speed by an order of magnitude over a baseline parser without AST.",

        "For the PCFG model, we compared three agenda-based parsers: EXH prioritizes edges by their span length, thereby simulating the exhaustive CKY algorithm; NULL prioritizes edges by their inside probability; and SX is an A* parser that prioritizes edges by their inside probability times an admissible outside probability estimate.",
        "We use the SX estimate devised by Klein and Manning (2003) for CFG parsing, where they found it offered very good performance for relatively little computation.",
        "It gives a bound on the outside probability of a nonterminal P with i words to the right and j words to the left, and can be computed from a grammar using a simple dynamic program.",
        "The parsers are tested with and without adaptive supertagging where the former can be seen as performing exact search (via A*) over the pruned search space created by AST.",
        "Table 7 shows that A* with the SX heuristic decreases the number of edges pushed by up to 39% on the unpruned search space.",
        "Although encouraging, this is not as impressive as the 95% speedup obtained by Klein and Manning (2003) with this heuristic on their CFG.",
        "On the other hand, the NULL heuristic works better for CCG than for CFG, with speedups of 29% and 11%, respectively.",
        "These results carry over to the AST setting which shows that A* can improve search even on the highly pruned search graph.",
        "Note that A* only saves work in the final iteration of AST, since for earlier iterations it must process the entire agenda to determine that there is no spanning analysis.",
        "Since there are many more categories in the CCG grammar we might have expected the SX heuristic to work better than for a CFG.",
        "Why doesn't it?",
        "We can measure how well a heuristic bounds the true cost in",

        "Lower slack means that the heuristic bounds the true cost better and guides us to the exact solution more quickly.",
        "Figure 3 plots the average slack for the SX heuristic against the number of words in the outside context.",
        "Comparing this with an analysis of the same heuristic when applied to a CFG by Klein and Manning (2003), we find that it is less effective in our setting.",
        "There is a steep increase in slack for outside contexts with size more than one.",
        "The main reason for this is because a single word in the outside context is in many cases the full stop at the end of the sentence, which is very predictable.",
        "However for longer spans the flexibility of CCG to analyze spans in many different ways means that the outside estimate for a nonterminal can be based on many high probability outside derivations which do not bound the true probability very well.",
        "Lexicalization in the HWDep model makes the precomputed SX estimate impractical, so for this model we designed two hierarchical A* (HA*) variants based on simple grammar projections of the model.",
        "The basic idea of HA* is to compute Viterbi inside probabilities using the easier-to-parse projected",
        "'Specifically, we refer to Figure 9 of their paper which uses a slightly different representation of estimate sharpness",
        "Table 7: Exhaustive search (EXH), A* with no heuristic (NULL) and with the SX heuristic in terms of millions of edges pushed, popped and traversals computed using the PCFG grammar with and without adaptive supertagging.",
        "grammar, use these to compute Viterbi outside probabilities for the simple grammar, and then use these as outside estimates for the true grammar; all computations are prioritized in a single agenda following the algorithm of Felzenszwalb and McAllester two simple grammar projections, each simplifying the HWDep model: PCFGProj completely removes lexicalization and projects the grammar to a PCFG, while as LexcatProj removes only the headwords but retains the lexical categories.",
        "Figure 4 compares exhaustive search, A* with no heuristic (NULL), and HA*.",
        "For HA*, parsing effort is broken down into the different edge types computed at each stage: We distinguish between the work carried out to compute the inside and outside edges of the projection, where the latter represent the heuristic estimates, and finally, the work to compute the edges of the target grammar.",
        "We find that A* NULL saves about 44% of edges pushed which makes it slightly more effective than for the PCFG model.",
        "However, the effort to compute the grammar projections outweighs their benefit.",
        "We suspect that this is due to the large difference between the target grammar and the projection: The PCFG projection is a simple grammar and so we improve the probability of a traversal less often than in the target grammar.",
        "The Lexcat projection performs worst, for two reasons.",
        "First, the projection requires about as much work to compute as the target grammar without a heuristic (NULL).",
        "Second, the projection itself does not save a large amount of work as can be seen in the statistics for the target grammar."

        "Adaptive supertagging is a strong technique for efficient CCG parsing.",
        "Our analysis confirms tremendous speedups, and shows that for weak models, it can even result in improved accuracy.",
        "However, for better models, the efficiency gains of adaptive su-pertagging come at the cost of accuracy.",
        "One way to look at this is that the supertagger has good precision with respect to the parser's search space, but low recall.",
        "For instance, we might combine both parsing and supertagging models in a principled way to exploit these observations, eg.",
        "by making the supertagger output a soft constraint on the parser rather than a hard constraint.",
        "Principled, efficient search algorithms will be crucial to such an approach.",
        "To our knowledge, we are the first to measure A* parsing speed both in terms of running time and commonly used hardware-independent metrics.",
        "It is clear from our results that the gains from A* do not come as easily for CCG as for CFG, and that agenda-based algorithms like A* must make very large reductions in the number of edges processed to result in realtime savings, due to the added expense of keeping a priority queue.",
        "However, we have shown that A* can yield real improvements even over the highly optimized technique of adaptive supertagging: in this pruned search space, a 44% reduction in the number of edges pushed results in a 15% speedup in CPU time.",

        "(2010), Zhang et al.",
