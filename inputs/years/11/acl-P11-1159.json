      "heading": "3. Relevant Linguistic Concepts",
      "text": [
        "In this section, we present the linguistic concepts relevant to our discussion of Arabic parsing.",
        "Orthography The Arabic script uses optional diacritics to represent short vowels, consonantal doubling and the indefininteness morpheme (nunation).",
        "For example, the word kataba 'he wrote' is often written as ^^ifktb, which can be ambiguous with other words such as JJIf kutubU 'books'.",
        "In news text, only around 1.6% of all words have any diacritic (Habash, 2010).",
        "As expected, the lack of diacritics contributes heavily to Arabic's morphological ambiguity.",
        "In this work, we only use undiacritized text; however, some of our parsing features which are derived through morphological disambiguation include diacritics (specifically, lemmas, see below).",
        "Morphemes Words can be described in terms of their morphemes; in Arabic, in addition to concate-native prefixes and suffixes, there are templatic morphemes called root and pattern.",
        "For example, the word Öj-ySo yu+kAtib+uwn 'they correspond' has one prefix and one suffix, in addition to a stem composed of the root <_>Oi) k-t-b 'writing related' and the pattern 1A2i3}",
        "Lexeme and features Alternatively, Arabic words can be described in terms of lexemes and inflectional features.",
        "The set of word forms that only vary inflectionally among each other is called the lexeme.",
        "A lemma is a specific word form chosen to represent the lexeme word set; for example, Arabic verb lemmas are third person masculine singular perfective.",
        "We explore using both the dia-critized lemma and the undiacritized lemma (hereafter lmm).",
        "Just as the lemma abstracts over inflectional morphology, the root abstracts over both inflectional and derivational morphology and thus provides a deeper level of lexical abstraction, indicating the \"core\" meaning of the word.",
        "The pattern is a generally complementary abstraction sometimes indicating sematic notions such causation and reflexiveness.",
        "We use the pattern of the lemma, not of the word form.",
        "We group the root, pattern, lemma and lmm in our discussion as lexical features.",
        "Nominal lexemes can also be classified into two groups: rational (i.e., human) or irrational (i.e.„ non-human).",
        "The rationality feature interacts with syntactic agreement and other inflectional features (discussed next); as such, we group it with those features in this paper's experiments.",
        "The inflectional features define the the space of variations of the word forms associated with a lexeme.",
        "PATB-tokenized words vary along nine dimensions: gender and number (for nominals and verbs); person, aspect, voice and mood (for verbs); and case, state, and the attached definite article proclitic det (for nominals).",
        "Inflectional features abstract away from the specifics of morpheme forms.",
        "Some inflectional features affect more than one morpheme in the same word.",
        "For example, changing the value of the aspect feature in the example above from imperfective to perfective yields the word form IjJlS''kAtab+uwA 'they corresponded', which differs in terms of prefix, suffix and pattern.",
        "Surface vs. functional features Additionally, some inflectional features, specifically gender and number, are expressed using different morphemes in different words (even within the same part-of-speech).",
        "There are four sound gender-number suffixes in Arabic: +ff (null morpheme) for masculine singular, 3+ +h for feminine singular, jj+ +wn for masculine plural and ot+ +At for feminine plural.",
        "Plurality can be expressed using sound plural suffixes or using a pattern change together with singular suffixes.",
        "A sound plural example is the word pair öt-uiWHafiyd+ah/Hafiyd+At 'granddaughter/granddaughters'.",
        "On the other hand, the plural of the inflectionally and morphemically feminine singular word ï-wjA* madras+ah 'school' is the word jjt-o madAris+f 'schools', which is feminine and plural inflectionally, but has a masculine singular suffix.",
        "This irregular inflection, known as broken plural, is similar to the English mouse/mice, but is much more common in Arabic (over 50% of plurals in our training data).",
        "A similar inconsistency appears in feminine nouns that are not inflected using sound gender suffixes, e.g., the feminine form of the masculine singular adjective Jjjt Âzraq+ff 'blue' is",
        "eUjj zarqA'+cf) not «jjt* *Âzraq+ah.",
        "To address this inconsistency in the correspondence between inflectional features and morphemes, and inspired by (Smrz, 2007), we distinguish between two types of inflectional features: surface (or form-based) features and functional features.",
        "Most available Arabic NLP tools and resources model morphology using surface inflectional features and do not mark rationality; this includes the PATB (Maamouri et al., 2004), the Buckwalter morphological analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) and tools using them such as the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic (MADA) system (Habash and Rambow, 2005).",
        "The Elixir-FM analyzer (Smrz, 2007) readily provides the functional inflectional number feature, but not full functional gender (only for adjectives and verbs but not for nouns), nor rationality.",
        "Most recently, Alkuhlani and Habash (2011) present a version of the PATB (part 3) that is annotated for functional gender, number and rationality features for Arabic.",
        "We use this resource in modeling these features in Section 5.5.",
        "Morpho-syntactic interactions Inflectional features and rationality interact with syntax in two ways.",
        "In agreement relations, two words in a specific syntactic configuration have coordinated values for specific sets of features.",
        "MSA has standard (i.e., matching value) agreement for subject-verb pairs on person, gender, and number, and for noun-adjective pairs on NUMBER, GENDER, CASE, and det.",
        "There are three very common cases of exceptional agreement: verbs preceding subjects are always singular, adjectives of irrational plural nouns are always feminine singular, and verbs whose subjects are irrational plural are also always feminine singular.",
        "See the example in Figure 1: the adjective, oUf-ÄJt AlökyAt 'smart', of the feminine plural (and rational) ot-ti- HafiydAt 'granddaughters' is feminine plural; but the adjective, ^LojCi-t AlHkwmyh 'the-governmental', of the feminine plural (and irrational) j-jt-u madAris 'schools' is feminine singular.",
        "These agreement rules always refer to functional morphology categories; they are orthogonal to the morpheme-feature inconsistency discussed above.",
        "MSA exhibits marking relations in CASE and STATE marking.",
        "Different types of dependents have different CASE, e.g., verbal subjects are always marked NOMINATIVE.",
        "CASE and STATE are rarely explicitly manifested in undiacritized MSA.",
        "The DET feature plays an important role in distinguishing between the N-N idafa (possessive) construction, in which only the last noun may bear the definite article, and the NA modifier construction, in which both elements generally exhibit agreement in definiteness.",
        "Lexical features do not constrain syntactic structure as inflectional features do.",
        "Instead, bilexical dependencies are used to model semantic relations which often are the only way to disambiguate among different possible syntactic structures.",
        "Lexical abstraction also reduces data sparseness.",
        "The core POS tagsets Words also have associated part-of-speech (POS) tags, e.g., \"verb\", which further abstract over morphologically and syntactically similar lexemes.",
        "Traditional Arabic grammars often describe a very general three-way distinction into verbs, nominals and particles.",
        "In comparison, the tagset of the Buckwalter Morphological Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004) used in the PATB has a core POS set of 44 tags (before morphological extension).",
        "Cross-linguistically, a core set containing around 12 tags is often assumed, including: noun, proper noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, particles, connectives, and punctuation.",
        "Henceforth, we reduce core44 to such a tagset, and dub it core12.",
        "The catib6 tagset can be viewed as a further reduction, with the exception that catib6 contains a passive voice tag; however, this tag constitutes only 0.5% of the tags in the training.",
        "Extended POS tagsets The notion of \"POS tagset\" in natural language processing usually does not refer to a core set.",
        "Instead, the Penn English Treebank (PTB) uses a set of 46 tags, including not only the core POS, but also the complete set of morphological features (this tagset is still fairly small since English is morphologically impoverished).",
        "In PATB-tokenized MSA, the corresponding type of tagset (core POS extended with a complete description of morphology) would contain upwards of 2,000 tags, many of which are extremely rare (in our training corpus of about 300,000 words, we encounter only 430 of such POS tags with complete morphology).",
        "Therefore, researchers have proposed tagsets for MSA whose size is similar to that of the English PTB tagset, as this has proven to be a useful size computationally.",
        "These tagsets are hybrids in the sense that they are neither simply the core POS, nor the complete morphologically enriched tagset, but instead they selectively enrich the core POS tagset with only certain morphological features.",
        "A full dicussion of how these tagsets affect parsing is presented in Marton et al.",
        "(2010); we summarize the main points here.",
        "The following are the various tagsets we use in this paper: (a) the core POS tagset core12; (b) the CATiB treebank tagset catibEx, a newly introduced extension of catib6 (Habash and Roth, 2009) by simple regular expressions of the word form, indicating particular morphemes such as the prefix Jt Al+ or the suffix jj +wn; this tagset is the best-performing tagset for Arabic on predicted values.",
        "(c) the PATB full tagset (bw), size «2000+ (Buckwalter, 2004); We only discuss here the best performing tagsets (on predicted values), and bw for comparison."
