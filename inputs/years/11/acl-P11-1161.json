        "Motivation: The offline acquisition of instances (rio de janeiro, porsche cayman) and their corresponding class labels (brazilian cities, locations, vehicles, sports cars) from text has been an active area of research.",
        "In order to extract fine-grained classes of instances, existing methods often apply manually-created (Banko et al., 2007; Talukdar et al., 2008) or automatically-learned (Snow et al., 2006) extraction patterns to text within large document collections.",
        "In Web search, the relative ranking of documents returned in response to a query directly affects the outcome of the search.",
        "Similarly, the quality of the relative ranking among class labels extracted for a given instance influences any applications (e.g., query refinements or structured extraction) using the extracted data.",
        "But due to noise in Web data and limitations of extraction techniques, class labels acquired for a given instance (e.g., oil shale) may fail to properly capture the semantic classes to which the instance may belong (Kozareva et al., 2008).",
        "Inevitably, some of the extracted class labels will be less useful (e.g., sources, mutual concerns) or incorrect (e.g., plants for the instance oil shale).",
        "In previous work, the relative ranking of class labels for an instance is determined mostly based on features derived from the source Web documents from which the data has been extracted, such as variations ofthe frequency of co-occurrence or diversity of extraction patterns producing a given pair (Etzioni et al., 2005).",
        "Contributions: This paper explores the role of Web search queries, rather than Web documents, in inducing superior ranking among class labels extracted automatically from documents for various instances.",
        "It compares two sources of indirect ranking evidence available within anonymized query logs: a) co-occurrence of an instance and its class label in the same query; and b) co-occurrence of an instance and its class label, as separate queries within the same query session.",
        "The former source is a noisy attempt to capture queries that narrow the search results to a particular class of the instance (e.g., jaguar car maker).",
        "In comparison, the latter source noisily identifies searches that specialize from a class (e.g., car maker) to an instance (e.g., jaguar) or, conversely, generalize from an instance to a class.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing inherently-noisy queries and query sessions for the purpose ofranking ofopen-domain, labeled class instances.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces intuitions behind an approach using queries for ranking class labels of various instances, and describes associated ranking functions.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 describe the experimental setting and evaluation results over evaluation sets of instances associated with Web search queries.",
        "The results illustrate the higher quality of the query-based, re-ranked lists of class labels, relative to alternative ranking methods using only document-based counts."

        "Ranking Functions: The ranking functions follow directly from the above hypotheses.",
        "• Ranking based on H\\ (using documents): The first hypothesis Hi is a reformulation of findings from previous work (Etzioni et al., 2005).",

        "([..] C [such as|including] X [and|,|.",
        "]), where J is a potential instance (e.g., dideroi) and C is a potential class label (e.g., writers).",

        "of the sentence words, for potential class labels C; and identified by checking that 1 occurs as an entire query in query logs, for instances 1 (Van Durme and Paşca, 2008).",
        "The application of the scoring formula (1) to candidates extracted from the Web produces a ranked list of class labels Lhi(T).",
        "• Ranking based on H2 (using queries): Intuitively, Web users searching for information about 1 sometimes add some or all terms of C to a search query already containing J, either to further specify their query, or in response to being presented with sets of search results spanning several meanings of an ambiguous instance.",
        "Examples of such queries are happiness emotion and diderot philosopher.",

        "• Ranking based on H3 (using query sessions): Given the third hypothesis H3, Web users searching for information about 1 may subsequently search for more general information about one of its classes C. Conversely, users may specialize their search from a class C to one of its instances 1.",

        "In practice, a class label is deemed more relevant if its individual terms occur as part of queries that are in the same query session as a query containing only the instance.",
        "More precisely, for each term within any class label from L#i(î), we compute a score TermSessionScore, equal to the frequency sum of the anonymized queries from the query sessions that contain the term and are: a) either the initial query of the session, with the instance 1 being one of the subsequent queries from the same session; or b) one of the subsequent queries of the session, with the instance 1 being the initial query of the same session.",
        "Before computing the frequencies, the class label terms are stemmed.",

        "The class labels are ranked according to the geometric means, resulting in a ranked list L#3(î).",
        "In case of ties, L#3(J) preserves the relative ranking from Lhi(T).",
        "Unsupervised Ranking: Given an instance 1, the ranking hypotheses and corresponding functions Lhi(T), Lh2(Z) and L#3(J) (or any combination of them) can be used together to generate a merged, ranked list of class labels per instance 1.",
        "The score of a class label in the merged list is determined by the inverse of the average rank in the lists Lhi(T) and L#2(2~) and L#3(J), computed with the following formula:",
        "J2i Rank{C,Lm",
        "where N is the number of input lists of class labels (in this case, 3), and Rank(C, L#i) is the rank of C in the input list of class labels Lm (Lm, ^H2 or L#3).",
        "The rank is set to 1000, if C is not present in the list L#j.",
        "By using only the relative ranks and not the absolute scores of the class labels within the input lists, the outcome of the merging is less sensitive to how class labels of a given instance are numerically scored within the input lists.",
        "In case of ties, the scores of the class labels from Lhi(T) serve as a secondary ranking criterion.",
