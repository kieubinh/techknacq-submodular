        "Almost every day, people are faced with a situation that they must decide upon one thing or the other.",
        "To make better decisions, they probably attempt to compare entities that they are interesting in.",
        "These days, many web search engines are helping people look for their interesting entities.",
        "It is clear that getting information from a large amount of web data retrieved by the search engines is a much better and easier way than the traditional survey methods.",
        "However, it is also clear that directly reading each document is not a perfect solution.",
        "If people only have access to a small amount of data, they may get a biased point of view.",
        "On the other hand, investigating large amounts of data is a time-consuming job.",
        "Therefore, a comparison mining system, which can automatically provide a summary of comparisons between two (or more) entities from a large quantity of web documents, would be very useful in many areas such as marketing.",
        "We divide our work into two tasks to effectively build a comparison mining system.",
        "The first task is related to a sentence classification problem and the second is related to an information extraction problem.",
        "Task 1.",
        "Classifying comparative sentences into one non-comparative class and seven comparative classes (or types); 1) Equality, 2) Similarity, 3) Difference, 4) Greater or lesser, 5) Superlative, 6) Pseudo, and 7) Implicit comparisons.",
        "The purpose of this task is to efficiently perform the following task.",
        "Task 2.",
        "Mining comparative entities and predicates taking into account the characteristics of each type.",
        "For example, from the sentence \"Stock-Xis worth more than stock-Y.\"",
        "belonging to \"4) Greater or lesser\" type, we extract \"stock-X\" as a subject entity (SE), \"stock-Y\" as an object entity (OE), and \"worth\" as a comparative predicate (PR).",
        "These tasks are not easy or simple problems as described below.",
        "Classifying comparative sentences (Task 1): For the first task, we extract comparative sentences from text documents and then classify the extracted comparative sentences into seven comparative types.",
        "Our basic idea is a keyword search.",
        "Since Ha (1999a) categorized dozens of Korean comparative keywords, we easily build an initial keyword set as follows:",
        "In addition, we easily match each of these keywords to a particular type anchored to Ha's research, e.g., ([gat]: same)\" to \"1) Equality\", \"iLt} ([bo-da]: than)\" to \"4) Greater or lesser\".",
        "However, any method that depends on just these linguistic-based keywords has obvious limitations as follows:",
        "1) Kling is insufficient to cover all of the actual comparison expressions.",
        "2) There are many non-comparative sentences that contain some elements of Kling.",
        "3) There is no one-to-one relationship between keyword types and sentence types.",
        "Mining comparative entities and predicates (Task 2): Our basic idea for the second task is selecting candidates first and finding answers from the candidates later.",
        "We regard each of noun words as a candidate for SE/OE, and each of adjective (or verb) words as a candidate for PR.",
        "However, this candidate detection has serious problems as follows:",
        "4) There are many actual SEs, OEs, and PRs that consist of multiple words.",
        "5) There are many sentences with no OE, especially among superlative sentences.",
        "It means that the ellipsis is frequently occurred in superlative sentences.",
        "We focus on solving the above five problems.",
        "We perform various experiments to find relevant features and proper machine learning techniques.",
        "The final experimental results in 5-fold cross validation show the overall accuracy of 88.59% for the first task and the overall accuracy of 86.81% for the second task.",

        "Our strategy is to first detect Comparative Sentence candidates (CS-candidates), and then eliminate non-comparative sentences from the candidates.",

        "However, we observe that Klingis not enough to capture all the actual comparison expressions.",
        "Hence, we build a comparison lexicon as follows:",
        "â–  Comparison Lexicon = Kling U {Additional keywords that are frequently used for actual comparative expressions}",
        "This lexicon is composed of three parts.",
        "The first part includes the elements of Kling and their synonyms.",
        "The second part consists of idioms.",
        "For example, an idiom \"X 7} ^SXA [X-ga meon-jeo u-seot-da]\" commonly means \"The winner is X\" while it literally means \"X laughed first\".",
        "The last part consists of long-distance-words sequences, e.g., \"<X^ [X-neun], [ji-man], Y^ [Y-neun], A [da]>\".",
        "This sequence means that the sentence is formed as < S(X) + V + but + S(Y) + V > in English (S: subject phrase; V: verb phrase; X, Y: proper nouns).",
        "We could regard a word, \"T^ ([ji-man]: but),\" as a single keyword.",
        "However, this word also captures numerous non-comparative sentences.",
        "Namely, the precision value can fall too much due to this word.",
        "By using long-distance-words sequences instead of single keywords, we can keep the precision value from dropping seriously low.",
        "The comparison lexicon finally has a total of 177 elements.",
        "We call each element \"CK\" hereafter.",
        "Note that our lexicon does not include comparative/superlative POS tags.",
        "Unlike English, there is no Korean comparative/superlative POS tag from POS tagger commonly.",
        "Our lexicon covers 95.96% of the comparative sentences in our corpus.",
        "It means that we successfully defined a comparison lexicon for CS-candidate detection.",
        "However, the lexicon shows a relatively low precision of 68.39%.",
        "While detecting CS-candidates, the lexicon also captures many non-comparative sentences, e.g., following Ex1:",
        "sik-i o-reul-geot gat-da]: I think stock price will rise tomorrow.)",
        "This sentence is a non-comparative sentence even though it contains a CK, \"^[gat].\"",
        "This CK generally means \"same,\" but it often expresses \"conjecture\"' Since it is an adjective in both cases, it is difficult to distinguish the difference.",
        "To effectively filter out non-comparative sentences from CS-candidates, we use the sequences of \"continuous POS tags within a radius of 3 words from each CK\" as features.",
        "Each word in the sequence is replaced with its POS tag in order to reflect various expressions.",
        "However, as CKs play the most important role, they are represented as a combination of their lexicalization and POS tag, e.g., \"^Vpa.\"",
        "Finally, the feature has the form of \"X y\" (\"X\" means a sequence and \"y\" means a class; y1: comparative, y2: non-comparative).",
        "For instance, \"<pv etm nbn ^/pa ef sf >- y2\" is one of the features from Ex1 sentence.",
        "Finally, we achieved an f1-score of 90.23% using SVM.",
        "As we extract comparative sentences successfully, the next step is to classify the comparatives into different types.",
        "We define seven comparative types and then employ TBL for comparative sentence classification.",
        "We first define six broad comparative types based on modern Korean linguistics: 1) Equality, 2) Similarity, 3) Difference, 4) Greater or lesser, 5) Superlative, 6) Pseudo comparisons.",
        "The first five types can be understood intuitively, whereas the sixth type needs more explanation.",
        "\"6) Pseudd\" comparison includes comparative sentences that compare two (or more) properties of one entity such as \"Smartphone-X is a computer rather than a phone.\"",
        "This type of sentence is often classified into \"4) Greater or lesser.'",
        "However, since this paper focuses on comparisons between different entities, we separate \"6) Pseudo\" type from \"4) Greater or lesser\" type.",
        "The seventh type is \"7) Implicit\" comparison.",
        "It is added with the goal of covering literally \"implicit\" comparisons.",
        "For example, the sentence \"Shopping Mall X guarantees no fee full refund, but Shopping Mall Y requires refund-fee\" does not directly compare two shopping malls.",
        "It implicitly gives a hint that X is more beneficial to use than Y.",
        "It can be considered as a non-comparative sentence from a linguistic point of view.",
        "However, we conclude that this kind of sentence is as important as the other explicit comparisons from an engineering point of view.",
        "After defining the seven comparative types, we simply match each sentences to a particular type based on the CK types; e.g., a sentence which contains the word \"7% ([ga-jang]: most)\" is matched to \"Superlative\" type.",
        "However, a method that uses just the CK information has a serious problem.",
        "For example, although we easily match the CK \"SA ([bo-da]: than)\" to \"Greater or lesser\" without doubt, we observe that the type of CK itself does not guarantee the correct type of the sentence as we can see in the following three sentences:",
        "eui pum-jil-eun Y-bo-da jo-chi-do na-ppeu-ji-do an-ta]: The quality of X is neither better nor worse than that of Y.)",

        "However, each of these three sentences belongs to a different type.",
        "This fact addresses that many CKs could have an ambiguity problem just like the CK of \"SA ([bo-da]: than).\"",
        "To solve this ambiguity problem, we employ TBL.",
        "We first roughly annotate the type of sentences using the type of CK itself.",
        "After this initial annotating, TBL generates a set of error-driven transformation rules, and then a scoring function ranks the rules.",
        "We define our scoring function as Equation (1):",
        "Here, ri is the i-th transformation rule, Ci is the number of corrected sentences after ri is applied, and Ei is the number of the opposite case.",
        "The ranking process is executed iteratively.",
        "The iterations stop when the scoring function reaches a certain threshold.",
