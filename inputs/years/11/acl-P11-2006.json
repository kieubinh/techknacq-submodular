        "Bootstrapping (Yarowsky, 1995; Abney, 2004) is a technique frequently used in natural language processing to expand limited resources with minimal supervision.",
        "Given a small amount of sample data (seeds) representing a particular semantic class of interest, bootstrapping first trains a classifier (which often is a weighted list of surface patterns characterizing the seeds) using the seeds, and then apply it on the remaining data to select instances most likely to be of the same class as the seeds.",
        "These selected instances are added to the seed set, and the process is iterated until sufficient labeled data are acquired.",
        "Many bootstrapping algorithms have been proposed for a variety of tasks: word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995; Abney, 2004), information extraction (Hearst, 1992; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), part-of-speech tagging (Clark et al., 2003), and statistical parsing (Steedman et al., 2003; Mc-",
        "Closky et al., 2006).",
        "Bootstrapping algorithms, however, are known to suffer from the problem called semantic drift: as the iteration proceeds, the algorithms tend to select instances increasingly irrelevant to the seed instances (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "For example, suppose we want to collect the names of common tourist sites from a web corpus.",
        "Given seed instances {New York City, Maldives Islands}, bootstrapping might learn, at one point of the iteration, patterns like \"pictures ofX\" and \"photos ofX\" which also co-occur with many irrelevant instances.",
        "In this case, a later iteration would likely acquire frequent words co-occurring with these generic patterns, such as Michael Jackson.",
        "Previous work has tried to reduce the effect of semantic drift by making the stop list of instances that must not be extracted (Curran et al., 2007; McIntosh and Curran, 2009).",
        "Drift can also be reduced with carefully selected seeds.",
        "However, both of these approaches require expert knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach to seed selection and stop list creation for the state-of-the-art bootstrapping algorithm Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).",
        "An advantage of this approach is that it requires zero or minimal supervision.",
        "The idea is to use the hubness score of instances and patterns computed from the point-wise mutual information matrix with the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999).",
        "Komachi et al.",
        "(2008) pointed out that semantic drift in Espresso has the same root as topic drift (Bharat and Henzinger, 1998) observed with HITS, noting the algorithmic similarity between them.",
        "While Komachi et al.",
        "proposed to use algorithms different from Espresso to avoid semantic drift, in this paper we take advantage of this similarity to make better use of Espresso.",

        "In this section, we review related work on seed selection and stop list construction.",
        "We also briefly introduce the Espresso bootstrapping algorithm (Pan-tel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) for which we build our seed selection and stop list construction methods.",
        "The performance of bootstrapping can be greatly influenced by a number of factors such as the size of the seed set, the composition of the seed set and the coherence of the concept being expanded (Vyas et al., 2009).",
        "Vyas et al.",
        "(2009) studied the impact of the composition of the seed sets on the expansion performance, confirming that seed set composition has a significant impact on the quality of expansions.",
        "They also found that the seeds chosen by non-expert editors are often worse than randomly chosen ones.",
        "A similar observation was made by McIntosh and Curran (2009), who reported that randomly chosen seeds from the gold-standard set often outperformed seeds chosen by domain experts.",
        "These results suggest that even for humans, selecting good seeds is a non-trivial task.",
        "Yangarber et al.",
        "(2002) proposed to run multiple bootstrapping sessions in parallel, with each session trying to extract one of several mutually exclusive semantic classes.",
        "Thus, the instances harvested in one bootstrapping session can be used as the stop list of the other sessions.",
        "Curran et al.",
        "(2007) pursued a similar idea in their Mutual Exclusion Bootstrapping, which uses multiple semantic classes in addition to hand-crafted stop lists.",
        "While multi-class bootstrapping is a clever way to reduce human supervision in stop list construction, it is not generally applicable to bootstrapping for a single class.",
        "To apply the idea of multi-class bootstrapping to single-class bootstrapping, one has to first find appropriate competing semantic classes and good seeds for them, which is in itself a difficult problem.",
        "Along this line of research, McIntosh (2010) recently used Algorithm 1 Espresso algorithm",
        "1: Input: Seed vector i0 2: Instance-pattern co-occurrence matrix A 3: Instance cutoff parameter k 4: Pattern cutoff parameter m 5: Number of iterations t 6: Output: Instance score vector i 7: Pattern score vector p 12: Scale p so that the components sum to one.",

        "Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) is one of the state-of-the-art bootstrapping algorithms used in many natural language tasks (Komachi and Suzuki,",
        "Yoshida et al., 2010).",
        "Espresso takes advantage of pointwise mutual information (pmi) (Manning and Schütze, 1999) between instances and patterns to evaluate their reliability.",
        "Let n be the number of all instances in the corpus, and p the number of all possible patterns.",
        "We denote all pmi values as an n x p instance-pattern matrix A, with the (i, j) element of A holding the value of pmi between the ith instance and the jth pattern.",
        "Let AT denote the matrix transpose of A.",
        "Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of Espresso.",
        "The input vector i0 (called seed vector) is an n-dimensional binary vector with 1 at the ith component for every seed instance i, and 0 elsewhere.",
        "The algorithm outputs an n-dimensional vector i and an p-dimensional vector p, respectively representing the final scores of instances and patterns.",
        "Note that for brevity, the pseudocode assumes fixed numbers (k and m) of components in i and p are carried over to the subsequent iteration, but the original Espresso allows them to gradually increase with the number of iterations.",
        "3 HITS-based Approach to Seed Selection and Stop List Construction",
        "Komachi et al.",
        "(2008) pointed out the similarity between Espresso and Kleinberg's HITS web page ranking algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999).",
        "Indeed, if we remove the pattern/instance selection steps of Algorithm 1 (lines 13 and 16), the algorithm essentially reduces to HITS.",
        "In this case, the outputs i and p match respectively the hubness and authority score vectors of HITS, computed on the bipartite graph of instances and patterns induced by matrix A.",
        "An implication of this algorithmic similarity is that the outputs of Espresso are inherently biased towards the HITS vectors, which is likely to be the cause of semantic drift.",
        "Even though the pattern/instance selection steps in Espresso reduce such a bias to some extent, the bias still persists, as empirically verified by Komachi et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "In other words, the expansion process does not drift in random directions, but tend towards the set of instances and patterns with the highest HITS scores, regardless of the target semantic class.",
        "We exploit this observation in seed selection and stop list construction for Espresso, in order to reduce semantic drift.",
        "Our strategy is extremely simple, and can be summarized as follows.",
        "1.",
        "First, compute the HITS ranking of instances in the graph induced by the pmi matrix A.",
        "This can be done by calling Algorithm 1 with k = m = °° and a sufficiently large t.",
        "2.",
        "Next, check the top instances in the HITS ranking list manually, and see if these belong to the target class.",

        "(a) If the top instances are of the target class, use them as the seeds.",
        "We do not use a stop list in this case.",
        "(b) If not, these instances are likely to make a vector for which semantic drift is directed; hence, use them as the stop list.",
        "In this case, the seed set must be prepared manually, just like the usual bootstrapping procedure.",

        "In the lexical sample task, a small preselected set of a target word is given, along with an inventory of senses for each word (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008).",
        "Each word comes with a number of instances (context sentences) in which the target word occur, and some of these sentences are manually labeled with the correct sense of the target word in each context.",
        "The goal of the task is to classify unlabeled context sentences by the sense of the target word in each context, using the set of labeled sentences.",
        "To apply Espresso for this task, we reformulate the task to be that of seed set expansion, and not classification.",
        "That is, the hand-labeled sentences having the same sense label are used as the seed set, and it is expanded over all the remaining (unlabeled) sentences.",
        "The reason we use the lexical sample task is that every sentence (instance) belongs to one of the predefined senses (classes), and we can expect the most frequent sense in the corpus to form the highest HITS ranking instances.",
