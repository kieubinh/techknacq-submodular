        "The dialect labeling task requires knowledge of Arabic at a native level.",

        "Of the 3.1M available sentences, we selected a 'small' subset of 142,530 sentences to be labeled by MTurk Workers.",

        "We have been collecting labels from MTurk for a period of about four and a half months.",
        "In that period, 11,031 HITs were performed to completion (corresponding to 110,310 sentences, each labeled by three distinct annotators).",
