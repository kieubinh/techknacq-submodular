        "Our results suggest (i) that frame-based classifiers are usable for author attribution of both translated and untranslated texts; (ii) that frame-based classifiers generally perform worse than the baseline classifiers for untranslated texts, but (iii) perform as well as, or superior to the baseline classifiers on translated texts; (iv) that – contrary to current belief – naïve classifiers based on lexical markers may perform tolerably on translated texts if the combination of author and translator is present in the training set of a classifier."

        "Authorship attribution is the following problem: For a given text, determine the author of said text among a list of candidate authors.",
        "Determining authorship is difficult, and a host of methods have been proposed: As of 1998 Rudman estimated the number of metrics used in such methods to be at least 1000 (Rudman, 1997).",
        "For comprehensive recent surveys see e.g. (Juola, 2006; Koppel et al., 2008; Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "The process of authorship attribution consists of selecting markers (features that provide an indication of the author), and classifying a text by assigning it to an author using some appropriate machine learning technique.",
        "In contrast to the general authorship attribution problem, the specific problem of attributing translated texts to their original author has received little attention.",
        "Conceivably, this is due to the common intuition that the impact of the translator may add enough noise that proper attribution to the original author will be very difficult; for example, in (Arun et al., 2009) it was found that the imprint of the translator was significantly greater than that of the original author.",
        "The volume of resources for natural language processing in English appears to be much larger than for any other language, and it is thus, conceivably, convenient to use the resources at hand for a translated version of the text, rather than the original.",
        "To appreciate the difficulty of purely lexical or syntactic characterization of authors based on translation, consider the following excerpts from three different translations of the first few paragraphs of Turgenev's ^BopaHCKoe Tnes/ip:",

        "At an open window, in a handsome mansion situated in one of the outlying streets of O., the chief town of the government of that name-it was in the year 1842-there were sitting two ladies, the one about fifty years old, the other an old woman of seventy.",
        "A Nobleman's Nest Translated by I. F. Hapgood The brilliant, spring day was inclining toward the",
        "evening, tiny rose-tinted cloudlets hung high in the heavens, and seemed not to be floating past, but retreating into the very depths of the azure.",
        "In front of the open window of a handsome house, in one of the outlying streets of O * * * the capital of a Government, sat two women; one fifty years of age, the other seventy years old, and already aged.",

        "As translators express the same semantic content in different ways the syntax and style of different translations of the same text will differ greatly due to the footprint of the translators; this footprint may affect the classification process in different ways depending on the features.",
        "For markers based on language structure such as grammar or function words it is to be expected that the footprint of the translator has such a high impact on the resulting text that attribution to the author may not be possible.",
        "However, it is possible that a specific author/translator combination has its own unique footprint discernible from other author/translator combinations: A specific translator may often translate often used phrases in the same way.",
        "Ideally, the footprint of the author is (more or less) unaffected by the process of translation, for example if the languages are very similar or the marker is not based solely on lexical or syntactic features.",
        "In contrast to purely lexical or syntactic features, the semantic content is expected to be, roughly, the same in translations and originals.",
        "This leads us to hypothesize that a marker based on semantic frames such as found in the FrameNet database (Ruppen-hofer et al., 2006), will be largely unaffected by translations, whereas traditional lexical markers will be severely impacted by the footprint of the translator.",
        "The FrameNet project is a database of annotated exemplar frames, their relations to other frames and obligatory as well as optional frame elements for each frame.",
        "FrameNet currently numbers approximately 1000 different frames annotated with natural language examples.",
        "In this paper, we combine the data from FrameNet with the LTH semantic parser (Johansson and Nugues, 2007), until very recently (Das et al., 2010) the semantic parser with best experimental performance (note that the performance of LTH on our corpora is unknown and may differ from the numbers reported in (Johansson and",
        "Nugues, 2007)).",
        "The research on authorship attribution is too voluminous to include; see the excellent surveys (Juola, an overview of the plethora of lexical and syntactic markers used.",
        "The literature on the use of semantic markers is much scarcer: Gamon (Gamon, 2004) developed a tool for producing semantic dependency graphs and using the resulting information in conjunction with lexical and syntactic markers to improve the accuracy of classification.",
        "McCarthy et al.",
        "(McCarthy et al., 2006) employed WordNet and latent semantic analysis to lexical features with the purpose of finding semantic similarities between words; it is not clear whether the use of semantic features improved the classification.",
        "Argamon et al.",
        "(Argamon, 2007) used systemic functional grammars to define a feature set associating single words or phrases with semantic information (an approach reminiscent of frames); Experiments of authorship identification on a corpus of English novels of the 19th century showed that the features could improve the classification results when combined with traditional function word features.",
        "Apart from a few studies (Arun et al., 2009; Holmes, 1992; Archer et al., 1997), the problem of attributing translated texts appears to be fairly untouched."

        "Closest to a standard corpus for author attribution is The Federalist Papers (Juola, 2006), originally used by Mosteller and Wallace (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964), and we employ the subset of this corpus consisting of the 71 undisputed single-author documents as our Corpus I.",
        "For translated texts, a mix of authors and translators across authors is needed to ensure that the attribution methods do not attribute to the translator instead of the author.",

        "Based on this, we elected to compile a fresh corpus of translated texts; our Corpus II consists of English translations of 19th century Russian romantic literature chosen from Project Gutenberg for which a number of different versions, with different translators existed.",
        "The corpus primarily consists of novels, but is slightly polluted by a few collections of short stories and two nonfiction works by Tolstoy due to the necessity of including a reasonable mix of authors and translators.",
        "The corpus consists of 30 texts by 4 different authors and 12 different translators of which some have translated several different authors.",
        "The texts range in size from 200 (Turgenev: The Rendezvous) to 33000 (Tolstoy: War and Peace) sentences.",
        "The option of splitting the corpus into an artificially larger corpus by sampling sentences for each author and collating these into a large number ofnew documents was discarded; we deemed that the sampling could inadvertently both smooth differences between the original texts and smooth differences in the translators' footprints.",

        "To ascertain how heavily each marker is influenced by translation we also performed translator attribution on a subset of 11 texts [Corpus IIb] with 3 different translators each having translated 3 different authors.",
        "If the translator leaves a heavy footprint on the marker, the marker is expected to score better when attributing to translator than to author.",
        "Finally, we reduced the corpus to a set of 18 texts [Corpus IIc] that only includes unique author/translator combinations to see if each marker could attribute correctly to an author if the translator/author combination was not present in the training set.",
        "All classification experiments were conducted using a multi-class winner-takes-all (Duan and Keerthi, 2005) support vector machine (SVM).",
        "For cross-validation, all experiments used leave-one-out (i.e. N-fold for N texts in the corpus) validation.",

        "We have investigated the use of semantic frames as markers for author attribution and tested their applicability to attribution of translated texts.",
        "Our results show that frames are potentially useful, especially so for translated texts, and suggest that a combined method of frequent words and frames can outperform methods based solely on traditional markers, on translated texts.",
        "For attribution of untranslated texts and attribution to translator traditional markers such as frequent words and n-grams are still to be preferred.",
        "Our test corpora consist of a limited number of authors, from a limited time period, with translators from a similar limited time period and cultural context.",
        "Furthermore, our translations are all from a single language.",
        "Thus, further work is needed before firm conclusions regarding the general applicability of the methods can be made.",
        "It is well known that effectiveness of authorship markers may be influenced by topics (Stein et al., 2007; Schein et al., 2010); while we have endeavored to design our corpora to minimize such influence, we do not currently know the quantitative impact on topicality on the attribution methods in this paper.",
        "Furthermore, traditional investigations of authorship attribution have focused on the case of attributing texts among a small (N < 10) class of authors at the time, albeit with recent, notable exceptions (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2010; Koppel et al., 2010).",
        "We test our methods on similarly restricted sets of authors; the scalability of the methods to larger numbers of authors is currently unknown.",
        "Combining several classification methods into an ensemble method may yield improvements in precision (Raghavan et al., 2010); it would be interesting to see whether a classifier using frames yields significant improvements in ensemble with other methods.",
        "Finally, the distribution of frames in texts is distinctly different from the distribution of words: While there are function words, there are no 'function frames', and certain frames that are common in a corpus may fail to occur in the training material of a given author; it is thus conceivable that smoothing would improve classification by frames more than by words or N-grams."
