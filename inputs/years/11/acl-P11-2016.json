        "\"That's what she said\" is a well-known family of jokes, recently repopularized by the television show \"The Office\" (Daniels et al., 2005).",
        "The jokes consist of saying \"that's what she said\" after someone else utters a statement in a non-sexual context that could also have been used in a sexual context.",
        "For example, if Aaron refers to his late-evening basketball practice, saying \"I was trying all night, but I just could not get it in!",
        "\", Betty could utter \"that's what she said\", completing the joke.",
        "While somewhat juvenile, this joke presents an interesting natural language understanding problem.",
        "A \"that's what she said\" (TWSS) joke is a type of double entendre.",
        "A double entendre, or adianoeta, is an expression that can be understood in two different ways: an innocuous, straightforward way, given the context, and a risque way that indirectly alludes to a different, indecent context.",
        "To our knowledge, related research has not studied the task of identifying double entendres in text or speech.",
        "The task is complex and would require both deep semantic and cultural understanding to recognize the vast array of double entendres.",
        "We focus on a subtask of double entendre identification: TWSS recognition.",
        "We say a sentence is a TWSS if it is funny to follow that sentence with \"that's what she said\".",
        "We frame the problem of TWSS recognition as a type of metaphor identification.",
        "A metaphor is a figure of speech that creates an analogical mapping between two conceptual domains so that the terminology of one (source) domain can be used to describe situations and objects in the other (target) domain.",
        "Usage of the source domain's terminology in the source domain is literal and is nonliteral in the target domain.",
        "Metaphor identification systems seek to differentiate between literal and nonlit-eral expressions.",
        "Some computational approaches to metaphor identification learn selectional preferences of words in multiple domains to help identify nonlit-eral usage (Mason, 2004; Shutova, 2010).",
        "Other approaches train support vector machine (SVM) models on labeled training data to distinguish metaphoric language from literal language (Pasanek and Sculley, 2008).",
        "TWSSs also represent mappings between two domains: the innocuous source domain and an erotic target domain.",
        "Therefore, we can apply methods from metaphor identification to TWSS identification.",
        "In particular, we (1) compare the adjectival selectional preferences of sexually explicit nouns to those of other nouns to determine which nouns may be euphemisms for sexually explicit nouns and (2) examine the relationship between structures in the erotic domain and nonerotic contexts.",
        "We present a novel approach – Double Entendre via Noun Transfer (DEviaNT) – that applies metaphor identification techniques to solving the double entendre problem and evaluate it on the TWSS problem.",
        "DEviaNT classifies individual sentences as either funny if followed by \"that's what she said\" or not, which is a type of automatic humor recognition (Mihal-cea and Strapparava, 2005; Mihalcea and Pulman, 2007).",
        "We argue that in the TWSS domain, high precision is important, while low recall may be tolerated.",
        "In experiments on nearly 21K sentences, we find that DEviaNT has 12% higher precision than that of baseline classifiers that use n-gram TWSS models.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 will outline the characteristics of the TWSS problem that we leverage in our approach.",
        "Section 3 will describe the DEviaNT approach.",
        "Section 4 will evaluate DEviaNT on the TWSS problem.",
        "Finally, Section 5 will summarize our contributions."

        "We observe two facts about the TWSS problem.",
        "First, sentences with nouns that are euphemisms for sexually explicit nouns are more likely to be TWSSs.",
        "For example, containing the noun \"banana\" makes a sentence more likely to be a TWSS than containing the noun \"door\".",
        "Second, TWSSs share common structure with sentences in the erotic domain.",
        "For example, a sentence of the form \"[subject] stuck [object] in\" or \"[subject] could eat [object] all day\" is more likely to be a TWSS than not.",
        "Thus, we hypothesize that machine learning with euphemism-and structure-based features is a promising approach to solving the TWSS problem.",
        "Accordingly, apart from a few basic features that define a TWSS joke (e.g., short sentence), all of our approach's lexical features model a metaphorical mapping to objects and structures in the erotic domain.",
        "Part of TWSS identification is recognizing that the source context in which the potential TWSS is uttered is not in an erotic one.",
        "If it is, then the mapping to the erotic domain is the identity and the statement is not a TWSS.",
        "In this paper, we assume all test instances are from nonerotic domains and leave the classification of erotic and nonerotic contexts to future work.",
        "There are two interesting and important aspects of the TWSS problem that make solving it difficult.",
        "First, many domains in which a TWSS classifier could be applied value high precision significantly more than high recall.",
        "For example, in a social setting, the cost of saying \"that's what she said\" inappropriately is high, whereas the cost of not saying it when it might have been appropriate is negligible.",
        "For another example, in automated public tagging of twitter and facebook data, false positives are considered spam and violate usage policies, whereas false negatives go unnoticed.",
        "Second, the overwhelming majority of everyday sentences are not TWSSs, making achieving high precision even more difficult.",
        "In this paper, we strive specifically to achieve high precision but are willing to sacrifice recall."

        "The goal of our evaluation is somewhat unusual.",
        "DEviaNT explores a particular approach to solving the TWSS problem: recognizing euphemistic and structural relationships between the source domain and an erotic domain.",
        "As such, DEviaNT is at a disadvantage to many potential solutions because DEviaNT does not aggressively explore features specific to TWSSs (e.g., DEviaNT does not use a lexical n-gram model of the TWSS training data).",
        "Thus, the goal of our evaluation is not to outperform the baselines in all aspects, but rather to show that by using only euphemism-based and structure-based features, DEviaNT can compete with the baselines, particularly where it matters most, delivering high precision and few false positives.",
        "Our goals for DEviaNT's training data were to (1) include a wide range of negative samples to distinguish TWSSs from arbitrary sentences while (2) keeping negative and positive samples similar enough in language to tackle difficult cases.",
        "DEviaNT's positive training data are 2001 quoted sentences from twssstories.com (TS), a website of user-submitted TWSS jokes.",
        "DEviaNT's negative training data are 2001 sentences from three sources (667 each): textsfromlastnight.com (TFLN), a set of user-submitted, typically-racy text messages; fmylife.com/intimacy (FML), a set of short (12 sentence) user-submitted stories about their love lives; and wikiquote.org (WQ), a set of quotations from famous American speakers and films.",
        "We did not carefully examine these sources for noise, but given that TWSSs are rare, we assumed these data are sufficiently negative.",
        "For testing, we used 262 sentences (all the data from these sources that were available at the time of the experiments).",
        "We cleaned the data by splitting it into individual sentences, capitalizing the first letter of each sentence, tagging it with the Stanford Parser (Toutanova and Manning, 2000; Toutanova et al., 2003), and fixing several tagger errors (e.g., changing the tag of \"i\" from the foreign word tag FW to the correct pronoun tag PRP).",
        "Our experiments compare DEviaNT to seven other classifiers: (1) a Naive Bayes classifier on unigram features, (2) an SVM model trained on unigram features, (3) an SVM model trained on unigram and bigram features, (4-6) MetaCost (Domingos, 1999) (see Section 3.4) versions of (1-3), and (7) a version of DEviaNT that uses just the Basic Structure features (as a feature ablation study).",
