        "Automatic systems for the analysis of opinions expressed in text on the web have been studied extensively.",
        "Initially, this was formulated as a coarsegrained task - locating opinionated documents and tackled using methods derived from standard retrieval or categorization.",
        "However, in recent years there has been a shift towards a more detailed task: not only finding the text expressing the opinion, but also analysing it: who holds the opinion and to what is addressed; it is positive or negative (polarity); what its intensity is.",
        "This more complex formulation leads us deep into NLP territory; the methods employed here have been inspired by information extraction and semantic role labeling, combinatorial optimization and structured machine learning.",
        "A crucial step in the automatic analysis of opinion is to mark up the opinion expressions: the pieces of text allowing us to infer that someone has a particular feeling about some topic.",
        "Then, opinions can be assigned a polarity describing whether the feeling is positive, neutral or negative.",
        "These two tasks have generally been tackled in isolation.",
        "Breck et al.",
        "(2007) introduced a sequence model to extract opinions and we took this one step further by adding a reranker on top of the sequence labeler to take the global sentence structure into account in (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010b); later we also added holder extraction (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010a).",
        "For the task of classifiying the polarity of a given expression, there has been fairly extensive work on suitable classification features (Wilson et al., 2009).",
        "While the tasks of expression detection and polarity classification have mostly been studied in isolation, Choi and Cardie (2010) developed a sequence labeler that simultaneously extracted opinion expressions and assigned polarities.",
        "This is so far the only published result on joint opinion segmentation and polarity classification.",
        "However, their experiment lacked the obvious baseline: a standard pipeline consisting of an expression identifier followed by a polarity classifier.",
        "In addition, while theirs is the first end-to-end system for expression extraction with polarities, it is still a sequence labeler, which, by construction, is restricted to use simple local features.",
        "In contrast, in (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010b), we showed that global structure matters: opinions interact to a large extent, and we can learn about their interactions on the opinion level by means of their interactions on the syntactic and semantic levels.",
        "It is intuitive that this should also be valid when polarities enter the picture - this was also noted by Choi and Cardie (2008).",
        "Evaluative adjectives referring to the same evaluee may cluster together in the same clause or be dominated by a verb of categorization; opinions with opposite polarities may be conjoined through a contrastive discourse connective such as but.",
        "In this paper, we first implement two strong baselines consisting of pipelines of opinion expression segmentation and polarity labeling and compare them to the joint opinion extractor and polarity classifier by Choi and Cardie (2010).",
        "Secondly, we extend the global structure approach and add features reflecting the polarity structure of the sentence.",

        "Opinions have two features: polarity and intensity, and most expressions are also associated with a holder, also called source.",
        "In this work, we only consider polarities, not intensities or holders.",

        "We trained a first-order labeler with the discriminative training method by Collins (2002) and used common features: words, POS, lemmas in a sliding window.",
        "In addition, we used subjectivity clues extracted from the lexicon by Wilson et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "For the second baseline, we added our opinion expression reranker (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010b) on top of the expression sequence labeler.",
        "Given an expression, we use a classifier to assign a polarity value: positive, neutral, or negative.",
        "We trained linear support vector machines to carry out this classification.",
        "The problem of polarity classification has been studied in detail by Wilson et al.",
        "(2009), who used a set of carefully devised linguistic features.",

        "We formulate the opinion extraction task as a structured prediction problem y = arg maxy w • $(x, y).",
        "where w is a weight vector and $ a feature extractor representing a sentence x and a set y of polarity-labeled opinions.",
        "This is a high-level formulation we still need an inference procedure for the arg max and a learner to estimate w on a training set.",
        "Since there is a combinatorial number of ways to segment a sentence and label the segments with polarities, the tractability of the arg max operation will obviously depend on whether we can factorize the problem for a particular $.",
        "Choi and Cardie (2010) used a Markov factorization and could thus apply standard sequence labeling with a Viterbi arg max.",
        "However, in (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010b), we showed that a large improvement can be achieved if relations between possible expressions are considered; these relations can be syntactic or semantic in nature, for instance.",
        "This representation breaks the Markov assumption and the arg max becomes intractable.",
        "We instead used a reranking approximation: a Viterbibased sequence tagger following Breck et al.",
        "(2007) generated a manageable hypothesis set of complete segmentations, from which the reranking classifier picked one hypothesis as its final output.",
        "Since the set is small, no particular structure assumption (such as Markovization) needs to be made, so the reranker can in principle use features of arbitrary complexity.",
        "We now adapt that approach to the problem of joint opinion expression segmentation and polarity classification.",
        "In that case, we not only need hypotheses generated by a sequence labeler, but also the polarity labelings output by a polarity classifier.",
        "The hypothesis generation thus proceeds as follows:",
        "• For a given sentence, let the base sequence labeler generate up to ks sequences of unlabeled opinion expressions;",
        "• for every sequence, apply the base polarity classifier to generate up to kp polarity labelings.",
        "Thus, the hypothesis set size is at most ks • kp.",
        "We used a ks of 64 and a kp of 4 in all experiments.",

        "Polarity pair and syntactic dominance.",
        "In addition to the detailed syntactic path, we use a simpler feature based on dominance, i.e. that one expression is above the other in the syntax tree.",

        "Opinion expression boundaries are hard to define rigorously (Wiebe et al., 2005), so evaluations of their quality typically use soft metrics.",
        "The MPQA annotators used the overlap metric: an expression is counted as correct if it overlaps with one in the gold standard.",
        "This has also been used to evaluate opinion extractors (Choi et al., 2006; Breck et al., 2007).",
        "However, this metric has a number of problems: 1) it is possible to \"fool\" the metric by creating expressions that cover the whole sentence; 2) it does not give higher credit to output that is \"almost perfect\" rather than \"almost incorrect\".",
        "Therefore, in (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010b), we measured the intersection between the system output and the gold standard: every compared segment is assigned a score between 0 and 1, as opposed to strict or overlap scoring that only assigns 0 or 1.",

        "We have studied the implementation of end-to-end systems for opinion expression extraction and polarity labeling.",

        "However, our most interesting result is that a joint model of expression extraction and polarity labeling signiicantly improves over the sequential approach.",
        "This model uses features describing the interaction of opinions through linguistic structures.",
        "This precludes exact inference, but we resorted to a reranker.",
        "The model was trained using approximate max-margin learning.",
        "The inal system improved over the baseline by 4 points in intersection F-measure and 7 points in recall.",

        "This is not only of practical value but also con-irms our linguistic intuitions that surface phenomena such as syntax and semantic roles are used in encoding the rhetorical organization of the sentence, and that we can thus extract useful information from those structures.",
        "This would also suggest that we should leave the surface and instead process the discourse structure, and this has indeed been proposed (Somasundaran et al., 2009).",
