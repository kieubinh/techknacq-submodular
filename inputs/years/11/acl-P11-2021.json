        "Automatic speech recognition systems, which transcribe words, are often augmented by subsequent processing for inserting punctuation or labeling speech acts.",
        "Both prosodic features (extracted from the acoustic signal) and lexical features (extracted from the word sequence) have been shown to be useful for these tasks (Shriberg et al., 1998; Kim and Woodland, 2003; Ang et al., 2005).",
        "However, access to labeled speech training data is generally required in order to use prosodic features.",
        "On the other hand, the Internet contains large quantities of textual data that is already labeled with punctuation, and which can be used to train a system using lexical features.",
        "In this work, we focus on question detection in the Meeting Recorder Dialog Act corpus (MRDA) (Shriberg et al., 2004), using text sentences with question marks in Wikipedia \"talk\" pages.",
        "We compare the performance of a question detector trained on the text domain using lexical features with one trained on MRDA using lexical features and/or prosodic features.",
        "In addition, we experiment with two unsupervised domain adaptation methods to incorporate unlabeled MRDA utterances into the text-based question detector.",
        "The goal is to use the unlabeled domain-matched data to bridge stylistic differences as well as to incorporate the prosodic features, which are unavailable in the labeled text data."
