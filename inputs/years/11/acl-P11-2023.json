        "We propose a number of improvements to ISO-TimeML to deal with as yet untreated phenomena.",
        "These include both cross-language annotation guidelines, as well as guidelines specific to French.",
        "All these guidelines are implemented in the FTiB.",
        "Cross-language Improvements : ISO-TimeML currently provides for the annotation of event modality by capturing the lemma of a modal on a subordinated event tag in the modality attribute.",
        "Inspired by the fact that in French, modality is expressed by fully inflected verbs, we propose that those verbs be tagged as modal, and we provide a set of normalized values for the modality attribute, within a manual annotation context, that reflect the classic classes of linguistic modality (Palmer, 1986): NECESSITY and POSSIBILITY (epistemic), OBLIGATION and PERMISSION (de-ontic).",
        "We also provide a way of capturing the difference between support verb constructions with a neutral aspectual value (mener une attaque (carry out an attack)) and those with an inchoative aspectual value (lancer une attaque (launch an attack)).",
        "ISO-TimeML encodes the relation between the verb and its nominal argument via a <TLINK> of type IDENTITY.",
        "We encode aspectual variants in the FTiB by using an <ALINK>.",
        "A significant proportion (13/36) of the annotated <ALINK> tags in the FTiB (36%) are used in this case.",
        "A third improvement we propose is the introduction of the event class EVENTjCONTAINER to distinguish predicates that take an event nominal as subject.",
        "In TB1.2, these predicates were sometimes marked, but not distinguished from the OCCURRENCE class.",
        "The distinction is appropriate as these predicates have events as arguments, unlike OCCURRENCEs.",
        "The relative frequency of this class (19 occurrences) compared to the standard PERCEPTION class (10) also justifies its use.",
        "Although not yet dealt with in ISO-TimeML, aspectual periphrases, such as en train de + Vinf (akin to the English progressive -ing), adding an aspectual value to an event, are captured in the FTiB in the aspect attribute for events.",
        "We also propose a new value for aspect, PROSPECTIVE, encoding the value of the construction aller + Vinf (going to + Vnf ), as in le soleil va exploser (the sun is going to explode).",
        "Improvements for French : a correspondence had to be made between the ISO-TimeML schema and the grammatical tense system of French, in particular, to account for tenses such as the passe compose (PAST tense value, as opposed to the present perfect used in English) and imparfait (IMPERFECT, not present in English as a morphological tense).",
        "French modal verbs behave differently to English modal auxiliaries as they can be conjugated in all tenses, fall within the scope of aspectual, negative polarity and other modal operators.",
        "Unlike in TB1.2, modal verbs (and adjectives), are marked <EVENT> in FTiB and have the class MODAL.",

        "Firstly, to favor comparison with TB1.2 (which is made up of news articles).",

        "We present some of the correlations between sub-genre and linguistic content in Section 5.",
        "Automatic pre-annotation : To speed up the annotation process, we carried out an automatic pre-annotation of markables (events, temporal expressions and some relation markers), followed by manual correction.",

        "We adapted and enriched a pre-existing set of transducers for annotating temporal expressions in French (Gross, 2002) for our purposes.",

        "The value attribute is only set during normalization, carried out after the detection phase.",
        "A script calculates normalized values for marked expressions, including index-icals, such as lundi dernier (last Monday) or l'annee prochaine (next year) (with the article's publication date as reference point).",
