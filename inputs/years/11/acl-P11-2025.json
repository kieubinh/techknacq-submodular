        "Since the early days of natural language understanding (NLU), quantifier scope disambiguation has been an extremely hard task.",
        "Therefore, early NLU systems either devised some mechanism for leaving the semantic representation underspecified (Woods 1978, Hobbs and Shieber 1987), or tried to assign scoping to sentences based on heuristics (VanLehn 1978, Moran 1988, Alshawi 1992).",
        "There has been a lot of work since then on developing frameworks for scope-underspecified semantic representations (Alshawi and Crouch 1992, Bos 1996, Copestake et al., 2001, Egg et al., 2001).",
        "The motivation of most recent formalisms is to develop a constraint-based framework where you can incrementally add constraints to filter out unwanted scopings.",
        "However, almost all of these formalisms are based on hard constraints, which have to be satisfied in every reading of the sentence.",
        "It seems that the story is different in practice.",
        "Most of the constraints one can hope for (imposed by discourse, pragmatics, word knowledge, etc.)",
        "are soft constraints, that is they define a preference over the possible readings of a sentence.",
        "As a result, statistical methods seem to be well suited for scope disambiguation.",
        "Surprisingly enough, after two decades of extensive work on statistical techniques in natural language processing, there has not been much work on scope disambiguation (see section 6 for a review).",
        "In addition, as discussed later, this work is very restricted.",
        "It considers sentences with only two quantifiers, where the quantifiers are picked from a predefined list.",
        "For example, it ignores definites, bare singulars/plurals, and proper nouns, as well as negations and other scopal operators.",
        "A major reason for the lack of work on statistical scope disambiguation is the lack of a comprehensive scope-disambiguated corpus.",
        "In fact, there is not even a standard test set for evaluation purposes.",
        "The reason behind this latter fact is simple.",
        "Scope disambiguation is very hard even for humans.",
        "In fact, our own early effort to annotate part of the Penn Treebank with full scope information soon proved to be too ambitious.",
        "Instead, we have picked a domain that covers many challenging phenomena in scope disambiguation, while keeping the scope disambiguation fairly intuitive.",
        "This helps us to build the first moderately sized corpus of natural language text with full scope information.",
        "By fully scoping a sentence, we mean to label the scope interaction between every two scopal elements in that sentence.",
        "We scope all scope-bearing NPs (quantified or not), negations, logical/modal operators, and other sentential adverbials.",
        "We also annotate plurals with their distributive vs. collective readings.",
        "In addition, we label sentences with coreference relations because they affect the scope interaction between NPs."

        "This domain has several properties that make it a great choice for a first effort to build a comprehensive scope-disambiguated corpus.",
        "First, it carries a lot of scope interactions.",
        "As shown in the examples, the domain carries many quantified NPs.",
        "Also, scopal operators such as negation, and logical operators occur pretty often in the domain.",
        "Second, scope disambiguation is critical for deep understanding in this domain.",
        "Third, scoping is fairly intuitive, because a conscious knowledge of scoping is required in order to be able to accomplish the explained task.",

        "Plurals, in general, introduce a major source of complexity both in formal and computational semantics (Link 1997).",
        "From a scope-disambiguation point of view, the main issue with plurals come from the fact that they carry two possible kinds of readings: collective vs. distributive.",
        "We treat plurals as a set of individuals and assume that the index of a plural NP refers to the set (collective reading).",
        "However, we also assume that every plural potentially carries an implicit universal quantifier ranging over all elements in the set.",
        "We represent this implicit universal with id (' d' for distributive) where i is the index of the plural NP.",
        "It is important to notice that while most theoretical papers talk about the collectivity vs. distributivity distinction at the sentence level, for us the right treatment is to make this distinction at the constraint level.",

        "In spite of choosing a specific domain with fairly intuitive quantifier scoping, the scope annotation has been a very challenging job.",

        "Most work on quantifier scoping focuses on scoping phenomena, which may be interesting from theoretical perspective, but do not occur very often in practice.",
        "Therefore many challenging practical phenomena remain unexplored.",
        "During annotation of the corpus, we encountered a lot of these phenomena, which we have tried to generalize and find a reasonable treatment for.",
        "Second, other sources of ambiguity are likely to show up as scope disagreement.",
        "Finally, very often the disagreement in scoping does not result from the different interpretations of the sentence, but the different representations of the same interpretation.",
        "In writing the annotation scheme, extreme care has been taken to prevent these spurious disagreements.",
