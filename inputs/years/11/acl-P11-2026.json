        "The growth of text corpora in different languages poses an inherent problem of aligning documents across languages.",
        "Obtaining an explicit alignment, or a different way of bridging the language barrier, is an important step in many natural language processing (NLP) applications such as: document retrieval (Gale and Church, 1991; Rapp, 1999; Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Vu et al., 2009), Transliteration Mining (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Hermjakob et al., 2008; Udupa et al., 2009; Ravi and Knight, 2009) and Multilingual Web Search (Gao et al., 2008; Gao et al., 2009).",
        "Aligning documents from different languages arises in all the above mentioned problems.",
        "In this paper, we address this problem by mapping documents into a common subspace (interlingual representa-tion).",
        "This common subspace generalizes the notion of vector space model for cross-lingual applications (Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "There are two major approaches for solving the document alignment problem, depending on the available resources.",
        "The first approach, which is widely used in the Cross-lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) literature, uses bilingual dictionaries to translate documents from one language (source) into another (target) language (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Pirkola et al., 2001).",
        "Then standard measures such as cosine similarity are used to identify target language documents that are close to the translated document.",
        "The second approach is to use training data of aligned document pairs to find a common subspace such that the aligned document pairs are maximally correlated (Susan T. Dumais, 1996; Vinokourov et al., 2003; Mimno et al., 2009; Platt et al., 2010; Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "Both kinds of approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses.",
        "Dictionary based approaches treat source documents independently, i.e., each source language document is translated independently of other documents.",
        "Moreover, after translation, the relationship of a given source document with the rest of the source documents is ignored.",
        "On the other hand, supervised approaches use all the source and target language documents to infer an interlingual representation, but their strong dependency on the training data prevents them from generalizing well to test documents from a different domain.",
        "In this paper, we propose a technique that combines the advantages of both these approaches.",
        "At a broad level, our approach uses bilingual dictionaries to identify initial noisy document alignments (Sec.",
        "2.1) and then uses these noisy alignments as training data to learn a common subspace.",
        "Since the alignments are noisy, we need a learning algorithm that is robust to the errors in the training data.",
        "It is known that techniques like CCA overfit the training data (Rai and Daumé III, 2009).",
        "So, we start with an unsupervised approach such as Kernelized Sorting (Quadrianto et al., 2009) and develop a supervised variant of it (Sec.",
        "2.2).",
        "Our supervised variant learns to modify the within language document similarities according to the given alignments.",
        "Since the original algorithm is unsupervised, we hope that its supervised variant is tolerant to errors in the candidate alignments.",
        "The primary advantage of our method is that, it does not use any training data and thus generalizes to test documents from different domains.",
        "And unlike the dictionary based approaches, we use all the documents in computing the common subspace and thus achieve better accuracies compared to the approaches which translate documents in isolation.",
        "There are two main contributions of this work.",
        "First, we propose a discriminative technique to learn an interlingual representation using only a bilingual dictionary.",
        "Second, we develop a supervised variant of Kernelized Sorting algorithm (Quadrianto et al., 2009) which learns to modify within language document similarities according to a given alignment."

        "Given a cross-lingual corpus, with an underlying unknown document alignment, we propose a technique to recover the hidden alignment.",
        "This is achieved by mapping documents into an interlingual representation.",
        "Our approach involves two stages.",
        "In the first stage, we use a bilingual dictionary to find initial candidate noisy document alignments.",
        "The second stage uses a robust learning algorithm to learn a common subspace from the noisy alignments identified in the first step.",
        "Subsequently, we project all the documents into the common subspace and use maximal matching to recover the hidden alignment.",
        "During this stage, we also learn mappings from the document spaces onto the common subspace.",
        "These mappings can be used to convert any new document into the interlingual representation.",
        "We describe each of these two steps in detail in the following two sub sections (Sec.",
        "2.1 and Sec. 2.2).",
        "Translating documents from one language into another language and finding the nearest neighbours gives potential alignments.",
        "Unfortunately, the resulting alignments may differ depending on the direction of the translation owing to the asymmetry of bilingual dictionaries and the nearest neighbour property.",
        "In order to overcome this asymmetry, we first turn the documents in both languages into bag of translation pairs representation.",
        "We follow the feature representation used in Ja-garlamudi and Daumé III (2010) and Boyd-Graber and Blei (2009).",
        "Each translation pair of the bilingual dictionary (also referred as a dictionary entry) is treated as a new feature.",
        "Given a document, every word is replaced with the set of bilingual dictionary entries that it participates in.",
        "If D represents the TFIDF weighted term x document matrix and T is a binary matrix matrix of size no_of_dictionary_entries x vocabsize, then converting documents into a bag of dictionary entries is given by the linear operation X(t) – TD.",
        "After converting the documents into bag of dictionary entries representation, we form a bipartite graph with the documents of each language as a separate set of nodes.",
        "The edge weight between a pair of documents and (in source and target language respectively) is computed as the Euclidean distance between those documents in the dictionary space.",
        "Let n^-indicate the likeliness of a source document is aligned to a target document .",
        "We want each document to align to at least one document from other language.",
        "Moreover, we want to encourage similar documents to align to each other.",
        "We can formulate this objective and the constraints as the following minimum cost flow",
        "arg min V\" Wjnij (1)",
        "where C is some user chosen constant, m and n are the number of documents in source and target languages respectively.",
        "Without the last constraint < C) this optimization problem always gives an integral solution and reduces to a maximum matching problem (Jonker and Volgenant, 1987).",
        "Since this solution may not be accurate, we allow many-to-many mapping by setting the constant C to a value less than one.",
        "In our experiments (Sec.",
        "3), we found that setting C to a value less than 1 gave better performance analogous to the better performance of soft Expectation Maximization (EM) compared to hard-EM.",
        "The optimal solution of Eq.",
        "1 can be found efficiently using linear programming (Ravindra et al., 1993).",
        "Kernelized Sorting is an unsupervised technique to align objects of different types, such as English and Spanish documents (Quadrianto et al., 2009; Ja-garalmudi et al., 2010).",
        "The main advantage of this method is that it only uses the intra-language document similarities to identify the alignments across languages.",
        "In this section, we describe a supervised variant of Kernelized Sorting which takes a set of candidate alignments and learns to modify the intra-language document similarities to respect the given alignment.",
        "Since Kernelized Sorting does not rely on the interlingual document similarities at all, we hope that its supervised version is robust to noisy alignments.",
        "Let X and Y be the TFIDF weighted term x document matrices in both the languages and let Kx and Ky be their linear dot product kernel matrices, i.e. , Kx = XTX and Ky = YTY.",
        "Let n G {0, l|mxn denote the permutation matrix which captures the alignment between documents of different languages, i.e. nij = 1 indicates documents xi and yj are aligned.",
        "Then Kernelized Sorting formulates n as the solution of the following optimization problem (Gretton et al., 2005):",
        "argmax tr(KxÜKynT) (2)",
        "In our supervised version of Kernelized Sorting, we fix the permutation matrix (to say II) and modify the kernel matrices Kx and Ky so that the objective function is maximized for the given permutation.",
        "Specifically, we find a mapping for each language, such that when the documents are projected into their common subspaces they are more likely to respect the alignment given by nI .",
        "Subsequently, the test documents are also projected into the common subspace and we return the nearest neighbors as the aligned pairs.",
        "Let U and V be the mappings for the required subspace in both the languages, then we want to solve the following optimization problem:",
        "argmax tr(XTUUTX II YTVVTY IIT)",
        "where I is an identity matrix of appropriate size.",
        "For brevity, let Cxy denote the cross-covariance matrix (i.e. Cxy = XII YT) then the above objective function becomes:",
        "arg max tr(UUTCxy VVTCXJ,)",
        "We have used the cyclic property of the trace function while rewriting Eq.",
        "4 to Eq.",
        "5.",
        "We use alternative maximization to solve for the unknowns.",
        "Fixing V (to say Vo), rewriting the objective function using the cyclic property of the trace function, forming the Lagrangian and setting its derivative to zero results in the following solution:",
        "Cxy VoVoTU = Au U (6)",
        "For the initial iteration, we can substitute VoVoT as identity matrix which leaves the kernel matrix unchanged.",
        "Similarly, fixing U (to U0) and solving the optimization problem for V results:",
        "UoUoTCxy V = Av V (7)",
        "In the special case where both VoVoT and UoUoTare identity matrices, the above equations reduce to CxyCTy U = Au U and CTyCxy V = Av V. In this particular case, we can simultaneously solve for both U and V using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as:",
        "So for the first iteration, we do the SVD of the cross-covariance matrix and get the mappings.",
