        "Evaluation has always been one of the major issues in Machine Translation research, as both human and automatic evaluation methods exhibit very important limitations.",
        "On the one hand, although highly reliable, in addition to being expensive and time consuming, human evaluation suffers from inconsistency problems due to inter-and intra-annotator agreement issues.",
        "On the other hand, while being consistent, fast and cheap, automatic evaluation has the major disadvantage of requiring reference translations.",
        "This makes automatic evaluation not reliable in the sense that good translations not matching the available references are evaluated as poor or bad translations.",
        "The main objective of this work is to propose and evaluate AM-FM, a semantic framework for assessing translation quality without the need for reference translations.",
        "The proposed framework is theoretically grounded on the classical concepts of adequacy and fluency, and it is designed to account for these two components of translation quality in an independent manner.",
        "First, a cross-language latent semantic indexing model is used for assessing the adequacy component by directly comparing the output translation with the input sentence it was generated from.",
        "Second, an n-gram based language model of the target language is used for assessing the fluency component.",
        "Both components of the metric are evaluated at the sentence level, providing the means for defining and implementing a sentence-based evaluation metric.",
        "Finally, the two components are combined into a single measure by implementing a weighted harmonic mean, for which the weighting factor can be adjusted for optimizing the metric performance.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2, presents some background work and the specific dataset that has been used in the experimental work.",
        "Section 3, provides details on the proposed AM-FM framework and the specific metric implementation.",
        "Section 4 presents the results of the conducted comparative evaluations.",
        "Finally, section 5 presents the main conclusions and relevant issues to be dealt with in future research."

        "Regarding the specific idea of evaluating machine translation without using reference translations, several works have proposed and evaluated different approaches, including round-trip translation (Somers, 2005; Rapp, 2009), as well as other regression-and classification-based approaches (Quirk, 2004; Ga-mon et al., 2005; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007; Specia et al., 2009).",
        "As part of the recent efforts on machine translation evaluation, two workshops have been organizing shared-tasks and evaluation campaigns over the last four years: the NIST Metrics for Machine Translation Challenge (MetricsMATR) and the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT); which were actually held as one single event in their most recent edition in 2010.",

        "A two-component evaluation metric, based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency (White et al., 1994) is defined.",
        "While adequacy accounts for the amount of source meaning being preserved by the translation (5:all, 4:most, 3:much, 2:little, 1:none), fluency accounts for the quality of the target language in the translation (5:flawless, 4:good, 3:non-native, 2:disfluent, 1:incomprehensible).",
        "For implementing the adequacy-oriented component (AM) of the metric, the cross-language latent semantic indexing approach is used (Dumais et al., 1997), in which the source sentence originating the translation is used as evaluation reference.",
