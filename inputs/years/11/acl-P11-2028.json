        "However, in written Chinese text, there is no word delimiter.",
        "Thus, in almost all tasks of Chinese natural language processing (NLP), the first step is to segment a Chinese sentence into a sequence of words.",
        "This is the task of Chinese word segmentation (CWS), an important and challenging task in Chinese NLP.",
        "Some linguists believe that word (containing at least one character) is the appropriate unit for Chinese language processing.",
        "When treating CWS as a standalone NLP task, the goal is to segment a sentence into words so that the segmentation matches the human gold-standard segmentation with the highest F-measure, but without considering the performance of the end-to-end NLP application that uses the segmentation output.",
        "In statistical machine translation (SMT), it can happen that the most accurate word segmentation as judged by the human gold-standard segmentation may not produce the best translation output (Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "While state-of-the-art Chinese word segmenters achieve high accuracy, some errors still remain.",
        "Instead of segmenting a Chinese sentence into words, an alternative is to split a Chinese sentence into characters, which can be readily done with perfect accuracy.",
        "However, it has been reported that a Chinese-English phrase-based SMT system (Xu et al., 2004) that relied on characters (without CWS) performed slightly worse than when it used segmented words.",
        "It has been recognized that varying segmentation granularities are needed for SMT (Chang et al., 2008).",
        "To evaluate the quality of Chinese translation output, the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation in 2005 (IWSLT'2005) used the word-level BLEU metric (Papineni et al., character-level evaluation metrics to rank the submitted systems.",
        "Although there is much work on automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT), whether word or character is more suitable for automatic evaluation of Chinese translation output has not been systematically investigated.",
        "In this paper, we utilize various machine translation evaluation metrics to evaluate the quality of Chinese translation output, and compare their correlation with human assessment when the Chinese translation output is segmented into words versus characters.",
        "Since there are several CWS tools that can segment Chinese sentences into words and their segmentation results are different, we use four representative CWS tools in our experiments.",
        "Our experimental results reveal that character-level metrics correlate with human assessment better than word-level metrics.",
        "That is, CWS is not essential for automatic evaluation of Chinese translation output.",

        "We have analyzed the reasons why character-level metrics better correlate with human assessment than word-level metrics.",
        "Compared to word-level metrics, character-level metrics can capture more synonym matches.",
        "For example, Figure 1 gives the system translation and a reference translation segmented into words:",
        "The word \"4\" is a synonym for the word \"0 4\", and both words are translations of the English word \"umbrella\".",
        "If a word-level metric is used, the word \"4\" in the system translation will not match the word \"04\" in the reference translation.",
        "However, if the system and reference translation are segmented into characters, the word \"4\" in the system translation shares the same character \"4\" with the word \" 04\" in the reference.",
        "Thus character-level metrics can better capture synonym matches.",
        "We can classify the semantic relationships of words that share some common characters into three types: exact match, partial match, and no match.",
        "The statistics on the output translations of an MT system are shown in Table 5.",
        "It shows that \"exact match\" accounts for 71% (29/41) and \"no match\" only accounts for 7% (3/41).",
        "This means that words that share some common characters are synonyms in most cases.",
        "Therefore, character-level metrics do a better job at matching Chinese translations.",
        "Another reason why word-level metrics perform worse is that the segmented words in a system translation may be inconsistent with the segmented words in a reference translation, since a statistical word segmenter may segment the same sequence of characters differently depending on the context in a sentence.",
        "For example:",
        "Translation: ifcJ±_M0 J^_?",
        "Here the word \"M0\" is the Chinese translation of the English word \"Kyoto\".",
        "However, it is segmented into two words, \"M\" and \"0\\ in the reference translation by the same CWS tool.",
        "When this happens, a word-level metric will fail to match them in the system and reference translation.",
        "While the accuracy of state-of-the-art CWS tools is high, segmentation errors still exist and can cause such mismatches.",
        "To summarize, character-level metrics can capture more synonym matches and the resulting segmentation into characters is guaranteed to be consistent, which makes character-level metrics more suitable for the automatic evaluation of Chinese translation output."
