        "Melamed (2000) introduces the competitive linking algorithm which greedily constructs matchings under the one-to-one mapping assumption.",
        "In (Matusov et al., 2004), matchings are found using an algorithm for constructing a maximum weighted bipartite graph matching (Schrijver, 2003), where word pair scores come from alignment posteriors of generative models.",

        "(2005) cast word alignment as a maximum weighted matching problem and propose a framework for learning word pair scores as a function of arbitrary features of that pair.",

        "(2006) address this issue by formulating the alignment problem as a quadratic assignment problem, and off-the-shelf integer linear programming (ILP) solvers are used to solve to optimization problem.",
        "While efficient for some median scale problems, ILP-based approaches are limited since when modeling more sophisticated interactions, the number of variables (and/or constraints) required grows polynomially, or even exponentially, making the resultant optimization impractical to solve.",
        "In this paper, we treat the word alignment problem as maximizing a submodular function subject to matroid constraints (to be defined in Section 2).",
        "Submodular objective functions can represent complex interactions among alignment decisions, and essentially extend the modular (linear) objectives used in the aforementioned approaches.",
        "While our extensions add expressive power, they do not result in a heavy computational burden.",
        "This is because maximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint can be solved efficiently using a simple greedy algorithm.",
        "The greedy algorithm, moreover, is a constant factor approximation algorithm that guarantees a near-optimal solution.",
        "In this paper, we moreover show that submodularity naturally arises in word alignment problems when modeling word fertility (see Section 4).",

        "To find the correct alignment (ei, fi) and (e2, f2), the competitive linking algorithm in (Melamed, 2000) poses a one-to-one assumption to prevent choosing ( e , f2) over ( e2, f2 ) .",

        "Alternatively, we argue that the reason of choosing (e2, f2) rather than (ei, f2) is that the benefit of aligning ei and f2diminishes after ei is already aligned with fi – this is exactly the property of diminishing returns, and therefore, it is natural to use submodular functions to model alignment scores.",
