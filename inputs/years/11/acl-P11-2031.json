        "However, there is no consistently used strategy that controls for the effects of unstable estimates of model parameters.",
        "While the existence of optimizer instability is an acknowledged problem, it is only infrequently discussed in relation to the reliability ofexperimental results, and, to ourknowledge, there has yet to be a systematic study ofits effects on hypothesis testing.",
        "In this paper, we present a series of experiments demonstrating that optimizer instability can account for substantial amount ofvariation in translation quality, which, if not controlled for, could lead to incorrect conclusions.",
        "We then show that it is possible to control for this variable with a high degree of confidence with only a few replications of the experiment and conclude by suggesting new best practices for significance testing for machine translation."

        "Statistical machine translation systems consist of a model whose parameters are estimated to maximize some objective function on a set of development data.",
        "Because the standard objectives (e.g., 1-best BLEU, expected BLEU, marginal likelihood) are not convex, only approximate solutions to the optimization problem are available, and the parameters learned are typically only locally optimal and may strongly depend on parameter initialization and search hyperparameters.",
        "Additionally, stochastic optimization and search techniques, such as minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Arun et al., 2010),constitute a second, more obvious source of noise in the optimization procedure.",
        "This variation in the parameter vector affects the quality of the model measured on both development data and held-out test data, independently of any experimental manipulation.",
        "Thus, when trying to determine whether the difference between two measurements is significant, it is necessary to control for variance due to noisy parameter estimates.",
        "This can be done by replication of the optimization procedure with different starting conditions (e.g., by running MERT many times).",
        "Unfortunately, common practice in reporting machine translation results is to run the optimizer once per system configuration and to draw conclusions about the experimental manipulation from this single sample.",
        "However, it could be that a particular sample is on the \"low\" side of the distribution over optimizer outcomes (i.e., it results in relatively poorer scores on the test set) or on the \"high\" side.",
        "The danger here is obvious: a high baseline result paired with a low experimental result could lead to a useful experimental manipulation being incorrectly identified as useless.",
        "We now turn to the question of how to reduce the probability falling into this trap."

        "Approximate randomization (AR) has been proposed as a more reliable technique for MT significance testing, and evidence suggests that it yields fewer type I errors (i.e., claiming a significant difference where none exists; Riezler and Maxwell, 2005).",
        "Other uses in NLP include the MUC-6 evaluation (Chinchor, 1993) and parsing (Cahill et al., 2008).",

        "In our experiments, we ran the MERT optimizer to optimize BLEU on a held-out development set many times to obtain a set of optimizer samples on two different pairs of systems (4 configurations total).",
        "Each pair consists of a baseline system (System A) and an \"experimental\" system (System B), which previous research has suggested will perform better.",
        "The first system pair contrasts a baseline phrase-based system (Moses) and experimental hierarchical phrase-based system (Hiero), which were constructed from the Chinese-English BTEC corpus (0.7M words), the later of which was decoded with the cdec decoder (Koehn et al., 2007; Chiang, 2007; Dyer et al., 2010).",
        "The second system pair contrasts two German-English Hiero/cdec systems constructed from the WMT11 parallel training data (98M words).",
        "The baseline system was trained on unsegmented words, and the experimental system was constructed using the most probable segmentation of the German text according to the CRF word segmentation model of Dyer (2009).",
        "The Chinese-English systems were optimized 300 times, and the German-English systems were optimized 50 times.",
        "Our experiments used the default implementation of MERT that accompanies each of the two decoders.",
        "The Moses MERT implementation uses 20 random restart points per iteration, drawn uniformly from the default ranges for each feature, and, at each iteration, 200-best lists were extracted with the current weight vector (Bertoldi et al., 2009).",
        "The cdec MERT implementation performs inference over the decoder search space which is structured as a hypergraph (Kumar et al., 2009).",
        "Rather than using restart points, in addition to optimizing each feature independently, it optimizes in 5 random directions per iteration by constructing a search vector by uniformly sampling each element of the vector from ( – 1,1) and then renormalizing so it has length 1.",
        "For all systems, the initial weight vector was manually initialized so as to yield reasonable translations.",
        "Table 1: Measured standard deviations of different automatic metrics due to test-set and optimizer variability.",

        "Results are reported using BLEU (Papineni et",
        "Denkowski and Lavie, 2010), and TER (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "In this section, we describe and measure (on the example systems just described) three extraneous variables that should be considered when evaluating a translation system.",
        "We quantify these variables in terms of standard deviation s, since it is expressed in the same units as the original metric.",
        "Refer to Table 1 for the statistics.",
        "Local optima effects sdev The first extraneous variable we discuss is the stochasticity of the optimizer.",
        "As discussed above, different optimization runs find different local maxima.",
        "The noise due to this variable can depend on many number of factors, including the number of random restarts used (in MERT), the number of features in a model, the number of references, the language pair, the portion of the search space visible to the optimizer (e.g. 10-best, 100-best, a lattice, a hypergraph), and the size of the tuning set.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no proxy to estimate this effect as with bootstrap resampling.",
        "To control for this variable, we must run the optimizer multiple times to estimate the spread it induces on the development set.",
        "Using the n optimizer samples, with mi as the translation quality measurement of the development set for the ith optimization run, and m is the average of all mis, we report the standard deviation over the tuning set as sdev:",
        "A high sdev value may indicate that the optimizer is struggling with local optima and changing hyperparameters (e.g. more random restarts in MERT) could improve system performance.",
        "Overfitting effects stest As with any optimizer, there is a danger that the optimal weights for a tuning set may not generalize well to unseen data (i.e., we overfit).",
        "For a randomized optimizer, this means that parameters can generalize to different degrees over multiple optimizer runs.",
        "We measure the spread induced by optimizer randomness on the test set metric score stest, as opposed to the overfitting effect in isolation.",
        "The computation of stest is identical to sdevexcept that the mis are the translation metrics calculated on the test set.",
        "In Table 1, we observe that stest > sdev, indicating that optimized parameters are likely not generalizing well.",
        "Test set selection sseï The final extraneous variable we consider is the selection of the test set itself.",
        "A good test set should be representative of the domain or language for which experimental evidence is being considered.",
        "However, with only a single test corpus, we may have unreliable results because of idiosyncrasies in the test set.",
        "This can be mitigated in two ways.",
        "First, replication of experiments by testing on multiple, non-overlapping test sets can eliminate it directly.",
        "Since this is not always practical (more test data may not be avail-abile), the widely-used bootstrap resampling method (§3) also controls for test set effects by resampling multiple \"virtual\" test sets from a single set, making it possible to infer distributional parameters such as the standard deviation of the translation metric over (very similar) test sets.",
        "Furthermore, this can be done for each of our optimizer samples.",
        "By averaging the bootstrap-estimated standard deviations over optimizer samples, we have a statistic that jointly quantifies the impact of test set effects and optimizer instability on a test set.",
        "We call this statistic ssel.",
        "Different values of this statistic can suggest methodological improvements.",
