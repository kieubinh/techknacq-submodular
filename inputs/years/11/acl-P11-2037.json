        "Empty elements in the syntactic analysis of a sentence are markers that show where a word or phrase might otherwise be expected to appear, but does not.",
        "They play an important role in understanding the grammatical relations in the sentence.",
        "For example, in the tree of Figure 2a, the first empty element (*) marks where John would be if believed were in the active voice {someone believed...), and the second empty element (*T*) marks where the man would be if who were not fronted {John was believed to admire who?",
        ").",
        "Empty elements exist in many languages and serve different purposes.",
        "In languages such as Chinese and Korean, where subjects and objects can be dropped to avoid duplication, empty elements are particularly important, as they indicate the position of dropped arguments.",
        "Figure 1 gives an example of a Chinese parse tree with empty elements.",
        "The first empty element (*pro*) marks the subject of the whole sentence, a pronoun inferable from context.",
        "The second empty element (*PR0*) marks the subject of the dependent VP {shishïfâlù tiâowéri).",
        "The Penn Treebanks (Marcus et al., 1993; Xue et al., 2005) contain detailed annotations of empty elements.",
        "Yet most parsing work based on these resources has ignored empty elements, with some",

        "Recently, empty-element recovery for Chinese has begun to receive attention: Yang and Xue (2010) treat it as classification problem, while Chung and Gildea (2010) pursue several approaches for both Korean and Chinese, and explore applications to machine translation.",
        "Our intuition motivating this work is that empty elements are an integral part of syntactic structure, and should be constructed jointly with it, not added in afterwards.",
        "Moreover, we expect empty-element recovery to improve as the parsing quality improves.",

      "heading": "2. Method",
      "text": [
        "Our method is fairly simple.",
        "We take a state-of-the-art parsing model, the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006), train it on data with explicit empty elements, and test it on word lattices that can nondeterminis-tically insert empty elements anywhere.",
        "The idea is that the state-splitting of the parsing model will enable it to learn where to expect empty elements to be inserted into the test sentences.",
        "Tree transformations Prior to training, we alter the annotation of empty elements so that the terminal label is a consistent symbol (e), the preterminal label is the type of the empty element, and -N0NE-is deleted (see Figure 2b).",
        "This simplifies the lattices because there is only one empty symbol, and helps the parsing model to learn dependencies between nonterminal labels and empty-category types because there is no intervening - NONE -.",
        "Then, following Schmid (2006), if a constituent contains an empty element that is linked to another node with label X, then we append /X to its label.",
        "If there is more than one empty element, we process them bottom-up (see Figure 2b).",
        "This helps the parser learn to expect where to find empty elements.",
        "In our experiments, we did this only for elements of type *T*.",
        "Finally, we train the Berkeley parser on the preprocessed training data.",
        "Lattice parsing Unlike the training data, the test data does not mark any empty elements.",
        "We allow the parser to produce empty elements by means of lattice-parsing (Chappelier et al., 1999), a generalization of CKY parsing allowing it to parse a word-lattice instead of a predetermined list of terminals.",
        "Lattice parsing adds a layer of flexibility to existing parsing technology, and allows parsing in situations where the yield of the tree is not known in advance.",
        "Lattice parsing originated in the speech",
        "'Unfortunately, not enough information was available to carry out comparison with the method of Chung and Gildea (2010).",
        "processing community (Hall, 2005; Chappelier et al., 1999), and was recently applied to the task of joint clitic-segmentation and syntactic-parsing in Hebrew (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2011) and Arabic (Green and Manning, 2010).",
        "Here, we use lattice parsing for empty-element recovery.",
        "We use a modified version of the Berkeley parser which allows handling lattices as input.",
        "The modification is fairly straightforward: Each lattice arc correspond to a lexical item.",
        "Lexical items are now indexed by their start and end states rather than by their sentence position, and the initialization procedure of the CKY chart is changed to allow lexical items of spans greater than 1.",
        "We then make the necessary adjustments to the parsing algorithm to support this change: trying rules involving preterminals even when the span is greater than 1, and not relying on span size for identifying lexical items.",
        "At test time, we first construct a lattice for each test sentence that allows 0, 1, or 2 empty symbols (e) between each pair of words or at the start/end of the sentence.",
        "Then we feed these lattices through our lattice parser to produce trees with empty elements.",
        "Finally, we reverse the transformations that had been applied to the training data."

        "Define a nonterminal node, for present purposes, to be a node which is neither a terminal nor preterminal node.",
        "The standard PARSEVAL metric (Black et al., 1991) counts labeled nonempty brackets: items are (X, i, j) for each nonempty nonterminal node, where X is its label and i, j are the start and end positions of its span.",
        "Yang and Xue (2010) simply count unlabeled empty elements: items are (i, i) for each empty element, where i is its position.",
        "If multiple empty elements occur at the same position, they only count the last one.",
        "The metric originally proposed by Johnson (2002) counts labeled empty brackets: items are (X/t, i, i) for each empty nonterminal node, where X is its label and t is the type of the empty element it dominates, but also (t, i, i) for each empty element not dominated by an empty nonterminal node.",
        "The following structure has an empty nonterminal dominating two empty elements:",
        "(SBAR-S/*T*,m) We tried to follow Schmid in a generic way: we collapse any vertical chain of empty nonterminals into a single nonterminal.",
        "In order to avoid problems associated with cases like this, we suggest a pair of simpler metrics.",
        "The first is to count labeled empty elements, i.e., items are (t, i, i) for each empty element, and the second, similar in spirit to SParseval (Roark et al., 2006), is to count all labeled brackets, i.e., items are (X, i, j) for each nonterminal node (whether nonempty or empty).",
