        "Automatic text summarization aims at reducing the amount of text the user has to read while preserving important contents, and has many applications in this age of digital information overload (Mani, 2001).",
        "In particular, query-oriented multi-document summarization is useful for helping the user satisfy his information need efficiently by gathering important pieces of information from multiple documents.",
        "In this study, we focus on extractive summarization (Liu and Liu, 2009), in particular, on sentence selection from a given set of source documents that contain relevant sentences.",
        "One well-known challenge in selecting sentences relevant to the information need is the vocabulary mismatch between the query (i.e. information need representation) and the candidate sentences.",
        "Hence, to enrich the information need representation, we build a co-occurrence graph to obtain words that augment the original query terms.",
        "We call this method Query Snowball.",
        "Another challenge in sentence selection for query-oriented multi-document summarization is how to avoid redundancy so that diverse pieces of information (i.e. nuggets (Voorhees, 2003)) can be covered.",
        "For penalizing redundancy across sentences, using single words as the basic unit may not always be appropriate, because different nuggets for a given information need often have many words in common.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of this word overlap problem from the NTCIR-8 ACLIA2 Japanese question answering test collection.",
        "Here, two gold-standard nuggets for the question \"Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) is a full-length animated movie from Japan.",
        "The user wants to know how it was received overseas.\"",
        "(in English translation) is shown.",
        "Each nugget represents a particular award that the movie received, and the two Japanese nugget strings have as many as three words in common: (review/critic)\", \"T – ^ (animation)\" and \"Ä (award).\"",
        "Thus, if we use single words as the basis for penalising redundancy in sentence selection, it would be difficult to cover both of these nuggets in the summary because of the word overlaps.",
        "We therefore use word pairs as the basic unit for computing sentence scores, and then formulate the summarization problem as a Maximum Cover Problem with Knapsack Constraints (MCKP) (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004; Takamura and Oku-mura, 2009a).",

        "Whereas, our method is unsupervised.",
        "Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) also formulated summarization as an MCKP, and they used two types of concepts in documents: single words and events (named entity pairs with a verb or a noun).",
        "While their work was for generic summarization, our method is designed specifically for query-oriented summarization.",
        "MMR-based methods are also popular for query-oriented summarization (Jagarlamudi et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2010b).",
        "Moreover, graph-based methods for summarization and sentence retrieval are popular (Otterbacher et al., 2005; Varadarajan and Hristidis, 2006;",
        "Bosma, 2009).",
        "Unlike existing graph-based methods, our method explicitly computes indirect relationships between the query and words in the documents to enrich the information need representation.",
        "To this end, our method utilizes within-sentence cooccurrences of words.",
        "The approach taken by Jagarlamudi et al.",
        "(2005) is similar to our proposed method in that it uses word co-occurrence and dependencies within sentences in order to measure relevance of words to the query.",
        "However, while their approach measures the generic relevance of each word based on Hyperspace Analogue to Language (Lund and Burgess, 1996) using an external corpus, our method measures the relevance of each word within the document contexts, and the query relevance scores are propagated recursively."

        "Section 3.1 introduces the Query Snowball (QSB) method which computes the query relevance score for each word.",
        "Then, Section 3.2 describes how we formulate the summarization problem based on word pairs.",
        "The basic idea behind QSB is to close the gap between the query (i.e. information need representation) and relevant sentences by enriching the information need representation based on cooccurrences.",
        "To this end, QSB computes a query relevance score for each word in the source documents as described below.",
        "Figure 2 shows the concept of QSB.",
        "Here, Q is the set of query terms (each represented by q), Rl is the set of words (rl) that co-occur with a query term in the same sentence, and R2 is the set of words (r2) that co-occur with a word from Rl, excluding those that are already in Rl.",
        "The imaginary root node at the center represents the information need, and we assume that the need is propagated through this graph, where edges represent within-sentence co-occurrences.",
        "Thus, to compute sentence scores, we use not only the query terms but also the words in Rl and R2.",
        "Our first clue for computing a word score is the query-independent importance of the word.",
        "We represent this base word score by sb(w) = \\og(N/ctf (w)) or sb(w) = 1og(N/n(w)), where ctf (w) is the total number of occurrences of w within the corpus and n(w) is the document frequency of w, and N is the total number of documents in the corpus.",
        "We will refer to these two versions as itf and idf, respectively.",
        "Our second clue is the weight propagated from the center of the co-occurence graph shown in Figure 1.",
        "Below, we describe how to compute the word scores for words in R1 and then those for words in R2.",
        "As Figure 2 suggests, the query relevance score for r1 G R1 is computed based not only on its base word score but also on the relationship between rl and q G Q.",
        "To be more specific, let freq(w,w') denote the within-sentence co-occurrence frequency for words w and w', and let distance(w, w') denote the minimum dependency distance between w and w': A dependency distance is the path length between nodes w and w' within a dependency parse tree; the minimum dependency distance is the shortest path length among all dependency parse trees of source-document sentences in which w and w' co-occur.",
        "Then, the query relevance score for r1 can be computed as:",
        "sb(q)sumQ",

        "SrleRl sr (r1).",
        "Having determined the query relevance score, the next step is to define the summary score.",
        "To this end, we use word pairs rather than individual words as the basic unit.",
        "This is because word pairs are more informative for discriminating across different pieces of information than single common words.",
        "(Recall the example mentioned in Section 1) Thus, the word pair score is simply defined as: sp(w1,w2) = sr(w1)sr(w2) and the summary score is computed as:",
        "where u is a textual unit, which in our case is a sentence.",
        "Our problem then is to select S to maximize Jqsbp (S).",
        "The above function based on word pairs is still submodular, and therefore we can apply a greedy approximate algorithm with performance guarantee as proposed in previous work (Khuller et al., 1999; Takamura and Okumura, 2009a).",
        "Let l(u) denote the length of u.",
        "Given a set of source documents D and a length limit L for a summary, Require: D, L where sumQ = ^qeQ sb(q).",
        "It can be observed that the query relevance score sr (r1) reflects the base word scores of both q and r1 , as well as the cooccurrence frequency freq(q, r1).",
        "Moreover, sr(r1) depends on distance (q, r1), the minimum dependency distance between q and r1, which reflects the strength of relationship between q and r1.",
        "This quantity is used in one of its denominators in Eq.1 as small values of distance(q, r1) imply a strong relationship between q and r1.",
        "The 1.0 in the denominator avoids division by zero.",
