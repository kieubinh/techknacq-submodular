        "Rating scales have been used for measuring human perception of various stimuli for a long time, at least since the early 20th century (Freyd, 1923).",
        "First used in psychology and psychophysics, they are now also common in a variety of other disciplines, including NLP.",
        "Discrete scales are the only type of scale commonly used for qualitative assessments of computer-generated language in NLP (e.g. in the DUC/TAC evaluation competitions).",
        "Continuous scales are commonly used in psychology and related fields, but are virtually unknown in NLP.",
        "While studies assessing the quality of individual scales and comparing different types of rating scales are common in psychology and related fields, such studies hardly exist in NLP, and so at present little is known about whether discrete scales are a suitable rating tool for NLP evaluation tasks, or whether continuous scales might provide a better alternative.",
        "A range of studies from sociology, psychophysiology, biometrics and other fields have compared discrete and continuous scales.",
        "Results tend to differ for different types of data.",
        "E.g., results from pain measurement show a continuous scale to outperform a discrete scale (ten Klooster et al., 2006).",
        "Other results (Svensson, 2000) from measuring students' ease of following lectures show a discrete scale to outperform a continuous scale.",
        "When measuring dyspnea, Lansing et al.",
        "(2003) found a hybrid scale to perform on a par with a discrete scale.",
        "Another consideration is the types of data produced by discrete and continuous scales.",
        "Parametric methods of statistical analysis, which are far more sensitive than non-parametric ones, are commonly applied to both discrete and continuous data.",
        "However, parametric methods make very strong assumptions about data, including that it is numerical and normally distributed (Siegel, 1957).",
        "If these assumptions are violated, then the significance of results is overestimated.",
        "Clearly, the numerical assumption does not hold for the categorial data produced by discrete scales, and it is unlikely to be normally distributed.",
        "Many researchers are happier to apply parametric methods to data from continuous scales, and some simply take it as read that such data is normally distributed (Lansing et al., 2003).",
        "Our aim in the present study was to systematically assess and compare discrete and continuous scales when used for the qualitative assessment of computer-generated language.",
        "We start with an overview of assessment scale types (Section 2).",
        "We describe the experiments we conducted (Section 4), the data we used in them (Section 3), and the properties we examined in our inter-scale comparisons (Section 5), before presenting our results",
        "Q1: Grammaticality The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read."

        "Our interchangeability results (Sections 6.1 and 6.2) indicate that the vas and vds-7 scales we have tested can substitute for each other in our present evaluation tasks in terms of the mean system scores they produce.",
        "Where we were able to measure validity (Section 6.6), both scales were shown to be similarly valid, predicting image identification accuracy figures from a separate experiment equally well.",
        "Stability (Section 6.3) was marginally better for vds-7 data, and Reliability (Sections 6.1 and 6.2) was better for vas data in the image description evaluations, but (mostly) better for vds-7 data in the weather forecast evaluations.",
        "Finally, the vas experiments found greater numbers of statistically significant differences between systems in 3 out of 4 cases (Section 6.5).",
        "Our own raters strongly prefer working with vas scales over vdss.",
        "This has also long been clear from the psychology literature (Svensson, 2000)), where raters are typically found to prefer vas scales over vdss which can be a \"constant source of vexation to the conscientious rater when he finds his judgments falling between the defined points\" (Champ-ney, 1941).",
        "Moreover, if a rater's judgment falls between two points on a vds then they must make the false choice between the two points just above and just below their actual judgment.",
        "In this case we know that the point they end up selecting is not an accurate measure of their judgment but rather just one of two equally accurate ones (one of which goes unrecorded).",
        "Our results establish (for our evaluation tasks) that vas scales, so far unproven for use in nlp, are at least as good as vdss, currently virtually the only scale in use in nlp.",
        "Combined with the fact that raters strongly prefer vass and that they are regarded as more amenable to parametric means of statistical analysis, this indicates that vas scales should be used more widely for nlp evaluation tasks.",
