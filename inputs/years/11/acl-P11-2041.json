        "In any given noun phrase (NP), an arbitrary number of nominal modifiers may be used.",
        "The order of these modifiers affects how natural or fluent a phrase sounds.",
        "Determining a natural ordering is a key task in the surface realization stage of a natural language generation (NLG) system, where the adjectives and other modifiers chosen to identify a referent must be ordered before a final string is produced.",
        "For example, consider the alternation between the phrases \"big red ball\" and \"red big ball\".",
        "The phrase \"big red ball\" provides a basic ordering of the words big and red.",
        "The reverse ordering, in \"red big ball\", sounds strange, a phrase that would only occur in marked situations.",
        "There is no consensus on the exact qualities that affect a modifier's position, but it is clear that some modifier orderings sound more natural than others, even if all are strictly speaking grammatical.",
        "Determining methods for ordering modifiers prenominally and investigating the factors underlying modifier ordering have been areas of considerable research, including work in natural language processing (Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou, 1999; Mal-ouf, 2000; Mitchell, 2009; Dunlop et al., 2010), linguistics (Whorf, 1945; Vendler, 1968), and psychology (Martin, 1969; Danks and Glucksberg, 1971).",
        "A central issue in work on modifier ordering is how to order modifiers that are unobserved during system development.",
        "English has upwards of 200,000 words, with over 50,000 words in the vocabulary of an educated adult (Aitchison, 2003).",
        "Up to a quarter of these words may be adjectives, which poses a significant problem for any system that attempts to categorize English adjectives in ways that are useful for an ordering task.",
        "Extensive in-context observation of adjectives and other modifiers is required to adequately characterize their behavior.",
        "Developers of automatic modifier ordering systems have thus spent considerable effort attempting to make reliable predictions despite sparse data, and have largely limited their systems to order modifier pairs instead of full modifier strings.",
        "Conventional wisdom has been that direct evidence methods such as simple n-gram modeling are insufficient for capturing such a complex and productive process.",
        "Recent approaches have therefore utilized increasingly sophisticated data-driven approaches.",
        "Most recently, Dunlop et al.",
        "(2010) used both discriminative and generative methods for estimating class-based language models with multiple-sequence alignments (MSA).",
        "Training on manually curated syntactic corpora, they showed excellent indomain performance relative to prior systems, and decent cross-domain generalization.",
        "However, following a purely supervised training approach for this task is unduly limiting and leads to conventional assumptions that are not borne out in practice, such as the inapplicability of simple ngram models.",
        "NP segmentation is one of the most reliable annotations that automatic parsers can now produce, and may be applied to essentially arbitrary amounts of unlabeled data.",
        "This yields orders-of-magnitude larger training sets, so that methods that are sensitive to sparse data and/or are domain specific can be trained on sufficient data.",
        "In this paper, we compare an n-gram language model and a hidden Markov model (HMM) constructed using expectation maximization (EM) with several recent ordering approaches, and demonstrate superior performance of the n-gram model across different domains, particularly as the training data size is scaled up.",
        "This paper presents two important results: 1) N-gram modeling performs better than previously believed for this task, and in fact surpasses current class-based systems.",
        "2) Automatic parsers can effectively provide essentially unlimited training data for learning modifier ordering preferences.",
        "Our results point the way to larger scale data-driven approaches to this and related tasks."

        "In one of the earliest automatic prenominal modifier ordering systems, Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) ordered pairs of modifiers, including adjectives, nouns (\"baseball field\"); gerunds, (\"running man\"); and participles (\"heated debate\").",
        "They described a direct evidence method, a transitivity method, and a clustering method for ordering these different kinds of modifiers, with the transitivity technique returning the highest accuracy of 90.67% on a medical text.",
        "However, when testing across domains, their accuracy dropped to 56%, not much higher than random guessing.",
        "Malouf (2000) continued this work, ordering prenominal adjective pairs in the BNC.",
        "He abandoned a bigram model, finding it achieved only 75.57% prediction accuracy, and instead pursued statistical and machine learning techniques that are more robust to data sparsity.",
        "Malouf achieved an accuracy of 91.85% by combining three systems.",
        "However, it is not clear whether the proposed ordering approaches extend to other kinds of modifiers, such as gerund verbs and nouns, and he did not present analysis of cross-domain generalization.",
        "Later, Mitchell (2009) focused on creating a class-based model for modifier ordering.",
        "Her system mapped each modifier to a class based on the frequency with which it occurs in different prenominal positions, and ordered unseen sequences based on these classes.",
        "Dunlop et al.",
        "(2010) used a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) approach to order modifiers, achieving the highest accuracy to date across different domains.",
