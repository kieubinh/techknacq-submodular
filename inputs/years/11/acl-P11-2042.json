        "Several empirical studies show that delivering information in the form of a dialogue, as opposed to monologue, can be particularly effective for education (Craig et al., 2000; Lee et al., 1998) and persuasion (Suzuki and Yamada, 2004).",
        "Information-delivering or expository dialogue was already employed by Plato to communicate his philosophy.",
        "It is used primarily to convey information and possibly also make an argument; this in contrast with dramatic dialogue which focuses on character development and narrative.",

        "Automatic generation of dialogue from text in monologue makes it possible to convert information into dialogue as and when needed.",
        "This paper describes the first data-oriented monologue-to-dialogue generation system which relies on the automatic mapping of the discourse relations underlying monologue to appropriate sequences of dialogue acts.",
        "The approach is data-oriented in that the mapping rules have been automatically derived from an annotated parallel monologue/dialogue corpus, rather than being handcrafted.",
