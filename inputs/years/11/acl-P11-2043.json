        "As such, it is not uncommon to want to gain access to this information when a visual display is not convenient or available (while driving or walking for example).",
        "One way of addressing this issue is to use audio displays and, in particular, have users listen to content read to them by a speech synthesizer instead of reading it themselves on a display.",
        "While listening to speech opens many opportunities, it also has issues which must be considered when using it as a replacement for reading.",

        "One key reason for the difference is that understanding is more important than grammar to a radio news writer.",
        "Furthermore, audio has different perceptual and information qualities compared to reading.",
        "For example, the use of the negations not and no should be limited since it is easy for listeners to miss that single utterance.",
        "Listener cannot relisten to a word; and, missing it has a huge impact on meaning.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of changing the writing-style of text to make it suitable to being listened to instead of being read.",
        "We start by researching the writing-style differences across text and audio in the linguistics and journalism literatures.",
        "Based on this study, we suggest a number of linguistic features that set the two styles apart.",
        "We validate these features statistically by analyzing their distributions in a corpus of parallel text-and audio-style documents; and experimentally through a style classification task.",

        "For example, Biber (1988) provides an exhaustive study of such variations.",

        "Most of these studies focus on the variations between the written and the spontaneous spoken language.",
        "Our focus is on the written language for audio, i.e. on a style that we hypothesize being somewhere between the formally written and spontaneous speech styles.",
        "Fang (1991) provides a pragmatic analysis and a side-by-side comparisons ofthe \"writing style differences in newspaper, radio, and television news\" as part of the instructions for journalist students learning to write for the three different mediums.",

        "In this work the goal is to optimize the style, and generation is one approach to that end (we plan addressing it for future work)",

        "Some general guidelines of audio style (Biber, 1988; Fang, 1991) include 1) the choice of simple words and short, declarative sentences with active voice preferred.",
        "2) Attribution precedes statements as it does in normal conversations.",
        "3) The subject should be as close to the predicate as feasible.",
        "4) Pronouns should be used with a lot of wariness.",
        "It is better to repeat a name, so that the listener will not have to pause or replay to recall.",

        "6) Dependent clauses should be avoided, especially at the start of a sentence.",
        "It is usually better to make a separate sentence of a dependent clause.",
        "7) Numbers should be approximated so that they can be understood.",
        "For example, the sum of $52,392 could be stated as more than fifty thousand dollars.",
        "8) Adjectives and adverbs should be used only when necessary for the meaning.",
        "In order to determine the differences between the text and audio styles, we needed textual data that ideally covered the same semantic content but was produced for the two different media.",
        "National Public Radio (NPR) has exactly this type of data.",
