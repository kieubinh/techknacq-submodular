        "Such monolingual alignment techniques are also frequently employed in systems for paraphrase generation, multi-document summarization, sentence fusion and question answering.",
        "Previous work (MacCartney et al., 2008) has presented a phrase-based monolingual aligner for NLI (MANLI) that has been shown to significantly outperform a token-based NLI aligner (Chambers et al., 2007) as well as popular alignment techniques borrowed from machine translation (Och and Ney, 2003; Liang et al., 2006).",
        "However, MANLI's use of a phrase-based alignment representation appears to pose a challenge to the decoding task, i.e. the task of recovering the highest-scoring alignment under some parameters.",
        "Consequently, MacCartney et al.",
        "(2008) employ a stochastic search algorithm to decode alignments approximately while remaining consistent with regard to phrase segmentation.",
        "In this paper, we propose an exact decoding technique for MANLI that retrieves the globally optimal alignment for a sentence pair given some parameters.",
        "Our approach is based on integer linear programming (ILP) and can leverage optimized general-purpose LP solvers to recover exact solutions.",
        "This strategy boosts decoding speed by an order of magnitude over stochastic search in our experiments.",
        "Additionally, we introduce hard syntactic constraints on alignments produced by the model, yielding better precision and a large increase in the number of perfect alignments produced over our evaluation corpus."

        "Initial experiments with a feature that considers the similarity of dependency heads of tokens in an edit (similar to MANLI's contextual features that look at preceding and following words) yielded some improvement over the baseline models; however, this did not perform as well as the simple constraints described above.",
        "Specific features that approximate soft variants of these constraints could also be devised but this was not explored here.",
