        "The goal of event extraction is to identify instances of a class of events in text.",
        "In addition to identifying the event itself, it also identifies all of the participants and attributes of each event; these are the entities that are involved in that event.",
        "The same event might be presented in various expressions, and an expression might represent different events in different contexts.",
        "Moreover, for each event type, the event participants and attributes may also appear in multiple forms and exemplars of the different forms may be required.",
        "Thus, event extraction is a difficult task and requires substantial training data.",
        "However, annotating events for training is a tedious task.",
        "Annotators need to read the whole sentence, possibly several sentences, to decide whether there is a specific event or not, and then need to identify the event participants (like Agent and Patient), and attributes (like place and time) to complete an event annotation.",
        "As a result, for event extraction tasks like MUC4, MUC6 (MUC 1995) and ACE2005, from one to several hundred annotated documents were needed.",
        "In this paper, we apply a novel self-training process on an existing state-of-the-art baseline system.",
        "Although traditional self-training on normal newswire does not work well for this specific task, we managed to use information retrieval (IR) to select a better corpus for bootstrapping.",
        "Also, taking advantage of properties of this corpus, cross-document inference is applied to obtain more \"informative\" probabilities.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply information retrieval and global inference to semi-supervised learning for event extraction."

        "2005).",

      "heading": "5. Our Approach",
      "text": [
        "In self-training, a classifier is first trained with a small amount of labeled data.",
        "The classifier is then used to classify the unlabeled data.",
        "Typically the most confident unlabeled points, together with their predicted labels, are added to the training set.",
        "The classifier is retrained and the procedure repeated.",
        "As a result, the criterion for selecting the most confident examples is critical to the effectiveness of self-training.",
        "To acquire confident samples, we need to first decide how to evaluate the confidence for each event.",
        "However, as an event contains one trigger and an arbitrary number of roles, a confident event might contain unconfident arguments.",
        "Thus, instead of taking the whole event, we select a partial event, containing one confident trigger and its most confident argument, to feed back to the training system.",
        "For each mention mi, its probability of filling a role r in a reportable event whose trigger is t is computed by:",
        "where PArg(mi) is the probability from the argument classifier, PRole(mi,r) is that from the role classifier, and PEvent(t) is that from the trigger classifier.",
        "In each iteration, we added the most confident <role, trigger> pairs to the training data, and retrained the system.",
        "However, traditional self-training does not perform very well (see our results in Table 3).",
        "The newly added samples do not improve the system performance; instead, its performance stays stable, and even gets worse after several iterations.",
        "We analyzed the data, and found that this is caused by two common problems of traditional self-training.",
        "First, the classifier uses its own predictions to train itself, and so a classification mistake can reinforce itself.",
        "This is particularly true for event extraction, due to its relatively poor performance, compared to other NLP tasks, like Named Entity Recognition, parsing, or part-of-speech tagging, where self-training has been more successful.",
        "Figure 1 shows that the precision using the original training data is not very good: while precision improves with increasing classifier threshold, about 1/3 of the roles are still incorrectly tagged at a threshold of 0.90.",
        "Another problem of self-training is that nothing \"novel\" is added because the most confident examples are those frequently seen in the training data and might not provide \"new\" information.",
        "Co-training is a form of self-training which can address this problem to some extent.",
        "However, it requires two views of the data, where each example is described using two different feature sets that provide different, complementary information.",
        "Ideally, the two views are conditionally independent and each view is sufficient (Zhu, 2008).",
        "Co-training has had some success in training (binary) semantic relation extractors for some relations, where the two views correspond to the arguments of the relation and the context of these arguments (Agichtein and Gravano 2000).",
        "However, it has had less success for event extraction because event arguments may participate in multiple events in a corpus and individual event instances may omit some arguments.",
        "5.2 Self-training on Information Retrieval Selected Corpus (STIR)",
        "To address the first problem (low precision of extracted events), we tried to select a corpus where the baseline system can tag the instances with greater confidence.",
        "(Ji and Grishman 2008) have observed that the events in a cluster of documents on the same topics as documents in the training corpus can be tagged more confidently.",
        "Thus, we believe that bootstrapping on a corpus of topic-related documents should perform better than a regular newswire corpus.",
        "We followed Ji and Grishman (2008)'s approach and used the INDRI retrieval system(Strohman et al., 2005) to obtain the top N related documents for each annotated document in the training corpus.",
        "The query is event-based to insure that related documents contain the same events.",
        "For each training document, we construct an INDRI query from the triggers and arguments.",
        "For example, for sentence (1) in section 2, we use the keywords \"killed', \"attacked', \"France\", \"Bob Cole\", and \"today\" to extract related documents.",
        "Only names and nominal arguments will be used; pronouns appearing as arguments are not included.",
        "For each argument we also add other names coreferential with the argument.",
        "Although bootstrapping on related documents can solve the problem of \"confidence\" to some extent, the \"novelty\" problem still remains: the top-ranked extracted events will be too similar to those in the training corpus.",
        "To address this problem, we propose to use a simple form of global inference based on the special characteristics of related-topic documents.",
        "Previous studies pointed out that information from wider scope, at the document or cross-document level, could provide non-local information to aid event extraction (Ji and Grishman 2008, Liao and Grishman 2010a).",
        "There are two common assumptions within a cluster of related documents (Ji and Grishman instance of a word triggers an event, other instances of the same word will trigger events of the same type.• Trigger Consistency Per Cluster: if one",
        "• Role Consistency Per Cluster: if one entity appears as an argument of multiple events of the same type in a cluster of related documents, it should be assigned the same role each time.",
        "Based on these assumptions, if a trigger/role has a low probability from the baseline system, but a high one from global inference, it means that the local context of this trigger/role tag is not frequently seen in the training data, but the tag is still confident.",
        "Thus, we can confidently add it to the training data and it can provide novel information which the samples confidently tagged by the baseline system cannot provide.",
        "To start, the baseline system extracts a set of events and estimates the probability that a particular instance of a word triggers an event of that type, and the probability that it takes a particular argument.",
        "The global inference process then begins by collecting all the confident triggers and arguments from a cluster of related documents.",
        "For each trigger word and event type, it records the highest probability (over all instances of that word in the cluster) that the word triggers an event of that type.",
        "For each argument, within-document and cross-document coreference are used to collect all instances of that entity; we then compute the maximum probability (over all instances) of that argument playing a particular role in a particular event type.",
        "These maxima will then be used in place of the locally-computed probabilities in computing the probability of each trigger-argument pair in the formula for PRoleOfTrigger given above.",
        "For example, if the entity \"Iraq\" is tagged confidently (probability > 0.9) as the \"Attacker\" role somewhere in a cluster, and there is another instance where from local information it is only tagged with 0.1 probability to be an \"Attacker\" role, we use probability of 0.9 for both instances.",
        "In this way, a trigger pair containing this argument is more likely to be added into the training data through bootstrapping, because we have global evidence that this role probability is high, although its local confidence is low.",
        "In this way, some novel trigger-argument pairs will be chosen, thus improving the baseline system."
