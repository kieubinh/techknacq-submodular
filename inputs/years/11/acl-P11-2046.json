        "Bootstrappers are prone to semantic drift, caused by selection of poor candidate terms or patterns (Curran et al., 2007), which can be reduced by semantically constraining the candidates.",
        "Multi-category bootstrappers, such as nomen (Yangar-ber et al., 2002) and wmeb (McIntosh and Curran, 2008), reduce semantic drift by extracting multiple categories simultaneously in competition.",
        "The inclusion of manually-crafted negative categories to multi-category bootstrappers achieves the best results, by clarifying the boundaries between categories (Yangarber et al., 2002).",
        "For example, female names are often bootstrapped with the negative categories flowers (e.g. Rose, Iris) and gem stones (e.g. Ruby, Pearl) (Curran et al., 2007).",
        "Unfortunately, negative categories are difficult to design, introducing a substantial amount of human expertise into an otherwise unsupervised framework.",
        "McIntosh (2010) made some progress towards automatically learning useful negative categories during bootstrapping.",
        "In this work we identify an unsupervised source of semantic constraints inspired by the Coupled Pattern Learner (cpl, Carlson et al.",
        "(2010)).",
        "In cpl, relation bootstrapping is coupled with lexicon bootstrapping in order to control semantic drift in the target relation's arguments.",
        "Semantic constraints on categories and relations are manually crafted in cpl.",
        "For example, a candidate of the relation Is-CeoOf will only be extracted if its arguments can be extracted into the ceo and company lexicons and a ceo is constrained to not be a celebrity or politician.",
        "Negative examples such as Is-CeoOf(Sergey Brin, Google) are also introduced to clarify boundary conditions.",
        "cpl employs a large number of these manually-crafted constraints to improve precision at the expense of recall (only 18 Is-CeoOf instances were extracted).",
        "In our approach, we exploit open relation bootstrapping to minimise semantic drift, without any manual seeding of relations or predefined category lexicon combinations.",
        "Orthogonal to these seeded and constraint-based methods is the relation-independent Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) paradigm.",
        "OpenIE systems, such as TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007), define neither lexicon categories nor predefined relationships.",
        "They extract relation tuples by exploiting broad syntactic patterns that are likely to indicate relations.",
        "This enables the extraction of interesting and unanticipated relations from text.",
        "However these patterns are often too broad, resulting in the extraction of tuples that do not represent relations at all.",

        "Rather than relying on manually-crafted category and relation constraints, Relation Guided Bootstrapping (rgb) automatically detects, seeds and bootstraps open relations between the target categories.",
        "These relations anchor categories together, e.g. Is-CeoOf and IsFounderOf anchor person and company, preventing them from drifting into other categories.",
        "Relations can also identify new terms.",
        "We demonstrate that this relation guidance effectively reduces semantic drift, with performance approaching manually-crafted constraints.",
        "rgb can be applied to any multi-category bootstrapper, and in these experiments we use wmeb (McIntosh and Curran, 2008), as shown in Figure 1. rgb alternates between two phases of wmeb, one for terms and the other for relations, with a one-off relation discovery phase in between.",
        "Term Extraction",
        "The first stage of rgb follows the term extraction process of wmeb.",
        "Each category is initialised by a set of hand-picked seed terms.",
        "In each iteration, a category's terms are used to identify candidate patterns that can match the terms in the text.",
        "Semantic drift is reduced by forcing the categories to be mutually exclusive (i.e. patterns must be nominated by only one category).",
        "The remaining patterns are ranked according to reliability and relevance, and the top-n patterns are then added to the pattern set.",
        "The reliability of a pattern for a given category is the number of extracted terms in the category's lexicon that match the pattern.",

        "In rgb, the relations and their seeds are automatically identified in relation discovery.",

        "Each ordered pair of categories (C1,C2) = R1)2is checked for open (not pre-defined) relations between Ci and C2.",
        "This check removes all pairs of terms, tuples (t1,t2) G C1 x C2 with freq(t1 ,t2) < 5 and a cooccurrence score x(t1; t2) < 0.",

        "If multiple relations are found, e.g. R1;2 and R2;3, these are bootstrapped simultaneously, competing with each other for tuples and relation patterns.",
        "Mutual exclusion constraints between the relations are also forced.",
        "In each iteration, a relation's set of tuples is used to identify candidate relation patterns, as for term extraction.",
        "The top-n non-overlapping patterns are extracted for each relation, and are used to identify the top-n candidate tuples.",
        "The tuples are scored similarly to the relation patterns, and any tuple identified by multiple relations is excluded.",
        "For tuple extraction, a relation R12 is constrained to only consider candidates where either t1 or t2 has previously been extracted into C1 or C2, respectively.",
        "To extract a candidate tuple with an unknown term, the term must also be a valid candidate of its associated category.",
        "That is, the term must match at least one pattern assigned to the category and not match patterns assigned to another category.",
        "This type-checking anchors relations to the categories they link together, limiting their drift into other relations.",
        "It also provides guided term growth in the categories they link.",
