        "Relation Extraction (RE) from text as defined in ACE (Doddington et al., 2004) concerns the extraction of relationships between two entities.",
        "This is typically carried out by applying supervised learning, e.g. (Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) by using a handlabeled corpus.",
        "Although, the resulting models are far more accurate than unsupervised approaches, they suffer from the following drawbacks: (i) they require labeled data, which is usually costly to produce; (ii) they are typically domain-dependent as different domains involve different relations; and (iii), even in case the relations do not change, they result biased toward the text feature distributions of the training domain.",
        "The drawbacks above would be alleviated if data from several different domains and relationships were available.",
        "A form of weakly supervision, specifically named distant supervision (DS) when applied to Wikipedia, e.g. (Banko et al., 2007; Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2010) has been recently developed to meet the requirement above.",
        "The main idea is to exploit (i) relation repositories, e.g. the Infobox, x, of Wikipedia to define a set of relation types RT(x) and (ii) the text in the page associated with x to produce the training sentences, which are supposed to express instances of RT(x).",
        "Previous work has shown that selecting the sentences containing the entities targeted by a given relation is enough accurate (Banko et al., 2007; Mintz et al., 2009) to provide reliable training data.",
        "However, only (Hoffmann et al., 2010) used DS to define extractors that are supposed to detect all the relation instances from a given input text.",
        "This is a harder test for the applicability of DS but, at the same time, the resulting extractor is very valuable: it can find rare relation instances that might be expressed in only one document.",
        "For example, the relation President(Barrack Obama, United States) can be extracted from thousands of documents thus there is a large chance of acquiring it.",
        "In contrast, Pres-ident(Eneko Agirre, SIGLEX) is probably expressed in very few documents, increasing the complexity for obtaining it.",
        "In this paper, we extend DS by (i) considering relations from semantic repositories different from Wikipedia, i.e. YAGO, and (2) using training instances derived from any Wikipedia document.",
        "This allows for (i) potentially obtaining training data for many more relation types, defined in different sources; (ii) meaningfully enlarging the size of the DS data since the relation examples can be extracted from any Wikipedia document .",
        "Additionally, by following previous work, we define state-of-the-art RE models based on kernel methods (KM) applied to syntactic/semantic structures.",
        "We use tree and sequence kernels that can exploit structural information and interdependencies among labels.",
        "Experiments show that our models are flexible and robust to Web documents as we achieve the interesting F1 of 74.29% on 52 YAGO relations.",
        "This is even more appreciable if we approximately compare with the previous result on RE using DS, i.e. 61% (Hoffmann et al., 2010).",
        "Although the experiment setting is different from ours, the improvement of about 13 absolute percent points demonstrates the quality of our model.",
        "Finally, we also provide a system for extracting relations from any text.",
        "This required the definition of a robust Named Entity Recognizer (NER), which is also trained on weakly supervised Wikipedia data.",
        "Consequently, our end-to-end RE system is applicable to any document.",
        "This is another major improvement on previous work.",
        "The satisfactory RE F1 of 67% for 52 Wikipedia relations suggests that our model is also successfully applicable in real scenarios.",
        "RE generally relates to the extraction of relational facts, or world knowledge from the Web (Yates, 2009).",
        "To identify semantic relations using machine learning, three learning settings have been applied, namely supervised methods, e.g. (Zelenko",
        "Algorithm 2.1: acquire_labeled_data() DS = 0",
        "YAGO(R) : Instances of Relation R for each {Wikipedia article : W) G Freebase ' S – set of sentences from W for each s GS",
        "such approaches can be applied to few relation types thus distant supervised learning (Mintz et al., 2009) was introduced to tackle such problem.",
        "Another solution proposed in (Riedel et al., 2010) was to adapt models trained in one domain to other text domains."

        "We use YAGO, a large knowledge base of entities and relations, and Freebase, a collection of Wikipedia articles.",
        "Our procedure uses entities and facts from YAGO to provide relation instances.",
        "For each pair of entities that appears in some YAGO relation, we retrieve all the sentences of the Freebase documents that contain such entities.",
        "YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) is a huge semantic knowledge base derived from WordNet and Wikipedia.",
        "It comprises more than 2 million entities (like persons, organizations, cities, etc.)",
        "and 20 million facts connecting these entities.",
        "These include the taxonomic Is-A hierarchy as well as semantic relations between entities.",
        "We use the YAGO version of 2008-w40-2 with a manually confirmed accuracy of 95% for 99 relations.",

        "For our experiments, we used 100,000 articles.",
        "Out of them, only 28,074 articles contain at least one relation for a total of 68,429 of relation instances.",

        "Temporal and Numerical Expression",
        "Wikipedia articles are marked with entities like Person or Organization but not with dates or numerical attributes.",
        "This prevents to extract interesting relations between entities and dates, e.g. John F. Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917 or between entities and numerical attributes, e.g.",
        "The novel Gone with the wind has 1037 pages.",
        "Thus we designed 18 regular expressions to extract dates and other 25 to extract numerical attributes, which range from integer number to ordinal number, percentage, monetary, speed, height, weight, area, time, and ISBN.",
        "Distant supervision (DS) for RE is based on the following assumption: (i) a sentence is connected in some way to a database of relations and (ii) such sentence contains the pair of entities participating in a target relation; (iii) then it is likely that such sentence expresses the relation.",
        "In traditional DS the point (i) is implemented by the Infobox, which is connected to the sentences by a proximity relation (same page of the sentence).",
        "In our extended DS, we relax (i) by allowing for the use of an external DB of relations such as YAGO and any document of Freebase (a collection of Wikipedia documents).",
        "The alignment between YAGO and Freebase is implemented by the Wikipedia page link: for example the link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JamesJCameron refers to the entity James.Cameron.",
        "We use an efficient procedure formally described in Alg.",
        "2.1: for each Wikipedia article in Freebase, we scan all of its NEs.",
        "Then, for each pair of entities seen in the sentence, we query YAGO to retrieve the relation instance connecting these entities.",
        "Note that a simplified version of our approach is the following: for any YAGO relation instance, scan all the sentences of all Wikipedia articles to test point (ii).",
        "Unfortunately, this procedure is impossible in practice due to millions of relation instances in YAGO and millions of Wikipedia articles in Free-base, i.e. an order of magnitude of 10 iterations."
