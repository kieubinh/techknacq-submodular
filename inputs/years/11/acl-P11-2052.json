        "As data-driven techniques tackle more and more complex natural language processing tasks, it becomes increasingly unfeasible to use complete, accurate, hand-annotated data on a large scale for training models in all languages.",
        "One approach to addressing this problem is to develop methods that automatically generate annotated data by transferring annotations in parallel corpora from languages for which this information is available to languages for which these data are not available (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Fung et al., 2007; Padó and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Previous work on the cross-lingual transfer of semantic annotations (Pado, 2007; Basili et al., 2009) has produced annotations of good quality for test sets that were carefully selected based on semantic ontologies on the source and target side.",
        "It has been suggested that these annotations could be used to train semantic role labellers (Basili et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we generate high-quality broad-coverage semantic annotations using an automatic approach that does not rely on a semantic ontology for the target language.",
        "Furthermore, to our knowledge, we report the first results on using joint syntactic-semantic learning to improve the quality of the semantic annotations from automatic cross-lingual transfer.",
        "Results on correlations between syntax and semantics found in previous work (Merlo and van der Plas, 2009; Lang and Lapata, 2010) have led us to make use of the available syntactic annotations on the target language.",
        "We use the semantic annotations resulting from cross-lingual transfer combined with syntactic annotations to train a joint syntactic-semantic parser for the target language, which, in turn, re-annotates the corpus (See Figure 1).",
        "We show that the semantic annotations produced by this parser are of higher quality than the data on which it was trained.",
        "Given our goal of producing broad-coverage annotations in a setting based on an aligned corpus, our choices of formal representation and of labelling scheme differ from previous work (Pado, 2007; Basili et al., 2009).",
        "We choose a dependency representation both for the syntax and semantics because relations are expressed as direct arcs between words.",

        "Data-driven induction of semantic annotation based on parallel corpora is a well-defined and feasible task, and it has been argued to be particularly suitable to semantic role label annotation because cross-lingual parallelism improves as one moves to more abstract linguistic levels of representation.",

        "(2002; 2005) find that direct syntactic dependency parallelism between English and Spanish concerns 37% of dependency links, Padó (2007) reports an upper-bound mapping correspondence calculated on gold data of 88% F-measure for individual semantic roles, and 69% F-measure for whole scenario-like semantic frames.",
        "Recently, Wu and Fung (2009a; 2009b) also show that semantic roles help in statistical machine translation, capitalising on a study of the correspondence between English and Chinese which indicates that 84% of roles transfer directly, for PropBank-style annotations.",
        "These results indicate high correspondence across languages at a shallow semantic level.",
        "Based on these results, our transfer of semantic annotations from English sentences to their French translations is based on a very strong mapping hypothesis, adapted from the Direct Correspondence Assumption for syntactic dependency trees by Hwa et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Direct Semantic Transfer (DST) For any pair of sentences E and F that are translations of each other, we transfer the semantic relationship R(xE, Ve) to R(xF, yF) if and only if there exists a word-alignment between xE and xF and between yE and Vf , and we transfer the semantic property P(xE) to P(xF) if and only if there exists a word-alignment between x E and xF.",
        "The relationships which we transfer are semantic role dependencies and the properties are predicate senses.",
        "We introduce one constraint to the direct semantic transfer.",
        "Because the semantic annotations in the target language are limited to verbal predicates, we only transfer predicates to words the syntactic parser has tagged as a verb.",
        "As reported by Hwa et al.",
        "(2005), the direct correspondence assumption is a strong hypothesis that is useful to trigger a projection process, but will not work correctly for several cases.",
        "We used a filter to remove obviously incomplete annotations.",
        "We know from the annotation guidelines used to annotate the French gold sentences that all verbs, except modals and realisations of the verb être, should receive a predicate label.",

        "However, previous work in machine translation leads us to believe that transferring the correlations between syntax and semantics across languages would be problematic due to argument-structure divergences (Dorr, 1994).",
        "For example, the English verb like and the French verb plaire do not share correlations between syntax and semantics.",
        "The verb like takes an A0 subject and an A1 direct object, whereas the verb plaire licences an A1 subject and an A0 indirect object.",
        "We therefore transfer semantic roles cross-lingually based only on lexical alignments and add syntactic information after transfer.",
        "In Figure 1, we see that cross-lingual transfer takes place at the semantic level, a level that is more abstract and known to port relatively well across languages, while the correlations with syntax, that are known to diverge cross-lingually, are learnt on the target language only.",
