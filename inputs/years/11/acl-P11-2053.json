        "The problem of determining and inferring the sense of a word on the basis of its context has been the subject of quite a bit of research.",
        "Earlier investigations have mainly focused on the disambiguation of word senses from information contained in the context, e.g. Schütze (1998) or on the induction of word senses (Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "Only recently, the field has added a diachronic dimension to its investigations and has moved towards the computational detection of sense development over time (Sagi et al., 2009; Cook and Stevenson, 2010), thereby complementing theoretical investigations in historical linguistics with information gained from large corpora.",
        "These approaches have concentrated on measuring general changes in the meaning of a word (e.g., narrowing or pejoration), whereas in this paper we deal with cases where words acquire a new sense by extending their contexts to other domains.",
        "For the scope of this investigation we restrict ourselves to cases of semantic change in English even though the methodology is generally language independent.",
        "Our choice is on the one hand motivated by the extensive knowledge available on semantic change in English.",
        "On the other hand, our choice was driven by the availability of large corpora for English.",
        "In particular, we used the New York Times Annotated Corpus.",
        "Given the variety and the amount of text available, we are able to track changes from 1987 until 2007 in 1.8 million newspaper articles.",
        "In order to be able to explore our approach in a fruitful manner, we decided to concentrate on words which have acquired a new dimension of use due to the introduction of computing and the internet, e.g., to browse, to surf, bookmark.",
        "In particular, the Netscape Navigator was introduced in 1994 and our data show that this does indeed correlate with a change in use of these words.",
        "Our approach combines methods from the fields of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics (Thomas and Cook, 2005; Keim et al., 2010) with unsupervised techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "This combination provides a novel instrument which allows for tracking the diachronic development of word meaning by visualizing the contexts in which the words occur.",
        "Our overall aim is not to replace linguistic analysis in this field with an automatic method, but to guide research by generating new hypotheses about the development of semantic change."

        "The computational modeling of word senses is based on the assumption that the meaning of a word can be inferred from the words in its immediate context (\"context words\").",
        "Research in this area mainly focuses on two related tasks: Word Sense Disambiguation (wsd) and Word Sense Induction (wsi).",
        "The goal of wsd is to classify occurrences of pol-ysemous words according to manually predefined senses.",
        "One popular method for performing such a classification is Latent Semantic Analysis (lsa) (Deerwester et al., 1990), with other methods also suitable for the task (see Navigli (2009) for an extensive survey).",
        "The aim of wsi is to learn word senses from text corpora without having a predefined number of senses.",
        "This goal is more difficult to achieve, as it is not clear beforehand how many senses should be extracted and how a sense could be described in an abstract way.",
        "Recently, however, Brody and Lapata (2009) have shown that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (lda) (Blei et al., 2003) can be successfully applied to perform word sense induction from small word contexts.",
        "The original idea of lsa and lda is to learn \"topics\" from documents, whereas in our scenario word contexts rather than documents are used, i.e., a small number of words before and after the word under investigation (bag of words).",
        "Sagi et al.",
        "(2009) have demonstrated that broadening and narrowing of word senses can be tracked over time by applying l sa to small word contexts in diachronic corpora.",
        "In addition, we will use lda, which has proven even more reliable in the course of our investigations.",
        "In general, the aim of our paper is to go beyond the approach of Sagi et al.",
        "(2009) and analyze semantic change in more detail.",
        "Ideally, a starting point of change is found and the development over time can be tracked, paired with a quantitative comparison of prevailing senses.",
        "We therefore suggest to visualize word contexts in order to gain a better understanding of diachronic developments and also generate hypotheses for further investigations."

        "The advantage of these terms is that the cause of change can be located precisely in time.",

        "When dealing with a complex phenomenon such as semantic change, one has to be aware of the limitations of an automatic approach in order to be able to draw the right conclusions from its results.",
        "The first results of the case studies presented in this paper show that LDA is useful for distinguishing different word senses on the basis of word contexts and performs better than LSA for this task.",
        "Further, it has been demonstrated by exemplary cases that the emergence of a new word sense can be detected by our new methodology",
        "One of the main reasons for an interactive visualization approach is the possibility of being able to detect conspicuous patterns at-a-glance, yet at the same time being able to delve into the details of the data by zooming in on the occurrences of particular words in their contexts.",
        "This makes it possible to compensate for one of the major disadvantages of generative and vector space models, namely their functioning as \"black boxes\" whose results cannot be tracked easily.",
        "The biggest problem in dealing with a corpus-based method of detecting meaning change is the availability of suitable corpora.",
        "First, computing semantic information on the basis of contexts requires a large amount of data in order to be able to infer reliable results.",
        "Second, the words in the context from which the meanings will be distinguished should be both semantically and orthographically stable over time so that comparisons between different stages in the development of the language can be made.",
        "Unfortunately, both requirements are not always met.",
        "On the one hand words do change their meaning, after all this is what the present study is all about.",
        "However, we assume that the meanings in a certain context window are stable enough to infer reliable results provided it is possible that the forms of the same words in different periods can be linked.",
        "This of course limits the applicability of the approach to smaller time ranges due to changes in the phonetic form of words.",
        "Moreover, in particular for older periods of the language, different variants for the same word, either due to sound changes or different (or rather no) spelling conventions, abound.",
        "For now, we circumvent this problem by testing our tool on corpora where the drawbacks of historical texts are less severe but at the same time interesting developments can be detected to prove our approach correct.",
        "For future research, we want to test our methodology on a broader range of terms, texts and languages and develop novel interactive visualizations to aid investigations in two ways.",
        "As a first aim, the user should be allowed to check the validity and quality of the visualizations by experimenting with parameter settings and inspecting their outcome.",
