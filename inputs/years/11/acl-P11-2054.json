        "We present an NLP system that classifies the assertion type of medical problems in clinical notes used for the Fourth i2b2/VA Challenge.",
        "Our classifier uses a variety of linguistic features, including lexical, syntactic, lexico-syntactic, and contextual features.",
        "To overcome an extremely unbalanced distribution of assertion types in the data set, we focused our efforts on adding features specifically to improve the performance of minority classes.",
        "As a result, our system reached 94.17% micro-averaged and 79.76% macro-averaged F1-measures, and showed substantial recall gains on the minority classes."

        "Since the beginning of the new millennium, there has been a growing need in the medical community for Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to provide computable information from narrative text and enable improved data quality and decision-making.",
        "Many NLP researchers working with clinical text (i.e. documents in the electronic health record) are also realizing that the transition to machine learning techniques from traditional rule-based methods can lead to more efficient ways to process increasingly large collections of clinical narratives.",
        "As evidence of this transition, nearly all of the best-performing systems in the Fourth i2b2/VA Challenge (Uzuner and DuVall, 2010) used machine learning methods.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the medical assertions classification task.",
        "Given a medical problem mentioned in a clinical text, an assertion classifier must look at the context and choose the status of how the medical problem pertains to the patient by assigning one of six labels: present, absent, hypothetical, possible, conditional, or not associated with the patient.",
        "The corpus for this task consists of discharge summaries from Partners HealthCare (Boston, MA) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, as well as discharge summaries and progress notes from the University of Pittsburgh Medical",
        "Center (Pittsburgh, PA).",
        "Our system performed well in the i2b2/VA Challenge, achieving a micro-averaged F1-measure of 93.01%.",
        "However, two of the assertion categories (present and absent) accounted for nearly 90% of the instances in the data set, while the other four classes were relatively infrequent.",
        "When we analyzed our results, we saw that our performance on the four minority classes was weak (e.g., recall on the conditional class was 22.22%).",
        "Even though the minority classes are not common, they are extremely important to identify accurately (e.g., a medical problem not associated with the patient should not be assigned to the patient).",
        "In this paper, we present our efforts to reduce the performance gap between the dominant assertion classes and the minority classes.",
        "We made three types of changes to address this issue: we changed the multi-class learning strategy, filtered the training data to remove redundancy, and added new features specifically designed to increase recall on the minority classes.",
        "We compare the performance of our new classifier with our original i2b2/VA Challenge classifier and show that it performs substantially better on the minority classes, while increasing overall performance as well."

        "Lexical Features: The medical term itself, the three words preceding it, and the three words following it.",
        "We used the LVG annotator in Lexical Tools (McCray et al., 1994) to normalize each word (e.g., with respect to case and tense).",
        "Syntactic Features: Part-of-speech tags of the three words preceding the medical term and the three words following it.",
        "Lexico-Syntactic Features: We also defined features representing words corresponding to several parts-of-speech in the same sentence as the medical term.",
        "The value for each feature is the normalized word string.",
        "To mitigate the limited window size of lexical features, we defined one feature each for the nearest preceding and following adjective, adverb, preposition, and verb, and one additional preceding adjective and preposition and one additional following verb and preposition.",
        "Contextual Features: We incorporated the ConText algorithm (Chapman et al., 2001) to detect four contextual properties in the sentence: absent (negation), hypothetical, historical, and not associated with the patient.",
        "The algorithm assigns one of three values to each feature: true, false, or possible.",
        "We also created one feature to represent the Section Header with a string value normalized using (Meystre and Haug, 2005).",
        "The system only using contextual features gave reasonable results: F1-measure overall 89.96%, present 91.39%, absent 86.58%, and hypothetical 72.13%.",
        "Feature Pruning: We created an UNKNOWN feature value to cover rarely seen feature values.",
        "Lexical feature values that had frequency < 4 and other feature values that had frequency < 2 were all encoded as UNKNOWNs.",
        "After the i2b2/VA Challenge submission, we added the following new features, specifically to try to improve performance on the minority classes:",
        "Lexical Features: We created a second set of lexical features that were case-insensitive.",
        "We also created three additional binary features for each lexical feature.",
        "We computed the average tf-idf score for the words comprising the medical term itself, the average tf-idf score for the three words to its left, and the average tf-idf score for the three words to its right.",
        "Each binary feature has a value of true if the average tf-idf score is smaller than a threshold (e.g. 0.5 for the medical term itself), or false otherwise.",
        "Finally, we created another binary feature that is true if the medical term contains a word with a negative prefix.",
        "Lexico-Syntactic Features: We defined two binary features that check for the presence of a comma or question mark adjacent to the medical term.",
        "We also defined features for the nearest preceding and following modal verb and wh-adverb (e.g., where and when).",
        "Finally, we reduced the scope of these features from the entire sentence to a context window of size eight around the medical term.",
        "Sentence Features: We created two binary features to represent whether a sentence is long (> 50 words) or short (<= 50 words), and whether the sentence contains more than 5 punctuation marks, primarily to identify sentences containing lists.",
        "Context Features: We created a second set of ConText algorithm properties for negation restricted to the six word context window around the medical term.",
        "According to the assertion annotation guidelines, problems associated with allergies were defined as conditional.",
        "So we added one binary feature that is true if the section headers contain terms related to allergies (e.g., \"Medication allergies\").",
        "Feature Pruning: We changed the pruning strategy to use document frequency values instead of corpus frequency for the lexical features, and used document frequency > 1 for normalized words and > 2 for case-insensitive words as thresholds.",
        "We also removed 57 redundant instances from the training set.",
        "Finally, when a medical term coexists with other medical terms (problem concepts) in the same sentence, the others are excluded from the lexical and lexico-syntactic features.",
        "Our original i2b2 system used a 1-vs-1 classification strategy.",
        "This approach creates one classifier for each possible pair of labels (e.g., one classifier decides whether an instance is present vs. absent, another decides whether it is present vs. conditional, etc.).",
        "All of the classifiers are applied to a new instance and the label for the instance is determined by summing the votes of the classifiers.",
        "However, Huang et al.",
        "(2001) reported that this approach did not work well for data sets that had highly unbalanced class probabilities.",
        "Therefore we experimented with an alternative 1-vs-all classification strategy.",
        "In this approach, we",
        "se.",
        "create one classifier for each type of label using instances with that label as positive instances and instances with any other label as negative instances.",
        "The final class label is assigned by choosing the class that was assigned with the highest confidence value (i.e., the classifier's score).",
        "Evaluation",
        "After changing to the 1-vs-all multi-class strategy and adding the new feature set, we evaluated our improved system on the test data and compared its performance with our original system.",
        "The training set includes 349 clinical notes, with 11,967 assertions of medical problems.",
        "The test set includes 477 texts with 18,550 assertions.",
        "These assertions were distributed as follows (Table 1):",
        "For the i2b2/VA Challenge submission, our system showed good performance, with 93.01% micro-averaged F1-measure.",
        "However, the macro F1-measure was much lower because our recall on the minority classes was weak.",
        "For example, most of the conditional test cases were misclassified as present.",
        "Table 2 shows the comparative results of the two systems (named 'i2b2' for the i2b2/VA Challenge system, and 'new' for our improved system).",
        "The micro-averaged F1-measure of our new system is 94.17%, which now outperforms the best official score reported for the 2010 i2b2 challenge (which was 93.62%).",
        "The macro-averaged F1-measure increased from 76.38% to 79.76% because performance on the minority classes improved.",
        "The F1-measure improved in all classes, but we saw especially large improvements with the possible class (+6.32%) and the conditional class (+8.58%).",
        "Although the improvement on the dominant classes was limited in absolute terms (+.79% F1-measure for present and +1.86% for absent), the relative reduction in error rate was greater than for the minority classes: -29.25% reduction in error rate for absent assertions, -17.32% for present assertions, and -13.3% for conditional assertions.",
