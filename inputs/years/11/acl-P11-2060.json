        "The construction of an annotated corpus involves a lot of work performed by large groups.",

        "This is probably the most used dependency corpus, since English is the most popular language among the researchers.",
        "Still we are able to find a considerable amount of errors in it.",

        "They are able to find a similar number of errors in different corpora, however, as our investigation shows, the overlap between our results is quite small and the approaches are rather complementary."
