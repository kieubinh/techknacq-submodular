        "Arabic has a rich and complex morphology.",
        "In addition to being both templatic (root/pattern) and con-catenative (stems/affixes/clitics), Arabic's optional diacritics add to the degree of word ambiguity (Habash, 2010).",
        "This paper focuses on two specific issues of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) nominal morphology involving the features of gender and number only: the discrepancy between morphological form and function and the complex system of morpho-syntactic agreement.",
        "Arabic nominals (i.e. nouns, proper nouns and adjectives) and verbs inflect for gender: masculine (M) and feminine (F), and for number: singular (S), dual (D) and plural (P).",
        "These features are typically realized using a small set of suffixes that uniquely convey gender and number combinations: +<p (MS), 5+ +h (FS), jI+ +An (MD), jb-+ +tAn (FD), jj+ +wn (MP), and oI+ +At (FP).",
        "For example, the adjective ^aL mAhr 'clever' has the following forms among others: ^aL mAhr (MS), SyhL mAhrîi (FS), j j^aL mAhrwn (MP), and o[yhl« mAhrAt (FP).",
        "For a sizable minority of words, these features are expressed templatically, i.e., through pattern change, coupled with some singular suffix.",
        "A typical example of this phenomenon is the class of broken",
        "symbols: ' c, A I, A I, A I, w J , y £<j , h 5,5?",
        "<j.",
        "j+ +w (nominative construct state).",
        "plurals.",
        "In such cases, the form of the morphology (singular suffix) is inconsistent with the word's functional number (plural).",
        "For example, the word ^jl'kAtb (MS) 'writer/scribe' has two broken plurals: olÜTktAb (Mp ) and ijlTktbh (Mp).",
        "In addition to broken plurals, Arabic has a class of broken feminines in which the feminine singular form is derived templatically: e.g., the adjective 'red'",
        "jA ÂHmr ( Mf ) and c J* HmrA' ( ff ).",
        "Verbs and nominal duals do not display this discrepancy.",
        "Ad hoc cases of form-function discrepancy also exist, e.g., <LJA xlyfh (Mf ) 'caliph', jLu HAml (ffl) 'pregnant', and Jjjja Tryq 'road' which can be",
        "both M and F ( ).",
        "Arabic also has some non-countable collective plurals that behave as singulars morpho-syntactically although they may translate to English as plurals, e.g., jf tmr (M^) 'palm dates'.",
        "Arabic gender and number features participate in morpho-syntactic agreement within specific constructions such as nouns and their adjectives and verbs and their subjects.",
        "Arabic agreement rules are more complex than the simple matching rules found in languages such as French or Spanish (Holes, 2004; Habash, 2010).",
        "First, Arabic adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender and number except for plural irrational (non-human) nouns, which always take feminine singular adjectives.",
        "For example, the two plural words öUU» TAlbAt (FpR) 'students' and oU^* mktbAt 'libraries' (Fpj) take the adjective 'new' as o'-^.-**- jdydAt (JpN) and 'o-Xj-Xa jdydh ( FfN ), respectively.",
        "Rationality is a morpho-lexical feature.",
        "There are nouns that are semantically rational/human but not morpho-syntactically, e.g., oj*-\" sçwb (Mpj) 'nations/peoples' takes a feminine singular adjective.Second, verbs and their nominal subjects have the same rules as nouns and their adjectives, except that,",

        "sAfr (MjfN) AlrjAl (MpR).",
        "Third, number quantification has unique rules (Dada, 2007), e.g., numbers over 10 always take a singular noun, while numbers 3 to 10 take a plural noun and inversely agree with the noun's functional gender.",
        "Compare, for instance, oUU» with o>U* xmsh (FfN) TlAb (MrpR) 'five [male] students' and £JU» jj^P- xmswn (JprN) TAlbh (FfR) 'lit.",

        "The example is in a dependency representation based on the Columbia Arabic Treebank (Catib) (Habash and Roth, 2009).",
        "Finally, although the rules described above are generally followed, there are numerous exceptions that can typically be explained as some form of figure of speech involving elision or overridden rationality/irrationality.",
        "For example, the word j%>- jys (MMi) 'army' can take the rational MP agreement in an elided reference to its members.",
