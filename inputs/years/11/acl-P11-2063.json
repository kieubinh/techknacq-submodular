        "While there are many types of parsers available, all of them rely on a lexicon of words, whether syntactic like Comlex, enriched with semantics like WordNet, or derived from tagged corpora like the Penn Treebank (Macleod et al., 1994; Fellbaum, 1998; Marcus et al., 199^)63",
        "However, many of these resources have gaps that the others can fill in.",
        "WordNet, for example, only contains open-class words, and it lacks the extensive subcategorization frame and agreement information present in Comlex (Miller et al., 1993; Macleod et al., 1994).",
        "Comlex, while syntactically deep, doesn't have tagged usage data or semantic groupings (Macleod et al., 1994).",
        "Furthermore, many of these resources do not map to one another or have restricted licenses.",
        "The goal of our research was to create a syntactic lexicon, like Comlex, that unified multiple existing open-source resources including Felbaum's (1998) WordNet, Kipper et al's (2000) VerbNet, and Wiktionary.",
        "Furthermore, we wanted it to have direct links to frame semantic representations via the open-license OpenCyc knowledge base.",
        "The result was NU-LEX a lexicon of over 100,000 words that has the coverage of WordNet, is enriched with tense information from automatically screen-scrapping Wiktionary, and contains VerbNet subcategorization frames.",
        "This lexicon was incorporated into a bottom-up chart parser, EANLU, that connects the words to Cyc representations (Tomai & Forbus 2009).",
        "Each entry is represented by Cyc assertions and contains syntactic information as a set of features consistent with previous feature systems (Allen 1995; Macleod et al., 1994)."

        "Comlex is handmade and contains 38,000 lemmas.",
        "It represents words in feature value lists that contain lexical data such as part of speech, agreement information, and syntactic frame participation (Macleod et al., 1994).",
        "Furthermore, Comlex has extensive mappings to, and uses representations compatible with, multiple lexical resources (Macleod et al., 1994).",
        "Attempts to automatically create syntactic lexical resources from tagged corpora have also been successful.",
        "The Penn Treebank is one such resource (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "These resources have been successfully incorporated into statistical parsers such as the Apple Pie parser (Sekine & Grishman, 1995).",
        "Unfortunately, they still require extensive labor to do the annotations.",
        "NU-LEX is different in that it is automatically compiled without relying on a hand-annotated corpus.",
        "Instead, it combines crowd-sourced data, Wiktionary, with existing lexical resources.",
        "This research was possible because of the existing lexical resources WordNet and VerbNet.",
        "WordNet is a virtual thesaurus that groups words together by semantic similarity into synsets representing a lexical concept (Felbaum, 1998).",
        "VerbNet is an extension of Levin's (1993) verb class research.",
        "It represents verb meaning in a class hierarchy where each verb in a class has similar semantic meanings and identical syntactic usages (Kipper et al., 2000).",
        "Since its creation it has been expanded to include classes not in Levin's original research (Kipper et al., 2006).",
        "These two resources have already been mapped, which facilitated applying subcategorization frames to WordNet verbs.",
        "Furthermore, WordNet has existing links to OpenCyc.",
        "OpenCyc is an open-source version of the ResearchCyc knowledge base that contains hierarchical definitional information but is missing much of the lower level instantiated facts and linguistic knowledge of ResearchCyc (Matuszek et al., 2006).",
        "Previous research by McFate (2010) used these links and VerbNet hierarchies to create verb semantic frames which are used in EANLU, the parser NU-LEX was tested on."
