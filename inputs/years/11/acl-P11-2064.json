        "Colour is a vital component in the successful delivery of information, whether it is in marketing a commercial product (Sable and Akcay, 2010), in web design (Meier, 1988; Pribadi et al., 1990), or in information visualization (Christ, 1975; Card et al., 1999).",
        "Since real-world concepts have associations with certain colour categories (for example, danger with red, and softness with pink), complementing linguistic and non-linguistic information withappro-priate colours has a number of benefits, including: (1) strengthening the message (improving semantic coherence), (2) easing cognitive load on the receiver, (3) conveying the message quickly, and (4) evoking the desired emotional response.",
        "Consider, for example, the use of red in stop signs.",
        "Drivers are able to recognize the sign faster, and it evokes a subliminal emotion pertaining to possible danger, which is entirely appropriate in the context.",
        "The use of red to show areas of high crime rate in a visualization is another example of good use of colour to draw emotional response.",
        "On the other hand, improper use of colour can be more detrimental to understanding than using no colour (Marcus, 1982; Meier, 1988).",
        "A word has strong association with a colour when the colour is a salient feature of the concept the word refers to, or because the word is related to a such a concept.",
        "Many concept-colour associations, such as swan with white and vegetables with green, involve physical entities.",
        "However, even abstract notions and emotions may have colour associations (honesty-white, danger-red, joy-yellow, anger-red).",
        "Further, many associations are culture-specific (Gage, 1969; Chen, 2005).",
        "For example, prosperity is associated with red in much of Asia.",
        "Unfortunately, there exists no lexicon with any significant coverage that captures these concept-colour associations, and a number of questions remain unanswered, such as, the extent to which humans agree with each other on these associations, and whether physical concepts are more likely to have a colour association than abstract ones.",
        "In this paper, we describe how we created a large word-colour lexicon by crowdsourcing with effective quality control measures (Section 3), as well as experiments and analyses to show that:",
        "• More than 30% of the terms have a strong colour association (Sections 4).",
        "• About 33% of thesaurus categories have strong colour associations (Section 5).",
        "• Abstract terms have colour associations almost as often as physical entities do (Section 6).",
        "• There is a strong association between different emotions and colours (Section 7).",
        "Thus, using the right colours can not only improve semantic coherence, but also inspire the desired emotional response."
