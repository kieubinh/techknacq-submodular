        "However, there have been several other systems using the reordering-as-preprocessing approach, and they have met with mixed success.",

        "We have systematically varied several aspects of the Howlett and Dras (2010) system and reproduced results close to both papers, plus a full range in between.",
        "Our results show that choices in the PSMT system can completely erode potential gains of the reordering preprocessing step, with the largest effect due to simple choice of data.",
        "We have shown that a lack of overall improvement using reordering-as-preprocessing need not be due to the usual suspects, language pair and reordering process.",
        "Significantly, our oracle experiments show that in all cases the reordering system does produce better translations for some sentences.",
        "We conclude that effort is best directed at determining for which sentences the improvement will appear."
