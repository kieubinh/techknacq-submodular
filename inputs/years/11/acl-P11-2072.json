        "In this paper, we discuss some of the practical issues that arise from decoding general SCFGs that are seldom discussed in the literature.",
        "We focus on parsing grammars extracted using the method put forth by Galley et al.",
        "(2004), but the solutions to these issues are applicable to other general forms of SCFG with many nonterminals.",
        "The GHKM grammar extraction method produces a large number of unary rules.",
        "Unary rules are the rules that have exactly one nonterminal and no terminals on the source side.",
        "They may be problematic for decoders since they may create cycles, which are unary production chains that contain duplicated dynamic programming states.",
        "In later sections, we discuss why unary rules are problematic and investigate two possible solutions.",
        "GHKM grammars often have rules with many right-hand-side nonterminals and require binarization to ensure 0(n) time parsing.",
        "However, bina-rization creates a large number of virtual nonterminals.",
        "We discuss the challenges of, and possible solutions to, issues arising from having a large number of virtual nonterminals.",
        "We also compare bina-rizing the grammar with filtering rules according to scope, a concept introduced by Hopkins and Lang-mead (2010).",
        "By explicitly considering the effect of anchoring terminals on input sentences, scope-3 rules encompass a much larger set of rules than Chomsky normal form but they can still be parsed in 0(n) time.",
        "Unlike phrase-based machine translation, GHKM grammars are less flexible in how they can segment sentence pairs into phrases because they are restricted not only by alignments between words in sentence pairs, but also by target-side parse trees.",
        "In general, GHKM grammars suffer more from data sparsity than phrasal rules.",
        "To alleviate this issue, we discuss adding glue rules and phrases extracted using methods commonly used in phrase-based machine translation."

        "However, unary rules can be problematic:",
        "• Unary production cycles corrupt the translation hypergraph generated by the decoder.",
        "A hyper-graph containing a unary cycle cannot be topologically sorted.",
        "Many algorithms for parameter tuning and coarse-to-fine decoding, such as the inside-outside algorithm and cube-pruning, cannot be run in the presence of unary cycles.",
        "• The existence of many unary rules of the form \"NP – > NP, the NP\" quickly fills a pruning bin with guesses of English words to insert without any source-side lexical evidence.",
        "The most obvious way of eliminating problematic unary rules would be converting grammars into Chomsky normal form.",
        "However, this may result in bloated grammars.",
        "In this section, we present two different ways to handle unary rules.",
        "The first involves modifying the grammar extraction method, and the second involves modifying the decoder.",

        "We modify the definition of a frontier node in the following way.",
        "We label frontier nodes in the English parse tree, and examine the Chinese span each frontier node covers.",
        "If a frontier node covers the same span as the frontier node that immediately dominates it, then the dominated node is no longer considered a frontier.",

        "The naïve way to detect unary cycles is backtracking on a unary chain to see if a newly generated item has been generated before.",
        "The running time of this is constrained only by the number of possible items in a chart span.",
        "In practice, however, this is often not a problem: if all unary derivations have positive costs and a priority queue is used to expand unary derivations, only the best K unary items will be generated, where K is the pruning constant.",
        "• Ban negative cost unary rules",
        "When tuning feature weights, an optimizer may try feature weights that may give negative costs to unary productions.",

        "Synchronous binarization (Zhang et al., 2006) is an effective method to reduce SCFG parsing complexity and allow early language model integration.",

        "Alternatively, we can filter rules that have more than scope-3 to parse in 0(n) time with unbinarized rules.",
        "This requires Earley (Earley, 1970) style parsing, which does implicit binarization at decoding time.",
        "Scope-filtering may filter out unnecessarily long rules that may never be applied, but it may also throw out rules with useful contextual information.",
        "In addition, scope-filtering does not accommodate early language model state integration.",
        "We compare the two with an experiment.",
        "For the rest of the section, we discuss issues created by virtual nonterminals.",
        "One aspect of grammar binarization that is rarely mentioned is how to assign probabilities to binarized grammar rules.",
        "The naïve solution is to assign probability one to any rule whose left-hand side is a virtual nonterminal.",
        "This maintains the original model.",
        "However, it is generally not fair to put chart items of virtual nonterminals and those of regular nonterminals in the same bin, because virtual items have artificially low costs.",
        "One possible solution is adding a heuristic to push up the cost of virtual items for fair comparison.",
        "For our experiments, we use an outside estimate as a heuristic for a virtual item.",
        "Consider the following rule binarization (only the source side shown):",
        "A – > BCD is the orginal rule and – log(p) is the cost of the rule.",
        "In decoding time, when a chart item is generated from the binarized rule V – >■ BC, we add – log(p) to its total cost as an optimistic estimate of the cost to build the original unbinarized rule.",
        "The heuristic is used only for pruning purposes, and it does not change the real cost.",
        "The idea is similar to A* parsing (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "One complication is that a binarized rule can arise from multiple different unbinarized rules.",
        "In this case, we pick the lowest cost among the unbinarized rules as the heuristic.",
        "Another approach for handling virtual nonterminals would be giving virtual items separate bins and avoiding pruning them at all.",
