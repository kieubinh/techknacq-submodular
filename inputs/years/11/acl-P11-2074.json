        "Significant progress has been made in statistical machine translation (SMT) in recent years.",
        "Among all the proposed approaches, the phrase-based method (Koehn et al., 2003) has become the widely adopted one in SMT due to its capability of capturing local context information from adjacent words.",
        "There exists significant amount of work focused on the improvement of translation performance with better features.",
        "The feature set could be either small (at the order of 10), or large (up to millions).",
        "For example, the system described in (Koehn et al., 2003) is a widely known one using small number of features in a maximum-entropy (log-linear) model (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "The features include phrase translation probabilities, lexical probabilities, number of phrases, and language model scores, etc.",
        "The feature weights are usually optimized with minimum error rate training (MERT) as in (Och, 2003).",
        "Besides the MERT-based feature weight optimization, there exist other alternative discriminative training methods for MT, such as in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Liang et al., 2006; Blunsom et al., 2008).",
        "However, scalability is a challenge for these approaches, where all possible translations of each training example need to be searched, which is computationally expensive.",
        "In (Chiang et al., 2009), there are 11K syntactic features proposed for a hierarchical phrase-based system.",
        "The feature weights are trained with the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) efficiently on a forest of translations from a development set.",
        "Even though significant improvement has been obtained compared to the baseline that has small number of features, it is hard to apply the same approach to millions offeatures due to the data sparseness issue, since the development set is usually small.",
        "In (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007), a maximum entropy (ME) model is proposed, which utilizes millions of features.",
        "All the feature weights are trained with a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach on the full training corpus.",
        "It achieves significantly better performance than a normal phrase-based system.",
        "However, the estimation of feature weights has no direct connection with the final translation performance.",
        "In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework, a discriminative mixture model, to bridge the gap between the ML training and the discriminative training for SMT.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly review the ME baseline of this work.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce the discriminative mixture model that combines various types of features.",
        "In Section 4, we present experimental results on a large-scale Arabic-English MT task with focuses on feature combination, alignment combination, and domain adaptation, respectively.",
        "Section 5 concludes the paper."

        "The model has the following form, where s is a source phrase, and t is a target phrase.",
        "j is the jump distance from the previously translated source word to the current source word.",
        "During training j can vary widely due to automatic word alignment in the parallel corpus.",
        "To limit the sparseness created by long jumps, j is capped to a window of source words (-5 to 5 words) around the last translated source word.",
        "Jumps outside the window are treated as being to the edge of the window.",
        "In Eq.",
        "(1), p0 is a prior distribution, Z is a normalizing term, and fi(t,j, s) are the features of the model, each being a binary question asked about the source, distortion, and target information.",

        "Now we introduce the discriminative mixture model.",

        "Let the probability of target phrase and jump given certain source phrase for cluster k be where Zk is a normalizing factor for cluster k.",

        "It can be rewritten in the log domain as",
        "The individual feature weights Aki for the i-th feature in cluster k are estimated in the maximum-entropy framework as in the baseline model.",
        "However, the mixture weights wk can be optimized directly towards the translation evaluation metric, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), along with other usual costs (e.g. language model scores) on a development set.",
        "Note that the number of mixture components is relatively small (less than 10) compared to millions of features in baseline.",
        "Hence the optimization can be conducted easily to generate reliable mixture weights for decoding with MERT (Och, 2003) or other optimization algorithms, such as the Simplex Armijo Downhill algorithm proposed in (Zhao and Chen, 2009).",
        "Given the proposed mixture model, how to split the feature space into multiple regions becomes crucial.",
        "In order to surpass the baseline model, where all features can be viewed as existing in a single mixture component, the separated mixture components should be complementary to each other.",
        "In this work, we explore three different ways of partitions, based on either feature types, word alignment types, or the domain of training data.",
        "In the feature-type-based partition, we split the ME features into 8 categories:",
        "• F1: Lexical features that examine source word, target word and jump;",
        "• F2: Lexical context features that examine source word, target word, the previous source word, the next source word and jump;",
        "• F3: Lexical context features that examine source word, target word, the previous source word, the previous target word and jump;",
        "• F4: Lexical context features that examine source word, target word, the previous or next source word and jump;",
        "• F5: Segmentation features based on morphological analysis that examine source morphemes, target word and jump;",
        "• F6: Part-of-speech (POS) features that examine the source and target POS tags and their neighbors, along with target word and jump;",
        "• F7: Source parse tree features that collect the information from the parse labels of the source words and their siblings in the parse trees, along with target word and jump;",
        "• F8: Coverage features that examine the coverage status of the source words to the left and to the right.",
        "They fire only if the left source is open (untranslated) or the right source is closed.",
        "All the features falling in the same feature category/cluster are tied to each other to share the same mixture weights at the upper level as in Eq.",
        "(3).",
        "Besides the feature-type-based clustering, we can also divide the feature space based on word alignment types, such as supervised alignment versus unsupervised alignment (to be described in the experiment section).",
        "For each type of word alignment, we build a mixture component with millions of ME features.",
        "On the task of domain adaptation, we can also split the training data based on their domain/resources, with each mixture component representing a specific domain."

        "For each sentence in the training, three types of word alignments are created: maximum entropy alignment (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005), GIZA++ alignment (Och and 1996).",
        "Our tuning and test sets are extracted from the GALE DEV10 Newswire set, with no overlap between tuning and test.",
        "There are 1063 sentences (168 documents) in the tuning set, and 1089 sentences (168 documents) in the test set.",
        "Both sets have one reference translation for each sentence.",
        "Instead of using all the training data, we sample the training corpus based on the tuning/test set to train the systems more efficiently.",

        "A 5-gram language model is trained from the English Gigaword corpus and the English portion ofthe parallel corpus used in the translation model training.",

        "With the log-linear mixture model, we obtained 0.6 gain compared to the baseline.",
        "Since there are exactly the same number of features in the baseline and mixture model, the better performance is due to two facts: separate training of the feature weights A within each mixture component; the discriminative training of mixture weights w. The first one allows better parameter estimation given the number of features in each mixture component is much less than that in the baseline.",
        "The second factor connects the mixture weighting to the final translation performance directly.",
        "In the baseline, all feature weights are trained together solely under the maximum likelihood criterion, with no differentiation of the various types of features in terms of their contribution to the translation performance.",
