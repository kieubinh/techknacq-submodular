        "Phrase-based statistical machine translation is useful for translating between languages with similar word orders.",
        "However, it has problems with longdistance reordering when translating between languages with different word orders, such as Japanese-English.",
        "These problems are especially crucial when translating long sentences, such as patent sentences, because many combinations of word orders cause high computational costs and low translation quality.",
        "In order to address these problems, various methods which use syntactic information have been proposed.",
        "These include methods where source sentences are divided into syntactic chunks or clauses and the translations are merged later (Koehn and",
        "Knight, 2003; Sudoh et al., 2010), methods where syntactic constraints or penalties for reordering are added to a decoder (Yamamoto et al., 2008; Cherry, 2008; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Xiong et al., 2010), and methods where source sentences are reordered into a similar word order as the target language in advance (Katz-Brown and Collins, 2008; Isozaki et al., 2010).",
        "However, these methods did not use document-level context to constrain reorderings.",
        "Document-level context is often available in real-life situations.",

        "In order to address the aforementioned problem, we propose a method for specifying phrases in a source sentence which are assumed to be translated as single blocks using document-level context.",
        "We call these phrases \"coherent phrases\".",
        "When translating a document, for example a patent specification, we first extract coherent phrase candidates from the document.",
        "Then, when translating each sentence in the document, we set zones which cover the coherent phrase candidates and restrict reorderings which violate the zones.",
        "As mentioned in the previous section, specifying coherent phrases is difficult when using only one source sentence.",
        "However, we have observed that document-level context can be a clue for specifying coherent phrases.",
        "In a patent specification, for example, noun phrases which indicate parts of the invention are very important noun phrases.",
        "In previous example, \"% 1 0 WW MC IHPeH W W M 1 2 \" is a part of the invention.",
        "Since this is not language dependent, in other words, this noun phrase is always a part of the invention in any other language, this noun phrase should be translated as a single block in every language.",
        "In this way, important phrases in patent documents are assumed to be coherent phrases.",
        "We therefore treat the problem of specifying coherent phrases as a problem of specifying important phrases, and we use these phrases as constraints on reorderings.",
        "The details of the proposed method are described below.",
        "We propose the following method for finding coherent phrases in patent sentences.",
        "First, we extract coherent phrase candidates from a patent document.",
        "Next, the candidates are ranked by a criterion which reflects the document-level context.",
        "Then, we specify coherent phrases using the rankings.",
        "In this method, using document-level context is critically important because we cannot rank the candidates without it.",
        "Coherent phrase candidates are extracted from a context document, a document that contains a source sentence.",
        "We extract all noun phrases as coherent phrase candidates since most noun phrases can be translated as single blocks in other languages (Koehn and Knight, 2003).",
        "These noun phrases include nested noun phrases.",
        "The candidates which have been extracted are nested and have different lengths.",
        "A naive method cannot rank these candidates properly.",
        "For example, ranking by frequency cannot pick up an important phrase which has a long length, yet, ranking by length may give a long but unimportant phrase a high rank.",
        "In order to select the appropriate coherent phrases, measurements which give high rank to phrases with high termhood are needed.",
        "As one such measurement, we use C-value (Frantzi and Anani-adou, 1996).",
        "C-value is a measurement of automatic term recognition and is suitable for extracting important phrases from nested candidates.",
        "The C-value of a phrase p is expressed in the following equation:",
        "l(p) is the length of a phrase p, n(p) is the frequency of p in a document, t(p) is the total frequency of phrases which contain p as a subphrase, c(p) is the number of those phrases.",
        "Since phrases which have a large C-value frequently occur in a context document, these phrases are considered to be a significant unit, i.e., a part of the invention, and to be coherent phrases.",
        "Given a source sentence, we find coherent phrase candidates in the sentence in order to set zones for reordering constraints.",
        "If a coherent phrase candidate is found in the source sentence, the phrase is regarded a coherent phrase and annotated with a zone tag, which will be mentioned in the next section.",
        "We check the coherent phrase candidates in the sentence in descending C-value order, and stop when the C-value goes below a certain threshold.",
        "Nested zones are allowed, unless their zones conflict with pre-existing zones.",
        "We then give the zone-tagged sentence, an example is shown in Table 1, as a decoder input.",
        "In decoding, reorderings which violate zones, such as the baseline output in Table 1, are restricted and we get a more appropriate translation, such as the proposed output in Table 1.",
        "We use the Moses decoder (Koehn et al., 2007; Koehn and Haddow, 2009), which can specify reordering constraints using <zone> and </zone> tags.",

        "This dataset contains a training set of 3 million sentence pairs, a development set of 2,000 sentence pairs, and a test set of 1,251 (J-E) and 1,119 (E-J) sentence pairs.",

        "In the proposed method, reordering constraints were defined with a context document.",
        "For J-E translation, we used the CaboCha parser (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) to analyze the context document.",
        "As coherent phrase candidates, we extracted all subtrees whose heads are noun.",
        "For E-J translation, we used the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) and extracted all noun phrases, labeled \"NP\", as coherent phrase candidates.",
        "The parsers are used only when extracting coherent phrase candidates.",
        "When specifying zones for each source sentence, strings which match the coherent phrase candidates are defined to be zones.",
        "Therefore, the proposed method is robust against parsing errors.",
        "We tried various thresholds of the C-value and selected the value that yielded the highest BLEU score for the development set.",
        "In this method, reordering constraints were defined without a context document.",
        "For J-E translation, we converted the dependency trees of source sentences processed by the CaboCha parser into bracketed trees and used these as reordering constraints.",
        "For E-J translation, we used all of the noun phrases detected by the Charniak parser as reordering constraints.",
        "The experiment results are shown in Table 2.",
        "For evaluation, we used the case-insensitive BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) with a single reference.",
        "In both directions, our proposed method yielded the highest BLEU scores.",
        "The absolute improvement over the baseline (dl = – 1) was 1.20% in J-E translation and 1.41% in E-J translation.",
        "According to the bootstrap resampling test (Koehn, 2004), the improvement over the baseline was statistically significant (p < 0.01) in both directions.",
        "When compared to the method without context, the absolute improvement was 1.54% in J-E and 0.25% in E-J.",
        "The improvement over the baseline was statistically significant (p < 0.01) in J-E and almost significant (p < 0.1) in E-J.",
        "These results show that the proposed method using document-level context is effective in specifying reordering constraints.",
        "Moreover, as shown in Table 3, although zone setting without context is failed if source sentences have parsing errors, the proposed method can set zones appropriately using document-level context.",
