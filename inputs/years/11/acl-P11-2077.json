        "Language Models (LMs) are key components in most statistical machine translation systems, where they play a crucial role in promoting output fluency.",

        "Generative factored language models (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) represent each token by multiple factors such as part-of-speech, lemma and surface form-and capture linguistic patterns in the target language at the appropriate level of abstraction.",
        "Instead of estimating likelihood, discriminative language models (Roark et al., 2004; Roark et al., 2007; Li and Khudanpur, 2008) directly model fluency by casting the task as a binary classification or a ranking problem.",
        "The method we propose combines advantages of both directions mentioned above.",
        "We use factored features to capture linguistic patterns and discriminative learning for directly modeling fluency.",
        "We define highly overlapping and correlated factored features, and extend a robust learning algorithm to handle them and cope with a high rate of label noise.",
        "For discriminatively learning language models, we use confidence-weighted learning (Dredze et al., 2008), an extension of the perceptron-based online learning used in previous work on discriminative language models.",
        "Furthermore, we extend confidence-weighted learning with soft margin to handle the case where training data labels are noisy, as is typically the case in discriminative language modeling.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce factored features for discriminative language models.",
        "Section 3 presents confidence-weighted learning.",
        "Section 4 describes its extension for the case where training data are noisy.",
        "We present empirical results in Section 5 and differentiate our approach from previous ones in Section 6.",

        "Factored features are n-gram features where each component in the n-gram can be characterized by different linguistic dimensions of words such as surface, lemma, part of speech (POS).",
        "Each of these dimensions is conventionally referred to as a factor.",
        "An example of a factored feature is \"pick PRON up\", where PRON is the part of speech (POS) tag for pronouns.",
        "Appropriately weighted, this feature can capture the fact that in English that pattern is often fluent.",
        "Compared to traditional surface n-gram features like \"pick her up\", \"pick me up\" etc., the feature \"pick PRON up\" generalizes the pattern better.",
        "On the other hand, this feature is more precise than the corresponding POS n-gram feature \"VERB PRON PREP\" since the latter also promotes undesirable patterns such as \"pick PRON off\" and \"go PRON in\".",
        "So, constructing features with components from different abstraction levels allows better capturing linguistic patterns.",
        "In this study, we use tri-gram factored features to learn a discriminative language model for English, where each token is characterized by three factors including surface, POS, and extended POS.",
        "In the last factor, some POS tags are further refined (Table 1).",
        "In other words, we will use all possible trigrams where each element is either a surface from, a POS, or an extended POS."

        "Online learning algorithms scale well to large datasets, and are thus well adapted to discriminative language modeling.",
        "On the other hand, the perceptron and Passive Aggressive (PA) algorithms(Crammer et al., 2006) can be ill-suited for learning tasks where there is a long tail of rare significant features as in the case of language modeling.",
        "Motivated by this, we adopt a simplified version of the CW algorithm of (Dredze et al., 2008).",
        "We introduce a score , based on the number of times a feature has been obseerved in training, indicating how confident the algorithm is in the current estimate wifor the weight of feature i.",
        "Instead of equally changing all feature weights upon a mistake, the algorithm now changes more aggressively the weights it is less confident in.",

        "The algorithm thus updates weights aggressively enough to correctly rank the current pair of instances (i.e. satisfying the constraint), and preserves as much knowledge learned so far as possible (i.e. minimizing the weighted difference to wt).",
        "In the special case when At = I this is the update of the Passive-Aggressive algorithm of (Crammer et al., 2006).",
        "By introducing multiple confidence scores with the diagonal matrix A, we take into account the fact that feature weights that the algorithm has more confidence in (because it has learned these weights from more training instances) contribute more to the knowledge the algorithm has accumulated so far than feature weights it has less confidence in.",
        "A change in the former is more risky than a change with the same magnitude on the latter.",

        "Moreover, the discriminative framework is appropriate for handling highly overlapping features, which is the case of factored features.",
        "While we did not experiment with this, a natural extension consists in using all n-grams up to a certain order, thus providing back-off features and enabling the use of higher-order n-grams.",
        "Second, for learning factored language models discrim-inatively, we adopt a simple confidence-weighted algorithm, limiting the problem of poor estimation of weights for rare features.",
        "Finally, we extended confidence-weighted learning with soft margins to handle the case where labels of training data are noisy.",
        "This is typically the case in discriminative language modeling, where labels are obtained only indirectly.",
