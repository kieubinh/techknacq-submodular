        "In most systems, the LM is independent of the test input, i.e. fixed n-gram probabilities determine the likelihood of all translation hypotheses, regardless of the source input.",

        "The weighting scheme relies on a measure of cross-lingual similarity evaluated by projecting sparse vector representations of the target sentences into the space of source sentences using a transformation matrix computed from the bilingual parallel data.",

        "Those source terms of the M-dimensional vector û will be emphasized that most frequently co-occur with the target terms in v. In other words, û can be interpreted as a \"bag-of-words\" translation of v.",

        "In order to alleviate the runtime complexity of on-line LM biasing, we present an efficient method for obtaining biased counts of an arbitrary target n-gram t. We define ct = \\c\\,..., cf] to be the indicator-count vector where cl is the unbiased count of t in target sentence j.",
