        "The translation quality of statistical phrase-based systems (Koehn et al., 2003) is heavily dependent on the quality of the translation and reordering models generated during the phrase extraction algorithm (Ling et al., 2010).",
        "The basic phrase extraction algorithm uses word alignment information to constraint the possible phrases that can be extracted.",
        "It has been shown that better alignment quality generally leads to better results (Ganchev et al., 2008).",
        "However the relationship between the word alignment quality and the results is not straightforward, and it was shown in (Vilar et al., 2006) that better alignments in terms of F-measure do not always lead to better translation quality.",
        "The fact that spurious word alignments might occur leads to the use of alternative representations for word alignments that allow multiple alignment hypotheses, rather than the 1-best alignment (Venu-gopal et al., 2009; Mi et al., 2008; Christopher Dyer et al., 2008).",
        "While using n-best alignments yields improvements over using the 1-best alignment, these methods are computationally expensive.",
        "More recently, the method described in (Liu et al., 2009) produces improvements over the methods above, while reducing the computational cost by using weighted alignment matrices to represent the alignment distribution over each parallel sentence.",
        "However, their results were limited by the fact that they had no method for extracting a reordering model from these matrices, and used a simple distance-based model.",
        "In this paper, we propose two methods for generating the MSD (Mono Swap Discontinuous) reordering model from the weighted alignment matrices.",
        "First, we test a simple approach by using the 1-best alignment to generate the reordering model, while using the alignment matrix to produce the translation model.",
        "This reordering model is a simple adaptation of the MSD model to read from alignment matrices.",
        "Secondly, we develop two algorithms to infer the reordering model from the weighted alignment matrix probabilities.",
        "The first one uses the alignment information within phrase pairs, while the second uses contextual information of the phrase pairs.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the MSD model; Section 3 presents our two algorithms; in Section 4 we report the results from the experiments conducted using these algorithms, and comment on the results; we conclude in Section 5."

        "For instance, the monotonicity model only considers monotone and non-monotone orientation types, whereas the MSD model also considers the monotone orientation type, but distinguishes the non-monotone orientation type between swap and discontinuous.",

        "When using a weighted alignment matrix, rather than working with alignments points, we use the probability of each word in the source aligning with each word in the target.",
        "Thus, the regular MSD model cannot be directly applied here.",
        "One obvious solution to solve this problem is to produce a 1-best alignment set along with the alignment matrix, and use the 1-best alignment to generate the reordering model, while using the alignment matrix to produce the translation model.",
        "However, this method would not be taking advantage of the weighted alignment matrix.",
        "The following subsections describe two algorithms that are proposed to make use of the alignment probabilities.",
        "Each phrase pair that is extracted using the algorithm described in (Liu et al., 2009) is given a score based on its alignments.",
        "This score is higher if the alignment points in the phrase pair have high probabilities, and if the alignment is consistent.",
        "Thus, if an the above are true, which means, (a\"-1 extracted phrase pair has better quality, its orientation should have more weight than phrase pairs with worse quality.• The orientation is discontinuous if neither of",
        "We implement this by changing the C (o) function in equation 1 from being the number of the phrase pairs with the orientation o, to the sum of the scores of those phrases.",
        "We also need to normalize the scores for each group, due to the fixed smoothing that is applied, since if the sum of the scores is much lower (e.g. 0.1) than the smoothing factor (0.5), the latter will overshadow the weight of the phrase pairs.",
        "The normalization is done by setting the phrase pair with the highest value of the sum of all MSD probabilities to 1, and readjusting other phrase pairs accordingly.",
        "Thus, a group of 3 phrase pairs that have the MSD probability sums of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.1, are all set to 1, 0.5 and 1.",
        "We propose an alternative algorithm to calculate the reordering orientations for each phrase pair.",
        "Rather than classifying each phrase pair with either monotonous (M), swap (S) or discontinuous (D), we calculate the probability for each orientation, and use these as weighted counts when creating the reordering model.",
        "Thus, for the previous word, given a weighted alignment matrix W, the phrase pair between the indexes i and j in S, Sj, and n and m in T, T – , the probability values for each orientation are given by:",
        "These formulas derive from the adaptation of conditions of each orientation presented in 2.",
        "In the regular MSD model, the previous orientation for a phrase pair is monotonous if the previous word in the source phrase is aligned with the previous word in the target phrase and not aligned with the next word.",
        "Thus, the probability ofaphrase pairto have a monotonous orientation Pc(M) is given by the probability of the previous word in the source phrase being aligned with the previous word in the target phrase W--1, and the probability of the previous word in the source to not be aligned with the next word in the target (1 - Wj+1 ).",
        "Also, the sum of the probabilities of all orientations (Pc(M), Pc(S), Pc (D)) for a given phrase pair can be trivially shown to be 1.",
        "The probabilities for the next word are given analogously.",

        "The optimization of the translation model weights was done using MERT, and each experiment was run 5 times, and the final score is calculated as the average of the 5 runs, in order to stabilize the results.",

        "Consistent improvements in the BLEU scores may be observed when changing from the MSD model to the models generated using alignment matrices.",

        "This is evident if we look at the difference in the scores between the distance-based and the MSD models.",
        "Furthermore, in this task, we observe an improvement on all scores from the MSD model to our weighted MSD models, which suggests that the usage of alignment matrices helps predict the reordering probabilities more accurately.",
        "We can also see that the context based reordering model performs better than the score based model in the BTEC task, which does not perform significantly better than the regular MSD model in this task.",
        "Furthermore, combining the score based method with the context based method does not lead to any improvements.",
        "We believe this is because the alignment probabilities are much more accurate in the English-French language pair, and phrase pair scores remain consistent throughout the extraction, making the score based approach and the regular MSD model behave similarly.",
        "On the other hand, in the DIALOG task, score based model has better performance than the regular MSD model, and the combination of both methods yields a significant improvement over each method alone.",
        "Table 3 shows a case where the context based model is more accurate than the regular MSD model.",
        "The alignment is obviously faulty, since the word \"two\" is aligned with both \"deux\", although it should only be aligned with the first occurrence.",
        "Furthermore, the word \"twin\" should be aligned with \"a deux lit\", but it is aligned with \"chambres\".",
        "If we use the 1-best alignment to compute the reordering type of the sentence pair \"Je voudrais reserver deux\" / \"I'd like to reserve two\", the reordering type for the following orientation would be monotonous, since the next word \"chambres\" is falsely aligned with \"twin\".",
        "However, it should clearly be discontinuous, since the right alignment for \"twin\" is \"a deux lit\".",
        "This problem is less serious when we use the weighted MSD model, since the orientation probability mass would be divided between monotonous and discontinuous since the probability weighted matrix for the wrong alignment is 0.5.",
        "On the BTEC task, some of the other scores are lower than the MSD model, and we suspect that this stems from the fact that our tuning process only attempts to maximize the BLEU score."
