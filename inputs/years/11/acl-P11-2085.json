        "For English spelling correction (Kukich, 1992; Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005; Chen et al., 2007; Whitelaw et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2010), most approaches make use of a lexicon which contains a list of well-spelled words (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005; Islam and Inkpen, 2009).",
        "Context features (Ro-zovskaya and Roth, 2010) of words provide useful evidences for spelling correction.",
        "These features are usually represented by an n-gram language model (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Wilcox-O'Hearn et al., 2010).",
        "Phonetic features (Toutanova and Moore, 2002; Atkinson, 2008) are proved to be useful in English spelling correction.",

        "Visual and phonological features are used in Chinese spelling correction (Liu et al., 2010).",
        "Instead of proposing a method for spelling correction, we mainly investigate the reasons that cause typing errors in both English and Chinese.",
        "Some errors are caused by specific properties in Chinese such as the phonetic difference between Mandarin and dialects spoken in southern China.",
        "Meanwhile, confusion sets of Chinese words play an important role in Chinese spelling correction.",

        "The user made a mistake to type in the third Pinyin (\"shenme\" is mistyped as \"shenem\").",

        "Threshold is set to 2 in this paper, as Damerau (1964) shows that about 80% of typos are caused by a single edit operation.",
        "Therefore, using a threshold of 2, we should be able to find most of the typos.",
        "Furthermore, we can extract corresponding Chinese word-correction pairs \"tf^Ä-tf\"^\" from this typing record.",
        "Using heuristic rules discussed above, we extract 54, 309, 334 Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs.",

        "For precision aspect, we randomly select 1, 000 pairs and ask five native speakers to annotate them as correct or wrong.",
        "Annotation results show that the precision of our method is about 75.8%.",
        "Some correct Pinyins are labeled as errors because we only take edit distance into consideration.",
        "We should consider context features as well, which will be left as our future work.",

        "The total occurrences of these mistyped Pinyins are 259, 051.",
        "We successfully retrieve 144, 020 of them, which indicates the recall of our method is about 55.6%.",
