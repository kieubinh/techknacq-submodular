        "Peer reviewing of student writing has been widely used in various academic fields.",
        "While existing web-based peer-review systems largely save instructors effort in setting up peer-review assignments and managing document assignment, there still remains the problem that the quality of peer reviews is often poor (Nelson and Schunn, 2009).",
        "Thus to enhance the effectiveness of existing peer-review systems, we propose to automatically predict the helpfulness of peer reviews.",
        "In this paper, we examine prior techniques that have been used to successfully rank helpfulness for product reviews, and adapt them to the peer-review domain.",
        "In particular, we use an SVM regression algorithm to predict the helpfulness of peer reviews",

        "Prior studies of peer review in the Natural Language Processing field have not focused on helpfulness prediction, but instead have been concerned with issues such as highlighting key sentences in papers (Sandor and Vorndran, 2009), detecting important feedback features in reviews (Cho, 2008; Xiong and Litman, 2010), and adapting peer-review assignment (Garcia, 2010).",
        "However, given some similarity between peer reviews and other review types, we hypothesize that techniques used to predict review helpfulness in other domains can also be applied to peer reviews.",
        "Kim et al.",
        "(2006) used regression to predict the helpfulness ranking of product reviews based on various classes of linguistic features.",
        "Ghose and Ipeirotis (2010) further examined the socio-economic impact of product reviews using a similar approach and suggested the usefulness of subjectivity analysis.",
        "Another study (Liu et al., 2008) of movie reviews showed that helpfulness depends on reviewers' expertise, their writing style, and the timeliness of the review.",
        "Tsur and Rappoport (2009) proposed RevRank to select the most helpful book reviews in an unsupervised fashion based on review lexicons.",
        "However, studies of Amazon's product reviews also show that the perceived helpfulness of a review depends not only on its review content, but also on social effects such as product qualities, and individual bias in the presence of mixed opinion distribution (Danescu-Niculescu-",
        "Mizil et al., 2009).",
        "Nonetheless, several properties distinguish our corpus of peer reviews from other types of reviews:",
        "1) The helpfulness of our peer reviews is directly rated using a discrete scale from one to five instead of being defined as a function of binary votes (e.g. the percentage of \"helpful\" votes (Kim et al., 2006));",
        "2) Peer reviews frequently refer to the related students' papers, thus review analysis needs to take into account paper topics; 3) Within the context of education, peer-review helpfulness often has a writing specific semantics, e.g. improving revision likelihood; 4) In general, peer-review corpora collected from classrooms are of a much smaller size compared to online product reviews.",
        "To tailor existing techniques to peer reviews, we will thus propose new specialized features to address these issues."

        "Following Kim et al.",
        "(2006), we train our helpfulness model using SVM regression with a radial basis function kernel provided by SVM1ight (Joachims, 1999).",
        "We first evaluate each feature type in isolation to investigate its predictive power of peerreview helpfulness; we then examine them together in various combinations to find the most useful feature set for modeling peer-review helpfulness.",
        "Performance is evaluated in 10-fold cross validation of our 267 peer reviews by predicting the absolute helpfulness scores (with Pearson correlation coefficient r) as well as by predicting helpfulness ranking (with Spearman rank correlation coefficient rs ).",
        "Although predicted helpfulness ranking could be directly used to compare the helpfulness of a given set of reviews, predicting helpfulness rating is desirable in practice to compare helpfulness between existing reviews and new written ones without reranking all previously ranked reviews.",
        "Results are presented regarding the generic features and the specialized features respectively, with 95% confidence bounds.",
        "Evaluation of the generic features is presented in Table 2, showing that all classes except syntactic (SYN) and meta-data (MET) features are significantly correlated with both helpfulness rating (r) and helpfulness ranking (rs).",
        "Structural features (bolded) achieve the highest Pearson (0.60) and Spearman correlation coefficients (0.59) (although within the significant correlations, the difference among coefficients are insignificant).",
        "Note that in isolation, MET (paper ratings) are not significantly correlated with peer-review helpfulness, which is different from prior findings of product reviews (Kim et al., 2006) where product scores are significantly correlated with product-review helpfulness.",
        "However, when combined with other features, MET does appear to add value (last row).",
        "When comparing the performance between predicting helpfulness ratings versus ranking, we observe r œ rs consistently for our peer reviews, while Kim et al.",
        "(2006) reported r < rs for product reviews.Finally, we observed a similar feature redundancy effect as Kim et al.",
        "(2006) did, in that simply combining all features does not improve the model's performance.",
        "Interestingly, our best feature combination (last row) is the same as theirs.",

        "Significant results are marked by * (p < 0.05).",
        "Evaluation of the specialized features is shown in Table 3, where all features examined are significantly correlated with both helpfulness rating and ranking.",
        "When evaluated in isolation, although specialized features have weaker correlation coefficients ([0.43, 0.51]) than the best generic features, these differences are not significant, and the specialized features have the potential advantage of being theory-based.",
        "The use of features related to meaningful dimensions of writing has contributed to validity and greater acceptability in the related area of automated essay scoring (Attali and Burstein, 2006).",
        "When combined with some generic features, the specialized features improve the model's performance in terms of both r and rs compared to the best performance in Section 4.1 (the baseline).",
        "Though the improvement is not significant yet, we think it still interesting to investigate the potential trend to understand how specialized features capture additional information of peer-review helpfulness.",
        "Therefore, the following analysis is also presented (based on the absolute mean values), where we start from the baseline feature set, and gradually expand it by adding our new specialized features: 1) We first replace the raw lexical unigram features (UGR) with lexical category features (LEX2), which slightly improves the performance before rounding to the significant digits shown in row 5.",
        "Note that the categories not only substantially abstract lexical information from the reviews, but also carry simple syntactic and semantic information.",
        "2) We then add one semantic class - topic words (row 6), which enhances the performance further.",
        "Semantic features did not help when working with generic lexical features in Section 4.1 (second to last row in Table 2), but they can be successfully combined with the lexical category features and further improve the performance as indicated here.",
        "3) When cognitive-science and localization features are introduced, the prediction becomes even more accurate, which reaches a Pearson correlation of 0.67 and a Spearman correlation of 0.67 (Table 3, last row)."
