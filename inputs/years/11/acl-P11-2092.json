        "One of the challenges in statistical language modeling are words that appear in the recognition task at hand, but not in the training set, so called out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "Especially for productive language it is often necessary to at least reduce the number of OOVs.",
        "We present a novel approach based on morphological classes to handling OOV words in language modeling for English.",
        "Previous work on morphological classes in English has not been able to show noticeable improvements in perplexity.",
        "In this article class-based language models as proposed by Brown et al.",
        "(1992) are used to tackle the problem.",
        "Our model improves perplexity of a Kneser-Ney (KN) model for English by 4%, the largest improvement of a state-of-the-art model for English due to morphological modeling that we are aware of.",
        "A class-based language model groups words into classes and replaces the word transition probability by a class transition probability and a word emission probability:",
        "Brown et al.",
        "and many other authors primarily use context information for clustering.",
        "Niesler et al.",
        "(1998) showed that context clustering works better than clusters based on part-of-speech tags.",
        "However, since the context of an OOV word is unknown and it therefore cannot be assigned to a cluster, OOV words are as much a problem to a context-based class model as to a word model.",
        "That is why we use non-distributional features - features like morphological suffixes that only depend on the shape of the word itself - to design a new class-based model that can naturally integrate unknown words.",
        "In related work, factored language models (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) were proposed to make use of morphological information in highly inflecting languages such as Finnish (Creutz et al., 2007), Turkish (Creutz et al., 2007; Yuret and Biçici, 2009) and Arabic (Creutz et al., 2007; Vergyri et al., 2004) or compounding languages like German (Berton et al., 1996).",
        "The main idea is to replace words by sequences of factors or features and to apply statistical language modeling to the resulting factor sequences.",
        "If, for example, words were segmented into morphemes, an unknown word would be split into an unseen sequence, which could be recognized using discounting techniques.",
        "However, if one morpheme, e.g. the stem, is unknown to the system, the fundamental problem remains unsolved.",
        "Our class-based model uses a number of features that have not been used in factored models (e.g., shape and length features) and achieves - in contrast to factored models - good perplexity gains for English.",

        "The feature vector of a word consists of four parts that represent information about suffixes, capitalization, special characters and word length.",
        "For the suffix group, we define a binary feature for each of the 100 most frequent suffixes learned on the training corpus by the Reports algorithm (Keshava, 2006), a general purpose unsupervised morphology learning algorithm.",
        "One additional binary feature is used for all other suffixes learned by Reports, including the empty suffix.",
        "The feature groups capitalization and special characters are motivated by the analysis shown in Table 2.",
        "Our goal is to improve OOV modeling.",
        "The table shows that most OOV words (/ = 0) are numbers (CD), names (NP), and nouns and adjectives (NN, NNS, JJ).",
        "This distribution is similar to hapax legomena (/ = 1), but different from the POS distribution of all tokens.",
        "Capitalization and special character features are of obvious utility in identifying the POS classes NP and CD since names in English are usually capitalized and numbers are written with digits and special characters such as comma and period.",
        "To capture these \"shape\" properties of a word, we define the features listed in Table 1.",
        "The fourth feature group is length.",
        "Short words often have unusual distributional properties.",
        "Examples are abbreviations and bond credit ratings like Aaa.",
        "To represent this information in the length part of the vector, we define four binary features for lengths 1, 2, 3 and greater than 3.",
        "The four parts of the vector (suffixes, capitalization, special characters, length) are weighted equally by normalizing the subvector of each subgroup to unit length.",
        "We designed the four feature groups to group word types to either resemble POS classes or to induce an even finer sub-partitioning.",
        "Unsupervised POS clustering is a hard task in English and it is virtually impossible if a word's context (which is not available for OOV items) is not taken into account.",
        "For example, there is no way we can learn that \"the\" and \"a\" are similar or that \"child\" has the same relationship to \"children\" as \"kid\" does to \"kids\".",
        "But as our analysis in Table 2 shows, part of the benefit of morphological analysis for OOVs comes from an appropriate treatment of names and numbers.",
        "The suffix feature group is useful for categorizing OOV nouns and adjectives because there are very few irregular morphemes like \"ren\" in children in English and OOV words are likely to be regular words.",
        "So even though morphological learning based on the limited information we use is not possible in general, it can be partially solved for the special case of OOV words.",
        "Our experimental results in Section 5 confirm that this is the case.",
        "We also testes prefixes and features based on word stems.",
