      "text": [
        "Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006).",
        "This task requires deciding whether a textual statement (termed the hypothesis-H) can be inferred (entailed) from another text (termed the text-T).",
        "Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges, currently organized under NIST, have become a standard benchmark for entailment systems.",
        "These systems tackle their complex task at various levels of inference, including logical representation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Inference at these levels usually requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance.",
        "Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, performing at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010).",
        "Within complex systems, lexical entailment modeling is an important component.",
        "Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach.",
        "While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework.",
        "Typically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text's terms.",
        "Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexical semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (denoted here as entailment rules).",
        "Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H's terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting absolute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Harrison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrieval-style vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009).",
        "Other works (Corley and Mihal-cea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have applied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity function between their terms.",
        "These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood.",
        "An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources.",
        "We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various entailment phenomena.",
        "Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative probabilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment.",
        "Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which enables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level.",
        "While heuristic methods are limited in their ability to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of being extendable and enabling the utilization of well-founded probabilistic methods such as the EM algorithm.",
        "We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines.",
        "Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentage-coverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art.",
        "These results support the viability of the probabilistic framework while pointing at certain modeling aspects that need to be improved."

        "Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the likelihood that all H's terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entailment, which were mostly neglected by previous lexical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliability levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transitive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) considering multiple entailments when entailing a term.",
        "Figure 1: The generative process of entailing terms of a hypothesis from a text.",
        "Edges represent entailment rules.",
        "There are 3 evidences for the entailment of hi : a rule from Resource^, another one from Resources both suggesting that tj entails it, and a chain from ti through an intermediate term t'.",
        "For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h g H would be entailed by at least one term t g T (Glickman et al., 2006).",
        "Figure 1 describes the process of entailing hypothesis terms.",
        "The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as tn and hm in Figure 1).",
        "Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and morphological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference – reasoning from WordNet).",
        "We denote by R(r) the resource which provided the rule r.",
        "Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chains that connect a term t g T to a term h g H through intermediate terms.",
        "For instance, from the rules infer – inference and inference – reasoning we can deduce the rule infer – reasoning (were inference is the intermediate term as t in Figure 1).",
        "Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for tj and hi in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as ti and tj are indicating the entailment of hi in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h's entailment.",
        "It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h, it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources.",
        "Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter Or for each resource R, denoting its reliability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment instance.",
        "Direct matches are considered as a special \"resource\", called match, for which Omatch is expected to be close to 1.",
        "We now present our probabilistic model.",
        "For a text term t G T to entail a hypothesis term h by a chain c, denoted by t – h, the application of every r g c must be valid.",
        "Note that a rule r in a chain c connects two terms (its left-hand-side and its right-hand-side, denoted Ihs – rhs).",
        "The Ihs of the first rule in c is t g T and the rhs of the last rule in it is h g H. We denote the event of a valid rule application by Ihs – rhs.",
        "Since a-priori a rule r is valid with probability 0R(r), and assuming independence of all r g c, we obtain Eq.",
        "1 to specify the probability of the event t – h. Next, let C (h) denote the set of chains which suggest the entailment of h. The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq.",
        "2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid.",
        "Finally, the probability that T entails all of H, assuming independence of H 's terms, is the probability that every h g H is entailed, as given in Eq.",
        "3.",
        "Notice that there could be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain.",
        "Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special \"resource\" called uncovered (expecting Ouncovered to be relatively small).",
        "(even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment).",
        "Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis.",
        "We denote Hc as the subset of H's terms which are covered by some rule chain and Huc as the remaining uncovered part.",
        "Eq.",
        "3a then provides a refined entailment model for H, in which the second term specifies the probability that Huc is entailed given that Hc is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths:",
        "The difficulty in estimating the Or values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTE-training entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level.",
        "Therefore, we use EM-based estimation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "In the E step we use the current Or values to compute all whcr (T, H) values for each training pair.",
        "whcr (T, H) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h g H is valid, given that either T entails H or not according to the training annotation (see Eq.",
        "4).",
        "Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side (Ihs) and its right-hand-side (rhs).",
        "Therefore Eq.",
        "4 uses the notation Ihs – rhs to designate the application of the rule r (similar to Eq.",
        "1).",
        "As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains.",
        "The above treatment of uncovered terms in H, as captured in Eq.",
        "3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypothesis.",
        "However, when the number of covered hypothesis terms increases the probability that the remaining terms are actually entailed by T increases too",
        "After applying Bayes' rule we get a fraction with Eq.",
        "3 in its denominator and 0R(r) as the second term of the numerator.",
        "The first numerator term is defined as in Eq.",
        "3 except that for the corresponding rule application we substitute 0R(r) by 1 (per the conditioning event).",
        "The probabilistic model defined by Eq.",
        "1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network).",
        "Hence the E-step probabilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988).",
        "The M step uses Eq.",
        "5 to update the parameter set.",
        "For each resource R we average the whcr (T, H) values for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted nR.",
        "For Eq.",
        "3a we need to estimate also p(T – Huc | | Hc |, | H | ).",
        "This is done directly via maximum likelihood estimation over the training set, by calculating the proportion of entailing examples within the set of all examples of a given hypothesis length (| H| ) and a given number of covered terms (| Hc| ).",
        "As | Hc| we take the number of identical terms in T and H (exact match) since in almost all cases terms in H which have an exact match in T are indeed entailed.",
        "We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain performance improvements."
