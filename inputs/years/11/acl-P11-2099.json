        "We conclude that the challenge in performing opinion mining in such type of content is correctly identifying the positive opinions, because (i) they are much less frequent than negative opinions and (ii) they are particularly exposed to verbal irony.",

        "This study focuses on identifying the most relevant challenges in mining opinions targeting media personalities, namely politicians, in comments posted by users to online news articles.",
        "We are interested in answering open research questions related to the expression of opinions about human entities in UGC.",
        "It has been suggested that the target identification is probably the easiest step in mining opinions on products using product reviews (Liu, 2010).",
        "But, is this also true for human targets namely for media personalities like politicians?",
        "How are these entities mentioned in UGC?",
        "What are the most productive forms of mention?",
        "Is it a standard name, a nickname, a pronoun, a definite description?",
        "Additionally, it was demonstrated that irony may influence the correct detection of positive opinions about human entities (Carvalho et al., 2009); however, we do not know the prevalence of this phenomenon in UGC.",
        "Is it possible to establish any type of correlation between the use of irony and negative opinions?",
        "Finally, approaches to opinion mining have implicitly assumed that the problem at stake is a balanced classification problem, based on the general assumption that positive and negative opinions are relatively well distributed in texts.",
        "But, should we expect to find a balanced number of negative and positive opinions in comments targeting human entities, or should we be prepared for dealing with very unbalanced data?",
        "To answer these questions, we analyzed a collection of comments posted by the readers of an online newspaper to a series of 10 news articles, each covering a televised face-to-face debate between the Portuguese leaders of five political parties.",
        "Having in mind the previously outlined questions, we designed an original rich annotation scheme to label opinionated sentences targeting human entities in this corpus, named SentiCorpus-PT.",

        "For creating SentiCorpus-PT we compiled a collection of comments posted by the readers of the Portuguese newspaper Publico to a series of 10 news articles covering the TV debates on the 2009 election of the Portuguese Parliament.",
        "These took place between the 2nd and the 12th of September, 2009, and involved the candidates from the largest Portuguese parties.",
        "The whole collection is composed by 2,795 posts (approx.",
        "8,000 sentences), which are linked to the respective news articles.",
        "This collection is interesting for several reasons.",
        "The opinion targets are mostly confined to a predictable set of human entities, i.e. the political actors involved in each debate.",
        "Additionally, the format adopted in the debates indirectly encouraged users to focus their comments on two specific candidates at a time, persuading them to confront their standings.",
        "This is particularly interesting for studying both direct and indirect comparisons between two or more competing human targets (Ga-napathibhotla and Liu, 2008).",
        "Our annotation scheme stands on the following assumptions: (i) the sentence is the unit of analysis, whose interpretation may require the analysis of the entire comment; (ii) each sentence may convey different opinions; (iii) each opinion may have different targets; (iv) the targets, which can be omitted in text, correspond to human entities; (v) the entity mentions are classifiable into syntactic-semantic categories; (vi) the opinionated sentences may be characterized according to their polarity and intensity; (vii) each opinionated sentence may have a literal or ironic interpretation.",
        "Opinion Target: An opinionated sentence may concern different opinion targets.",
        "Typically, targets correspond to the politicians participating in the televised debates or, alternatively, to other relevant media personalities that should also be identified (e.g.",
        "The Minister of Finance is done!).",
        "There are also cases wherein the opinion is targeting another commentator (e.g. Mr. Francisco de Amarante, did you watch the same debate I did?!?!?",
        "), and others where expressed opinions do not identify their target (e.g.",
        "The debate did not interest me at all!).",
        "All such cases are classified accordingly.",
        "The annotation also differentiates how human entities are mentioned.",
        "We consider the following syntactic-semantic sub-categories: (i) proper name, including acronyms (e.g. José Socrates, MFL), which can be preceded by a title or position name (e.g. Prime-minister José Socrates; Eng.",
        "Socrates); (ii) position name (e.g. social-democratic leader); (iii) organization (e.g. PS party, government); (iv) nickname (e.g. Pinocrates); (v) pronoun (e.g. him); (vi) definite description, i.e. a noun phrase that can be interpreted at sentence or comment level, after co-reference resolution (e.g. the guys at the Ministry of Education); (vii) omitted, when the reference to the entity is omitted in text, a situation that is frequent in null subject languages, like European Portuguese (e.g. [He] massacred...).",
        "Opinion Polarity and Intensity: An opinion polarity value, ranging from «-2» (the strongest negative value) to «2» (the strongest positive value), is assigned to each of the previously identified targets.",
        "Neutral opinions are classified with «0», and the cases that are ambiguous or difficult to interpret are marked with «?».",
        "Because of its subjectivity, the full range of the intensity scale («-2» vs. «-1»; «1» vs. «2») is reserved for the cases where two or more targets are, directly or indirectly, compared at sentence or comment levels (e.g.",
        "Both performed badly, but Socrates was clearly worse).",
        "The remaining negative and positive opinions should be classified as «1» and «1», respectively.",
        "Sentences not clearly conveying sentiment or opinion (usually sentences used for contextualizing or quoting something/someone) are classified as «non-opinionated sentences».",
        "Opinion Literality: Finally, opinions are characterized according to their literality.",
        "An opinion can be considered literal, or ironic whenever it conveys a meaning different from the one that derives from the literal interpretation of the text (e.g.",
        "This prime-minister is wonderful!",
        "Undoubtedly, all the Portuguese need is more taxes!",

        "Such comments were randomly selected from the entire collection, taking into consideration that each debate should be proportionally represented in the sentiment annotated corpus.",
        "To measure the reliability of the sentiment annotations, we conducted an inter-annotator agreement trial, with two annotators.",
        "This was performed based on the analysis of 207 sentences, randomly selected from the collection.",
        "The agreement study was confined to the target identification, polarity assignment and opinion literality, using Krippendorffs Alpha standard metric (Krippendorff, 2004).",
        "The highest observed agreement concerns the target identification (a=0.905), followed by the polarity assignment (a=0.874), and finally the irony labeling (a=0.844).",
        "According to Krippen-dorff's interpretation, all these values (> 0.8) confirm the reliability of the annotations.",
        "The results presented in the following sections are based on statistics taken from the 3,537 annotated sentences.",
        "Negative opinions represent 60% of the analyzed sentences.",
        "In our collection, only 15% of the sentences have a positive interpretation, and 13% a neutral interpretation.",
        "The remaining 12% are non-opinionated sentences (10%) and sentences whose polarity is vague or ambiguous (2%).",

        "With the exception of the debate between Jerönimo de Sousa (C5) and",
