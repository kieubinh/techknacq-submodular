        "One reason for the lack of computational models has been the absence of accurately-labeled naturally occurring utterances that can be used to train machine learning systems.",
        "Microblogging platforms such as Twitter, which allow users to communicate feelings, opinions and ideas in short messages and to assign labels to their own messages, have been recently exploited in sentiment and opinion analysis (Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Davi-dov et al., 2010).",
        "In Twitter, messages can be annotated with hashtags such as #bicycling, #happy and #sarcasm.",
        "We use these hashtags to build a labeled corpus of naturally occurring sarcastic, positive and negative tweets.",
        "In this paper, we report on an empirical study on the use of lexical and pragmatic factors to distinguish sarcasm from positive and negative sentiments expressed in Twitter messages.",
        "The contributions of this paper include i) creation of a corpus that includes only sarcastic utterances that have been explicitly identified as such by the composer of the message; ii) a report on the difficulty of distinguishing sarcastic tweets from tweets that are straightforwardly positive or negative.",
        "Our results suggest that lexical features alone are not sufficient for identifying sarcasm and that pragmatic and contextual features merit further study."

        "In the context of spoken dialogues, automatic detection of sarcasm has relied primarily on speech-related cues such as laughter and prosody (Tepperman et al., 2006).",
        "The work most closely related to ours is that of Davidov et al.",
        "(2010), whose objective was to identify sarcastic and non-sarcastic utterances in Twitter and in Amazon product reviews.",
        "In this paper, we consider the somewhat harder problem of distinguishing sarcastic tweets from non-sarcastic tweets that directly convey positive and negative attitudes (we do not consider neutral utterances at all).",
        "Our approach of looking at lexical features for identification of sarcasm was inspired by the work of Kreuz and Caucci (2007).",
        "In addition, we also look at pragmatic features, such as establishing common ground between speaker and hearer (Clark and Gerring, 1984), and emoticons.",
        "In Twitter, people (tweeters) post messages of up to 140 characters (tweets).",
        "Apart from plain text, a tweet can contain references to other users (@<user>), URLs, and hashtags (#hashtag) which are tags assigned by the user to identify topic (#teaparty, #worldcup) or sentiment (#angry, #happy, #sarcasm).",
        "An example of a tweet is: \"@UserName1 check out the twitter feed on @UserName2 for a few ideas :) http://xxxxxx.com #happy #hour \".",
        "To build our corpus of sarcastic (S), positive (P) and negative (N) tweets, we relied on the annotations that tweeters assign to their own tweets using hashtags.",
        "Our assumption is that the best judge of whether a tweet is intended to be sarcastic is the author of the tweet.",
        "As shown in the following sections, human judges other than the tweets' authors, achieve low levels of accuracy when trying to classify sarcastic tweets; we therefore argue that using the tweets labeled by their authors using hashtag produces a better quality gold standard.",
        "We used a Twitter API to collect tweets that include hashtags that express sarcasm (#sarcasm, #sarcastic), direct positive sentiment (e.g., #happy, #joy, #lucky), and direct negative sentiment (e.g., #sadness, #angry, #frustrated), respectively.",
        "We applied automatic filtering to remove retweets, duplicates, quotes, spam, tweets written in languages other than English, and tweets with URLs.",
        "To address the concern of Davidov et al.",
        "(2010) that tweets with #hashtags are noisy, we automatically filtered all tweets where the hashtags of interest were not located at the very end of the message.",
        "We then performed a manual review of the filtered tweets to double check that the remaining end hashtags were not part of the message.",
        "We thus eliminated messages about sarcasm such as \"I really love #sarcasm\" and kept only messages that express sarcasm, such as \"lol thanks.",
        "I can always count on you for comfort :) #sarcasm\".",
        "Our final corpus consists of 900 tweets in each of the three categories, sarcastic, positive and negative.",
        "Examples of tweets in our corpus that are labeled with the #sarcasm hashtag include the following:",
        "1) @ UserName That must suck.",

        "3) @UserName that's what I love about Miami.",
        "Attention to detail in preserving historic landmarks of the past.",
        "4) @UserName im just loving the positive vibes out of that!",
        "The sarcastic tweets are primarily negative (i.e., messages that sound positive but are intended to convey a negative attitude) as in Examples 2-4, but there are also some positive messages (messages that sound negative but are apparently intended to be understood as positive), as in Example 1."
