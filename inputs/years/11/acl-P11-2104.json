        "The general goal of this work is to mine the semantic orientation of foreign words.",

        "In this network two words are connected if we believe that they are semantically related.",

        "Some of the English words will be used as seeds for which we know the semantic orientation.",
        "Given such a network, we will measure the mean hitting time in a random walk starting at any given word to the positive set of seeds and the negative set of seeds.",
        "Positive words will be more likely to hit the positive set faster than hitting the negative set and vice versa.",
        "In the rest of this section, we define how the multilingual word network is built and describe an algorithm for predicting the semantic orientation of any given word.",
        "We build a network G(V, E) where V = Ven U Vfris the union of a set of English and foreign words.",
        "E is a set of edges connecting nodes in V. There are three types of connections: English-English connections, Foreign-Foreign connections and English-Foreign connections.",
        "For the English-English connections, we use Wordnet (Miller, 1995).",
        "Wordnet is a large lexical database of English.",
        "Words are grouped in synsets to express distinct concepts.",
        "We add a link between two words if they occur in the same Wordnet synset.",
        "We also add a link between two words if they have a hypernym or a similar-to relation.",
        "Foreign-Foreign connections are created in a similar way to the English connections.",
        "Some other languages have lexical resources based on the design of the Princeton English Wordnet.",
        "For example: Euro Wordnet (EWN) (Vossen, 1997), Arabic Wordnet",
        "Elkateb and Fellbaum, 2006) and the Hindi Wordnet (Narayan et al., 2002; S. Jha, 2001).",
        "We also use co-occurrence statistics similar to the work of Hatzi-vassiloglou and McKeown (1997).",
        "Finally, to connect foreign words to English words, we use a foreign to English dictionary.",
        "For every word in a list of foreign words, we look up its meaning in a dictionary and add an edge between the foreign word and every other English word that appeared as a possible meaning for it.",
        "We use the multilingual network we described above to predict the semantic orientation of words based on the mean hitting time to two sets of positive and negative seeds.",

        "Let the average number of steps that a random walker starting at some node i will need to enter a state k G S be h(i|S).",
        "It can be formally defined as:",
        "where is the transition probability between node i and node j.",
        "Given two lists of seed English words with known polarity, we define two sets of nodes S+ and S – representing those seeds.",
        "For any given word w, we calculate the mean hitting time between w and the two seed sets h(w|S+) and h(w|S – ).",
        "If h(w|S+) is greater than h(w|S – ), the word is classified as negative, otherwise it is classified as positive.",
        "We used the list of labeled seeds from (Hatzivassiloglou andMcKeown, 1997) and (Stone et al., 1966).",
        "Several other similarity measures may be used to predict whether a given word is closer to the positive seeds list or the negative seeds list (e.g. average shortest path length (Kamps et al., 2004)).",
        "However hitting time has been shown to be more efficient and more accurate (Hassan and Radev, 2010) because it measures connectivity rather than distance.",
        "For example, the length of the shortest path between the words \"good\" and \"bad\" is only 5 (Kamps et al., 2004)."
