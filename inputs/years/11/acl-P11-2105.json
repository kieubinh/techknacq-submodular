        "Text classification is a crucial and well-proven method for organizing the collection of large scale documents.",
        "The predefined categories are formed by different criterions, e.g. \"Entertainment\", \"Sports'' and \"Education\" in news classification, \"Junk Email\" and \"Ordinary Email\" in email classification.",
        "In the literature, many algorithms (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999; Yang and Pedersen, 1997) have been proposed, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and so on.",
        "Empirical evaluations have shown that most of these methods are quite effective in traditional text classification applications.",
        "In past serval years, hierarchical text classification has become an active research topic in database area (Koller and Sahami, 1997; Weigend et al., 1999) and machine learning area (Rousu et al., 2006; Cai and Hofmann, 2007).",
        "Different with traditional classification, the document collections are organized as hierarchical class structure in many application fields: web taxonomies (i.e. the Yahoo!",
        "Directory http://dir.yahoo.com/ and the Open Directory Project (ODP) http://dmoz.org/), email folders and product catalogs.",
        "The approaches of hierarchical text classification can be divided in three ways: flat, local and global approaches.",
        "The flat approach is traditional multi-class classification in flat fashion without hierarchical class information, which only uses the classes in leaf nodes in taxonomy(Yang and Liu, 1999; Yang and Peder-sen, 1997; Qiu et al., 2011).",
        "The local approach proceeds in a top-down fashion, which firstly picks the most relevant categories of the top level and then recursively making the choice among the low-level categories(Sun and Lim, 2001; Liu et al., 2005).",
        "The global approach builds only one classifier to discriminate all categories in a hierarchy(Cai and Hofmann, 2004; Rousu et al., 2006; Miao and Qiu, 2009; Qiu et al., 2009).",
        "The essential idea of global approach is that the close classes have some common underlying factors.",
        "Especially, the descendant classes can share the characteristics of the ancestor classes, which is similar with multi-task learn-ing(Caruana, 1997; Xue et al., 2007).",
        "Because the global hierarchical categorization can avoid the drawbacks about those high-level irrecoverable error, it is more popular in the machine learning domain.",
        "However, the taxonomy is defined artificially and is usually very difficult to organize for large scale taxonomy.",
        "The subclasses of the same parent class may be dissimilar and can be grouped in different concepts, so it bring great challenge to hierarchical classification.",
        "For example, the \"Sports\" node in a taxonomy have six subclasses (Fig.",
        "1a), but these subclass can be grouped into three unobservable concepts (Fig.",
        "1b).",
        "These concepts can show the underlying factors more clearly.",
        "In this paper, we claim that each class may have several latent concepts and its subclasses share information with these different concepts respectively.",
        "Then we propose a variant Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm to maximizes the margins between latent paths.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the basic model of hierarchical classification.",
        "Then we propose our algorithm in section 3.",
        "Section 4 gives experimental analysis.",
