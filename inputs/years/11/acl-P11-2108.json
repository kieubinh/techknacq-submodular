        "In addition to the cross-linguistic, cross-cultural differences which are the focus of our study, it is also clear that there are substantial inter-speaker differences in verbal feedback, both in frequency and, we expect, in signalling.",
        "Furthermore, while the rate of verbal feedback differs across language and speaker, it is, overall, a relatively infrequent phenomenon, occurring in as little as zero percent of pausal intervals for some dyads and only at an average of 13-30% of pausal intervals across the three languages.",
        "As a result, the substantial class imbalance and relative sparsity of listener verbal feedback present challenges for data-driven machine learning methods.",
        "Finally, as prior researchers have observed, provision of verbal feedback can be viewed as optional.",
        "The presence of feedback, we assume, indicates the presence of a suitable context; the absence of feedback, however, does not guarantee that feedback would have been inappropriate, only that the conversant did not provide it.",

        "We employ a leave-one-dyad-out cross-validation framework that allows us to determine overall accuracy while highlighting the different characteristics of the dyads.",
