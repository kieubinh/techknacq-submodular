        "Sentence segmentation, or the detection of sentence boundaries, is very much a solved problem for English.",
        "Sentence boundaries can be determined by looking for periods, exclamation marks and question marks.",
        "Although the symbol (dot) that is used to represent period is ambiguous because it is also used as the decimal point or in abbreviations, its resolution only requires local context.",
        "It can be resolved fairly easily with rules in the form of regular expressions or in a machine-learning framework (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997).",
        "Chinese also uses periods (albeit with a different symbol), question marks, and exclamation marks to indicate sentence boundaries.",
        "Where these punctuation marks exist, sentence boundaries can be unambiguously detected.",
        "The difference is that the Chinese comma also functions similarly as the English period in some context and signals the boundary ofa sentence.",
        "As a result, if the commas are not disambiguated, Chinese would have these \"run-on\" sentences that can only be plausibly translated into multiple English sentences.",
        "An example is given in (1), where one Chinese sentence is plausibly translated into three English sentences.",

        "[2] Comparatively speaking, [3] Zhuoyue' s prices are relatively low, [4] and they can also guarantee that their products are genuine.",
        "[5] Therefore I placed the order.\"",
        "In this paper, we formulate Chinese sentence segmentation as a comma disambiguation problem.",
        "The problem is basically one of separating commas that mark sentence boundaries (such as [2] and [5] in (1)) from those that do not (such as [1], [3] and [4]).",
        "Sentences that can be split on commas are generally loosely coordinated structures that are syntactically and semantically complete on their own, and they do not have a close syntactic relation with one another.",
        "We believe that a sentence boundary detection task that disambiguates commas, ifsuccessfully solved, simplifies downstream tasks such as parsing and Machine Translation.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe our procedure for deriving training and test data from the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005).",

        "To our knowledge, there is no data in the public domain with commas explicitly annotated based on whether they mark sentence boundaries.",
        "One could imagine using parallel data where a Chinese sentence is word-aligned with multiple English sentences, but such data is generally noisy and commas are not disambiguated based on a uniform standard.",
        "We instead pursued a different path and derived our training and test data from the Chinese Treebank (CTB).",
        "The CTB does not disambiguate commas explicitly, and just like the Penn English Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), the sentence boundaries in the CTB are identified by periods, exclamation and question marks.",
        "However, there are clear syntactic patterns that can be used to disambiguate the two types of commas.",
        "Commas that mark sentence boundaries delimit loosely coordinated toplevel IPs, as illustrated in Figure 1, and commas that don't cover all other cases.",
        "One such example is Figure 2, where a PP is separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma.",
        "We devised a heuristic algorithm to detect loosely coordinated structures in the Chinese Treebank, and labeled each comma with either EOS (end of a sentence) or Non-EOS (not the end of a sentence)."

        "Our comma disambiguation models are trained and evaluated on a subset of the Chinese TreeBank (CTB) 6.0, released by the LDC.",

        "The automatic parses in each test set are produced by retraining the Berkeley parser on its corresponding training set, plus the unused portion of the CTB 6.0.",
        "Measured by the ParsEval metric (Black et al., 1991), the parsing accuracy on the CTB test set stands at 83.63% (F-score), with a precision of 85.66% and a recall of 81.69%.",
        "There are 1,510 commas in the test set, and our heuristic baseline algorithm is able to correctly label 1,321 or 87.5% of the commas.",
        "Among these, 250 or 16.6% of them are EOS commas that mark sentence boundaries and 1,260 of them are Non-EOS commas.",
        "The results of our experiments are presented in Table 2.",
        "The baseline precision and recall for the EOS commas are 59.1% and 79.6% respectively with an F1 score of 67.8% .",
        "For Non-EOS commas, the baseline precision and recall are 95.7% and 89.0% respectively, amounting to an F1 score of 70.1%.",
        "The learned maximum classifier achieved a modest improvement over the baseline.",
        "The overall accuracy of the learned model is 89.2%, just shy of 90%.",
        "The precision and recall for EOS commas are 64.7% and 76.4% respectively and the combined F1 score is 70.1%.",
        "For Non-EOS commas, the precision and recall are 95.1% and 91.7% respectively, with the F1 score being 93.4%.",
        "Other than a list of most frequent words that start a sentence, all the features are extracted from the sentence the comma occurs in.",
        "Given that the heuristic algorithm and the learned model use essentially the same source of information, we attribute the improvement to the use of lexical features that the heuristic algorithm cannot easily take advantage of.",
        "Table 3 shows the contribution of individual feature groups.",
        "The numbers reflect the accuracy when each feature group is taken out of the model.",
        "While all the features have made a contribution to the overall accuracy on the development set, some of the features (3 and 8) actually hurt the overall performance slightly on the test set.",
        "What's interesting is while the heuristic algorithm that is based entirely on syntactic structure produced a strong baseline, when formulated as features they are not at all effective.",
        "In particular, feature groups 7, 8, 9 are explicit reformulations of the heuristic algorithm, but they all contributed very little to or even slightly hurt the overall performance.",
        "The more effective features are the lexical features (1, 2, 10, 11) probably because they are more robust.",
        "What this suggests is that we can get reasonable sentence segmentation accuracy without having to parse the sentence (or rather, the multi-sentence group) first.",

        "We trained a statistical model using data derived from the Chinese Treebank and reported promising preliminary results.",
