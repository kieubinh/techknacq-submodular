        "There are many ways in which we can refer to objects and people in the real world.",
        "A chair, for example, can be referred to as red, large, or seen from the front, while men may be singled out in terms of their pogonotrophy (facial hairstyle), clothing and many other attributes.",
        "This poses a problem for algorithms that automatically generate referring expressions: how to determine which attributes to use?",
        "One solution is to assume that some attributes are preferred over others, and this is indeed what many Referring Expressions Generation (REG) algorithms do.",
        "A classic example is the Incremental Algorithm (IA), which postulates the existence of a complete ranking of relevant attributes (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "The IA essentially iterates through this list of preferred attributes, selecting an attribute for inclusion in a referring expression if it helps singling out the target from the other objects in the scene (the distractors).",
        "Crucially, Dale and Reiter do not specify how the ranking of attributes should be determined.",
        "They refer to psycholinguistic research suggesting that, in general, absolute attributes (such as color) are preferred over relative ones (such as size), but stress that constructing a preference order is essentially an empirical question, which will differ from one domain to another.",
        "Many other REG algorithms similarly rely on preferences.",
        "The graph-based based REG algorithm (Krahmer et al., 2003), for example, models preferences in terms of costs, with cheaper properties being more preferred.",
        "Various ways to compute costs are possible; they can be defined, for instance, in terms of log probabilities, which makes frequently encountered properties cheap, and infrequent ones more expensive.",
        "Krahmer et al.",
        "(2008) argue that a less fine-grained cost function might generalize better, and propose to use frequency information to, somewhat ad hoc, define three costs: 0 (free), 1 (cheap) and 2 (expensive).",
        "This approach was shown to work well: the graph-based algorithm was the best performing system in the most recent REG Challenge (Gatt et al., 2009).",
        "Many other attribute selection algorithms also rely on training data to determine preferences in one form or another (Fabbrizio et al., 2008; Gervas et al., 2008; Kelleher, 2007; Spanger et al., 2008; Vi-ethen and Dale, 2010).",
        "Unfortunately, suitable data is hard to come by.",
        "It has been argued that determining which properties to include in a referring expression requires a \"semantically transparent\" corpus (van Deemter et al., 2006): a corpus that contains the actual properties of all domain objects as well as the properties that were selected for inclusion in a given reference to the target.",
        "Obviously, text corpora tend not to meet this requirement, which is why semantically transparent corpora are often collected using human participants who are asked to produce referring expressions for targets in controlled visual scenes for a given domain.",
        "Since this is a time consuming exercise, it will not be surprising that such corpora are thin on the ground (and are often only available for English).",
        "An important question therefore is how many human-produced references are needed to achieve a certain level ofperformance.",
        "Do we really need hundreds of instances, or can we already make informed decisions about preferences on a few or even one training instance?",
        "In this paper, we address this question by systematically training the graph-based REG algorithm on a number of \"semantically transparent\" data sets of various sizes and evaluating on a held-out test set.",
        "The graph-based algorithm seems a good candidate for this exercise, in view of its performance in the REG challenges.",
        "For the sake of comparison, we also follow the evaluation methodology of the REG challenges, training and testing on two domains (a furniture and a people domain), and using two automatic metrics (Dice and accuracy) to measure human-likeness.",
        "One hurdle needs to be taken beforehand.",
        "Krahmer et al.",
        "(2008) manually assigned one of three costs to properties, loosely based on corpus frequencies.",
        "For our current evaluation experiments, this would hamper comparison across data sets, because it is difficult to do it in a manner that is both consistent and meaningful.",
        "Therefore we first experiment with a more systematic way of assigning a limited number of frequency-based costs to properties using k-means clustering."

        "In this section we describe our experiment with k-means clustering to derive property costs from English and Dutch corpus data.",
        "For this experiment we looked at both English and Dutch, to make sure the chosen method does not only work well for English.",
        "Our English training and test data were taken from the TUNA corpus (Gatt et al., 2007).",
        "This semantically transparent corpus contains referring expressions in two domains (furniture and people), collected in one of two conditions: in the -LOC condition, participants were discouraged from mentioning the location of the target in the visual scene, whereas in the +LOC condition they could mention any properties they wanted.",
        "The TUNA corpus was used for comparative evaluation in the REG Challenges (2007-2009).",
        "For training in our current experiment, we used the -LOC data from the training 165 furniture descriptions and 136 people descriptions.",
        "For testing, we used the -LOC data from the TUNA 2009 development set: 38 furniture descriptions and 38 people descriptions.",
        "Dutch data were taken from the D-TUNA corpus (Koolen and Krahmer, 2010).",
        "This corpus uses the same visual scenes and annotation scheme as the TUNA corpus, but with Dutch instead of English descriptions.",
        "D-TUNA does not include locations as object properties at all, hence our restriction to -LOC data for English (to make the Dutch and English data more comparable).",
        "As Dutch test data, we used 40 furniture items and 40 people items, randomly selected from the textual descriptions in the D-TUNA corpus.",
        "The remaining furniture and people descriptions (160 items each) were used for training.",
        "We first determined the frequency with which each property was mentioned in our training data, relative to the number of target objects with this property.",
        "Then we created different cost functions (mapping properties to costs) by means ofk-means clustering, using the Weka toolkit.",
        "The k-means clustering algorithm assigns n points in a vector space to k clusters (Si to Sk) by assigning each point to the cluster with the nearest centroid.",
        "The total intra-cluster variance V is minimized by the function",
        "where ßi is the centroid of all the points Xj € Si.",
        "In our case, the points n are properties, the vector space is one-dimensional (frequency being the only dimension) and ßi is the average frequency of the properties in Si.",
        "The cluster-based costs are defined as follows:",
        "where S1 is the cluster with the most frequent properties, S2 is the cluster with the next most frequent properties, and so on.",
        "Using this approach, properties from cluster S1 get cost 0 and thus can be added \"for free\" to a description.",
        "Free properties are always included, provided they help distinguish the target.",
        "This may lead to overspecified descriptions, mimicking the human tendency to mention redundant properties (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "We ran the clustering algorithm on our English and Dutch training data for up to six clusters (k = 2 to k = 6).",
        "Then we evaluated the performance of the resulting cost functions on the test data from the same language, using Dice (overlap between attribute sets) and Accuracy (perfect match between sets) as evaluation metrics.",
        "For comparison, we also evaluated the best scoring cost functions from Theu-neetal.",
        "(2010) on our test data.",
        "These \"Free-Naive\" (FN) functions were created using the manual approach sketched in the introduction.",
        "The order in which the graph-based algorithm tries to add attributes to a description is explicitly controlled to ensure that \"free\" distinguishing properties are included (Viethen et al., 2008).",
        "In our tests, we used an order ofdecreasing frequency; i.e., always examining more frequent properties first.",
        "For the cluster-based cost functions, the best performance was achieved with k = 2, for both domains and both languages.",
        "Interestingly, this is the coarsest possible k-means function: with only two costs (0 and 1) it is even less fine-grained than the FN functions advocated by Krahmer et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "The results for the k-means costs with k = 2 and the FN costs of Theune et al.",
        "(2010) are shown in Table 1.",
        "No significant differences were found, which suggests that k-means clustering, with k = 2, can be used as a more systematic alternative for the manual assignment of frequency-based costs.",
