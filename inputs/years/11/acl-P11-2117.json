        "The task of text simplification aims to reduce the complexity of text while maintaining the content (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; Carroll et al., 1998; Feng, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we explore the sentence simplification problem: given a sentence, the goal is to produce an equivalent sentence where the vocabulary and sentence structure are simpler.",
        "Text simplification has a number of important applications.",
        "Simplification techniques can be used to make text resources available to a broader range of readers, including children, language learners, the elderly, the hearing impaired and people with aphasia or cognitive disabilities (Carroll et al., 1998; Feng, 2008).",
        "As a preprocessing step, simplification can improve the performance of NLP tasks, including parsing, semantic role labeling, machine translation and summarization (Miwa et al., 2010; Jonnaladrasekar and Srinivas, 1997).",
        "Finally, models for text simplification are similar to models for sentence compression; advances in simplification can benefit compression, which has applications in mobile devices, summarization and captioning (Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Galley and McKeown, 2007; Nomoto, 2009; Cohn and Lapata, 2009).",
        "One of the key challenges for text simplification is data availability.",
        "The small amount of simplification data currently available has prevented the application of data-driven techniques like those used in other text-to-text translation areas (Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2010).",
        "Most prior techniques for text simplification have involved either hand-crafted rules (Vickrey and Koller, 2008; Feng, 2008) or learned within a very restricted rule space (Chan-drasekar and Srinivas, 1997).",
        "We have generated a data set consisting of 137K aligned simplified/unsimplified sentence pairs by pairing documents, then sentences from English Wikipedia with corresponding documents and sentences from Simple English Wikipedia.",
        "Simple English Wikipedia contains articles aimed at children and English language learners and contains similar content to English Wikipedia but with simpler vocabulary and grammar.",
        "Figure 1 shows example sentence simplifications from the data set.",
        "Like machine translation and other text-to-text domains, text simplification involves the full range of transformation operations including deletion, rewording, reordering and insertion.",

        "For each aligned paragraph pair (i.e. a simple paragraph and one or more normal paragraphs), we then used a dynamic programming approach to find that best global sentence alignment following Barzi-lay and Elhadad (2003).",
        "Specifically, given n normal sentences to align to m simple sentences, we find a(n, m) using the following recurrence:",
        "where each line above corresponds to a sentence alignment operation: skip the simple sentence, skip the normal sentence, align one normal to one simple, align one normal to two simple, align two normal to one simple and align two normal to two simple.",
        "sim(i,j) is the similarity between the ith normal sentence and the j th simple sentence and was calculated using TF-IDF, cosine similarity.",
        "We set skipjpenalty = 0.0001 manually.",
        "Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) further discourage aligning dissimilar sentences by including a \"mismatch penalty\" in the similarity measure.",
        "Instead, we included a filtering step removing all sentence pairs with a normalized similarity below a threshold of 0.5.",
        "We found this approach to be more intuitive and allowed us to compare the effects of differing levels of similarity in the training set.",
        "Our choice of threshold is high enough to ensure that most alignments are correct, but low enough to allow for variation in the paired sentences.",
