        "While there have been great advances in the statistical modeling of hierarchical syntactic structure in the past 15 years, exact inference with such models remains very costly and most rich syntactic modeling approaches resort to heavy pruning, pipelining, or both.",
        "Graph-based pruning methods such as best-first and beam-search have both be used within context-free parsers to increase their efficiency.",
        "Pipeline systems make use of simpler models to reduce the search space of the full model.",
        "For example, the well-known Charniak parser (Char-niak, 2000) uses a simple grammar to prune the search space for a richer model in a second pass.",
        "Roark and Hollingshead (2008; 2009) have recently shown that using a finite-state tagger to close cells within the CKY chart can reduce the worst-case and average-case complexity of context-free parsing, without reducing accuracy.",
        "In their work, word positions are classified as beginning and/or ending multi-word constituents, and all chart cells not conforming to these constraints can be pruned.",
        "Zhang et al.",
        "(2010) and Bodenstab et al.",
        "(2011) both extend this approach by classifying chart cells with a finer granularity.",
        "Pruning based on constituent span is straightforwardly applicable to all parsing architectures, yet the methods mentioned above only consider spans of length two or greater.",
        "Lexical and unary productions spanning a single word are never pruned, and these can, in many cases, contribute significantly to the parsing effort.",
        "In this paper, we investigate complementary methods to prune chart cells with finite-state preprocessing.",
        "Informally, we use a tagger to restrict the number of unary productions with nonterminals on the right-hand side that can be included in cells spanning a single word.",
        "We term these single word constituents (SWCs) (see Section 2 for a formal definition).",
        "Disallowing SWCs alters span-1 cell population from potentially containing all nonterminals to just pre-terminal part-of-speech (POS) non-terminals.",
        "In practice, this decreases the number of active states in span-1 chart cells by 70%, significantly reducing the number of allowable constituents in larger spans.",
        "Span-1 chart cells are also the most frequently queried cells in the CKY algorithm.",
        "The search over possible midpoints will always include two cells spanning a single word - one as the first left child and one as the last right child.",

        "Note, however, that some methods of grammar access such as scanning through the rules ofa grammarand looking for matches in the chart - achieve less of a speedup from diminished cell population than others, something we investigate in this paper.",
        "Importantly, our method is orthogonal to prior work on tagging chart constraints and we expect efficiency gains to be additive.",
        "In what follows, we will demonstrate that a finite-state tagger can learn, with high accuracy, which span-1 chart cells can be closed to SWCs, and how such pruning can increase the efficiency of context-free parsing."

        "One implementation detail necessary to leverage the benefits of sparsely populated chart cells is the grammar access method used by the inner loop of the CKY algorithm.",
        "In bottom-up CKY parsing, to extend derivations ofadjacent substrings into new constituents spanning the combined string, one can either iterate over all binary productions in the grammar and test if the new derivation is valid (grammar loop), or one can take the crossproduct of active states in the cells spanning the substrings and poll the grammar for possible derivations (cross-product).",
        "With the crossproduct approach, fewer active states in either child cell leads to fewer grammar access operations.",
        "Thus, pruning constituents in lower cells directly affects the overall efficiency of parsing.",
        "On the other hand, with the grammar loop method there is a constant number of grammar access operations (i.e., the number of grammar rules) and the number of active states in each child cell has no impact on efficiency.",
        "Therefore, with the grammar loop implementation of the CYK algorithm, pruning techniques such as unary constraints will have very little impact on the final runtime efficiency of the parser.",

        "Additional transforms include (4) removing X – X unary productions for all non-terminals X, (5) collapsing unary chains to a single (possibly composite) unary production (Klein and Manning, 2001), (6) introducing new categories such as AUX (Charniak, 1997), and (7) collapsing of categories such as PRT and ADVP (Collins, 1997).",
        "For this paper we only apply transforms 1-3 and otherwise leave the treebank in its original form.",
        "We also note that ROOT unaries are a special case that do not affect search, and we choose to ignore them for the remainder of this paper.",

        "Table 1 displays the absolute counts of unaries in the treebank before and after processing.",
        "Multi-word constituent unary productions in the original treebank are rare and used primarily to mark quantifier phrases as noun phrases.",

        "The number of SWC unaries is relatively unchanged after processing the original treebank, but note that only 11.2% of words in the transformed treebank are covered by SWCs.",

        "This is true to some extent, but grammars induced from the WSJ treebank are notorious for over-generation.",
        "In addition, state-of-the-art accuracy in context-free parsing is often achieved by smoothing the grammar, so that rewrites from any one non-terminal to another are permissible, albeit with low probability.",
        "To empirically evaluate the impact of SWCs on span-1 chart cells, we parse the development set (section 24) with three different grammars induced from sections 2-21.",
        "Table 2 lists averaged counts of active Viterbi states (derivations with probability greater than zero) from span-1 cells within the dynamic programming chart, as well as relevant grammar statistics.",
        "Note that these counts are extracted from exhaustive parsing - no pruning has been applied.",
        "We notice two points of interest.",
        "First, although | VpOS | > | VpHR |, for the unsmoothed grammars more phrase-level states are active within the span-1 cells than states derived from POS tags.",
        "When parsing with the Markov order-2 grammar, 70% of active states are non-terminals from VPHR, and with the latent-variable grammar, 67% (152 of 227).",
        "This is due to the highly generative nature of SWC productions.",
        "Second, although using a smoothed grammar maximizes the number of active states, the unsmoothed grammars still provide many possible derivations per word.",
        "Given the infrequent use of SWCs in the treebank, and the search-space explosion incurred by including them in exhaustive search, it is clear that restricting SWCs in contexts where they are unlikely to occur has the potential for large efficiency gains.",

        "The Berkeley and BUBS parsers both parse with the Berkeley latent-variable grammar (Petrov and Klein, 2007b), while the Charniak parser uses a lexicalized grammar, and the exhaustive CKY algorithm is run with a simple Markov order-2 grammar.",

        "Applying unary and cell-closing constraints at this point in the coarse-to-fine pipeline speeds up the initial coarse-pass significantly, which accounted for almost half of the total parse time in the Berkeley parser.",
        "In addition, all subsequent fine-pass searches also benefit from additional pruning as their search is guided by the remaining constituents of the previous pass, which is the intersection of standard coarse-to-fine pruning and our imposed constraints.",
        "We apply constraints to the Charniak parser during the first-pass agenda-based search.",
        "Because an agenda-based search operates at a constituent level instead of a cell/span level, applying unary constraints alters the search frontier instead of reducing the absolute number of constituents placed in the chart.",
        "We jointly tune lambda and the internal search parameters of the Charniak parser until accuracy degrades.",

        "BUBS parsers both employ the crossproduct grammar access method discussed in Section 2, while the Berkeley parser uses the grammar loop method.",
        "This grammar access difference dampens the benefit of unary constraints for the Berkeley parser.",
        "Referring back to Figure 2, we see that both speed and accuracy increase in all but the Berkeley parser.",
        "Although it is unusual that pruning leads to higher accuracy during search, it is not unexpected here as our finite-state tagger makes use of lexical relationships that the PCFG does not.",
        "By leveraging this new information to constrain the search space, we are indirectly improving the quality of the model.",
