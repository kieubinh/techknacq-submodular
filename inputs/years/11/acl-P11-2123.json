        "As a hybrid representation, we also tested the effect of merging words with their corresponding SF (e.g. knife+ARTIFACT).",
        "This is a form of semantic specialization rather than generalization, and allows the parser to discriminate between the different senses of each word, but not generalize across words.",
        "For each of these three semantic representations, we experimented with using each of: (1) all open-class POSs (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), (2) nouns only, and (3) verbs only.",
