        "Bellare et al.",
        "reported that the discriminative approach achieves better accuracy than Espresso when the number of extracted pairs is increased because multiple features are used to support the evidence.",
        "However, three problems exist in their methods.",
        "First, they use only local context features.",
        "The discriminative approach is useful for using arbitrary features, however, they did not identify which feature or features are effective for the methods.",
        "Although the context features and attributes partly reduce entity word sense ambiguity, some ambiguous entities remain.",
        "For example, consider the domain broadcast program (PRG) and assume that PRG's attribute is advertisement.",
        "A false example is shown here: \"Android's advertisement employs Japanese popular actors.",
        "The attractive smartphone begins to target new users who are ordinary people.\"",
        "The entity Android belongs to the cellphone domain, not PRG, but appears with positive attributes or contexts because many cellphones are introduced in advertisements as same as broadcast program.",
        "By using topic, i.e. the genre of the document, we can distinguish \"Android\" from PRG and remove such false examples even if the false entity appeared with positive context strings or attributes.",
        "Second, they did not solve the problem of negative example selection.",
        "Because negative examples are necessary for discriminative training, they used all remaining examples, other than positive examples, as negative examples.",
        "Although this is the simplest technique, it is impossible to use all of the examples provided by a large-scale corpus for discriminative training.",
        "Third, their methods discriminate all candidates for new entities.",
        "This principle increases the risk of generating many false-positive examples and is inefficient.",
        "We solve these three problems by using topic information."
