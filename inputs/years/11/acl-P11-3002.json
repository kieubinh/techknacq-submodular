        "The canonical pipeline of text summarization consists of topic identification, interpretation, and summary generation (Hovy, 2005).",
        "In the simple case of extraction, topic identification and interpretation are conflated to sentence selection and concerned with summary informativeness.",
        "In comparison, summary generation addresses summary readability and a frequently discussed generation technique is sentence ordering.",
        "It is implicitly or explicitly stated that sentence ordering for summarization is primarily driven by coherence.",
        "For example, Barzilay et al.",
        "(2002) use lexical cohesion information to model local coherence.",
        "A statistical model by Lapata (2003) considers both lexical and syntactic features in calculating local coherence.",
        "More globally biased is Barzilay and Lee's (2004) HMM-based content model, which models global coherence with word distribution patterns.",
        "Whilst the above models treat coherence as lexical or topical relations, Barzilay and Lapata (2005, 2008) explicitly model local coherence with an entity grid model trained for optimal syntactic role transitions of entities.",
        "Although coherence in those works is modeled in the guise of \"lexical cohesion\", \"topic closeness\", \"content relatedness\", etc., few published works simultaneously accommodate coherence on the two levels: local coherence and global coherence, both of which are intriguing topics in text linguistics and psychology.",
        "For sentences, local coherence means the well-connectedness between adjacent sentences through lexical cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) or entity repetition (Grosz et al., 1995) and global coherence is the discourse-level relation connecting remote sentences (Mann and Thompson, 1995; Kehler, 2002).",
        "An abundance of psychological evidences show that coherence on both levels is manifested in text comprehension (Tapiero, 2007).",
        "Accordingly, an apt sentence ordering scheme should be driven by such concerns.",
        "We also note that as sentence ordering is usually discussed only in the context of multi-document summarization, factors other than coherence are also considered, such as time and source sentence position in Bollegala et al.",
        "'s (2006) \"agglomerative ordering\" approach.",
        "But it remains an open question whether sentence ordering is non-trivial for single-document summarization, as it has long been recognized as an actual strategy taken by human summarizers (Jing, 1998; Jing and McKeown, 2000) and acknowledged early in work on sentence ordering for multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper, we outline a grouping-based sentence ordering framework that is driven by the concern of local and global coherence.",
        "Summary sentences are grouped according to their conceptual relatedness before being ordered on two levels: group-level ordering and sentence-level ordering, which capture global coherence and local coherence in an integrated model.",
        "As a preliminary study, we applied the framework to singledocument summary generation and obtained interesting results.",
        "The main contributions of this work are: (1) we stress the need to channel sentence ordering research to linguistic and psychological findings about text coherence; (2) we propose a grouping-based ordering framework that integrates both local and global coherence; (3) we find in experiments that coherence-driven sentence ordering improves the readability of single-document summaries, for which sentence ordering is often considered trivial.",
        "In Section 2, we review related ideas and techniques in previous work.",
        "Section 3 provides the details of grouping-based sentence ordering.",
        "The preliminary experimental results are presented in Section 4.",
        "Finally, Section 5 concludes the whole paper and describes future work."

        "Our ordering framework is designed to capture both local and global coherence.",
        "Globally, we identify related groups among sentences and find their relative order.",
        "Locally, we strive to keep sentence similar or related in content close to each other within one group.",
        "As summary sentences are isolated from their original context, we retain the important content information by representing sentences as concept vectors.",
        "In the simplest case, the \"concept\" is equivalent to content word.",
        "A drawback of this practice is that it considers every content word equally contributive to the sentence content, which is not always true.",
        "For example, in the news domain, entities realized as NPs are more important than other concepts.",
        "To represent sentences as entity vectors, we identify both common entities (as the head nouns of NPs) and named entities.",
        "Two common entities are equivalent if their noun stems are identical or synonymous.",
        "Named entities are usually equated by identity.",
        "But in order to improve accuracy, we also consider: 1) structural subsumption (one is part of another); 2) hypernymy and holonymy (the named entities are in a superordinate-subordinate or part-whole relation).",
        "Now with summary sentence Si and m entities eik(k = 1 ... m), S, = (wfe√º), wfiei2), w/fom)), where wf(elk) = wkXffok), fielk) is the frequency of eik and wk is the weight of eik.",
        "We define wk = 1 if eik is a common entity and wk = 2 if eik is a named entity.",
        "We give double weight to named entities because of their significance to news articles.",
        "After all, a news story typically contains events, places, organizations, people, etc.",
        "that denote the news theme.",
        "Other things being equal, two sentences sharing a mention of named entities are thematically closer than two sentences sharing a mention of common entities.",
        "Alternatively, we can realize the \"concept\" as \"event\" because events are prevalent semantic constructs that bear much of the sentence content in some domains (e.g., narratives and news reports).",
        "To represent sentences as event vectors, we can follow Zhang et al.",
        "'s (2010) method at the cost of more complexity.",
        "To meet the global need of identifying sentence groups, we develop two grouping algorithms by applying graph-based operation and clustering.",
        "Connected Component Finding (CC)",
        "This algorithm treats grouping sentences as finding connected components (CC) in a text graph TG = ( V, E), where V represents the sentences and E the sentence relations weighted by cosine similarity.",
        "Edges with weight < t, a threshold, are removed because they represent poor sentence coherence.",
        "The resultant graph may be disconnected, in which we find all of its connected components, using depth-first search.",
        "The connected components are the groups we are looking for.",
        "Note that this method cannot guarantee that every two sentences in such a group are directly linked, but it does guarantee that there exists a path between every sentence pair.",
        "Modified K-means Clustering (MKM)",
        "Observing that the CC method finds only coherent groups, not necessarily groups of coherent sentences, we develop a second algorithm using clustering.",
        "A good choice might be K-means as it is efficient and outperforms agglomerative clustering methods in NLP applications (Steibach conventional K-means is the decision of K.",
        "Our solution is modified K-means (MKM) based on (Wilpon and Rabiner, 1985).",
        "Let's denote cluster i by CLi and cluster similarity by Sim(CL,) = ^in^SimiSm, Sin )), where Sim(Sm, Sm )is their cosine.",
        "The following illustrates the algorithm.",
        "The above algorithm stops iterating when each cluster contains all above-threshold-similarity sentence pairs or only one sentence.",
        "Unlike CC, MKM results in more strongly connected groups, or groups of coherence sentences.",
        "After the sentences are grouped, ordering is to be conducted on two levels: group and sentence.",
        "Composed of closely related sentences, groups simulate high-level textual constructs, such as \"central event\", \"cause\", \"effect\", \"background\", etc.",
        "for news articles, around which sentences are generated for global coherence.",
        "For an intuitive example, all sentences about \"cause\" should immediately precede all sentences about \"effect\" to achieve optimal readability.",
        "We propose two approaches to group-level ordering.",
        "1) If the group sentences come from the same document, group (G,) order is decided by the group-representing sentence (gt) order ( -< means \"precede\") in the text.",
        "2) Group order is decided in a greedy fashion in order to maximize the connectedness between adjacent groups, thus enhancing local coherence.",
        "Each time a group is selected to achieve maximum similarity with the ordered groups and the first ordered group (Gi) is selected to achieve maximum similarity with all the other groups.",
        "Ge{unordered groups} j=i",
        "where Sim(G, G') is the average sentence cosine similarity between G and G'.",
        "Within the ordered groups, sentence-level ordering is aimed to enhance local coherence by placing conceptually close sentences next to each other.",
        "Similarly, we propose two approaches.",
        "1) If the sentences come from the same document, they are arranged by the text order.",
        "2) Sentence order is greedily decided.",
        "Similar to the decision of group order, with ordered sentence Spi in group Gp:",
        "Sejunordered sentences in Gp} j=1",

        "On some occasions, e.g., a news article adopting the \"Wall Street Journal Formula\" (Rich and Harper, 2007) where conceptually related sentences are placed at the beginning and the end, sentence conceptual relatedness does not necessarily correlate with spatial proximity and thus selected sentences may need to be rearranged for better readability.",

        "In our implementation of the grouping-based ordering, sentences are represented as entity vectors and the threshold t = Avg(Sim(Sm, Sn )) x c, the average sentence similarity in a group multiplied by a coefficient empirically decided on separate held-out datasets of 20 documents for each length category.",
        "The \"group-representing sentence\" is the textually earliest sentence in the group.",

        "For example, \"CC/T/G\" means grouping with CC, group ordering with text order, and sentence ordering with the greedy approach.",
        "We evaluated the test orderings against the 3 reference orderings and compute the average (Madnani et al., 2007) by using 3 different metrics.",
        "The first metric is Kendall's t (Lapata 2003, 2006) , which has been reliably used in ordering evaluations (Bollegala et al., 2006; Madnani et al., 2007) .",
        "It measures ordering differences in terms of the number of adjacent sentence inversions necessary to convert a test ordering to the reference ordering.",
        "In this formula, m represents the number of inversions described above and N is the total number of sentences.",
        "The second metric is the Average Continuity (AC) proposed by Bollegala et al.",
        "(2006), which captures the intuition that the quality of sentence orderings can be estimated by the number of correctly arranged continuous sentences.",
        "In this formula, k is the maximum number of continuous sentences, a is a small value in case Pn= 1.",
        "Pn, the proportion of continuous sentences of length n in an ordering, is defined as m/(N - n + 1) where m is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test and reference orderings and N is the total number of sentences.",
        "Following (Bollegala et al., 2006), we set k = Mn(4, N) and a = 0.01.",
        "We also go a step further by considering only the continuous sentences in a paragraph marked by human annotators, because paragraphs are local meaning units perceived by human readers and the order of continuous sentences in a paragraph is more strongly grounded than the order of continuous sentences across paragraph boundaries.",
        "So in-paragraph sentence continuity is a better estimation for the quality of sentence orderings.",
        "This is our third metric: Paragraph-level Average Continuity (P-AC).",
        "Here PPn = m '/(N - n + 1), where m ' is the number of continuous sentences of length n in both the test ordering and a paragraph of the reference ordering.",
