        "The MWEs are extracted by an unsupervised method and classified into two distinct classes, namely locations and person names.",
        "The classification is based on simple heuristics that take the co-occurrence of MWEs with distinct postpositions into account.",
        "The resulting classes are evaluated against a hand-annotated gold standard and achieve an f-score of 0.5 and 0.746 for locations and persons, respectively.",
        "A target application is the Urdu ParGram grammar, where MWEs are needed to generate a more precise syntactic and semantic analysis."

      "text": [
        "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are expressions which can be semantically and syntactically idiosyncratic in nature; acting as a single unit, their meaning is not always predictable from their components.",
        "Their identification is therefore an important task for any Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that goes beyond the analysis of pure surface structure, in particular for languages with few other NL P tools available.",
        "There is a vast amount of literature on extracting and classifying MWEs automatically; many approaches rely on already available resources that aid during the acquisition process.",
        "In the case of the Indo-Aryan language Urdu, a lack of linguistic resources such as annotated corpora or lexical knowledge bases impedes the task of detecting and classifying MWEs.",
        "Nevertheless, statistical measures and language-specific syntactic information can be employed to extract and classify MWEs.",
        "Therefore, the method described in this paper can partly overcome the bottleneck of resource sparsity, despite the relatively small size of the available corpus and the simplistic approach taken.",
        "With the help of heuristics as to the occurrence of Urdu MWEs with characteristic postpositions and other cues, it is possible to cluster the MWEs into two groups: locations and person names.",
        "It is also possible to detect junk MWEs.",
        "The classification is then evaluated against a hand-annotated gold standard of Urdu MWEs.",
        "An NLP tool where the MWEs can be employed is the Urdu ParGram grammar (Butt and King, 2007; Bogel et al., 2007; Bogel et al., 2009), which is based on the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism (Dalrymple, 2001).",
        "For this task, different types of MWEs need to be distinguished as they are treated differently in the syntactic analysis.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of related work, in particular on MWE extraction in Indo-Aryan languages.",
        "Section 3 describes our methodology, with the evaluation following in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 presents the Urdu ParGram Grammar and its treatment of MWEs, followed by the discussion and the summary of the paper in Section 6."

        "MWE extraction and classification has been the focus of a large amount of research.",
        "However, much work",
        "has been conducted for well-resourced languages such as English, benefiting from large enough corpora (Attia et al., 2010), parallel data (Zarrieß and Kuhn, 2009) and NLP tools such as taggers or dependency parsers (Martens and Vandeghinste (2010), among others) and lexical resources (Pearce, 2001).",
        "Related work on Indo-Aryan languages has mostly focused on the extraction of complex predicates, with the focus on Hindi (Mukerjee et al., 2006; Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Sinha, 2009) and Bengali (Das et al., 2010; Chakraborty and Bandy-opadhyay, 2010).",
        "While complex predicates also make up a large part of the verbal inventory in Urdu (Butt, 1993), for the scope of this paper, we restrict ourselves to classifying MWEs as locations or person names and filter out junk bigrams.",
        "Our approach deviates in several aspects to the related work in Indo-Aryan: First, we do not concentrate on specific POS constructions or dependency relations, but use an unannotated middle-sized corpus.",
        "For classification, we use simple heuristics by taking the postpositions of the MWEs into account.",
        "These can provide hints as to the nature of the MWE."

      "text": [
        "The bigram extraction was carried out on a corpus of around 8.12 million tokens of Urdu newspaper text, collected by the Center for Research in Urdu Language Processing (CRULP) (Hussain, 2008).",
        "We did not perform any preprocessing such as POS tagging or stop word removal.",
        "Due to the relatively small size of our corpus, the frequency cut-off for bigrams was set to 5, i.e. all bigrams that occurred five times or more in the corpus were considered.",
        "This rendered a list of 172,847 bigrams which were then ranked with the X association measure, using the UCS toolkit.",
        "The reasons for employing the X association measure are twofold.",
        "First, papers using comparatively sized corpora reported encouraging results for similar experiments (Ramisch et al., 2008; Kizito et al., 2009).",
        "Second, initial manual comparison between MWE lists ranked according to all measures implemented in the UCS toolkit revealed the most convincing results for the X test.",
        "For the time being, we focus on bigram MWE extraction.",
        "While the UCS toolkit readily supports work on Unicode-based languages such as Urdu, it does not support trigram extraction; other freely available tools such as text-nsp do come with trigram support, but cannot handle Unicode script.",
        "As a consequence, we currently implement our own scripts to overcome these limitations.",
        "The clustering approach taken in this paper is based on Urdu-specific syntactic information that can be gathered straightforwardly from the corpus.",
        "Urdu has a number of postpositions that can be used to identify the nature of an MWE.",
        "Typographical cues such as initial capital letters do not exist in the Urdu script.",
        "Locative postpositions The postposition j (par) either expresses location on something which has a surface or that an object is next to something.",
        "In addition, it expresses movement to a destination.",
        "nAdiyah t3ul AbEb par gAyI",
        "Nadya Tel Aviv to go.Perf.Fem.Sg 'Nadya went to Tel Aviv.'",
        "ijy (mEN) expresses location in or at a point in space or time, whereas & (tak) denotes that something extends to a specific point in space.",
        "jw (sE) shows movement away from a certain point in space.",
        "These postpositions mostly occur with locations and are thus syntactic indicators for this type of MWE.",
        "However, in special cases, they can also occur with other nouns, in which case we predict wrong results during classification.",
        "Person-indicating syntactic cues To classify an MWE as a person, we consider syntactic cues that usually occur after such MWEs.",
        "The ergative marker J (nE) describes an agentive subject in transitive",
        "et al. (2010).",

        "The accusative and dative case marker (kO) is also a possible indicator that the preceding MWE is a person.",
        "These cues can also appear with common nouns, but the combination of MWE and syntactic cue hints to a person MWE.",
        "However, consider cases such as New Delhi said that the taxes will rise., where New Delhi is treated as an agent with nE attached to it, providing a wrong clue as to the nature of the MWE.",
        "The classification of the extracted bigrams is solely based on syntactic information as described in the previous section.",
        "For every bigram, the postpositions that it occurs with are extracted from the corpus, together with the frequency of the cooccurrence.",
        "Table 1 shows which postpositions are expected to occur with which type of MWE.",
        "The first stipulation is that only bigrams that occur with one of the locative postpositions plus the ablative/instrumental marker jw (sE) one or more times are considered to be locative MWEs (LOC).",
        "In contrast, bigrams are judged as persons (PERS) when they co-occur with all postpositions apart from the locative postpositions one or more times.",
        "If a bigram occurs with none of the postpositions, it is judged as being junk (JUNK).",
        "As a consequence this means that theoretically valid MWEs such as complex predicates, which never occur with a postposition, are misclassified as being junk.",
        "Without any further processing, the resulting clusters are then evaluated against a hand-annotated gold standard, as described in the following section."
