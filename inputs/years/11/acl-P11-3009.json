        "For French, the ANNODIS project for annotation of discourse (Pery-Woodley et al., 2009) will provide an original, discourse-annotated corpus.",
        "Resources for Czech are also becoming available (Zikanova et al., 2010).",
        "For German, a lexicon of discourse connectives exists since the 1990s, namely DiMLex for lexicon of discourse markers (Stede and Umbach, 1998).",
        "An equivalent, more recent database for French is LexConn for lexicon of connectives (Roze et al., 2010) - containing a list of 328 explicit connectives.",
        "For each of them, Lex-Conn indicates and exemplifies the possible senses, chosen from a list of 30 labels inspired from Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "For the first classification experiments in Section 4, we concentrated on English and the explicit connectives in the PDTB data.",
        "The sense hierarchy used in the PDTB consists of three levels, reaching from four top level senses (Temporal, Contingency, Comparison and Expansion) via 16 subsenses on the second level to 23 further subsenses on the third level.",
        "As the annotators were allowed to assign one or two senses for each connective there are 129 possible simple or complex senses for more than 18,000 explicit connectives.",
        "The PDTB further sees connectives as discourse-level predicates that have two propositional arguments.",
        "Argument 2 is the one containing the explicit connective.",
        "The sentence from the first example in Table 1 can be represented as while(So what we...[argument 1], the Office itself... [argument 2]), which is very helpful to examine the context of a connective (see Section 4.1 on features).",
        "The release of the PDTB had quite an impact on disambiguation experiments.",

        "However, when using all 100 types of connectives and the whole PDTB training set, it is not so difficult to achieve such a high score, because of the large amount of instances and the rather broad distinction of the four main classes only.",
        "As we show in the next section, when building separate classifiers for specific connectives with senses from the more detailed second hierarchy level of the PDTB, it is more difficult to reach high accuracies.",
