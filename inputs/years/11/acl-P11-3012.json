        "Example 1.1: I bought a new car yesterday.",
        "I love the powerful engine.",
        "determining the sentiment the author is expressing about the car requires knowing that the engine is a part of the car so that the positive sentiment being expressed about the engine can also be attributed to the car.",

        "The Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) Corpus (Mitchell, et al., 2005) is one of the most common corpora for performing relation extraction.",
        "In addition to the co-reference annotations, the Corpus is annotated to indicate 23 different relations between real-world entities that are mentioned in the same sentence.",
        "The documents consist of broadcast news transcripts and newswire articles from a variety of news organizations.",
        "The JDPA Corpus consists of 457 documents containing discussions about cars, and 180 documents discussing cameras (Kessler et al., 2010).",
        "In this work we only use the automotive documents.",
        "The documents are drawn from a variety of sources, and we particularly focus on the 24% of the documents from the JDPA Power Steering blog, 18% from Blogspot, and 18% from LiveJournal.",
        "The annotated mentions in the Corpus are single or multi-word expressions which refer to a particular real world or abstract entity.",
        "The mentions are annotated to indicate sets of mentions which constitute co-reference groups referring to the same entity.",
        "Five relationships are annotated between these entities: PartOf, FeatureOf, Produces, InstanceOf, and MemberOf.",
        "One significant difference between these relation annotations and those in the ACE Corpus is that the former are relations between sets of mentions (the co-reference groups) rather than between individual mentions.",
        "This means that these relations are not limited to being between mentions in the same sentence.",
        "So in Example 1.1, \"engine\" would be marked as a part of \"car\" in the JDPA Corpus annotations, but there would be no relation annotated in the ACE Corpus.",

        "The classification of each mention pair is performed using a support vector machine implemented using libLinear (Fan et al., 2008).",

        "The Mention Level, Overlap, Base Phrase Chunking, Dependency Tree, and Parse Tree features are the same as Zhou et al.",
        "(except for using the Stanford Parser rather than the Collins Parser).",

        "• Word Features: Identical, except rather than using a heuristic to determine the head word of the phrase it is chosen to be the noun (or any other word if there are no nouns in the mention) that is the least deep in the parse tree.",
        "This change has minimal impact.",
        "• Entity Types: Some of the entity types in the JDPA Corpus indicate the type of the relation (e.g. CarFeature, CarPart) and so we replace those entity types with \"Unknown\".",
        "• Token Class: We added an additional feature (TC12+ET12) indicating the Token Class of the head words (e.g.",
        "Abbreviation, DollarAm-mount, Honorific) combined with the entity types.",
        "• Semantic Information: These features are specific to the ACE relations and so are not used.",

        "Both the ACE news documents, and the JDPA authored documents are written by professional writers with stronger editorial standards than the other JDPA Corpus documents, and the relation extraction system performs much better on professionally edited documents.",
        "The heavy use of pronouns and less descriptive mention phrases in the other documents seems to be one cause of the reduction in relation extraction performance.",
        "There is also some evidence that because of the greater number of relations in the JPDA authored documents that the classifier training data could be skewed more towards those documents.",
