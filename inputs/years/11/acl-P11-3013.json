        "Noun phrase structure in the Penn Treebank has up until recently been only considered, due to under-specification, a flat structure.",
        "Due to the annotation and work of Vadas and Curran (2007a; 2007b; 2008), we are now able to create Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems that take advantage of the internal structure of noun phrases in the Penn Treebank.",
        "This extra internal structure introduces additional complications in NLP applications such as parsing.",
        "Dependency parsing has been a prime focus of NLP research of late due to its ability to help parse languages with a free word order.",
        "Dependency parsing has been shown to improve NLP systems in certain languages and in many cases is considered the state of the art in the field.",
        "Dependency parsing made many improvements due to the CoNLL X shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "However, in most cases, these systems were trained with a flat noun phrase structure in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Vadas' internal noun phrase structure has been used in previous work on constituent parsing using Collin's parser (Vadas and Curran, 2007c), but has yet to be analyzed for its effects on dependency parsing.",
        "Parsing is very early in the NLP pipeline.",
        "Therefore, improvements in parsing output could have an improvement on other areas of NLP in many cases, such as Machine Translation.",
        "At the same time, any errors in parsing will tend to propagate down the NLP pipeline.",
        "One would expect parsing accuracy to be reduced when the complexity of the parse is increased, such as adding noun phrase structure.",
        "But, for a machine translation system that is reliant on parsing, the new noun phrase structure, even with reduced parser accuracy, may yield improvements due to a more detailed grammatical structure.",
        "This is particularly of interest for dependency relations, as it may aid in finding the correct head of a term in a complex noun phrase.",
        "This paper examines the results and errors in parsing and machine translation of dependency parsers, trained with annotated noun phrase structure, against those with a flat noun phrase structure.",
        "These results are compared with two systems: a Baseline Parser with no internally annotated noun phrases and a Gold NP Parser trained with data which contains gold standard internal noun phrase structure annotation.",
        "Additionally, we analyze the effect of these improvements and errors in parsing down the NLP pipeline on the TectoMT machine translation system (Zabokrtsky et al., 2008).",
        "Section 2 contains background information needed to understand the individual components of the experiments.",
        "The methodology used to carry out the experiments is described in Section 3.",
        "Results are shown and discussed in Section 4.",

        "Dependence parsing is an alternative view to the common phrase or constituent parsing techniques used with the Penn Treebank.",
        "Dependency relations can be used in many applications and have been shown to be quite useful in languages with a free word order.",
        "With the influx of many data-driven techniques, the need for annotated dependency relations is apparent.",
        "Since there are many data sets with constituent relations annotated, this paper uses free conversion software provided from the CoNLL 2008 shared task to create dependency relations (Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008).",
        "Dependency parsing comes in two main forms: Graph algorithms and Greedy algorithms.",
        "The two most popular algorithms are McDonald's MST-Parser (McDonald et al., 2005) and Nivre's Malt-Parser (Nivre, 2003).",
        "Each parser has its advantages and disadvantages, but the accuracy overall is approximately the same.",
        "The types of errors made by each parser, however, are very different.",
        "MST-Parser is globally trained for an optimal solution and this has led it to get the best results on longer sentences.",
        "MaltParser on the other hand, is a greedy algorithm.",
        "This allows it to perform extremely well on shorter sentences, as the errors tend to propagate and cause more egregious errors in longer sentences with longer dependencies (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).",
        "We expect each parser to have different errors handling internal noun phrase structure, but for this paper we will only be examining the globally trained",
        "MSTParser.",
        "TectoMT is a machine translation framework based on Praguian tectogrammatics (Sgall, 1967) which represents four main layers: word layer, morphological layer, analytical layer, and tectogrammatical layer (Popel et al., 2010).",
        "This framework is primarily focused on the translation from English into Czech.",
        "Since much of dependency parsing work has been focused on Czech, this choice of machine translation framework logically follows as TectoMT makes direct use of the dependency relationships.",

        "TectoMT is a modular framework built in Perl.",
        "This allows great ease in adding the two different parsers into the framework since each experiment can be run as a separate \"Scenario\" comprised of different parsing \"Blocks\".",
        "This allows a simple comparison of two machine translation system in which everything remains constant except the dependency parser.",
        "The Penn Treebank is one of the most well known English language treebanks (Marcus et al., 1993), consisting of annotated portions of the Wall Street Journal.",
        "Much of the annotation task is painstakingly done by annotators in great detail.",
        "Some structures are not dealt with in detail, such as noun phrase structure.",
        "Not having this information makes it difficult to tell the dependencies on phrases such as \"crude oil prices\" (Vadas and Curran, 2007c).",
        "Without internal annotation it is ambiguous whether the phrase is stating \"crude prices\" (crude (oil prices)) or \"crude oil\" ((crude oil) prices).",
        "crude oil prices crude oil prices",
        "Manual annotation of these phrases would be quite time consuming and as seen in the example above, sometimes ambiguous and therefore prone to poor inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Vadas and Curran have constructed a Gold standard version Penn treebank with these structures.",
        "They were also able to train supervised learners to an F-score of 91.44% (Vadas and Curran, 2007a; Vadas and Curran, 2007b; Vadas and Curran, 2008).",
