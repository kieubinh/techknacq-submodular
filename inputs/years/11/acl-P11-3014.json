        "The automatic summarization of text is a prominent task in the field of natural language processing (NLP).",
        "While significant achievements have been made using statistical analysis and sentence extraction, \"true abstractive summarization remains a researcher's dream\" (Radev et al., 2002).",
        "Although existing systems produce high-quality summaries of relatively simple articles, there are limitations as to the types of documents these systems can handle.",
        "One such limitation is the summarization of multimodal documents: no existing system is able to incorporate the non-text portions of a document (e.g., information graphics, images) into the overall summary.",
        "Carberry et al.",
        "(2006) showed that the content of information graphics is often not repeated in the article's text, meaning important information may be overlooked if the graphical content is not included in the summary.",
        "Systems that perform statistical analysis of text and extract sentences from the original article to assemble a summary cannot access the information contained in non-text components, let alone seamlessly combine that information with the extracted text.",
        "The problem is that information from the text and graphical components can only be integrated at the conceptual level, necessitating a semantic understanding of the underlying concepts.",
        "Our proposed framework enables the generation of abstractive summaries from unified semantic models, regardless of the original format of the information sources.",
        "We contend that this framework is more akin to the human process of conceptual integration and regeneration in writing an abstract, as compared to the traditional NLP techniques of rating and extracting sentences to form a summary.",
        "Furthermore, this approach enables us to generate summary sentences about the information collected from graphical formats, for which there are no sentences available for extraction, and helps avoid the issues of coherence and ambiguity that tend to affect extraction-based summaries (Nenkova, 2006)."

        "Summarization is generally seen as a two-phase process: identifying the important elements of the document, and then using those elements to construct a summary.",
        "Most work in this area has focused on extractive summarization, assembling the summary from sentences representing the information in a document (Kupiec et al., 1995).",
        "Statistical methods are often employed to find key words and phrases (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999).",
        "Discourse structure (Marcu, 1997) also helps indicate the most important sentences.",
        "Various machine learning techniques have been applied (Aone et al., 1999; Lin, 1999), as well as approaches combining surface, content, relevance and event features (Wong et al., 2008).",
        "However, a few efforts have been directed towards abstractive summaries, including the modification (i.e., editing and rewriting) of extracted sentences (Jing and McKeown, 1999) and the generation of novel sentences based on a deeper understanding of the concepts being described.",
        "Lexical chains, which capture relationships between related terms in a document, have shown promise as an intermediate representation for producing summaries (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).",
        "Our work shares similarities with the knowledge-based text condensation model of Reimer and Hahn (1988), as well as with Rau et al.",
        "(1989), who developed an information extraction approach for conceptual information summarization.",
        "While we also build a conceptual model, we believe our method of construction will produce a richer representation.",
        "Moreover, Reimer and Hahn did not actually produce a natural language summary, but rather a condensed text graph.",
        "Efforts towards the summarization of multimodal documents have included naive approaches relying on image captions and direct references to the image in the text (Bhatia et al., 2009), while content-based image analysis and NLP techniques are being combined for multimodal document indexing and retrieval in the medical domain (Neveol et al., 2009)."

      "text": [
        "Our method consists of the following steps: building the semantic model, rating the informational content, and generating a summary.",
        "We construct the semantic model in a knowledge representation based on typed, structured objects organized under a foundational ontology (McDonald, 2000).",
        "To analyze the text, we use Sparser, a linguistically-sound, phrase structure-based chart parser with an extensive and extendible semantic grammar (McDonald, 1992).",
        "For the purposes of this proposal, we assume a relatively complete semantic grammar exists for the domain of documents to be summarized.",
        "In the prototype implementation (currently in progress), we are manually extending an existing grammar on an as-needed basis, with plans for large-scale learning of new rules and ontology definitions as future work.",
        "Projects like the Never-Ending Language Learner (Carlson et al., 2010) may enable us to induce these resources automatically.",
        "Although our framework is general enough to cover any image type, as well as other modalities (e.g., audio, video), since image understanding research has not yet developed tools capable of extracting semantic content from every possible image, we must restrict our focus to a limited class of images for the prototype implementation.",
        "Information graphics, such as bar charts and line graphs, are commonly found in popular media (e.g., magazines, newspapers) accompanying article text.",
        "To integrate this graphical content, we use the SIGHT system (Demir et al., 2010b) which identifies the intended message of a bar chart or line graph along with other salient propositions conveyed by the graphic.",
        "Extending the prototype to incorporate other modalities would not entail a significant change to the framework.",
        "However, it would require adding a module capable of mapping the particular modality to its underlying message-level semantic content.",
        "The next sections provide detail regarding the steps of our method, which will be illustrated on a short article from the May 29, 2006 edition of Businessweek magazine entitled, \"Will Medtronic's Pulse Quicken?\"",
        "This particular article was chosen due to good coverage in the existing Sparser grammar for the business news domain, and because it appears in the corpus of multimodal documents made available by the SIGHT project.",

        "Intuitively, the concepts containing the most information and having the most connections to other important concepts in the model are those we'd like to convey in the summary.",
        "We propose the use of an information density metric (ID) which rates a concept's importance based on a number of factors:",

        "• Number of expressions (e) realizing the concept in the current document",
        "• Prominence based on document and rhetorical structure (WD & Wr), and salience assessed by the graph understanding system (WG)",
        "Saturation refers to the level of completeness with which the knowledge base entry for a given concept is \"filled-out\" by information obtained from the document.",
        "As information is collected about a concept, the corresponding slots in its concept model entry are assigned values.",
        "The more slots that are filled, the more we know about a given instance of a concept.",
        "When all slots are filled, the model entry for that concept is \"complete,\" at least as far as the ontological definition of the concept category is concerned.",
        "As saturation level is sensitive to the amount of detail in the ontology definition, this factor must be normalized by the number of attribute slots in its definition, thus log(s) above.",
        "In Figure 3 we can see an example of relative saturation level by comparing the attribute slots for Company2 with that of Company1 in Figure 2.",
        "Since the \"Stock\" slot is filled for Medtronic and remains empty for Harris Nesbitt, we say that the concept for Company1 is more saturated (i.e., more complete) than that of Company2.",

        "For the intended message and informational propositions conveyed by the graphics, the weights assigned by SIGHT are incorporated into ID as WG.",
        "After computing the ID of each concept, we will apply Demir's (2010a) graph-based ranking algorithm to select items for the summary.",
        "This algorithm is based on PageRank (Page et al., 1999), but with several changes.",
        "Beyond centrality assessment based on relationships between concepts, it also incorporates apriori importance nodes that enable us to capture concept completeness, number of expressions, and document and rhetorical structure.",
        "More importantly from a generation perspective, Demir's algorithm iteratively selects concepts one at a time, re-ranking the remaining items by increasing the weight of related concepts and discounting redundant ones.",
        "Thus, we favor concepts that ought to be conveyed together while avoiding redundancy.",
        "After we determine which concepts are most important as scored by ID, the next step is to decide what to say about them and express these elements as sentences.",
        "Following the generation technique of McDonald and Greenbacker (2010), the expressions observed by the parser and stored in the model are used as the \"raw material\" for expressing the concepts and relationships.",
        "The two most important concepts as rated in the semantic model built from the Medtronic article would be Company1 (\"Medtronic\") and Person1 (\"Joanne Wuensch,\" a stock analyst).",
        "To generate a single summary sentence for this document, we should try to find some way of expressing these concepts together using the available phrasings.",
        "Since there is no direct link between these two concepts in the model (see Figure 1), none of the collected phrasings can express both concepts at the same time.",
        "Instead, we need to find a third concept that provides a semantic link between Company1 and Person1.",
        "If multiple options are available, deciding which linking concept to use becomes a microplanning problem, with the choice depending on linguistic constraints and the relative importance of the applicable linking concepts.",
        "In this example, a reasonable selection would be TargetStockPrice1 (see Figure 1).",
        "Combining original phrasings from all three concepts (via substitution and adjunction operations on the underlying TAG trees), along with a \"built-in\" realization inherited by the TargetStockPrice category (a subtype of Expectation - not shown in the figure), produces a construction resulting in this final surface form:",
        "Wuensch expects a 12-month target of 62 for medical device giant Medtronic.",
        "Thus, we generate novel sentences, albeit with some \"recycled\" expressions, to form an abstractive summary of the original document.",
        "Studies have shown that nearly 80% of human-written summary sentences are produced by a cut-and-paste technique of reusing original sentences and editing them together in novel ways (Jing and McKeown, 1999).",
        "By reusing selected short phrases (\"cutting\") coupled together with generalized constructions (\"pasting\"), we can generate abstracts similar to human-written summaries.",
        "The set of available expressions is augmented with numerous built-in schemas for realizing common relationships such as \"is-a\" and \"has-a,\" as well as realizations inherited from other conceptual categories in the hierarchy.",
        "If the knowledge base persists between documents, storing the observed expressions and making them available for later use when realizing concepts in the same category, the variety of utterances we can generate is increased.",
        "With a sufficiently rich set of expressions, the reliance on straightforward \"recycling\" is reduced while the amount of paraphrasing and transformation is increased, resulting in greater novelty of production.",
