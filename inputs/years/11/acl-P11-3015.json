        "Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying positive and negative opinions, sentiments, emotions and attitudes expressed in text.",
        "Although there has been in the past few years a growing interest in this field for different text genres such as newspaper text, reviews and narrative text, relatively less emphasis has been placed on extraction of opinions from scientific literature, more specifically, citations.",
        "Analysis of citation sentiment would open up many exciting new applications in bibliographic search and in bibliomet-rics, i.e., the automatic evaluation the influence and impact of individuals and journals via citations.",
        "Existing bibliometric measures like H-Index (Hirsch, 2005) and adapted graph ranking algorithms like PageRank (Radev et al., 2009) treat all citations as equal.",
        "However, Bonzi (1982) argued that if a cited work is criticised, it should consequently carry lower or even negative weight for bibliometric measures.",
        "Automatic citation sentiment detection is a prerequisite for such a treatment.",
        "Moreover, citation sentiment detection can also help researchers during search, by detecting problems with a particular approach.",
        "It can be used as a first step to scientific summarisation, enable users to recognise unaddressed issues and possible gaps in the current research, and thus help them set their research directions.",
        "For other genres a rich literature on sentiment detection exists and researchers have used a number of features such as n-grams, presence of adjectives, adverbs and other parts-of-speech (POS), negation, grammatical and dependency relations as well as specialised lexicons in order to detect sentiments from phrases, words, sentences and documents.",
        "State-of-the-art systems report around 85-90% accuracy for different genres of text (Nakagawa et al., 2010; Yessenalina et al., 2010; Tackstrom and McDonald, 2011).",
        "Given such good results, one might think that a sentence-based sentiment detection system trained on a different genre could be used equally well to classify citations.",
        "We argue that this might not be the case; our citation sentiment recogniser uses specialised training data and tests the performance of specialised features against current state-of-the-art features.",
        "The reasons for this are based on the following observations:",
        "• Sentiment in citations is often hidden.",
        "This might",
        "be because of the general strategy to avoid overt criticism due to the sociological aspect of citing (MacRoberts and MacRoberts, 1984; Thompson and Yiyun, 1991).",
        "Ziman (1968) states that many works are cited out of \"politeness, policy or piety\".",
        "Negative sentiment, while still present and detectable for humans, is expressed in subtle ways and might be hedged, especially when it cannot be quantitatively justified (Hyland, 1995).",
        "While SCL has been successfully applied to POS tagging and Sentiment Analysis (Blitzer et al., 2006), its effectiveness for parsing was rather unexplored.",
        "• Citation sentences are often neutral with respect to sentiment, either because they describe an algorithm, approach or methodology objectively, or because they are used to support a fact or statement.",
        "There are five different IBM translation models (Brown etal.",
        ", 1993).",
        "This gives rise to a far higher proportion ofobjec-tive sentences than in other genres.",
        "• Negative polarity is often expressed in contrastive terms, e.g. in evaluation sections.",
        "Although the sentiment is indirect in these cases, its negativity is implied by the fact that the authors' own work is clearly evaluated positively in comparison.",
        "This method was shown to outperform the class based model proposed in (Brown et al., 1992) .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "• There is also much variation between scientific texts and other genres concerning the lexical items chosen to convey sentiment.",
        "Sentiment carrying science-specific terms exist and are relatively frequent, which motivates the use of a sentiment lexicon specialised to science.",
        "Similarity-based smoothing (Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999) provides an intuitively appealing approach to language modeling.",
        "• Technical terms play a large role overall in scientific text (Justeson and Katz, 1995).",
        "Some of these carry sentiment as well.",
        "Current state of the art machine translation systems (Och, 2003) use phrasal (n-gram) features .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "For this reason, using higher order n-grams might prove to be useful in sentiment detection.",
        "• The scope of influence of citations varies widely from a single clause (as in the example below) to several paragraphs:",
        "As reported in Table 3, small increases in METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST scores (Doddington, 2002) suggest that .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "This affects lexical features directly since there could be \"sentiment overlap\" associated with neighbouring citations.",
        "Ritchie et al.",
        "(2008) showed that assuming larger citation scopes has a positive effect in retrieval.",
        "We will test the opposite direction here, i.e., we assume short scopes and use a parser to split sentences, so that the features associated with the clauses not directly connected to the citation are disregarded.",
        "We created a new sentiment-annotated corpus of scientific text in the form of a sentence-based collection of over 8700 citations.",
        "Our experiments use a supervised classifier with the state-of-the-art features from the literature, as well as new features based on the observations above.",
        "Our results show that the most successful feature combination includes dependency features and n-grams longer than for other genres (n = 3), but the assumption of a smaller scope (sentence splitting) decreased results."

        "(2002), we use uni-grams and bigrams as features and also add 3-grams as new features to capture longer technical terms.",
        "POS tags are also included using two approaches: attaching the tag to the word by a delimiter, and appending all tags at the end of the sentence.",
        "This may help in distinguishing between homonyms with different POS tags and signalling the presence of adjectives (e.g., JJ) respectively.",

        "Features previously found to be useful for detecting phrase-level contextual polarity (Wilson et al., 2009) are also included.",

        "Similarly, the number of valance shifters (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006) in the sentence are also used.",
        "The polarity shifter and negation phrase lists have been taken from the OpinionFinder system (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "We explore three different feature sets which focus on the lexical and grammatical structure of a sentence and have not been explored previously for the task of sentiment analysis of scientific text.",
        "The first set of these features include typed dependency structures (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) which describe the grammatical relationships between words.",
        "We aim to capture the long distance relationships between words.",
        "For instance in the sentence below, the relationship between results and competitive will be missed by trigrams but the dependency representation captures it in a single feature nsubj_competitive_results.",
        "<CIT> showed that the results for French-English were competitive to state-of-the-art alignment systems.",
        "A variation we experimented with, but gave up on as it did not show any improvements, concerns backing-off the dependent and governor to their POS tags (Joshi and Penstein-Rose, 2009).",
        "Removing irrelevant polar phrases around a citation might improve results.",
        "For this purpose, we split each sentence by trimming its parse tree.",
        "Walking from the citation node (<CIT>) towards the root, we select the subtree rooted at the first sentence node (S) and ignore the rest.",

        "(NP (33 significant) (NNS improvements))",
        "Dependencies and parse trees attach negation nodes, such as not, to the clause subtree and this shows no interaction with other nodes with respect to valence shifting.",
        "To handle this effect, we take a simple window-based inversion approach.",
        "All words inside a k-word window of any negation term are suffixed with a token jieg to distinguish them from their non-polar versions.",
        "For example, a 2-word negation window inverts the polarity of the positive phrase work well in the sentence below.",
