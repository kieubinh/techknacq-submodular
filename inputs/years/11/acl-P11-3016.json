        "We are interested in describing procedures by which infants, learning their native allophonic grammar, could reduce the variation and recover words.",
        "Combining insights from both computational and behavioral studies, we endorse the hypothesis that infants are good distributional learners (Maye et al., 2002; Saffran et al., 1996) and that they may 'bootstrap' into language tracking statistical regularities in the signal.",
        "We seek to identify which features of infants' input are most reliable for learning allophonic rules.",
        "A few indicators, based on distributional (Peperkamp et al., 2006) and lexical (Martin et al., submitted) information, have been described and validated in sil-ico.",
        "Yet, other aspects have barely been addressed, e.g. the question of whether or not these indicators capture different aspects of allophony and, if so, which combination scheme yields better results.",

        "As a model of language acquisition, this classifier is induced without supervision.",
        "In line with previous studies, we assume that infants are able to segment the continuous stream of acoustic input into a sequence of discrete segments, and that they quantize each of these segments into one of a finite number of phonetic categories.",
        "Quantization is a necessary assumption for the framework to apply.",
        "However, the larger the set of phonetic categories, the closer we get to recent 'single-stage' approaches (e.g. work by Dillon et al., in preparation) where phonological categories are acquired directly from raw infant-directed speech.",

        "By contrast, all three lexical indicators are much more robust even if, as predicted, FL's coarseness impedes its discriminant power (Figure l.b).",
        "The reason why FL* outperforms HFL may be due to the very definition of HFLs broken typewriter function: as the segments, e.g. {x,y}, are collapsed into a single symbol, the indicator captures not only minimal alternations like wx ~ wy, but also word pairs such as xy ~ yx.",
        "AUC curves suggest that, for each type, indicators converge at medium allophonic complexity.",

        "We also presented a first evaluation of the combination of indicators, and found no significant difference between the two combination schemes we defined.",
        "Unfortunately, none of the combinations we tested outperforms individual indicators.",
        "For comparability with previous studies, we only considered combination schemes requiring no modification in the definition of the task; however, learning allophonic pairs becomes unnatural when phonemes can have more than two realizations.",
        "Embedding each indicator's segment-to-segment (dis)similarities in a multidimensional space, for example, would enable the use ofclustering techniques where minimally distant points would be analyzed as allophones of a single phoneme.",
        "Thus far, segments have been nothing but abstract symbols and, for example, the task at hand is as hard for [a] ~ [a] as it is for [q] ~ [k].",
        "However, not only do allophones of a given phoneme tend to be acoustically similar, but acoustic differences may be more salient and/or available earlier to the infant than complementary distributions or minimally differing words.",
        "Therefore, the main extension towards a comprehensive model of the acquisition of allophonic rules would be to include acoustic indicators."
