        "Turkish is an agglutinative language with complex morphological structures, therefore using only word forms is not enough for many computational tasks.",
        "In this paper we analyze the effect of morphology in a Named Entity Recognition system for Turkish.",
        "We start with the standard word-level representation and incrementally explore the effect of capturing syntactic and contextual properties of tokens.",
        "Furthermore, we also explore a new representation in which roots and morphological features are represented as separate tokens instead of representing only words as tokens.",
        "Using syntactic and contextual properties with the new representation provide an 7.6% relative improvement over the baseline."

        "One of the main tasks of information extraction is the Named Entity Recognition (NER) which aims to locate and classify the named entities of an unstructured text.",
        "State-of-the-art NER systems have been produced for several languages, but despite all these recent improvements, developing a NER system for Turkish is still a challenging task due to the structure of the language.",
        "Turkish is a morphologically complex language with very productive inflectional and derivational processes.",
        "Many local and non-local syntactic structures are represented as morphemes which at the",
        "end produces Turkish words with complex morphological structures.",
        "For instance, the following English phrase \"if we are going to be able to make [something] acquire flavor\" which contains the necessary function words to represent the meaning can be translated into Turkish with only one token \"tat-landirabileceksek\" which is produced from the root \"tat\" (flavor) with additional morphemes +lan (acquire), +dir (to make), +abil (to be able), +ecek (are going), +se (if) and +k (we).",
        "This productive nature of the Turkish results in production of thousands of words from a given root, which cause data sparseness problems in model training.",
        "In order to prevent this behavior in our NER system, we propose several features which capture the meaning and syntactic properties of the token in addition to the contextual properties.",
        "We also propose using a sequence of morphemes representation which uses roots and morphological features as tokens instead of words.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes some previous related works, Section 3 describes our approach, Section 4 details the data sets used in the paper, Section 5 reports the experiments and results and Section 6 concludes with possible future work."

        "Turkish was one of the five languages the authors experimented with.",
        "In another work (Tur et al., 2003), the authors followed a statistical approach (HMMs) for NER task together with some other Information Extraction related tasks.",

      "heading": "3. Approach",
      "text": [
        "In this work, we used two tokenization methods.",
        "Initially we started with the sequence of words representation which will be referred as word-level model.",
        "We also introduced morpheme-level model in which morphological features are represented as states.",
        "We used several features which were created from deep and shallow analysis of the words.",
        "During our experiments we used Conditional Random Fields (CRF) which provides advantages over HMMs and enables the use of any number of features.",
        "Word-level tokenization is very commonly used in NER systems.",
        "In this model, each word is represented with one state.",
        "Since CRF can use any number of features to infer the hidden state, we develop several feature sets which allow us to represent more about the word.",
        "In this model, only the word tokens are used in their surface form.",
        "This model is effective for many languages which do not have complex morphological structures.",
        "However for morphologically rich languages, further analysis of words is required in order to prevent data sparseness problems and produce more accurate NER systems.",
        "An analysis (Hakkani-Tür, 2000) on English and Turkish news articles with around 10 million words showed that on the average 5 different Turkish word forms are produced from the same root.",
        "In order to decrease this high variation of words we use the root forms of the words as an additional feature.",
        "Features",
        "Named entities are mostly noun phrases, such as first name and last name or organization name and the type of organization.",
        "This property has been used widely in NER systems as a hint to determine the possible named entities.",
        "Part-of-Speech tags of the words depend highly on the language and the available Part-of-Speech tagger.",
        "Taggers may distinguish the proper nouns with or without their types.",
        "We used a Turkish morphological analyzer (Of lazer, 1994) which analyzes words into roots and morphological features.",
        "An example to the output of the analyzer is given in Table 1.",
        "The part-of-speech tag of each word is also reported by the tool .",
        "We use these tags as additional features and call them part-of-speech (POS) features.",
        "The morphological analyzer has a proper name database, which is used to tag Turkish person, location and organization names as proper nouns.",
        "An example name entity with this +Prop tag is given in Table 1.",
        "Although, the use of this tag is limited to the given database and not all named entities are tagged with it, we use it as a feature to distinguish named entities.",
        "This feature is referred as proper-noun (Prop) feature.",
        "As the last feature, we use the orthographic case information of the words.",
        "The initial letter of most named entities is in upper case, which makes case feature a very common feature in NER tasks.",
        "We also use this feature and mark each token as UC or LC depending on the initial letter of it.",
        "We don't do",
        "- 3rd person singular; +Pnon - No possesive agreement; +Nom - Nominative case.",
        "WORD + ROOT + POS + MORPHEMES",
        "anything special for the first words in sentences.",
        "An example phase in word-level model is given in Table 2 .",
        "In the figure each row represents a state.",
        "The first column is the lexical form of the word and the rest of the columns are the features and the tag is in the last column.",
        "Using Part-of-Speech tags as features introduces some syntactic properties of the word to the model, but still there is missing information of other morphological tags such as number/person agreements, possessive agreements or cases.",
        "In order to see the effect of these morphological tags in NER, we propose a morpheme-level tokenization method which represents a word in several states; one state for a root and one state for each morphological feature.",
        "In a setting like this, the model has to be restricted from assigning different labels to different parts of the word.",
        "In order to do this, we use an additional feature called root-morph feature.",
        "The root-morph is a feature which is assigned the value \"root\" for states containing a root and the value \"morph\" for states containing a morpheme.",
        "Since there are no prefixes in Turkish, a model trained with this feature will give zero probability (or close to zero probability if there is any smoothing) for assigning any B-* (Begin any NE) tag to a morph state.",
        "Similarly, transition from a state with B-* or I-* (Inside any NE) tag to a morph state with O (Other) tag will get zero probability from the model.",
        "In morpheme-level model, we use the following features:",
        "• the actual root of the word for root and morphemes of the token",
        "• the Part-of-speech tag of the word for the root part and the morphological tag for the morphemes",
        "• the root-morph feature which assigns \"root\" to the roots and \"morph\" to the morphemes",
