        "A headline is considered as a condensed summary of a document.",
        "It can be classified as the acme of text summarization.",
        "The necessity for automatic headline generation has been raised due to the need to handle huge amount of documents, which is a tedious and time-consuming process.",
        "Instead of reading every document, the headline can be used to decide which of them contains important information.",
        "There are two major disciplines towards automatic headline generation: extractive and abstractive.",
        "In the work of (Douzidia and Lapalme, 2004), and extractive method was used to produce a 10-words summary (which can be considered as a headline) of an Arabic document, and then it was automatically translated into English.",
        "Therefore, the reported score reflects the accuracy of the generation and translation which makes it difficult to evaluate the process of headline generation of this system.",
        "Hedge Trimmer (Dorr et al., 2003) is a system that creates a headline for an English newspaper story using linguistically-motivated heuristics to choose a potential headline.",
        "Jin and Hauptmann (2002) proposed a probabilistic model for headline generation in which they divide headline generation process into two steps; namely the step of distilling the information source from the observation of a document and the step of generating a title from the estimated information source, but it was for English documents.",
        "One of the tasks of the Document Understanding Conference of 2004 (DUC 2004) was generating a very short summary which can be considered as a headline.",
        "The evaluation was done on the first 75 bytes of the summary.",
        "Knowing that the average word size in Arabic is 5 characters (Alotaiby et al.",
        "2009) in addition to space characters, the specified summary size in Arabic words was roughly equivalent to 12 words.",
        "In the meantime, the average length of the headlines was about 8 words in the Arabic Gigaword corpus (Graff, 2007) of articles and their headlines.",
        "In this work, a 10-words headline is considered as an appropriate length.",
        "Classical Arabic writing system was originally consonantal and written from right to left.",
        "Every letter in the 28 Arabic alphabets represents a single consonant.",
        "To overcome the problem of different pronunciations of consonants in Arabic text, graphical signs known as diacritics were invented in the seventh century.",
        "Currently in the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), diacritics are omitted from written text almost all the time.",
        "As a result, this omission increases the number homographs (words with the same writing form).",
        "However, Arab readers normally differentiate between homographs by the context of the script.",
        "Moreover, Arabic is a morphologically complex language.",
        "An Arabic word may be constructed out of a stem plus affixes and clitics.",
        "Furthermore, some parts of the stem may be deleted or modified when appending a clitic to it according to specific orthographical rules.",
        "As a final point, different orthographic conventions exist across the Arab world (Buckwalter, 2004).",
        "As a result of omitting diacritics, complex morphology and different orthographical rules, two same words may be regarded as different if compared literally."

        "The main idea of the used method is to extract the most appropriate set of consecutive words (phrase) from a document body that should represent an adequate headline for the document.",
        "Then, evaluate those headlines by calculating ROUGE score against a set of 3 reference headlines.",
        "To do so, first, a list of nominated headlines was created from the document body.",
        "After this, four different evaluation methods were applied to choose the best headline that reflects the idea of the document among the nominated list.",
        "The task of these methods is to catch the most suitable headline that matches the document.",
        "The idea here is to choose the headline that contains the largest number of the most frequent words in the document taking into account ignoring stop words and giving earlier sentences in documents more weight.",
        "A window of a length of 10-words was passed over the paragraphs word by word to generate chunks of consecutive words that could be used as headlines.",
        "Moving the widow one word step may corrupt the fluency of the sentences.",
        "A simple approach to reduce this issue is to minimize the size of paragraphs.",
        "Therefore, the document body was divided into smaller paragraphs at new-line, comma, colon and period characters.",
        "This step increased the number of nominated headlines with proper start and end.",
        "The resulting is a nominated list of headlines of a length of 10 words.",
        "In the case of a paragraph of a length less than 10, there will be only one nominated headline of the same length of that paragraph.",
        "Table 1 shows an example of nominating headline list where a is the selected paragraph, b is the first nominated headline and c is the second nominated headline.",
        "Nominated headlines b and c are word-by-word translated.",
        "Table 1 : An example of headlines nomination.",
        "The very basic process of making a matching score between every two words in the document body is to give a score of 1 if the two words exactly match or 0 if there is even one mismatch character.",
        "This basic step is called the Exact Word Matching (EWM).",
        "Unfortunately, Arabic language contains clitics and is morphologically rich.",
        "This means the same word could appear with a single clitic attached to it and yet to be considered as a different word in the EWM method.",
        "Therefore, the idea of using Character Cross-Correlation (CCC) method emerged.",
        "In which a variable score in the range of 0 to 1 is calculated depending on how much characters match with each other.",
        "For example, if the word \"UJ&j\" \"and he wrote it\" is compared with the word \"he wrote\" using the EWM method the resulting score will be 0, but when using the CCC method it will be 0.667.",
        "The CCC method comes from signals cross-correlation which measures of similarity of two waveforms.",
        "In the CCC method the score is calculated according to the following equation:",
        "where wi is the first word containing M characters, Wj is the second word containing N characters and the operation * result 1 if the two corresponding characters match each other and 0 otherwise.",
        "After preparing the two tables of words matching score, now they will be utilized in the selection of the best headline.",
        "Except stop-words, every word in the document body (wd) will be matched with every word in the nominated headline (wh) using the CCC and the EWM methods and a score will be registered for every nominated sentence.",
        "A simple stop-word list consisting of about 180 words was created for this purpose.",
        "Calculating matching score for every sentence is also performed in two ways.",
        "The first way is the SUM method which is defined in the following equation:",
        "s UMp = it tC CCWd,Wj (3)",
        "where SUMp is the score using SUM method for the nominated headline p, K is the size of unique words in the document body and L is the size of words in the nominated headline (except stop-words).",
        "In this method the summation of the cross-correlation score of every word in the document body and every word in the headline is added up.",
