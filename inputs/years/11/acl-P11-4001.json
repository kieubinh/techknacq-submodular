        "Machine Translation system is a software designed that essentially takes a text in one language (called the source language), and translates it into another language (called the target language).",
        "There are number of approaches for MT like Direct based, Transform based, Interlingua based, Statistical etc.",
        "But the choice of approach depends upon the available resources and the kind of languages involved.",
        "In general, if the two languages are structurally similar, in particular as regards lexical correspondences, morphology and word order, the case for abstract syntactic analysis seems less convincing.",
        "Since the present research work deals with a pair of closely related language i.e. Hindi-Punjabi , thus direct word-to-word translation approach is the obvious choice.",
        "As some rule based approach has also been used, thus, Hybrid approach has been adopted for developing the system.",
        "An exhaustive survey has already been given for existing machine translations systems developed so far mentioning their accuracies and limitations.",

        "The preprocessing stage is a collection of operations that are applied on input data to make it processable by the translation engine.",
        "In the first phase of Machine Translation system, various activities incorporated include text normalization, replacing collocations and replacing proper nouns.",
        "The variety in the alphabet, different dialects and influence of foreign languages has resulted in spelling variations of the same word.",
        "Such variations sometimes can be treated as errors in writing.",
        "(Goyal V. and Lehal G.S., 2010).",
        "After passing the input text through text normalization, the text passes through this Collocation replacement sub phase of Preprocessing phase.",
        "Collocation is two or more consecutive words with a special behavior.",
        "(Choueka :1988).",
        "For example, the collocation 3tK tâ$T (uttar pradêsh) if translated word to word, will be translated as rk's ïïitT (javäb râj) but it must be translated as Q\"dd ifÜH (uttar pradêsh).",
        "The accuracy of the results for collocation extraction using t-test is not accurate and includes number of such bigrams and trigrams that are not actually collocations.",
        "Thus, manually such entries were removed and actual collocations were further extracted.",
        "The correct corresponding Punjabi translation for each extracted collocation is stored in the collocation table of the database.",
        "The collocation table of the database consists of 5000 such entries.",
        "In this sub phase, the normalized input text is analyzed.",
        "Each collocation in the database found in the input text will be replaced with the Punjabi translation of the corresponding collocation.",

        "A great proposition of unseen words includes proper nouns like personal, days of month, days of week, country names, city names, bank names, organization names, ocean names, river names, university names etc.",
        "and if translated word to word, their meaning is changed.",
        "If the meaning is not affected, even though this step fastens the translation process.",
        "Once these words are recognized and stored into the proper noun database, there is no need to decide about their translation or transliteration every time in the case of presence of such words in input text for translation.",
        "This gazetteer makes the translation accurate and fast.",
        "This list is self growing during each translation.",
        "Thus, to process this sub phase, the system requires a proper noun gazetteer that has been complied offline.",
        "For this task, we have developed an offline module to extract proper nouns from the corpus based on some rules.",
        "Also, Named Entity recognition module has been developed based on the CRF approach (Sharma R. and Goyal V., 2011b).",
        "Tokenizers (also known as lexical analyzers or word segmenters) segment a stream of characters into meaningful units called tokens.",
        "The tokenizer takes the text generated by pre processing phase as input.",
        "Individual words or tokens are extracted and processed to generate its equivalent in the target language.",
        "This module, using space, a punctuation mark, as delimiter, extracts tokens (word) one by one from the text and gives it to translation engine for analysis till the complete input text is read and processed.",
        "The translation engine is the main component of our Machine Translation system.",
        "It takes token generated by the tokenizer as input and outputs the translated token in the target language.",
        "These translated tokens are concatenated one after another along with the delimiter.",
        "Modules included in this phase are explained below one by one.",
        "Title may be defined as a formal appellation attached to the name of a person or family by virtue of office, rank, hereditary privilege, noble birth, or attainment or used as a mark of respect.",
        "Thus word next to title and word previous to surname is usually a proper noun.",
        "And sometimes, a word used as proper name of a person has its own meaning in target language.",
        "Similarly, Surname may be defined as a name shared in common to identify the members of a family, as distinguished from each member's given name.",
        "It is also called family name or last name.",
        "When either title or surname is passed through the translation engine, it is translated by the system.",
        "This cause the system failure as these proper names should be transliterated instead of translation.",
        "For example consider the Hindi sentence",
        "ff sft fTIT ^Tff Wll (shrïmân harsh jï hamârê yahâm padhârê).",
        "In this sentence, ff (harsh) has the meaning \"joy\".",
        "The equivalent translation of ff (harsh) in target language is yrft (khushï).",
        "Similarly, consider the Hindi sentence WST ffff fTft Iff Wftl.",
        "(prakâsh simh hamârê yahâm padhârê).",
        "Here, ^TCT (prakâsh) word is acting as proper noun and it must be transliterated and not translated because ffff (simh) is surname and word previous to it is proper noun.",
        "Thus, a small module has been developed for locating such proper nouns to consider them as title or surname.",
        "There is one special character '°' in Devanagari script to mark the symbols like ^T°, If this module found this symbol to be title or surname, the word next and previous to this token as the case may be for title or surname respectively, will be transliterated not translated.",
        "The title and surname database consists of 14 and 654 entries respectively.",
        "These databases can be extended at any time to allow new titles and surnames to be added.",
        "This module was tested on a large Hindi corpus and showed that about 2-5 % text of the input text depending upon its domain is proper noun.",
        "Thus, this module plays an important role in translation.",
        "This module finds the root word for the token and its morphological features.Morphological analyzer developed by IIT-H has been ported for Windows platform for making it usable for",
        "If token is not a title or a surname, it is looked up in the HPDictionary database containing Hindi to Punjabi direct word to word translation.",
        "If it is found, it is used for translation.",
        "If no entry is found in HPDictionary database, it is sent to next sub phase for processing.",
        "The HPDictionary database consists of 54,127 entries.This database can be extended at any time to allow new entries in the dictionary to be added.",
        "Among number of approaches for disambiguation, the most appropriate approach to determine the correct meaning of a Hindi word in a particular usage for our Machine Translation system is to examine its context using N-gram approach.",
        "After analyzing the past experiences of various authors, we have chosen the value of n to be 3 and 2 i.e. trigram and bigram approaches respectively for our system.",
        "Trigrams are further categorized into three different types.",
        "First category of trigram consists of context one word previous to and one word next to the ambiguous word.",
        "Second category of trigram consists of context of two adjacent previous words to the ambiguous word.",
        "Third category of the trigram consists of context of two adjacent next words to the ambiguous word.",
        "Bigrams are also categorized into two categories.",
        "First category of the bigrams consists of context of one previous word to ambiguous word and second category of the bigrams consists of one context word next to ambiguous word.",
        "For this purpose, the Hindi corpus consisting of about 2 million words was collected from different sources like online newspaper daily news, blogs, Prem Chand stories, Yashwant jain stories, articles etc.",

        "In this activity, inflectional analysis without using morphology has been performed for all those tokens that are not processed by morphological analysis module.",
