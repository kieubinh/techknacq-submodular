        "Today's Web search is still dominated by a document perspective: a user enters one or more keywords that represent the information of interest and receives a ranked list of documents.",
        "This technology has been shown to be very successful when used on an ordinary computer, because it very often delivers concrete documents or web pages that contain the information the user is interested in.",
        "The following aspects are important in this context: 1) Users basically have to know what they are looking for.",
        "2) The documents serve as answers to user queries.",
        "3) Each document in the ranked list is considered independently.",
        "If the user only has a vague idea of the information in question or just wants to explore the information space, the current search engine paradigm does not provide enough assistance for these kind of searches.",
        "The user has to read through the documents and then eventually reformulate the query in order to find new information.",
        "This can be a tedious task especially on mobile devices.",
        "Seen in this context, current search engines seem to be best suited for \"one-shot search\" and do not support content-oriented interaction.",
        "In order to overcome this restricted document perspective, and to provide a mobile device searches to \"find out about something\", we want to help users with the web content exploration process in two ways:",
        "1.",
        "We consider a user query as a specification of a topic that the user wants to know and learn more about.",
        "Hence, the search result is basically a graphical structure of the topic and associated topics that are found.",
        "2.",
        "The user can interactively explore this topic graph using a simple and intuitive touchable user interface in order to either learn more about the content of a topic or to interactively expand a topic with newly computed related topics.",
        "In the first step, the topic graph is computed on the fly from the a set of web snippets that has been collected by a standard search engine using the initial user query.",
        "Rather than considering each snippet in isolation, all snippets are collected into one document from which the topic graph is computed.",
        "We consider each topic as an entity, and the edges between topics are considered as a kind of (hidden) relationship between the connected topics.",
        "The content of a topic are the set of snippets it has been extracted from, and the documents retrievable via the snippets' web links.",
        "A topic graph is then displayed on a mobile device (in our case an iPad) as a touch-sensitive graph.",
        "By just touching on a node, the user can either inspect the content of a topic (i.e, the snippets or web pages) oractivate the expansion ofthe graphthrough an on the fly computation of new related topics for the selected node.",
        "In a second step, we provide additional background knowledge on the topic which consists ofex-plicit relationships that are generated from an online Encyclopedia (in our case Wikipedia).",
        "The relevant background relation graph is also represented as a touchable graph in the same way as a topic graph.",
        "The major difference is that the edges are actually labeled with the specific relation that exists between the nodes.",
        "Inthis way the usercanexplore inanuniformway both new information nuggets and validated background information nuggets interactively.",

        "We consider the extraction of a topic graph as a specific empirical collocation extraction task.",
        "However, instead of extracting collations between words, which is still the dominating approach in collocation extraction research, e.g., (Baroni and Evert, 2008), we are extracting collocations between chunks, i.e., word sequences.",
        "Furthermore, our measure of association strength takes into account the distance between chunks and combines it with the PMI (point-wise mutual information) approach (Turney, 2001).",
        "The core idea is to compute a set of chunk-pair-distance elements for the N first web snippets returned by a search engine for the topic Q, and to compute the topic graph from these elements.",
        "In general for two chunks, a single chunk-pair-distance element stores the distance between",
        "Figure 4: The snippets that are associated with the node label \"selena gomez\" of the topic graph from Fig. 3.In order to go back to the topic graph, the user simply touches the button labeled i-GNSSMM on the left upper corner of the iPad screen.",
        "the chunks by counting the number of chunks in-between them.",
        "We distinguish elements which have the same words in the same order, but have different distances.",
        "For example, (Peter, Mary, 3) is different from (Peter, Mary, 5) and (Mary, Peter, 3).",
        "We begin by creating a document S from the N-first web snippets so that each line of S contains a complete snippet.",
        "Each textline of S is then tagged with Part-of-Speech using the SVM-Tagger (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004) and chunked in the next step.",
        "The chunker recognizes two types of word chains.",
        "Each chain consists of longest matching sequences of words with the same PoS class, namely noun chains or verb chains, where an element of a noun chain belongs to one of the extended noun tags, and elements of a verb",
        "Figure 5: The web page associated with the first snippet of Fig. 4.",
        "A single touch on that snippet triggers a call to the iPad browser in order to display the corresponding web page.",
        "The left upper corner button labeled \"Snippets\" has to be touched in order to go back to the snippets page.",
        "chain only contains verb tags.",
        "We finally apply a kind of \"phrasal head test\" on each identified chunk to guarantee that the rightmost element only belongs to a proper noun or verb tag.",
        "For example, the chunk \"a/DT british/NNP for-mula/NNP one/NN racing/VBG driver/NN from/IN scotland/NNP\" would be accepted as proper NP chunk, where \"compelling/VBG power/NN of/IN\" is not.",
        "Performing this sort of shallow chunking is based on the assumptions: 1) noun groups can represent the arguments of a relation, a verb group the relation itself, and 2) web snippet chunking needs highly robust NL technologies.",
        "In general, chunking crucially depends on the quality of the embedded PoS-tagger.",
        "However, it is known that PoS-tagging performance of even the best taggers decreases substantially when",
        "glish Verbs are those whose PoS tag start with VB.",

        "The center of the graph corresponds to the search query.",
        "applied on web pages (Giesbrecht and Evert, 2009).",
        "Web snippets are even harder to process because they are not necessary contiguous pieces of texts, and usually are not syntactically well-formed paragraphs due to some intentionally introduced breaks (e.g., denoted by ... betweens text fragments).",
        "On the other hand, we want to benefit from PoS tagging during chunk recognition in order to be able to identify, on the fly, a shallow phrase structure in web snippets with minimal efforts.",
        "The chunk-pair-distance model is computed from the list of chunks.",
        "This is done by traversing the chunks from left to right.",
        "For each chunk Cj, a set is computed by considering all remaining chunks and their distance to Cj, i.e., (cj,cj+1,distj(j+1)), (c, ci+2, disti(i+2)), etc.",
        "We do this for each chunk list computed for each web snippet.",
        "The distance distj of two chunks cj and Cj is computed directly from the chunk list, i.e., we do not count the position of ignored words lying between two chunks.",
        "The motivation for using chunk-pair-distance statistics is the assumption that the strength of hidden relationships between chunks can be covered by means of their collocation degree and the frequency of their relative positions in sentences extracted from web snippets; cf. (Figueroa and Neumann, 2006) who demonstrated the effectiveness of this hypothesis for web-based question answering.",
        "Finally, we compute the frequencies of each chunk, each chunk pair, and each chunk pair distance.",
        "The set of all these frequencies establishes the chunk-pair-distance model CPDM.",
        "It is used for constructing the topic graph in the final step.",
        "Formally, a topic graph TG = (V,E,A) consists of a set V of nodes, a set E of edges, and a set A of node actions.",
        "Each node v G V represents a chunk and is labeled with the corresponding PoS-tagged word group.",
        "Node actions are used to trigger additional processing, e.g., displaying the snippets, expanding the graph etc.",
        "The nodes and edges are computed from the chunk-pair-distance elements.",
        "Since, the number of these elements is quite large (up to several thousands), the elements are ranked according to a weighting scheme which takes into account the frequency information of the chunks and their collocations.",
        "More precisely, the weight of a chunk-pair-distance element cpd = (cj,Cj,Djj), with Dj)j- = {(freqi, disti), (freq2, dist2),(freqn, distn)}, is computed based on PMI as follows:",
        "where relative frequency is used for approximating the probabilities p(c ) and p(cj).",
        "For log2(p(c , cj)) we took the (unsigned) polynomials of the corresponding Taylor series using (freqk, distk) in the k-th Taylor polynomial and adding them up:",
        "Ek=i freqk",
        "The visualized topic graph TG is then computed from a subset CPD'M c CPDM using the m highest ranked cpd for fixed cj.",
        "In other words, we restrict the complexity of a TG by restricting the number of edges connected to a node."
