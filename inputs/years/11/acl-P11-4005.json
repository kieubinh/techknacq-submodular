        "Recently, an increasing number of research has targeted language learners' need in editorial assistance including detecting and correcting grammar and usage errors in texts written in a second language.",
        "For example, Microsoft Research has developed the ESL Assistant, which provides such a service to ESL and EFL learners.",
        "Much of the research in this area depends on hand-crafted rules and focuses on certain error types.",
        "Very little research provides a general framework for detecting and correcting all types of errors.",
        "However, in the sentences of ESL writing, there may be more than one errors and one error may affect the performance of handling other errors.",
        "Erroneous sentences could be more efficiently identified and corrected if a grammar checker handles all errors at once, using a set of pattern rules that reflect the predominant usage of the English language.",
        "Consider the sentences, \"He play an important roles to close this deals. \"",
        "and \"He looks forward to hear you. \"",
        "The first sentence contains inaccurate word forms (i.e., play, roles, and deals), and rare usage (i.e., \"role to close'\"), while the second sentence use the incorrect verb form of \"hear\".",
        "Good responses to these writing errors might be (a) Use \"played\" instead of \"play.\"",
        "(b) Use \"role\" instead of \"roles\", (c) Use \"in closing\" instead of \"to close\" (d) Use \"to hearing\" instead of \"to hear\", and (e) insert \"from\" between \"hear\" and \"you.\"",
        "These suggestions can be offered by learning the patterns rules related to \"play ~ role\" and \"look forward\" based on analysis of ngrams and collocations in a very large-scale reference corpus.",
        "With corpus statistics, we could learn the needed phraseological tendency in the form of pattern rules such as \"play ~ role in V-ing) and \"look forward to V-ing.\"",
        "The use of such pattern rules is in line with the recent theory of Pattern Grammar put forward by Hunston and Francis (2000).",
        "We present a system, EdIt, that automatically learns to provide suggestions for rare/wrong usages in non-native writing.",
        "Example EdIt responses to a text are shown in Figure 1.",
        "Edit has retrieved the related pattern grammar of some ngram and collocation sequences given the input (e.g., \"play ~ role in V-ing\", and \"look forward to V-ing\").",
        "EdIt learns these patterns during pattern extraction process by syntactically analyzing a collection of well-formed, published texts.",
        "At run-time, EdIt first processes the input passages in the article (e.g., \"He play an important roles to close \") submitted by the L2 learner.",
        "And EdIt tag the passage with part of speech information, and compares the tagged sentence against the pattern rules anchored at certain collocations (e.g., \"play ~ role\" and \"look forward\").",
        "Finally, Edit finds the minimum-edit-cost patterns matching the passages using an extended Levenshtein's algorithm (Levenshtein, 1966).",
        "The system then highlights the edits and displays the pattern rules as suggestions for correction.",
        "In our prototype, EdIt returns the preferred word form and preposition usages to the user directly (see Figure 1); alternatively, the actual surface words (e.g., \"closing\" and \"deal\") could be provided.",

        "More recently, statistical approaches to developing grammar checkers have prevailed.",
        "Among unsupervised checkers, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) exploits negative evidence from edited textual corpora achieving high precision but low recall, while Tsao and Wible (2009) uses general corpus only.",

        "(2008) and Gamon and Leacock (2010) both use Web as a corpus to detect errors in non-native writing.",

        "In an approach similar to our work, Tsao and Wible (2009) use a combined ngrams of words forms, lemmas, and part-of-speech tags for research into constructional phenomena.",
        "The main differences are that we anchored each pattern rule in lexical collocation so as to avoid deriving rules that is may have two consecutive part-of-speech tags (e.g, \"V Pron$ socks off).",
        "The pattern rules we have derived are more specific and can be effectively used in detecting and correcting errors.",
        "In contrast to the previous research, we introduce a broad-coverage grammar checker that accommodates edits such as substitution, insertion and deletion, as well as replacing word forms or prepositions using pattern rules automatically derived from very large-scale corpora of well-formed texts."

        "On the other hand, since learners tend to select wrong word form and preposition, we set a lower cost for substitution among different word forms of the same lemma or lemmas with the same POS tag (e.g., replacing V with V-ing or replacing to with in\".",

        "Note that pattern rules involved flexible collocations are designed to take care of long distance dependencies that might be always possible to cover with limited ngram (for n less than 6).",

        "In existing grammar checkers, there are typically many modules examining different types of errors and different module may have different priority and conflict with one another.",
        "Let us note that this general framework for error detection and correction is an original contribution of our work.",
        "In addition, we incorporate probabilities conditioned on word positions in order to weigh edit costs.",
        "For example, the conditional probability of V to immediately follow \"look forward to\" is virtually 0, while the probability of V-ing to do so is approximates 0.3.",
