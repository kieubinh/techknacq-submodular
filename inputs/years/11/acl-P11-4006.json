        "Micro-blogging services such as Twitter, Plurk, and Jaiku, are platforms that allow users to share immediate but short messages with friends.",
        "Generally, the micro-blogging services possess some signature properties that differentiate them from conventional weblogs and forum.",
        "First, microblogs deal with almost real-time messaging, including instant information, expression of feelings, and immediate ideas.",
        "It also provides a source of crowd intelligence that can be used to investigate common feelings or potential trends about certain news or concepts.",
        "However, this real-time property can lead to the production of an enormous number of messages that recipients must digest.",
        "Second, mi-cro-blogging is time-traceable.",
        "The temporal information is crucial because contextual posts that appear close together are, to some extent, correlated.",
        "Third, the style of micro-blogging posts tends to be conversation-based with a sequence of responses.",
        "This phenomenon indicates that the posts and their responses are highly correlated in many respects.",
        "Fourth, micro-blogging is friendship-influenced.",
        "Posts from a particular user can also be viewed by his/her friends and might have an impact on them (e.g. the empathy effect) implicitly or explicitly.",
        "Therefore, posts from friends in the same period may be correlated sentiment-wise as well as content-wise.",
        "We leverage the above properties to develop an automatic and intuitive Web application, Me-meTube, to analyze and display the sentiments behind messages in microblogs.",
        "Our system can be regarded as a sentiment-driven, music-based summarization framework as well as a novel audiovisual presentation of art.",
        "MemeTube is designed as a search-based tool.",
        "The system flow is as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Given a query (either a keyword or a user id), the system first extracts a series of relevant posts and replies based on keyword matching.",
        "Then sentiment analysis is applied to determine the sentiment of the posts.",
        "Next a piece of music is composed to reflect the detected sentiments.",
        "Finally, the messages and music are fed into the animation generation model, which displays a piano keyboard that plays automatically.",
        "The contributions of this work can be viewed from three different perspectives.",
        "• From system perspective of view, we demo a novel Web-based system, MemeTube, as a kind of search-based sentiment presentation, musi-",
        "calization, and visualization tool for microblog messages.",
        "It can serve as a real-time sentiment detector or an interactive microblog audiovisual presentation system.",
        "• Technically, we integrate a language-model-based classifier approach with a Markov-transition model to exploit three kinds of information (i.e., contextual, response, and friendship information) for sentiment recognition.",
        "We also integrate the sentiment-detection system with a real-time rule-based harmonic music and animation generator to display streams of messages in an audiovisual format.",
        "• Conceptually, our system demonstrates that, instead of simply using textual tags to express sentiments, it is possible to exploit audio (i.e., music) and visual (i.e., animation) cues to present microblog users' feelings and experiences.",
        "In this respect, the system can also serve as a Web-based art piece that uses NLP-technologies to concretize and portray sentiments."

        "Related works can be divided into two parts: sentiment classification in microblogs, and sentiment-based audiovisual presentation for social media.",
        "For the first part, most of related literatures focus on exploiting different classification methods to separate positive and negative sentiments by a variety of textual and linguistics features, as shown in Table 1.",
        "Their accuracy ranges from 60%~85% depending on different setups.",
        "The major difference between our work and existing approaches is that our model considers three kinds of additional information (i.e., contextual, response and friendship information) for sentiment recognition.",
        "In recent years, a number of studies have investigated integrating emotions and music in certain media applications.",
        "For example, Ishizuka and Onisawa (2006) generated variations of theme music to fit the impressions of story scenes represented by textual content or pictures.",
        "Kaminskas (2009) aligned music with user-selected points of interests for recommendation.",

        "(2004) proposed a Photo2Video system that allows users to specify incident music that expresses their feelings about the photos.",
