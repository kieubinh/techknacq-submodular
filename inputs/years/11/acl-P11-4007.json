        "One possible application of BCI is typing systems; specifically, those BCI systems that use electroencephalography (EEG) have been increasingly studied in the recent decades to enable the selection of letters for expressive language generation (Wolpaw, 2007; Pfurtscheller et al., 2000;",
        "Treder and Blankertz, 2010).",
        "However, the use of noninvasive techniques for letter-by-letter systems lacks efficiency due to low signal to noise ratio and variability of background brain activity.",
        "Therefore current BCI-spellers suffer from low symbol rates and researchers have turned to various hierarchical symbol trees to achieve system speedups (Serby et al., 2005; Wolpaw et al., 2002; Treder and Blankertz, 2010).",

        "EEG responses corresponding to the visual stimuli are classified using regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) applied to stimulus-locked temporal features from multiple channels.",

        "Full screen awareness is required.",
        "In contrast, our approach is to distribute the stimuli temporally and present one symbol at a time using RSVP and seek a binary response to find the desired letter, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The latter method has the advantage of not requiring the user to look at different areas of the screen, which can be an important factor for those with LIS.",
        "Our RSVP paradigm utilizes stimulus sequences consisting of the 26 letters in the English alphabet plus symbols for space and backspace, presented in a randomly ordered sequence.",
        "When the user sees the target symbol, the brain generates an evoked response potential (ERP) in the EEG; the most prominent component of this ERP is the P300 wave, which is a positive deflection in the scalp voltage primarily in frontal areas and that generally occurs with a latency of approximately 300 ms.",
        "This natural novelty response of the brain, occurring when the user detects a rare, sought-after target, allows us to make binary decisions about the user's intent.",
        "The intent detection problem becomes a signal classification problem when the EEG signals are windowed in a stimulus-time-locked manner starting at stimulus onset and extending for a sufficient duration - in this case 500ms.",
        "Consider Figure 3, which shows the trial-averaged temporal signals from various EEG channels corresponding to target and non-target (distractor) symbols.",
        "This graph shows a clear effect between 300 and 500 ms for the target symbols that is not present for the distractor symbols (the latter of which clearly shows a component having a periodicity of 400 ms, which is expected in this case since a new image was presented every 400 ms).",

        "RDA is a modified quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) model.",
        "Assuming each class has a multivariate normal distribution and assuming classification is made according to the comparison of posterior distributions of the classes, the optimal Bayes classifier resides within the QDA model family.",

        "estimates in an attempt to minimize problems associated with singularities.",
        "The shrinkage procedure makes the class covariances closer to the overall data covariance, and therefore to each other, thus making the quadratic boundary more similar to a linear boundary.",
