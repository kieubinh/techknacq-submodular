        "Although a formidable amount of research have been done, the existing reported solutions or available systems are still far from perfect or do not meet the satisfaction level of end users'.",
        "The main issue is the various conceptual rules that govern sentiment and there are even more clues (possibly unlimited) that can convey these concepts from realization to verbalization of a human being.",
        "Human psychology directly relates to the unrevealed clues and governs the sentiment realization of us.",

        "In order to identify sentiment from a text, lexical analysis plays a crucial role.",
        "For example, words like love, hate, good and favorite directly indicate sentiment or opinion.",
        "Previous works (Pang et al., 2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Baccianella et.",
        "al., 2010) have already proposed various techniques for making dictionaries for those sentiment words.",
        "But polarity assignment of such sentiment lexicons is a hard semantic disambiguation problem.",
        "The regulating aspects which govern the lexical level semantic orientation are natural language context (Pang et al., 2002), language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimension (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hidden aspects.",
        "Therefore it is a challenging and enigmatic research problem.",
        "The current trend is to attach prior polarity to each entry at the sentiment lexicon level.",
        "Prior polarity is an approximation value based on heuristics based statistics collected from corpus and not exact.",
        "The probabilistic fixed point prior polarity scores do not solve the problem completely rather it places the problem into next level, called contextual polarity classification.",
        "We start with the hypothesis that the summation of all the regulating aspects of sentiment orientation is human psychology and thus it is a multifaceted problem (Liu, 2010).",
        "More precisely what we mean by human psychology is the union of all known and unknown aspects that directly or indirectly govern the sentiment orientation knowledge of us.",
        "The regulating aspects wrapped in the present PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender, Age, City, Country, Language and Profession.",
        "The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension of the existing SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et.",
        "al., 2010) to hold the possible psychological ingredients and govern the sentiment understandability of us.",
