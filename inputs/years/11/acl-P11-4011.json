        "Virtual human characters constitute a promising contribution to many fields, including simulation, training and interactive games (Kenny et al., 2007; Jan et al., 2009).",
        "The ability to communicate using natural language is important for believable and effective virtual humans.",
        "Such ability has to be good enough to engage the trainee or the gamer in the activity.",
        "Nowadays, most conversational systems operate on a dialogue-act level and require extensive annotation efforts in order to be fit for their task (Rieser and Lemon, 2010).",
        "Semantic annotation and rule authoring have long been known as bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains.",
        "In this paper, we present novel a algorithm for generating virtual instructors from automatically annotated human-human corpora.",
        "Our algorithm, when given a task-based corpus situated in a virtual world, generates an instructor that robustly helps a user achieve a given task in the virtual world of the corpus.",
        "There are two main approaches toward automatically producing dialogue utterances.",
        "One is the selection approach, in which the task is to pick the appropriate output from a corpus ofpossible outputs.",
        "The other is the generation approach, in which the output is dynamically assembled using some composition procedure, e.g. grammar rules.",
        "The selection approach to generation has only been used in conversational systems that are not task-oriented such as negotiating agents (Gandhe and Traum, 2007), question answering characters (Kenny et al., 2007), and virtual patients (Leuski et al., 2006).",
        "Our algorithm can be seen as a novel way of doing robust generation by selection and interaction management for task-oriented systems.",
        "In the next section we introduce the corpora used in this paper.",
        "Section 3 presents the two phases of our algorithm, namely automatic annotation and dialogue management through selection.",
        "In Section 4 we present a fragment of an interaction with a virtual instructor generated using the corpus and the algorithm introduced in the previous sections.",
        "We evaluate the virtual instructor in interactions with human subjects using objective as well as subjective metrics.",
        "We present the results of the evaluation in Section 5.",
        "We compare our results with both human and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper proposing an improved virtual instructor designed as a result of our error analysis."

        "The Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments (GIVE; Koller et al.",
        "(2010)) is a shared task in which Natural Language Generation systems must generate real-time instructions that guide a user in a virtual world.",
        "In this paper, we use the GIVE-2 Corpus (Gargett et al., 2010), a corpus of human instruction giving in virtual environments.",
        "We use the English part of the corpus which consists of 63 American English written discourses in which one subject guided another in a treasure hunting task in 3 different 3D worlds.",
        "The task setup involved pairs of human partners, each of whom played one of two different roles.",
        "The \"direction follower\" (DF) moved about in the virtual world with the goal of completing a treasure hunting task, but had no knowledge of the map of the world or the specific behavior of objects within that world (such as, which buttons to press to open doors).",
        "The other partner acted as the \"direction giver\" (DG), who was given complete knowledge of the world and had to give instructions to the DF to guide him/her to accomplish the task.",
        "The GIVE-2 corpus is a multimodal corpus which consists of all the instructions uttered by the DG, and all the object manipulations done by the DF with the corresponding timestamp.",

      "text": [
        "Our algorithm consists of two phases: an annotation phase and a selection phase.",
        "The annotation phase is performed only once and consists of automatically associating the DG instruction to the DF reaction.",
        "The selection phase is performed every time the virtual instructor generates an instruction and consists of picking out from the annotated corpus the most appropriate instruction at a given point.",
        "The basic idea of the annotation is straightforward: associate each utterance with its corresponding reaction.",
        "We assume that a reaction captures the semantics of its associated instruction.",
        "Defining reaction involves two subtle issues, namely boundary determination and discretization.",
        "We discuss these issues in turn and then give a formal definition of reaction.",
        "We define the boundaries of a reaction as follows.",
        "A reaction rk to an instruction uk begins right after the instruction uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction uk+1 is uttered.",
        "In the following example, instruction 1 corresponds to the reaction (2, 3, 4), instruction 5 corresponds to (6), and instruction 7 to (8).",
        "DG(1): hit the red you see in the far room DG(5): hit far side green DF(6): [moves next to the wrong green] DF(8): [moves to the right green and pushes it]",
        "As the example shows, our definition of boundaries is not always semantically correct.",
        "For instance, it can be argued that it includes too much because 4 is not strictly part of the semantics of 1.",
        "Furthermore, misinterpreted instructions (as 5) and corrections (e.g., 7) result in clearly inappropriate instruction-reaction associations.",
        "Since we want to avoid any manual annotation, we decided to use this naive definition of boundaries anyway.",
        "We discuss in Section 5 the impact that inappropriate associations have on the performance of a virtual instructor.",
        "The second issue that we address here is discretization of the reaction.",
        "It is well known that there is not a unique way to discretize an action into subactions.",
        "For example, we could decompose action 2 into 'enter the room' or into 'get close to the door and pass the door'.",
        "Our algorithm is not dependent on a particular discretization.",
        "However, the same discretization mechanism used for annotation has to be used during selection, for the dialogue manager to work properly.",
        "For selection (i.e., in order to decide what to say next) any virtual instructor needs to have a planner and a planning domain representation, i.e., a specification of how the virtual world works and a way to represent the state of the virtual world.",
        "Therefore, we decided to use them in order to discretize the reaction.",
        "Now we are ready to define reaction formally.",
        "Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when uttering instruction uk, Sk+1 be the state of the world when uttering the next utterance uk+1 and D be the planning domain representation.",
        "The reaction to uk is defined as the sequence of actions returned by the planner with Sk as initial state, Sk+1 as goal state and D as planning domain.",
        "The annotation of the corpus then consists of automatically associating each utterance to its (dis-cretized) reaction.",
        "In this section we describe how the selection phase is performed every time the virtual instructor generates an instruction.",
        "The instruction selection algorithm consists in finding in the corpus the set of candidate utterances C for the current task plan P ; P being the sequence of actions returned by the same planner and planning domain used for discretization.",
        "We define C = {U G Corpus | U.Reaction is a prefix of P}.",
        "In other words, an utterance U belongs to C if the first actions of the current plan P exactly match the reaction associated to the utterance.",
        "All the utterances that pass this test are considered paraphrases and hence suitable in the current context.",
        "While P does not change, the virtual instructor iterates through the set C, verbalizing a different utterance at fixed time intervals (e.g., every 3 seconds).",
        "In other words, the virtual instructor offers alternative paraphrases of the intended instruction.",
        "When P changes as a result of the actions of the DF, C is recalculated.",
        "It is important to notice that the discretization used for annotation and selection directly impacts the behavior of the virtual instructor.",
        "It is crucial then to find an appropriate granularity of the discretization.",
        "If the granularity is too coarse, many instructions in the corpus will have an empty associated reaction.",
        "For instance, in the absence of the representation of the user orientation in the planning domain (as is the case for the virtual instructor we evaluate in Section 5), instructions like \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" will have empty reactions making them indistinguishable during selection.",
        "However, if the granularity is too fine the user may get into situations that do not occur in the corpus, causing the selection algorithm to return an empty set of candidate utterances.",
        "It is the responsibility of the virtual instructor developer to find a granularity sufficient to capture the diversity of the instructions he wants to distinguish during selection."

        "Figure 2: \"the closet one\"",
        "Figure 4: \"exit the way you entered\"",
        "chair is a direct consequence of the utterances normally said in the corpus at this stage of the task plan (that is, when the user is about to manipulate this object).",
        "From the point of view of referring expression algorithms, the referring expression may not be optimal because it is over-specified (a pronoun would be preferred as in \"click it\"), Furthermore, the instruction contains a spelling error ('closet' instead of 'closest').",
        "In spite of this non optimality, the instruction led our user to execute the intended reaction, namely pushing the button.",
        "Right after the user clicks on the button (Figure 3), the system selects an utterance corresponding to the new task plan.",
        "The player position stayed the same so the only change in the plan is that the button no longer needs to be pushed.",
        "In this task state, DGs usually give acknowledgements and this then what our selection algorithm selects: \"good\".",
        "After receiving the acknowledgement, the user turns around and walks forward, and the next action in the plan is to leave the room (Figure 4).",
        "The system selects the utterance \"exit the way you entered\" which refers to the previous interaction.",
        "Again, the system keeps no representation of the past actions of the user, but such utterances are the ones that are found at this stage of the task plan."

        "In any case, our results are preliminary given the amount of subjects that we tested (13 versus around 290 for GIVE-2), but they are indeed encouraging.",
        "In particular, our system helped users to identify better the objects that they needed to manipulate in the virtual world, as shown by the low number ofmouse actions required to complete the task (a high number indicates that the user must have manipulated wrong objects).",
        "This correlates with the subjective evaluation of referring expression quality (see next section).",
        "We performed a detailed analysis of the instructions uttered by our system that were unsuccessful, that is, all the instructions that did not cause the intended reaction as annotated in the corpus.",
        "From the 2081 instructions uttered in the 13 interactions, 1304 (63%) of them were successful and 777 (37%) were unsuccessful.",
        "Given the limitations of the annotation discussed in Section 3.1 (wrong annotation of correction utterances and no representation of user orientation) we classified the unsuccessful utterances using lexical cues into 1) correction ('no','don't','keep', etc.",
        "), 2) orientation instruction ('left', 'straight', 'behind', etc.)",
        "and 3) other.",
        "We found that 25% of the unsuccessful utterances are of type 1,40% are type 2, 34% are type 3 (1% corresponds to the default utterance \"go\" that our system utters when the set of candidate utterances is empty).",
