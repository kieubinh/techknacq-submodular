        "An alternative way to take advantage of the existing MT technologies is to use them in collaboration with human translators within a computer-assisted translation (CAT) or interactive framework (Isabelle and Church, 1997).",
        "Interactivity in CAT has been explored for a long time.",
        "Systems have been designed to interact with linguists to solve ambiguities or update user dictionaries.",
        "An important contribution to CAT technology was pioneered by the TransType project (Foster et al., 1997; Langlais et al., 2002).",
        "The idea proposed in that work was to embed data driven MT techniques within the interactive translation environment.",
        "Following the TransType ideas, Barrachina et al.",
        "(2009) proposed the so-called IMT framework, in which fully-fledged statistical MT (SMT) systems are used to produce full target sentences hypotheses, or portions thereof, which can be accepted or amended by a human translator.",
        "Each corrected text segment is then used by the MT system as additional information to achieve improved suggestions.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a typical IMT session.",
        "The vast majority of the existing work on IMT makes use of the well-known batch learning paradigm.",
        "In the batch learning paradigm, the training of the IMT system and the interactive translation process are carried out in separate stages.",
        "This paradigm is not able to take advantage of the new knowledge produced by the user of the IMT system.",
        "In this paper, we present an application of the online learning paradigm to the IMT framework.",
        "In the online learning paradigm, the training and prediction stages are no longer separated.",
        "This feature is particularly useful in IMT since it allows to take into account the user feedback.",
