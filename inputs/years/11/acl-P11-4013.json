        "However, as wikis do not enforce their users to structure pages or add complementary metadata, wikis often end up as a mass of unmanageable pages with meaningless page titles and no usable link structure (Buffa, 2006).",

        "In this section, we present the different types of NLP-enabled support provided by Wikulu.",
        "Detecting Duplicates Whenever users add new content to a wiki there is the danger of duplicating already contained information.",
        "In order to avoid duplication, users would need comprehensive knowledge of what content is already present in the wiki, which is almost impossible for large wikis like Wikipedia.",
        "Wikulu helps to detect potential duplicates by computing the text similarity between newly added content and each existing wiki page.",
        "If a potential duplicate is detected, the user is notified and may decide to augment the duplicate page instead of adding a new one.",
        "Wikulu integrates text similarity measures such as Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) and Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "Suggesting Links While many wiki users readily add textual contents to wikis, they often restrain from also adding links to related pages.",
        "However, links in wikis are crucial as they allow users to quickly navigate from one page to another, or browse through the wiki.",
        "Therefore, it may be reasonable to augment a page about the topic sentiment analysis by a link to a page providing related information such as evaluation datasets.",
        "Wikulu supports users in this tedious task by automatically suggesting links.",
        "Link suggestion thereby is a two-step process: (a) first, suitable text phrases are extracted which might be worth to place a link on (see Figure 2), and (b) for each phrase, related pages are ranked by comparing their relevance to the current page, and then presented to the user.",
        "The user may thus decide whether she wants to use a detected phrase as a link or not, and if so, which other wiki page to link this phrase to.",
        "Wikulu currently integrates link suggestion algorithms by Geva (2007) and Itakura and Clarke (2007).",
        "Semantic Searching The capabilities of a wiki's built-in search engine are typically rather limited as it traditionally performs e.g. keyword-based retrieval.",
        "If that keyword is not found in the wiki, the query returns an empty result set.",
        "However, a page might exist which is semantically related to the keyword, and should thus yield a match.",
        "As the search engine is typically a core part of the wiki system, it is rather difficult to modify its behavior.",
        "However, by leveraging Wikulu's architecture, we can replace the default search mechanisms by algorithms which allow for semantic search to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem (Gurevych et al., 2007).",
        "Segmenting Long Pages Due to the open editing policy of wikis, pages tend to grow rather fast.",

        "Suggested segment breaks are highlighted by yellow bars.",
        "For users, it is thus a major challenge to keep an overview of what content is present on a certain page.",
        "Wikulu therefore supports users by analyzing long pages through employing text segmentation algorithms which detect topically coherent segments of text.",
        "It then suggests segment boundaries which the user may or may not accept for inserting a subheading which makes pages easier to read and better to navigate.",
        "As shown in Figure 3, users are also encouraged to set a title for each segment.",
        "When accepting one or more of these suggested boundaries, Wikulu stores them persistently in the wiki.",
        "Wikulu currently integrates text segmentation methods such as TextTiling (Hearst, 1997) or C99 (Choi, 2000).",
        "Summarizing Pages Similarly to segmenting pages, Wikulu makes long wiki pages more accessible by generating an extractive summary.",
        "While generative summaries generate a summary in own words, extractive summaries analyze the original wiki text sentence-by-sentence, rank each sentence, and return a list of the most important ones (see Figure 4).",
        "Wikulu integrates extractive text summarization methods such as LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "Highlighting Keyphrases Another approach to assist users in better grasping the idea of a wiki page at a glance is to highlight important keyphrases (see Figure 1).",
        "As Tucker and Whittaker (2009) have shown, highlighting important phrases assists users with reading longer texts and yields faster understanding.",
        "Wikulu thus improves readability by employing automatic keyphrase extraction algorithms.",
        "Additionally, Wikulu allows to dynamically adjust the number of keyphrases shown by presenting a slider to the user.",

        "Visually Analyzing the Results of NLP Algorithms Wikulu facilitates analyzing the results of NLP algorithms by using wiki pages as input documents and visualizing the results directly on that page.",
        "Consider an NLP algorithm which performs sentiment analysis.",
        "Typically, we were to put our analysis sentences in a text file, launch the NLP application, process the file, and would read the output from either a built-in console or a separate output file.",
        "This procedure suffers from two major drawbacks: (a) it is inconvenient to copy existing data into a custom input format which can be fed into the NLP system, and (b) the textual output does not allow presenting the results in a visually rich manner.",
        "Wikulu tackles both challenges by using wiki pages as input/output documents.",
        "For instance, by running the sentiment analysis component right from within the wiki, its output can be written back to the originating wiki page, resulting in visually rich, possibly interactive presentations.",
        "Educational Purposes Wikulu is a handy tool for educational purposes as it allows to (a) rapidly create test data in a collaborative manner (see Section 2), and (b) visualize the results of NLP algorithms, as described above.",
        "Students can gather hands-on experience by experimenting with NLP components in an easy-to-use wiki system.",
        "They can both collaboratively edit input documents, and explore possible results of e.g. different configurations of NLP components.",
        "In our system prototype, we integrated highlighting parts-of-speech which have been determined by a POS tagger.",
        "Enabling Semantic Wikis Semantic wikis such as the Semantic MediaWiki (Krotzsch et al., 2006) augment standard wikis with machine-readable semantic annotations of pages and links.",
        "As those annotations have to be entered manually, this step is often skipped by users which severely limits the usefulness of semantic wikis.",
        "Wikulu could support users e.g. by automatically suggesting the type of a link by means of relation detection or the type of a page by means of text categorization.",
        "Thus, Wikulu could constitute an important step towards the se-mantification of the content contained in wikis."

        "It acts as an HTTP proxy server which intercepts the communication between the web browser and the target wiki engine, while it allows to run any Apache UIMA-compliant NLP component using an extensible plugin mechanism.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we introduce each module: (a) the proxy server which allows to add Wikulu to any target wiki engine, (b) the JavaScript injection that bridges the gap between the client-and server-side code, (c) the plugin manager which gives access to any Apache UIMA-based NLP component, and (d) the wiki abstraction layer which offers a high-level interface to typical wiki operations such as reading and writing the wiki content.",
        "Proxy Server Wikulu is designed to work with any underlying wiki engine such as MediaWiki or TWiki.",
        "Consequently, we implemented it as an HTTP proxy server which allows it to be enabled at any time by changing the proxy settings of a user's web browser.",
        "The proxy server intercepts all requests between the user who interacts with her web browser, and the underlying wiki engine.",
        "For example, Wikulu passes certain requests to its language processing components, or augments the default wiki toolbar by additional commands.",
        "We elaborate on the latter in the following paragraph.",
        "JavaScript Injection Wikulu modifies the requests between web browser and target wiki by injecting custom client-side JavaScript code.",
        "Wikulu is thus capable of altering the default behavior of the wiki engine, e.g. replacing a keyword-based retrieval by enhanced search methods (cf.",
        "Section 2), adding novel behavior such as additional toolbar buttons or advanced input fields, or augmenting the originating web page after a certain request has been processed, e.g. an NLP algorithm has been run.",

        "It relies on Apache UIMA-compliant NLP components which use wiki pages (or parts thereof) as input texts.",

        "Wiki Abstraction Layer Wikulu communicates with the underlying wiki engine via an abstraction layer.",
