        "Producing semantic representations of text is motivated not only by theoretical considerations but also by the hypothesis that semantics can be used to improve automatic systems for tasks that are intrinsically semantic in nature such as question answering, textual entailment, machine translation, and more generally any natural language task that might benefit from inference in order to more closely approximate human performance.",
        "Since formal logics have formal denotational semantics, and are good candidates for supporting inference, they have often been taken to be the targets for mapping text to semantic representations, with frameworks emphasizing (more) tractable inference choosing first order predicate logic (Stickel, 1985) while those emphasizing representational power favoring one of the many available higher order logics (van Benthem, 1995).",
        "It was later recognized that in order to support some tasks, fully specifying certain aspects of a logic representation, such as quantifier scope, or reference resolution, is often not necessary.",
        "For example, for semantic translation, most ambiguities of quantifier scope can be carried over from the source language to the target language without being resolved.",
        "This led to the development of underspecified semantic representations (e.g. QLF, Alshawi and Crouch (1992) and MRS, Copestake et al. (2005)) which are easier to produce from text without contextual inference but which can be further specified as necessary for the task being performed.",
        "While traditionally mapping text to formal representations was predominantly rule-based, for both the syntactic and semantic components (Montague (1973), Pereira and Shieber (1987), Alshawi (1992)), good progress in statistical syntactic parsing (e.g. Collins (1999), Charniak (2000)) led to systems that applied rules for semantic interpretation to the output of a statistical syntactic parser (e.g. Bos et al.",
        "(2004)).",
        "More recently researchers have looked at statistical methods to provide robust and trainable methods for mapping text to formal representations of meaning (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005).",
        "In this paper we further develop the two strands of work mentioned above, i.e. mapping text to underspecified semantic representations and using statistical parsing methods to perform the analysis.",
        "Here we take a more direct route, starting from scratch by designing an underspecified semantic representation (Natural Logical Form, or NLF) that is purpose-built for statistical text-to-semantics mapping.",
        "An underspecified logic whose constructs are motivated by natural language and that is amenable to trainable direct semantic mapping from text without an intervening layer of syntactic representation.",
        "In contrast, the approach taken by (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005), for example, maps into traditional logic via lambda expressions, and the approach taken by (Poon and Domingos, 2009) depends on an initial step of syntactic parsing.",
        "In this paper, we describe a supervised training method for mapping text to NLF, that is, producing a statistical model for this mapping starting from training pairs consisting of sentences and their corresponding NLF expressions.",
        "This method makes use of an encoding of NLF expressions into dependency trees in which the set of labels is automatically generated from the encoding process (rather than being pre-supplied by a linguistically motivated dependency grammar).",
        "This encoding allows us to perform the text-to-NLF mapping using any existing statistical methods for labeled dependency parsing (e.g. Eisner (1996), Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), McDonald, Crammer, Pereira (2005)).",
        "A side benefit of the encoding is that it leads to a natural per-word measure for semantic mapping accuracy which we use for evaluation purposes.",
        "By combing our method with deterministic statistical dependency models together with deterministic (hard) clusters instead of parts of speech, we obtain a deterministic statistical text-to-semantics mapper, opening the way to feasible mapping of text-to-semantics at a large scale, for example the entire web.",
        "This paper concentrates on the text-to-semantics mapping which depends, in part, on some properties of NLF.",
        "We will not attempt to defend the semantic representation choices for specific constructions illustrated here.",
        "NLF is akin to a variable-free variant of QLF or an MRS in which some handle constraints are determined during parsing.",
        "For the purposes of this paper it is sufficient to note that NLF has roughly the same granularity of semantic representation as these earlier underspecified representations.",
        "We outline the steps of our text-to-semantics mapping method in Section 2, introduce NLF in Section 3, explain the encoding of NLF expressions as formal dependency trees in Section 4, and report on experiments for training and testing statistical models for mapping text to NLF expressions in Section 5."

        "(easier) test set which excludes examples in which the test semantic expressions contain Null operators.",
        "The strictest settings, in which semantic expressions with Null are not included in training but included in the test set effectively treat prediction of Null operators as errors.",
        "The lower accuracy (high 70's) for such stricter settings thus incorporates a penalty for our incomplete coverage of semantics for the WSJ sentences.",
        "The less strict Test+Null settings in which % is treated as a valid output may be relevant to applications that can tolerate some unknown operators between subexpressions in the output semantics.",
        "Next we look at the effect of limiting the size of the automatically generated formal label set prior to training.",
        "For this we take the configuration using the TrainWSJ-Null+AAlign training set and the TestWSJ-Null-AAlign test set (the third row in Table refPerWordSemanticAccuracyAAlign for which auto-alignment is used and only labels without the NULL operator % are included).",
        "For this training set there are 151 formal labels.",
        "We then limit the training set to instances that only include the most frequent k labels, for k = 100, 50,25,12, while keeping the test set the same.",
        "As can be seen in Table 7, the accuracy is unaffected when the training set is limited to the 100 most frequent or 50 most frequent labels.",
        "There is a slight loss when training is limited to 25 labels and a large loss if it is limited to 12 labels.",
        "This appears to show that, for this corpus, the core label set needed to construct the majority of semantic expressions has a size somewhere between 25 and 50.",
        "It is perhaps interesting that this is roughly the size of hand-produced traditional dependency label sets.",
        "On the other hand, it needs to be emphasized that since Table 7 ignores beyond-coverage constructions that presently include Null labels, it is likely that a larger label set would be needed for more complete semantic coverage."

        "We've shown that by designing an underspecified logical form that is motivated by, and closely related to, natural language constructions, it is possible to train a direct statistical mapping from pairs of sentences and their corresponding semantic expressions, with per-word accuracies ranging from 79% to 86% depending on the strictness of the experimental setup.",
        "The input to training does not require any traditional syntactic categories or parts of speech.",
        "We also showed, more specifically, that we can train a model that can be applied deterministically at runtime (using a deterministic shift reduce algorithm combined with deterministic clusters), making large-scale text-to-semantics mapping feasible.",
        "In traditional formal semantic mapping methods (Montague (1973), Bos et al.",
        "(2004)), and even some recent statistical mapping methods (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005), the semantic representation is overloaded to performs two functions: (i) representing the final meaning, and (ii) composing meanings from the meanings of subconstituents (e.g. through application of higher order lambda functions).",
        "In our view, this leads to what are perhaps overly complex semantic representations of some basic linguistic constructions.",
        "In contrast, in the method we presented, these two concerns (meaning representation and semantic construction) are separated, enabling us to keep the semantics of constituents simple, while turning the construction of semantic expressions into a separate structured learning problem (with its own internal prediction and decoding mechanisms).",
        "Although, in the experiments we reported here we do prepare the training data from a traditional treebank, we are encouraged by the results and believe that annotation of a corpus with only semantic expressions is sufficient for building an efficient and reasonably accurate text-to-semantics mapper.",
        "Indeed, we have started building such a corpus for a question answering application, and hope to report results for that corpus in the future.",
        "Other further work includes a formal denotational semantics of the underspeciied logical form and elaboration of practical inference operations with the semantic expressions.",
        "This work may also be seen as a step towards viewing semantic interpretation of language as the interaction between a pattern recognition process (described here) and an inference process.",
