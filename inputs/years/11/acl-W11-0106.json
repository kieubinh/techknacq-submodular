        "In other words, semantic relations are implicit associations between concepts in text.",
        "In general, a semantic relation is defined by stating the kind of connection linking two concepts.",
        "For example, Hendrickx et al.",
        "(2009) loosely define entity-origin as an entity is coming or is derived from an origin (e.g., position or material) and give one example: Earth is located in the Milky Way.",
        "We find this kind of definition weak and prone to confusion.",
        "Following Helbig (2005), we propose an extended definition for semantic relations, including semantic restrictions for its domain and range.",
        "For example, Domain(agent) must be an animate concrete object and Range(agent) must be a situation.",
        "Moreover, we propose to characterize relations by semantic primitives.",
        "Primitives indicate if a certain property holds between the arguments of a relation.",
        "For example, the primitive temporal indicates if the first argument must happen before the second in order for the relation to hold.",
        "This primitive holds for cause (a cause must precede its effect) and it does not apply to part-whole since the later relation does not consider time.",
        "Besides having a better understanding of each relation, this extended definition allows us to create a model that automatically obtains inference axioms for composing semantic relations.",
        "The model detects possible combinations of relations and identifies the conclusion of composing them.",

        "Any ontology can be used to define domains and ranges, e.g., Helbig (2005) defined one to define a set of 89 relations.",
        "Primitives are represented by an array PR of length n, where n is the number of primitives and P^ indicates the value r takes for the ith primitive.",
        "The inverse of r is denoted r_1 and can be obtained by simply switching the arguments of r. Given r(x, y), r_1(y, x) always holds.",
        "We can easily define r_1 given the definition for r: Domain(r_1) = Range(r), Range(r_1) = Domain(r), and PR-i is defined according to the fourth column of Table 1 for each primitive, i.e., Vi € [1, n] : PlR-i = Inverse(PlR).",

        "They specify basic attributes of a relation by stating if a particular property must hold by definition between the domain and range.",

        "They help to understand the interrelation differences and clustering relations.",

        "Time (whether an argument is guaranteed to happen before than the other), space and volition (whether or not there must be volition between the arguments) also play an important role.",

        "An issue might be that the proposed set of primitives is not enough for a particular set, but more primitives could be added to solve this eventuality.",
        "A further issue with the algebra is the fact that primitives are composed orthogonally.",
        "This is a simplification, but we have shown that this simplified algebra works.",
