        "However, systems built solely using first-order logical forms tend to be very brittle as they have no way of integrating uncertain knowledge.",
        "They, therefore, tend to have high precision at the cost of low recall (Bos and Markert, 2005).",
        "Recent advances in computational linguistics have yielded robust methods that use weighted or probabilistic models.",
        "For example, distributional models of word meaning have been used successfully to judge paraphrase appropriateness.",
        "This has been done by representing the word meaning in context as a point in a high-dimensional semantics space (Erk and Pado, 2008; Thater et al., 2010; Erk and Pado, 2010).",
        "However, these models typically handle only individual phenomena instead of providing a meaning representation for complete sentences.",

        "The goal of this work is to combine logic-based meaning representations with probabilities in a single unified framework.",
        "This will allow us to obtain the best of both situations: we will have the full expressivity of first-order logic and be able to reason with probabilities.",
        "We believe that this will allow for a more complete and robust approach to natural language understanding.",
        "In order to perform logical inference with probabilities, we draw from the large and active body of work related to Statistical Relational AI (Getoor and Taskar, 2007).",
        "Specifically, we make use of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) which employ weighted graphical models to represent first-order logical formulas.",

        "Bos and Markert (2005) describe a system for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) that uses Boxer to convert both the premise and hypothesis of an RTE pair into first-order logical semantic representations and then uses a theorem prover to check for logical entailment.",

        "Distributional models are able to predict semantic similarity between words based on distributional similarity and they can be learned in an unsupervised fashion.",

        "An MLN consists of a set of weighted first-order clauses.",
        "It provides a way of softening first-order logic by making situations in which not all clauses are satisfied less likely but not impossible (Richardson and Domingos, 2006).",
        "More formally, let X be the set of all propositions describing a world (i.e. the set of all ground atoms), F be the set of all clauses in the MLN, Wi be the weight associated with clause fi € Gft be the set of all possible groundings of clause fi, and Z be the normalization constant.",
        "Then the probability of a particular truth assignment x to the variables in X is defined as:",
        "where #(x) is 1 if g is satisfied and 0 otherwise, and nj(x) = J2gegf <7(x) is the number of groundings of fi that are satisfied given the current truth assignment to the variables in X.",

        "Implication signatures take the form \"x/y\" where x represents the implicativity in the the positive environment and y represents the implicativity in the negative environment.",
        "Both x and y have three possible values: \"+\" for positive entailment, meaning the nested proposition is entailed, \"-\" for negative entailment, meaning the negation of the proposition is entailed, and \"o\" for \"null\" entailment, meaning that neither the proposition nor its negation is entailed.",
        "Figure 2 gives concrete examples.",
        "We use these implication signatures to automatically generate rules that license specific entailments in the MLN.",

        "Likewise, (7b) says that if the occurrence of \"forget to\" appears in a DRS determined to be false, then the theme DRS should be considered true.",
        "Note that when the implication signature indicates a \"null\" entailment, no rule is generated for that case.",
        "This prevents the MLN from licensing entailments related directly to the nested proposition, but still allows for entailments that include the factive verb.",
        "So he wanted to fly entails neither he flew nor he did not fly, but it does still license he wanted to fly.",
        "Ambiguity in word meaning",

        "In this section we discuss our probabilistic approach to paraphrasing.",
        "In the next section we discuss how this approach is extended to cover hypernymy.",
        "A central problem to solve in the context of paraphrases is that they are context-dependent.",
        "Consider again example (3) and its two hypotheses.",
        "The first hypothesis replaces the word \"sweeping\" with a paraphrase that is valid in the given context, while the second uses an incorrect paraphrase.",

        "Boxer alone is unable to make this connection, but if we receive this information as input, either from gold-labeled data or a third-party coreference tool, we are able to incorporate it.",
        "Since Boxer is able to identify the index of the word that generated a particular predicate, we can tie each predicate to any related coreference chains.",
        "Then, for each atom on the chain, we can inject copies of all of the coreferring atoms, replacing the variables to match.",
        "For example, the word \"he\" generates an atom pred(l0, male, z5) and \"Christopher\" generates atom named(l0, christopher, x0).",
        "So, we can create a new atom by taking the atom for \"christopher\" and replacing the label and variable with that of the atom for \"he\", generating named(l0, christopher, x5).",
        "As a more complex example, the coreference information will inform us that \"the new ballpark\" corefers with \"a replacement for Candlestick Park\".",
        "However, our system is currently unable to handle this coreference correctly at this time because, unlike the previous example, the expression \"a replacement for Candlestick Park\" results in a complex three-atom conjunct with two separate variables: pred(l2, replacement, x6), rel(l2,for, x6, x7), and named(l2, candlestick-park, x7).",
        "Now, unifying with the atom for \"a ballpark\", pred(l0, ballpark, x3), is not as simple as replacing the variable because there are two variables to choose from.",
        "Note that it would not be correct to replace both variables since this would result in a unification of \"ballpark\" with \"candlestick_park\" which is wrong.",
        "Instead we must determine that x6 should be the one to unify with x3 while x7 is replaced with a fresh variable.",
        "The way that we can accomplish this is to look at the dependency parse of the sentence that is produced by the C&C parser is a precursor to running Boxer.",
        "By looking up both \"replacement\" and \"Candlestick Park\" in the parse, we can determine that \"replacement\" is the head of the phrase, and thus is the atom whose variable should be unified.",
        "So, we would create new atoms, pred(l0, replacement, x3), rel(l0,for, x3, z0), and named(l0, candlestick-park, z0), where z0 is a fresh variable.",
        "The second way that we make use of coreference information is to extend the sentential contexts used for calculating the appropriateness of paraphrases in the distributional model.",
        "In the simplest case, the sentential context of a word would simply be the other words in the sentence.",
