        "Large-scale lexical semantic resources that provide relational information about words have recently received much focus in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "In particular, data-driven models for lexical semantics require the creation of broad-coverage, hand-annotated corpora with predicate-argument information, i.e. rich information about words expressing a semantic relation having argument slots filled by the interpretations of their grammatical complements.",
        "Corpora combining semantic and syntactic annotations constitute the backbone for the development of probabilistic models that automatically identify the semantic relationships, or semantic roles, conveyed by sentential constituents (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "That is, given an input sentence and a target predicator the system labels constituents with general roles like Agent, Patient, Theme, etc., or more specific roles, as in (1).",
        "(1) [cognizer I] admired [Evaluée him] [Degree greatly] [Reason for his bravery and his cheerfulness].",
        "The task of automatic semantic role labelling (or shallow semantic parsing) is a first step towards text understanding and has found use in a variety of NLP applications including information extraction (Sur-deanu et al., 2003), machine translation (Boas, 2002), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004), summarisation (Melli et al., 2005), recognition of textual entailment relations (Burchardt and Frank, 2006), etc.",
        "Corpora with semantic role labels additionally lend themselves to extraction of linguistic knowledge at the syntax-semantics interface.",
        "The range of semantic and syntactic combinatorial properties (valences) of each word in each of its senses is documented in terms of annotated corpus attestations.",
        "For instance, the valence pattern for the use of admire in (1) is shown in (2).",
        "(2) Cognizer: Noun Phrase (NP), Subject Evaluee: Noun Phrase (NP), Object Degree: Adverbial Dependent Reason: Prepositional Dependent",
        "This data enables the quantitative study of various linguistic phenomena and the investigation of the relationship between the distinct linguistic layers comprised by predicate-argument analysis.",
        "Furthermore, the formulation of generalisations over predicate-specific annotations can capture how predicates relate in terms of both semantic and syntactic features.",
        "Such syntax-semantics mappings (so-called linking generalisations) encode regularities concerning the associations of semantic roles with grammatical functions and are essential for a linguistic knowledge base for NLP applications.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of generalising over the valences of individual predicators and proposes an abstract semantic basis for the representation of participant roles.",
        "The definition of semantic notions at an appropriate level of abstraction is the prerequisite for the formulation of a general, principled syntax-semantics interface.",
        "This is in accordance with a somewhat intuitive conception of semantic roles as classificatory notions encoding semantic similarities across different types of events or situations in the world.",
        "In effect, all conceptions of semantic roles as opposed to predicate-specific roles, such as admirer-admired, posit some sort of semantic classification of arguments across predicators while indicating an acknowledgment that the syntax-semantics interface (referred to with the term linking) is not completely arbitrary.",
        "Put differently, semantic roles constitute a level of representation suitable for capturing semantic generalisations which humans tend to express systematically through language.",
        "The structure of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 looks at conceptions of semantic roles in state-of-the-art approaches to semantic annotation indicating problems or complications related to the question of whether or how these roles can support generalisations across predicates.",
        "Section 3 calls attention to the theoretical underpinnings of the notion of semantic role and introduces an annotation schema which departs from the traditional view of semantic roles as atomic, undecomposable categories.",
        "Following the insight of Dowty's (1991) theory of Proto-Roles, I will propose analytical representations of verbal arguments based on semantically well-founded, grammatically relevant meaning components entailed by the semantics of predicates (Proto-Role entailments).",
        "Finally, section 4 presents a study in which lexical entailments are marked in a corpus in accordance with the proposed schema.",
        "General syntax-semantics mappings are extracted from the annotated data and are formalised in abstract classes which readily encode generalisations concerning linking to syntactic form."

        "Semantically annotated corpora currently available for English implement two distinct approaches to the prickly notion of semantic role.",
        "The Proposition Bank (PropBank) (Kingsbury et al., 2002) is a one million word corpus in which predicate-argument relations are hand-annotated for every occurrence of every verb in the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "Verb senses are distinguished informally on the basis of semantic as well as syntactic criteria.",
        "The semantic arguments of a verb are numbered sequentially.",
        "PropBank uses a common set of role labels (Arg0 up to Arg5) for all predicators, but these labels are defined on a per-verb basis, i.e. they have verb-specific meanings.",
        "Example PropBank annotations:",
        "(3) a.",
        "[Arg0 John] broke [Arg1 the window] [Arg2 with a rock].",
        "b.",
        "[Arg0 John] broke [Arg1 the window] [Arg3 into a million pieces].",
        "c. [Arg1 The window] broke [Arg3 into a million pieces].",
        "(4) [Arg0 Blue-chip consumer stocks] provided [Arg1 a lift] [Arg2 to the industrial average].",
        "As illustrated in (3), argument labels are consistent across alternate syntactic patterns of a given predicator in a given sense.",
        "However, PropBank refrains from formalising the semantics of the role labels and does not ensure their coherence across verbs.",
        "This is particularly clear with higher numbered labels, which correspond to distinct types of participants: Arg2 marks an Instrument for break (3), a Benefactive for provide (4), and a Source for buy (5).",
        "Lower-numbered labels denote various roles as well, but they are less arbitrary across verbs: Arg0 corresponds to traditional Agents, Experiencers, certain types of Theme, etc.",
        "which surface as subjects of transitive verbs and a class of intransitives called unergatives; Arg1, on the other hand, is assigned to objects of transitive verbs and subjects of unaccusatives and is the equivalent of traditional Patients, Themes, etc.",
        "While the PropBank corpus enables empirical insight into a variety of linguistic phenomena (e.g. variations in the grammatical expression of arguments) providing useful frequency information for the uses of predicators, it does not lend itself to extraction of a principled linguistic knowledge base with semantic generalisations across predicates.",
        "Inasmuch as no consistent mapping is ensured between a label and a semantic role, the argument labels result seriously overloaded across verbs.",
        "This explains why role recognition models have particularly poor performance in assigning the labels Arg -Arg5.",
        "In fact, an attempt is currently made to map PropBank argument labels to semantically coherent roles specified by VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) (i.e. a broad-coverage verb lexicon based on Levin's (1993) classification of English verbs according to shared meaning and behaviour).",
        "Even though VerbNet specifies a small list of abstract roles (23 in total) which are intended to support generalisations, these roles are not defined as global primitives, but are meaningful only within verb classes.",
        "Because mappings of labels to semantic roles with class-specific interpretations would lead to very sparse data, argument labels are subdivided into groupings of VerbNet roles.",
        "The latter are created manually on the basis of analysis of argument use.",
        "The subdivided (more coherent) PropBank labels perform better for semantic role labelling (Loper et al., 2007).",
        "A different paradigm for semantic role annotation is put forth by FrameNet.",
        "The Berkeley FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998) is creating an online lexical database containing semantic descriptions of words based on Fillmore's (1985) theory of frame semantics.",
        "The basic unit of analysis is the semantic frame, i.e. a schematic representation of a stereotypical scene or situation.",
        "Each frame is associated with a set of predicates (including verbs, nouns, and adjectives) and a set of semantic roles (called Frame Elements, FEs) encoding the participants and props in the designated scene.",
        "FrameNet includes manually annotated example sentences from the British National Corpus incorporating additional layers of phrase structure and grammatical function annotation.",
        "It also includes two small corpora of full-text annotation intended to facilitate statistical analysis of frame-semantic structures.",
        "Currently it contains more than 960 frames covering more than 11,600 lexical items exemplified in more than 150,000 annotated sentences.",

        "Instead Frame Elements are defined locally, i.e. in terms of frames.",
        "Frames are situated in semantic space by means of directed (asymmetric) relations.",
        "Each frame-to-frame relation associates a less dependent or more general frame (Superframe) with a more dependent or less general one (Sub frame).",
        "The hierarchical organisation of frames along with FE identities or analogs across frames are intended to enable the formulation of generalisations concerning the combinatorial properties (valences) of predicates.",
        "In practice, however, the frame hierarchy turns out to be somewhat complicated.",
        "Inheritance (i.e. the strongest semantic relation and the most plausible to propagate valence information across frames) is conditioned on complex sets of semantic components underlying frame definitions, ranging from FE membership and relations to other frames to relationships among FEs and Semantic Types on frames and FEs.",
        "This kind of frame dependence based on fine-grained semantic or ontological distinctions is doomed to miss argument structure commonalities in predicates evoking frames that are related at a more abstract, essentially structural semantic level.",
        "Section 4 includes a concrete example of the complications in generalising valence information across FrameNet frames.",
        "Researchers working in the FrameNet paradigm have proposed different approaches for abstracting over the properties of individual predicators and increasing the size of training data for semantic role labelling systems.",

        "(2009) also explore various machine learning features for generalising semantic roles in FrameNet, namely role hierarchy, human-understandable descriptors of Frame Elements, Semantic Types of filler phrases, and mappings of FrameNet roles to roles of VerbNet.",
        "The experimental result of the role classification using these generalisation features shows significant improvements in the system.",
        "This is due to the fact that role generalisations can form a remedy for the severe problem of sparse data which is inherent in lexical semantic corpus annotation.",
        "Data sparseness, i.e. the insufficient coverage of the range of predicate senses and constructions within sensible sizes of manually annotated data, is a bottleneck both for acquisition of linguistic knowledge for the semantic lexicon and for automated techniques for semantic role assignment.",
        "3 An Abstract Semantic Basis for the Representation of Participant Roles",
        "From the presentation of different annotation projects it becomes evident that semantic role annotation is a complicated task whose product is deeply influenced by its initial design philosophy and underlying criteria.",
        "Among these criteria the notion of semantic role itself is central.",
        "PropBank uses general role labels that lack semantic coherence.",
        "VerbNet and FrameNet, on the other hand, specify coherent roles at a more fine-grained level (i.e. roles with class-specific or frame-specific interpretations).",
        "In this section, I consider the linguistic contours of the concept of semantic role proposing an annotation schema based upon theoretically well-founded role concepts which meet the requirements of both generality and coherence.",
        "This schema is intended at enabling the formulation of a general syntax-semantics interface suitable for modelling the relations of predicates in terms of combinatorial features.",
        "Espousing and extending Dowty's (1991) Proto-Role hypothesis, I propose to associate arguments of predicates with properties entailed by the semantics of predicates.",
        "Mappings of entailments to syntactic constituents can be many-to-one.",
        "That is, an argument can be marked with one or more properties necessarily entailed by the meaning of the predicator.",
        "Prepositional complements are also marked with verbal entailments to which prepositions may contribute more specific content.",
        "In this paper, I will make no attempt to formalise the content added by prepositions; prepositional semantics is represented solely in terms of the common entailment basis it shares with verbal meaning.",
        "Each Proto-Role entailment indicates a grammatically pervasive concept, i.e. a property having direct effect on the grammatical behaviour of predicates.",
        "It is defined in terms of an abstract semantic relation underlying the lexical meaning of the predicate.",
        "Five such relations are identified in terms of which entailment-based representations are specified: Notion, Causation, Motion, Possession, Conditioning.",
        "Note that contrary to mere ontological labels, entailment-based representations encode structural characterisations of the semantics of arguments.",
        "Consider, for instance, the sentence in (1), repeated here as (6) [cognizer I] admired [Evaluee him] [Reason for his bravery and his cheerfulness].",
        "A structural representation of the meaning of this construction will explicitly encode the relationships between each of the arguments of admire, i.e. between the NP I and the NP him, between the NP him and the PP for his bravery and his cheerfulness, and between the NP I and the PP for his bravery and his cheerfulness.",
        "By contrast, the FrameNet roles shown above do not model the fact that the semantic content of an Evaluee requires a Cognizer, or that a Reason requires both a Cognizer and an Evaluee.",
        "The view that the semantic properties underlying lexical meaning are relational in nature (i.e. they are not to be conceived entirely independently of one another) has been advocated by several researchers, among others Wechsler (1995), Pinker (1989), Jackendoff (1990), and Davis (2001), on whose work I build.",
        "In the rest of this section, I define a set of recurring entailments which underlie the semantics of a range of verbs displaying various syntactic patterns.",

        "In situation types in which a Conceiver is entailed to have a notion of more than one participant, Conceived arguments are distinguished on the basis of their salience in the overall semantics of the predicate.",
        "For instance, test (8) intuitively lexicalises a dyadic relation between a Conceiver (tester) and a Conceived (tested) entity.",
        "A sought entity denoted by a for-PP is represented as part of a secondary Notion relation situated at the background of the primary (testing) relation.",
        "Conceived entities that are peripheral to the essential relation lexicalised by the predicate are associated with a more specific property termed Conceived-backgroundstate.ot'.affairs (Conceived-bsoa).",
        "These arguments receive less focus in the meaning of the predicate, in a sense that they are not absolutely necessary to understand the predicate's meaning.",
        "The representation of test (8), stereotype (10), and find out (11) in terms of two Notion relations, one of which is treated as more salient, reifies the concept of relative significance of Proto-Role properties in the verbal semantics.",
        "This concept is related to the weighting of entailments in the overall semantics of a verb, which plays a critical role in determining the syntactic patterns in which the verb appears (i.e. the grammatical realisations of its arguments).",
        "The verbs in (8) and (9) involve an additional entailment of Intentionality.",
        "This is used to mark entities characterised by conscious choice, decision, or control over the course of inherently intentional actions.",
        "Intentional participants necessarily have a notion/perception of some event participant(s).",
        "The annotations in (12) and (13) include the Entity and Property tags which are intended to distinguish Conceived arguments in terms of a predicative relation assigned in the Conceiver's mental model.",

        "In each of the sentences above we can conclude something about the object participant (e.g. that it is necessary, illegal, or linguistically expressed) on the basis of the subject referent (i.e. the characteristics of the game, the regulations specified by the code, the usage of the adjective 'beautiful').",
        "By contrast, no property of the subject referent is necessarily conditioned on the object: the semantics of ban, for example, does not allow us to characterise code 1425 as fair/unfair, severe/lax, complete/incomplete, new/old, etc.",
        "on the basis of the object NP 'large trucks in tunnels'; similarly, we cannot infer the precise meaning of the word 'beautiful' or whether it is a verb or a noun or an adjective on the basis of the content of the NP 'a quality which can be found in many different objects'.",
        "A more precise definition of the Conditioning relation could state that the intrinsic (i.e. invariable) properties of a participant a determine or condition some non-intrinsic (i.e. variable or event-dependent) property of a participant ß while the converse entailment does not go through.",
        "In (24), for example, the sociolinguistics domain is associated with a property of being diverse whereas the intrinsic properties of the domain have no significance for the definition of 'diversity' or what this notion may characterise."

        "It is important to note that despite the argument structure similarities of these predicators, it is not possible to establish an identity link between the Act FE of the Intentionally_act frame and the Entity FE of Visiting in terms of the frame hierarchy, because the FEs are associated with different Semantic Types in the corresponding frame definitions, i.e. Act is of type State_of_affairs whereas Entity is of type PhysicaLobject.",

        "Predicates grouped together in L-Types have some but not necessarily all their grammatical properties in common.",
        "This is in accordance with the fact that L-Types are essentially semantically-driven modelling recurring, abstract features in the semantics of predicators while disregarding ephemeral properties as well as lexical idiosyncrasies.",
        "In addition to the set of entailments discussed in the previous section, L-Types may also incorporate more fine-grained properties that are clearly relevant to linking.",
        "For instance, verbs lexicalising a Desiring situation were found with prepositional complements introduced by for, after, to, towards, of, or over (e.g. long for, hanker after, aspire to, pine over, etc.",
        "), but not on, upon, at, or about (like other Notion verbs, such as ponder, muse, think, etc.).",
        "Inasmuch as a Desiring relation is identified as a recurring concept systematically associated with a particular grammatical relation (e.g. a for-PP), it can be represented in a separate L-Type inheriting from the Notion L-Type presented previously.",
        "An initial classification like the one exemplified above captures general conditions which determine possible associations between the semantics of predicators and grammatical relations realising their arguments (e.g. the fact that a conceived entity can only surface in subject position in a passive sentence).",
        "It can be extended and refined on the basis of more specific semantic relations.",
        "Moreover, L-Types can be organised in hierarchical structures.",
        "They can form the upper portion of a principled hierarchy of classes encoding successively broader levels of generalisations concerning argument linking.",
        "This study indicated that a small number of Lexicalisation Types abstracts over a wide range of FrameNet frames.",
        "More precisely, in the annotated dataset 48 L-Types were identified based on various combinations of entailments: 9 Notion Types, 7 Intentionality Types, 10 Causation Types, 7 Communication (CausedJNotion) Types, 7 Motion (including CausedJMotion) Types, 7 Possession (including Causes-Possession) Types, and 1 Conditioning Type.",
        "These Types readily abstract over associations of semantic properties and grammatical functions attested in over 200 FrameNet frames.",
        "In the FrameNet paradigm, L-Types can be modelled as non-lexicalised frames specifying syntactic mapping constraints.",
        "Mappings between FrameNet frames and L-Types can be stated by means of a separate relation in addition to the frame relations currently specified by FrameNet.",
        "A relation generalising the combinatorial properties of lexical items across frames would simplify the picture of the frame hierarchy, in that it would essentially decouple purely lexical semantic information (encoded by existing frame-to-frame relations) from information pertaining exactly to the interface of syntax and semantics.",
        "In future work, our intention is to test whether the proposed semantic role schema and the attested L-Types can be useful for dealing with the sparse data problem and increasing the performance of semantic role labelling systems."
