        "Bridging the gap between lexical knowledge and world knowledge is crucial for achieving natural language understanding.",
        "For example, knowing whether a nominal is a person or organization and whether a person is male or female substantially improves coreference resolution, even when such knowledge is gathered through noisy unsupervised approaches (Bergsma, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2009).",
        "However, existing algorithms and resources for such semantic knowledge have focused primarily on static properties of nominals (e.g. gender or entity type), not dynamic properties of verbs and events.",
        "This paper shows how to learn one such property: the typical duration of events.",
        "Since an event's duration is highly dependent on context, our algorithm models this aspectual property as a distribution over durations rather than a single mean duration.",
        "For example, a \"war\" typically lasts years, sometimes months, but almost never seconds, while \"look\" typically lasts seconds or minutes, but rarely years or decades.",
        "Our approach uses web queries to model an event's typical distribution in the real world.",
        "Learning such rich aspectual properties of events is an important area for computational semantics, and should enrich applications like event coreference (e.g., Chen and Ji, 2009) in much the same way that gender has benefited nominal coreference systems.",
        "Event durations are also key to building event timelines and other deeper temporal understandings of a text (Verhagen et al., 2007; Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009).",
        "The contributions of this work are:",
        "• Demonstrating how to acquire event duration distributions by querying the web with patterns.",
        "• Showing that a system that predicts event durations based only on our web count distributions can outperform a supervised system that requires manually annotated training data.",
        "• Making available an event duration lexicon with duration distributions for common English events.",
        "We first review previous work and describe our reimplementation and augmentation of the latest supervised system for predicting event durations.",
        "Next, we present our approach to learning event distributions based on web counts.",
        "We then evaluate both of these models on an existing annotated corpus of event durations and make comparisons to durations we collected using Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",
        "Finally, we present a generated database of event durations."

      "text": [
        "Early work on extracting event properties focused on linguistic aspect, for example, automatically distinguishing culminated events that have an end point from non-culminated events that do not (Siegel and McKeown, 2000).",
        "The more fine-grained task of predicting the duration of events was first proposed by Pan et al.",
        "(2006), who annotated each event in a small section of the TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) with duration lower and upper bounds.",
        "They then trained support vector machines on their annotated corpus for two prediction tasks: less-than-a-day vs. more-than-a-day, and bins like seconds, minutes, hours, etc.",
        "Their models used features like bags of words, heads of syntactic subjects and objects, and WordNet hypernyms of the events.",
        "This work provides a valuable resource in its annotated corpus and is also a good baseline.",
        "We replicate their work and also add new features as described below.",
        "Our approach to the duration problem is inspired by the standard use of web patterns for the acquisition of relational lexical knowledge.",
        "Hearst (1998) first observed that a phrase like \"...algae, such as Gelidium.",
        ".",
        ". \"",
        "indicates that \"Gelidium\" is a type of \"algae\", and so hypernym-hyponym relations can be identified by querying a text collection with patterns like \"such <noun> as <noun>\" and \"<noun> , including <noun>\".",
        "A wide variety of pattern-based work followed, including the application of the idea in VerbOcean to acquire aspects and temporal structure such as happens-before, using patterns like \"to <verb> and then <verb>\" (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "More recent work has learned nominal gender and animacy by matching patterns like \"<noun> * himself\" and \"<noun> and her\" to a corpus of Web n-grams (Bergsma, 2005; Ji and Lin, 2009).",
        "Phrases like \"John Joseph\", which were observed often with masculine pronouns and never with feminine or neuter pronouns, can thus have their gender identified as masculine.",
        "Ji and Lin found that such web-counts can predict person names as well as a fully supervised named entity recognition system.",
        "Our goal, then, is to integrate these two strands in the literature, applying pattern/web approaches to the task of estimating event durations.",
        "One difference from previous work is the distributional nature of the extracted knowledge.",
        "In the time domain, unlike in most previous relation-extraction domains, there is rarely a single correct answer: \"war\" may last months, years or decades, though years is the most likely.",

        "In both our supervised and unsupervised models, we consider two types of event duration predictions: a coarse-grained task in which we only want to know whether the event lasts more or less than a day, and a fine-grained task in which we want to know whether the event lasts seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years.",
        "These two duration prediction tasks were originally suggested by Pan et al.",
        "(2006), based on their annotation of a subset of newspaper articles in the Timebank corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003).",
        "Events were annotated with a minimum and maximum duration like the following:",
        "• 5 minutes - 1 hour: A Brooklyn woman who was watching her clothes dry in a laundromat.",
        "• 1 week - 3 months: Eileen Collins will be named commander of the Space Shuttle mission.",
        "• 3 days - 2 months: President Clinton says he is committed to a possible strike against Iraq... Pan et al.",
        "suggested the coarse-grained binary classification task because they found that the mean event durations from their annotations were distributed bimodally across the corpus, roughly split into short events (less than a day) and long events (more than a day).",
        "The fine-grained classification task provides additional information beyond this simple two way distinction.",
        "For both tasks, we must convert the minimum/maximum duration annotations into single labels.",
        "We follow Pan et al.",
        "(2006) and take the arithmetic mean of the minimum and maximum durations in seconds.",
        "For example, in the first event above, 5 minutes would be converted into 300 seconds, 1 hour would be converted into 3600 seconds, the resulting mean would be 1950 seconds, and therefore this event would be labeled less-than-a-day for the coarse-grained task, and minutes for the fine-grained task.",

        "(2006) system in Section 8.",
        "However, we also implemented additional features.",

        "), and event class (occurrence, aspectual, state, etc.).",
        "We use each of these as a feature in our classifier.",

        "We used a named entity recognizer to add more information about the subjects and objects, labeling them as persons, organizations, locations, or other.",
        "Typed Dependencies: We coded aspects of the subcategorization frame of a predicate, such as transitivity, or the presence of prepositional objects or adverbial modifiers, by adding a binary feature for each typed dependency seen with a verb or noun.",
        "We experimented with including the head of the argument itself, but results were best when only the dependency type was included.",

        "While supervised learning is effective for many NLP tasks, it is sensitive to the amount of available training data.",

        "This motivates our desire to find an approach that does not rely on labeled data, but instead utilizes the large amounts of text available on the Web to search for duration-specific patterns.",
        "This section describes our web-based approach to learning event durations.",
        "Temporal properties of events are often described explicitly in language-specific constructions which can help us infer an event's duration.",

        "• Many spend hours surfing the Internet.",
        "• The answer is coming up in a few minutes.",

        "These examples are very rare in the corpus, but as can be seen, are extremely informative when present.",

        "To predict the duration of an event from the above patterns, we first insert the event into each pattern template and query the web to see how often the filled template occurs.",
        "These counts form a distribution over each of the bins of interest, e.g., in the fine-grained task we have counts for seconds, minutes, hours, etc.",
        "We discard pattern distributions with very low total counts, and normalize the remaining pattern distributions based on the frequency with which the pattern occurs in general.",
        "Finally, we uniformly merge the distributions from all patterns, and use the resulting distribution to select a duration label for the event.",

        "For the coarse-grained task of less than a day vs. more than a day, we collect counts using the two yesterday patterns described above.",

        "This basically says that if an event occurs with yesterday more than 0.2% of the time, we will assume that the event lasts less than a day.",
        "As with the coarse-grained task, our fine-grained approach begins by collecting counts using the three fine-grained patterns discussed above.",
        "Since each fine-grained pattern has both an <event> and a <bucket> slot to be filled, for a single event and a single pattern, we end up making 8 queries to cover each of the 8 buckets: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years and decades.",
        "After these queries, we have a pattern-specific distribution of counts over the various buckets, a coarse measure of the types of durations that might be appropriate to this event.",

        "As can be seen in Figure 1(a), this initial distribution can be skewed in various ways - in this case, years is given far too much mass.",
        "This is because in addition to the single event interpretation of words like \"saying\", there are iterative or habitual interpretations (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Frawley, 1992).",
        "Iterative events occur repeatedly over a period of time, e.g., \"he's been saying for years that... \" The two interpretations are apparent in the raw distributions of smile and run in Figure 2.",
        "The large peak at years for run shows that it is common to say someone \"was running for years.\"",

        "While the problem of distinguishing single events from iterative events is out of the scope of this paper (though an interesting avenue for future research), we can partially address the problem by recognizing that some buckets are simply more frequent in text than others.",
        "For example, Figure 1(b) shows that it is by far more common to see \"for <bucket>\" filled with years than with any other duration unit.",
        "Thus, for each bucket, we divide the counts collected with the event patterns by the counts we get for the pattern without the event.",
        "Essentially, this gives us for each bucket the probability of the event given that bucket.",
        "Figure 1(c) shows that the resulting normalized distribution fits our intution of how long \"saying\" should last much better than the raw counts: seconds and minutes have much more of the mass now.",
        "After normalizing an event's counts for each pattern, we combine the distributions from the three different patterns if their hit counts pass certain confidence thresholds.",
        "The total hit count for each pattern must exceed a minimum threshold tmin = 100 and not exceed a maximum threshold tmax = 100, 000 (both thresholds were optimized on the training data).",
        "The former avoids building distributions from a sparse number of hits, and the latter avoids classifying generic and polysemous events like 'to make' that return a large number of hits.",
        "We found such events to produce generic distributions that do not help in classification.",

        "Despite the fact that we saw little gains in performance when including subjects and objects in our query patterns, the Mechanical Turk evaluation suggests that more information may still be gleaned from the additional context.",
        "Giving Turkers the subject and object improved their label accuracy by 10-20% absolute.",
        "This suggests that finding a way to include subjects and objects in the web queries, for example by using thesauri to generate related queries, is a valuable line of research for future work.",

        "Our system, however, was also only given the event word, but it was able achieve over 70% in accuracy.",
