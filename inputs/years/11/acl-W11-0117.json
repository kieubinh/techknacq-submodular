        "In these projects, the goal is to build a worldwide grid of wordnets by means of interlingual pivots.",
        "While we may assume that the grid is static and stable in its nature, dynamic lexical resources (Calzolari 2008) are possible, provided a variety of language resources are wrapped as Web services and are accessible on a service infrastructure.",
        "For example, a virtually combined lexicon can be evolutionarily realized by opportunistically associating semantically corresponding entries in the relevant lexical resources.",
        "However, existing frameworks for modeling and representing lexical resources are not applicable to this new type of lexical resource in their current configurations.",
        "For example, while the ISO lexical markup framework (LMF) provides useful constructs to represent a range of lexicons, it still concentrates on modeling one lexical resource at a time, and does not provide effective devices to integrate different types of lexical resources into a single combined resource.",
        "This has motivated us to develop a framework for representing cross-lingual/interlingual lexical semantic correspondences that may be recovered through a series of on-demand/on-the-fly invocations of a lexical semantic matching process that underlies combined lexicon access services.",
