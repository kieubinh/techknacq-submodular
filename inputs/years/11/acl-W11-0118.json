        "This account caters for the facts that so-called generics can so easily be quantiied via traditional quantiiers, that GEN is silent in all known languages, and it explains also why it is the bare form which has the highest productivity, and can denote a range of quantiied entities, from existentials to universals.",

        "We will however remark that statements like 29 are reserved a special section in Link (1998), where they are introduced as 'relational plural sentences'.",
        "One of Link's claims is that those sentences warrant four collective/distributive combinations – as opposed to two only in the case where the object is an individual.",
        "So we can say in Sentence 29 that a collective of cats likes a collective of armchairs, or that this collective of cats likes each armchair individually, etc.",
        "This proliferation of interpretations makes uncertainties more likely with regard to who likes what, and to the quantification of the subject and object.",
        "For now, we will simply conclude that, although a simple syntax-based classifier is able to classify certain constructs with high precision, other constructs are beyond its capabilities.",
        "Further, it is difficult to see how improvements can be made to the current classification without venturing outside of the grammatical context.",
        "For instance, it seems practically impossible to improve on the high-precision rule specifying that every singular noun phrase should be classified as one.",
        "Due to space constraints, we will not report any further experiments in this paper.",
        "However, preliminary investigations into the use of lexical similarity to resolve quantification ambiguity can be found in Herbelot (2010)."

        "We have shown in this paper that subject noun phrases that are not explicitly quantified could be represented in an underspecified form.",
        "We have also argued that this formalisation is applicable to all constructs, including so-called generics.",
        "We have introduced a syntax-based classifier for quantification resolution and discussed the limits of an approach relying on compositional information only.",
        "We acknowledge that our quantificational account of noun phrases, and especially of generics, does not satisfy the common requirement that a formalisation be a full description of the semantic particularities of a linguistic phenomenon.",
        "We think, however, that this requirement has led to over-restrictive approaches.",
        "One of the debates surrounding generics, for instance, relates to whether they should be given a 'rules and regulations' or an inductivist truth condition (Carlson, 1995).",
        "Our view is that it would be a mistake to exclude either interpretation.",
        "Burton-Roberts' (1977) A gentleman opens doors for ladies clearly has normative force and without doubt, also allows the hearer to make their own conclusions with regard to the intersection between the set of all gentlemen and the set of people opening doors for ladies.",
        "Our view of semantics is that it is a layered system and that specifying the quantification semantics of a noun phrase does not mean providing the full semantics of that noun phrase.",
        "It may be argued that the ideal semantics of generics should be unified and integrate all possible aspects of meaning.",
        "But such a theory is yet to be developed for genericity and, from a computational point of view, may not even be desirable: a modular representation of meaning allows us to only formalise the aspects that we are interested in for a particular task, leaving the rest out.",
        "The approach presented here can be said to implement the idea of 'slacker' semantics (Copestake, 2009) in that a) our experiments try to derive a specification from compositional information only and b) we only attempt to specify one aspect of the meaning of noun phrases (quantification), leaving other aspects unspecified.",
        "In the future, we would like to take away some of the slack in a) by using lexical semantics in the specification of quantification.",
        "In order to do this, a much larger corpus should be created for the training and testing of the system, and this will be our next task."
