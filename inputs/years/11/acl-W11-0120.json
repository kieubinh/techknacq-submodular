        "Traditionally, a large body of research in natural language processing has focused on formalizing word meanings.",
        "Several resources developed to date (e.g., WordNet (Miller, 1995)) have enabled a systematic encoding of the semantics of words and exemplify their usage in different linguistic frameworks.",
        "As a result of this formalization, computing semantic relatedness between words has been possible and has been used in applications such as information extraction and retrieval, query reformulation, word sense disambiguation, plagiarism detection and textual entailment.",
        "In contrast, while research has shown that the human cognitive system is sensitive to visual information and incorporating a dual linguistic-and-pictorial representation of information can actually enhance knowledge acquisition (Potter and Faulconer, 1975), the meaning of an image in isolation is not well-defined and it is mostly task-specific.",
        "A given image, for instance, may be simultaneously labeled by a set of words using an automatic image annotation algorithm, or classified under a different set of semantic tags in the image classification task, or simply draw its meaning from a few representative regions following image segmentation performed in an object localization framework.",
        "Given that word meanings can be acquired and disambiguated using dictionaries, we can perhaps express the meaning of an image in terms of the words that can be suitably used to describe it.",
        "Specifically, we are interested to bridge the semantic gap (Smeulders et al., 2000) between words and images by exploring ways to harvest the information extracted from visual data in a general framework.",
        "While a large body of work has focused on measuring the semantic similarity of words (e.g., (Miller and Charles, 1998)), or the similarity between images based on image content (e.g., (Goldberger et al., 2003)), very few researchers have considered the measure of semantic relatedness between words and images.",
        "But, how exactly is an image related to a given word?",
        "In reality, quantification of such a cross-modal semantic relation is impossible without supplying it with a proper definition.",
        "Our work seeks to address this challenge by constructing a standard evaluation framework to derive a semantic relatedness metric for arbitrary pairs of words and images.",
        "In our work, we explore methods to build a representation model consisting of a joint semantic space of images and words by combining techniques widely adopted in computer vision and natural language processing, and we evaluate the hypothesis that we can automatically derive a semantic relatedness score using this joint semantic space.",
        "Importantly, we acknowledge that it is significantly harder to decode the semantics of an image, as its interpretation relies on a subjective and perceptual understanding of its visual components (Biederman,",
        "'In our paper, we are concerned with semantic relatedness, which is a more general concept than semantic similarity.",

        "1987).",
        "Despite this challenge, we believe this is a worthy research direction, as many important problems can benefit from the association of image content in relation to word meanings, such as automatic image annotation, image retrieval and classification (e.g., (Leong et al., 2010)) as well as tasks in the domains of of text-to-image synthesis, image harvesting and augmentative and alternative communication."

        "By projecting data points from all the images into a common space and grouping them into a large number of clusters such that similar data points are assigned to the same cluster, we can treat each cluster as a \"visual codeword\" and express every image in the collection as a \"bag of visual codewords\".",
        "This representation enables the application of methods used in text retrieval to tasks in image processing and computer vision.",
        "Typically, the type of visual features selected can be global - suitable for representation in all images, or local - specific to a given image type and task requirement.",
        "Global features are often described using a continuous feature space, such as color histogram in three different color spaces (RGB, HSV and LAB), or textures using Gabor and Haar wavelets (Makadia et al., 2008).",
        "In comparison, local features such as key points (Fei-Fei and Perona, 2005) are often distinct across different objects or scenes.",

        "Several variants have been proposed, including the original vector space model (Salton et al., 1997) and the Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Generally, vector models are attractive because they can be constructed using unsupervised methods of distributional corpus analysis and assume little language-specific requirements as long as texts can be reliably tokenized.",
        "Furthermore, various studies (Kanerva, 1998) have shown that by using collaborative, distributive memory units to represent semantic vectors, a closer correspondence to human cognition can be achieved.",
        "While vector-space models typically require nontrivial algebraic machinery, reducing dimensions is often key to uncover the hidden (latent) features of the terms distribution in the corpus, and to circumvent the sparseness issue.",

        "The assumptions below are necessary to validate our findings:",
        "1.",
        "Computing semantic relatedness between a word and an image involves comparing the concepts invoked by the word and the salient objects in the image as well as their interaction.",
        "This goes beyond simply identifying the presence or absence of specific objects indicated by a given word.",
        "For instance, we expect a degree of relatedness between an image showing a soccer ball and the word \"jersey,\" since both invoke concepts like {sports, soccer, teamwork} and so on.",
        "2.",
        "The semantics of an image is dependent on the focus, size and position of distinct objects identified through image segmentation.",
        "During labeling, we expect this segmentation to be performed implicitly by the annotators.",
        "Although it is possible to focus one's attention on specific objects via bounding boxes, we are interested to harvest the meaning of an image using a holistic approach.",
        "3.",
        "In the case of measuring the relatedness of a word that has multiple senses with a given image, humans are naturally inclined to choose the sense that provides the highest relatedness inside the pair.",
        "For example, an image of a river bank expectedly calls upon the \"river bank\" sense of the word \"bank\" (and not \"financial bank\" or other alternative word senses).",
        "4.",
        "A degree of semantic relatedness can exist between any arbitrary word and image, on a scale ranging from being totally unrelated to perfectly synonymous with each other.",
        "This is trivially true, as the same property holds when measuring similarity between words and texts.",
        "Next, we evaluate our hypothesis that we can measure the relatedness between a word and an image empirically, using a parallel corpus of words and images as our dataset.",
        "We use the ImageNet database (Deng et al., 2009), which is a large-scale ontology of images developed for advancing content-based image search algorithms, and serving as a benchmarking standard for various image processing and computer vision tasks.",
        "ImageNet exploits the hierarchical structure of WordNet by attaching relevant images to each synonym set (known as \"synset\"), hence providing pictorial illustrations of the concept associated with the synset.",

        "Compared to other image databases with keyword annotations, we believe that ImageNet is suitable for evaluating our hypothesis for three reasons.",
        "First, by leveraging on reliable keyword annotations in WordNet (i.e., words in the synset and their gloss naturally serve as annotations for the corresponding images), we can effectively circumvent the propagation of errors caused by unreliable annotations, and consequently hope to reach more conclusive results for this study.",
        "Second, unlike other image databases,",
        "ImageNet consists of millions of images, and it is a growing resource with more images added on a regular basis.",

        "Finally, third, although we can search for relevant images using keywords in ImageNet,there is currently no method to query it in the reverse direction.",
        "Given a test image, we must search through millions of images in the database to find the most similar image and its corresponding synset.",

        "Conversely, the relatively simple weighting scheme using tf (normalized) produces the highest correlation in six visual codeword sizes (K=200,300,400,700,800,900) for the image-centered scenario, as well as in another six visual codeword sizes (K=200,300,400,600,700,900) for the arbitrary-image scenario.",
        "Unlike stopwords in text retrieval accounting for most of the highest tfscores, visual codewords weighted by the same scheme tf and a similar tf (normalized) scheme seem to be the most discriminative.",
        "The correlation for including the entire visual vocabulary set (1000) produces identical results for all vector-based and LSA weighting schemes, as images across synsets are now encoded by the same set of visual codewords without discrimination between them.",
        "Dimensionality reduction using SVD gains an advantage over the vector-based method for both scenarios, with the highest correlation rating in LSA (200 visual codeword, tf(norm)) achieving 0.077 points better than the corresponding highest correlation in Vector-based (100 visual codeword, tf*itf) for the image-centered scenario, representing a 29.3% improvement.",
        "Similarly, in the arbitrary-image scenario, the increase in correlation from 0.287 (VB tf*itf at 100 visual codeword) to 0.353 (LSA tf(norm) at 200 visual codeword) underlines a gain of approximately 23.0%.",
        "Overall, the arbitrary-image scenario also scores consistently higher than the image-centered scenario under similar experimental conditions.",
        "For instance, for the top 200 visual words, the same weighting schemes produce consistently lower correlation figures for the image-centered scenario.",
        "This is also true for the Inter-Human-Agreement score, which is higher in the arbitrary-image scenario (0.764) compared to the image-centered scenario (0.687).",
        "Note that for all the experiments, the semantic relatedness scores generated from the semantic vector space are significantly more correlated with the human gold-standard than the random baselines.",

        "To investigate the effectiveness of the model when scaling up to large datasets, we employ the best combination of weighting scheme and vocabulary size shown in Table 2, i.e., a visual vocabulary size of 200 and tf (normalized) weighting for LSA, and vocabulary size of 100 and tf*itf weighting for the vector-based model, and incrementally construct models ranging from 167 synsets to 800 synsets (all randomly selected from ImageNet).",
        "We then measure the correlation of relatedness scores generated using the same test dataset with respect to human annotations.",
        "The dataset was randomly selected to increase by approximately five times, from a total of 230,864 images with 878 words to a total of 1,014,528 images with 3887 words.",
        "Furthermore, for each unseen test image taken from Synset Si and the associated 12 candidate words, we evaluate the ability of the model to identify which of the candidate words actually appear in the gloss or the synset of Si, in a task we term as word classification.",
        "Here, the top six words are predictably classified as those appearing in Si while the last six are classified as outside of Si , after all 12 words are ranked in reverse order of their relatedness to the test image.",
        "We measure the accuracy of the word classification task using tp^qan , where tp is the number of words correctly classified as synset or gloss words, and tn is the number of words correctly classified as outside of synset or gloss, both summed over the 2004 pairs of words and images.",
        "As shown in Figure 3, when a small number of synsets (33) was added to the original semantic space, correlation with human ratings increased steeply to around 0.45 and higher for LSA in both scenarios, while the vector-based method suffers a slight decrease in correlation ratings from 0.262 to 0.251 (image-centered) and from 0.287 to 0.278 (arbitrary-image).",
        "As more images and words are added, correlation for the vector-based model continues to decrease markedly.",
        "Comparatively, LSA is less sensitive to data scaling, as correlation figures for both scenarios decreases slightly but stays within a 0.40 to 0.45 range.",
        "Additionally, we infer that LSA is consistently more effective than the vector-based model in the words classification task (as also seen in Figure 3).",
        "Even with more data added to the semantic space, word classification accuracy stays consistently at 0.7 for LSA, while it drops to 0.535 for the vector-based model at a synset size of 800."
