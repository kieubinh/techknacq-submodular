        "Oil can not be delivered to Ukraine.",
        "But doing this requires fairly complex inference, because the words \"block\", \"enter\", \"can\", \"not\" and \"deliver\" carve up the world in different ways.",
        "Our approach is to define words such as these by means of axioms that link with underlying core theories explicating such very basic concepts as change of state and causality.",
        "Given the logical form of sentences like these two, we apply these axioms to express the meaning of the sentences in more fundamental predicates, and do a certain amount of defeasible reasoning in the core theories to determine that the second follows from the first.",
        "More generally, we are engaged in an enterprise we call \"deep lexical semantics\" (Hobbs, 2008), in which we develop various core theories of fundamental commonsense phenomena and define English word senses by means of axioms using predicates explicated in these theories.",
        "Among the core theories are cognition, microsociology, and the structure of events.",
        "The last of these is the focus of this paper.",
        "We use textual entailment pairs like the above to test out subsets of related axioms.",
        "This process enforces a uniformity in the way axioms are constructed, and also exposes missing inferences in the core theories.",
        "The latter is a major issue in this paper.",
        "In Section 2 we describe three aspects of the framework we are working in – the logical form we use, abductive interpretation and defeasibility, and the core theories of change of state and causality.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the methodology we use for constructing axioms, deriving from WordNet senses a smaller set of abstract, general \"supersenses\", encoding axioms for these, and testing them on textual entailment pairs.",

        "We use a logical notation in which states and events (eventualities) are reified.",
        "Specifically, if the expression (p x) says that p is true of x, then (p' ex) says that e is the eventuality of p being true of x. Eventuality e may exist in the real world (Rexist), in which case (p x) holds, or it may only exist in some modal context, in which case that is expressed simply as another property of the possible individual e. (In this paper we use a subset of Common Logic for the syntax of our notation.)",
        "The logical form of a sentence is a flat conjunction of existentially quantified postive literals, with about one literal per morpheme.",
        "(For example, logical words like \"not\" and \"or\" are treated as expressing predications about possible eventualities.)",
        "We have developed software to translate Penn TreeBank-style trees (as well as other syntactic formalisms) into this notation.",
        "The underlying core theories are expressed as axioms in this notation (Hobbs, 1985).",
        "The interpretation of a text is taken to be the lowest-cost abductive proof of the logical form of the text, given the knowledge base.",
        "That is, to interpret a text we prove the logical form, allowing for assumptions at cost, and pick the lowest-cost proof.",
        "Factors involved in computing costs include, besides the number of assumptions, the salience of axioms, the plausibility of axioms expressing defeasible knowledge, and consiliance or the degree to which the pervasive implicit redundancy of natural language texts is exploited.",
        "We have demonstrated that many interpretation problems are solved as a by-product of finding the lowest-cost proof.",
        "This method has been implemented in an abductive theorem-prover called Mini-Tacitus that has been used in a number of applications (Hobbs et al., 1993; Mulkar et al., 2007), and is used in the textual entailment problems described here.",
        "We are also working toward a probabilistic semantics for the cost of proofs (Blythe et al., 2011).",
        "Abductive interpretation accounts for script-like understanding of text – a script predicate provides the most economical interpretation (Hobbs et al., 1993) – but also enables interpretation of novel texts.",
        "Most commonsense knowledge is defeasible, i.e., it can be defeated.",
        "This is represented in our framework by having a unique \"et cetera\" proposition in the antecedent of Horn clauses that cannot be proved but can be assumed at a cost corresponding to the likeliehood that the conclusion is true.",
        "For example, the axiom would say that if x is a bird and other unspecified conditions hold, (etc-i), then x flies.",
        "No other axioms enable proving (etc-i x) , but it can be assumed, and hence participate in the lowest cost proof.",
        "The index i is unique to this axiom.",
        "In this paper rather than invent new indices for each axiom, we will use the abbreviation (etc) to indicate the defeasibility of the rule.",
        "(This approach to defeasibility is similar to circumscription (McCarthy, 1980).)",
        "We have articulated a number of core theories.",
        "The two most relevant to this paper are the theory of change of state and the theory of causality.",
        "The predication (change' eel e2) says that e is a change of state whose initial state is eland whose final state is e2.",
        "The chief properties of change are that there is some entity whose state is undergoing change, that change is defeasibly transitive, that eland e2 cannot be the same unless there has been an intermediate state that is different, and that change is consistent with the before relation from our core theory of time.",
        "Since many lexical items focus only on the initial or the final state of a change, we introduce for convenience the predications (changeFrom' e el) and (changeTo' e e2), defined in terms of change.",
        "The chief distinction in our core theory of causality is between the notions of causalComplex and cause .",
        "A causal complex includes all the states and events that have to happen or hold in order for the effect to happen.",
        "A cause is that contextually relevant element of the causal complex that is somehow central to the effect, whether because it is an action the agent performs, because it is not normally true, or for some other reason.",
        "Most of our knowledge about causality is expressed in terms of the predicate cause , rather than in terms of causal complexes, because we rarely if ever know the complete causal complex.",
        "Typically planning, explanation, and the interpretation of texts (though not diagnosis) involves reasoning about cause.",
        "Among the principal properties of cause are that it is defeasibly transitive, that events defeasibly have causes, and that cause is consistent with before.",
        "We also have a core theory of time, and the times of states and events can be represented as temporal properties of the reified eventualities.",
        "The theory of time has an essential function in axioms for words explicitly referencing time, such as \"schedule\" and \"delay\".",
        "But for most ofthe words we are explicating in this effort, we base our approach to the dynamic aspects of the world on the cognitively more basic theory of change of state.",
        "For example, the word \"enter\" is axiomatized as a change of state from being outside to being inside, and the fact that being outside comes before being inside follows from the axiom relating the predicates change and before.",
        "We find that reifying states and events as eventualities and treating them as first-class individuals is preferable to employing the event calculus (Gruninger and Menzel, 2010; Mueller, 2006) which makes a sharp distinction between the two, because language makes no distinction in where they can appear and we can give them a uniform treatment."

        "For each word, we analyze the structure of its WordNet senses.",
        "Typically, there will be pairs that differ only in, for example, constraints on their arguments or in that one is inchoative and the other causative.",
        "This analysis generally leads to a radial structure indicating how one sense leads by increments, logically and perhaps chronologically, to another word sense (Lakoff, 1987).",
        "The analysis also leads us to posit \"supersenses\" that cover two or more WordNet senses.",
        "(Frequently, these supersenses correspond to senses in FrameNet (Baker et al., 2003) or VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2006), which tend to be coarser grained; sometimes the desired senses are in WordNet itself.)",

        "We are currently only constructing axioms for the most general or abstract senses or supersenses.",
        "In this way, although we are missing some of the implications of the more specialized senses, we are capturing the most basic topological structure in the meanings of the words.",
        "Moreover, the specialized senses usually tap into some specialized domain that needs to be axiomatized before the axioms for these senses can be written.",
        "In constructing the axioms in the event domain, we are very much informed by the long tradition of work on lexical decomposition in linguistics (e.g., Gruber, 1965; Jackendoff, 1972).",
        "Our work differs from this in that our decompositions are done as logical inferences and not as tree transformations as in the earliest linguistic work, they are not obligatory but only inferences that may or may not be part of the lowest-cost abductive proof, and the \"primitives\" into which we decompose the words are explicated in theories that enable reasoning about the concepts.",
        "Figure 1 shows the radial structure of the senses for the word \"enter\", together with the axioms that characterize each sense.",
        "A link between two word senses means an incremental change in the axiom for one gives the axiom for the other.",
        "For example, the axiom for enter-S2 says that if xl enters x2 in x3, then xl causes a change to the eventuality il in which x2 is in x3; and the expanded axiom for enter-Sl.l states that if xl enters x2, then there is a change to a state el in which xl is in x2.",
        "So enter-S2 and enter-Sl.l are closely related and thus linked together.",
        "Abstraction is a special incremental change where one sense S1.1 specializes another sense S1 either by adding more predicates to or specializing some of the predicates in S1's axiom.",
        "We represent abstractions via arrows pointing from the subsenses to the supersenses.",
        "In Figure 1, enter-Sl.l and enter-Sl.2 both specialize enter-Sl.",
        "The predicate enter-Sl.l adds an extra predicate describing el as an in eventuality and enter-Sl.2 specializes el to membership in x2, where x2 is a group.",
        "The supersenses capture the basic topology of the senses they subsume.",
        "The extra information that the subsenses convey are typically the types and properties of the arguments, such as being a place or a process, or qualities of the causing event, such as being sudden or forceful.",
        "For each set of inferentially related words we construct textual entailment pairs, where the hypothesis (H) intuitively follows from text (T), and use these for testing and evaluation.",
        "The person writing the axioms does not know what the pairs are, and the person constructing the pairs does not know what the axioms look like.",
        "The ideal test then is whether given a knowledge base K consisting of all the axioms, H cannot be proven from K alone, but H can be proven from the union of K and the best intepretation of T. This is often too stringent a condition, since H may contain irrelevant material that doesn't follow from T, so an alternative is to determine whether the lowest cost abductive proof of H given K plus T is substantially lower than the lowest cost abductive proof of H given K alone, where \"substantially lower\" is defined by a threshold that can be trained (Ovchinnikova et al., 2011)."

        "(In this example, for expositional simplicity, we have allowed the eventuality cl ofblocking be the same as the eventuality ofcausing, where properly they should be closely related butnotidentical.)",
