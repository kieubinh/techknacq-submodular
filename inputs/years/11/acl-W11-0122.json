        "Lexical semantic resources often used as sense inventories are a prerequisite in automatic processing of human language.",
        "In the last few years, there has been a rise in research aligning different resources to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and coverage problems pertinent to any single resource.",
        "In this paper, we address the task of aligning WordNet noun synsets and Wikipedia articles to obtain a sense inventory of higher coverage and quality.",
        "WordNet, a lexical database for English, is extensively used in the NLP community and is a de-facto standard resource in many NLP tasks, especially in current WSD research (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "WordNet's manually defined comprehensive taxonomy motivates many researchers to utilize it.",
        "However, as WordNet is maintained by only a small group of experts, it is hard to cope with neologisms, named entities, or rare usages on a large scale (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006; Meyer and Gurevych, 2010).",
        "In order to compensate for WordNet's lack of coverage, Wikipedia has turned out to be a valuable resource in the NLP community.",
        "Wikipedia has the advantage of being constantly updated by thousands of voluntary contributors.",
        "It is multilingual and freely available containing a tremendous amount of encyclopedic knowledge enriched with hyperlink information.",
        "In the past, researchers have explored the alignment of Wikipedia categories and WordNet synsets (e.g., Toral et al.",
        "(2008); Ponzetto and Navigli (2009)).",
        "However, using the categories instead of the articles causes three limitations: First, the number of Wikipedia categories (about 0.5 million in the English edition) is much smaller compared to the number of articles (about 3.35 million).",
        "Secondly, the category system in Wikipedia is not structured consistently (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009).",
        "And finally, disregarding the article level neglects the huge amount of textual content provided by the articles.",
        "Therefore, attempts to align WordNet synsets and Wikipedia articles (instead of categories) have been recently made.",
        "This has three major benefits.",
        "First of all, as WordNet and Wikipedia were found to be partly complementary on the word sense level, an aligned resource would increase the coverage of senses (Wolf and Gurevych, 2010).",
        "Second, word senses contained in both resources can then be represented by relational information from WordNet and encyclopedic information from Wikipedia in a multilingual manner yielding an enriched knowledge representation.",
        "And finally, the third major benefit of the alignment is the ability to automatically acquire sense-tagged corpora in a mono-and multilingual fashion.",
        "For each WordNet synset, the text of the aligned Wikipedia article (or all sentences or paragraphs in Wikipedia that contain a link to the article) can be automatically extracted similar to the approach proposed by Mihalcea (2007).",
        "Automatically generated sense-tagged corpora can be used to, e.g., counter the bottleneck of supervised WSD methods that rely on such sense-tagged text collections, which are rare.",
        "Further, due to the cross-lingual links in Wikipedia, also corpora in different languages can be constructed easily.",
        "Our contribution to this paper is two-fold.",
        "First, we propose a novel two-step approach to align WordNet synsets and Wikipedia articles.",
        "We model the task as a word sense disambiguation problem applying the Personalized PageRank algorithm proposed by Agirre and Soroa (2009) as it is state-of-the-art in WSD and combine it with a word overlap measure, which increases the overall performance.",
        "Second, we generate and introduce a well-balanced reference dataset for evaluation consisting of 1,815 manually annotated sense alignment candidates.",
        "WordNet synsets and their corresponding Wikipedia article candidates are sampled along their distinctive properties such as synset size, domain, or the location in the WordNet taxonomy.",
        "An evaluation on this dataset let us generalize the performance to a full alignment between WordNet and Wikipedia, which is publicly available for further research activities."

        "One of the first attempts proposed a new resource YAGO integrating WordNet and Wikipedia consisting of more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "The set of entities contains all WordNet synsets and Wikipedia articles with titles that are not represented as terms in WordNet.",
        "Thus, they ignore ambiguous entities, e.g., the British rock band Queen is not covered as the term queen is already contained in WordNet.",

        "Recently, Ponzetto and Navigli (2010) presented a method based on a conditional probability p(s\\w) of selecting the WordNet sense s given the Wikipedia article w, whereas the conditional probability relies on a normalized word overlap measure of the textual sense representation.",
        "Both approaches, however, have the following two major drawbacks: first, the algorithms are modeled such that they always assume a counterpart in WordNet for a given Wikipedia article, which does not hold for the English Wikipedia (see Section 4).",
        "Second, the algorithms always assign the most likely WordNet synset to a Wikipedia article, not allowing multiple alignments.",
        "However, due to the different sense granularities in WordNet and Wikipedia, some Wikipedia articles might be assigned to more than one WordNet synset.",
        "Based on these observations, there is a need for a better approach yielding none, one, or more than one alignment for a given synset or article.",
        "We will describe a novel idea to tackle this in the next section."

        "Automatic sense alignment aims to match senses of different resources that have the same meaning.",
        "In general, one sense is given and the task is to find a correspondent within another resource, in case one exists.",
        "Thereby, automatic sense alignment meets two subgoals.",
        "At first, all potential alignment candidate senses for a given sense have to be extracted.",
        "Secondly, these extracted candidates have to be scored to select the sense(s) that match in meaning.",
        "For example, given the WordNet synset wn =<schooner: sailing vessel used informer times> and the two Wikipedia alignment candidate articles wp1 =<Schooner: A schooner is a type of sailing vessel ...> and wp2 =<Schooner (glass): A schooner is a type of glass used for ...> ; the article wp1 should be aligned with the synset wn, while the second should not be aligned.",
        "The recall of the extraction step can highly influence the performance of the whole alignment process.",
        "If a sense is not extracted in the first step, it cannot be selected in the alignment step either.",
        "In Section 3.1, we state how we extract Wikipedia alignment candidate articles for a given synset.",
        "In the subsequent Section 3.2, we describe how we determine the article that is aligned to the synset (if any at all).",
        "As almost all Wikipedia articles refer to nouns, we focus on this part-of-speech.",
        "In order to extract Wikipedia articles for a given WordNet synset, we follow the procedure introduced by Wolf and Gurevych (2010).",
        "We shortly summarize this method here: Let wn be a WordNet synset with a set of synonyms {s1, • • • ,sn} of size n. For each synonym s € wn, we extract all Wikipedia articles wp € WPwn that match one of the following constraints:",
        "a) the article title matches s, e.g., the article Window is retrieved for the synonym term Window, b) the article title is of the form s-(description tag), e.g., Window-(computing),",
        "c) the article has a redirect that matches s or is of the form s-(description tag), e.g., Chaff-(counter-measure) has a redirect Window fcodename) and, thus, is retrieved for the synonym term Window,",
        "d) the article is linked in a hyperlink, in which the link anchor text matches s, e.g., the article Bandwagon effect is retrieved for the term bandwagon, as there exist a hyperlink of the form [[Bandwagon effect\\bandwagon]].",
        "Only hyperlinks that occur in at least 3 different articles are taken into account in order to reduce noise.",
        "Given the set of Wikipedia candidates WPwn extracted for synset wn, we have to classify each Wikipedia article wp € WPwn as being a valid alignment or not with respect to wn.",
        "Therefore, we first calculate similarities between synset-article pairs of a given training set.",
        "In a second step, we learn a threshold corresponding to the minimum similarity a sense pair should have to be aligned.",
        "This threshold is then used to fully align WordNet and Wikipedia.",
        "Sense similarity.",
        "The basis of our new approach for sense alignment is the PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998) relying on a lexical-semantic knowledge base, which is modeled as a graph G = (V, E).",
        "As knowledge base we use WordNet 3.0 extended with manually disambiguated glosses from the \"Princeton Annotated Gloss Corpus\".",
        "The vertices v € V represent the synsets; the edges (undirected and unweighted) represent semantic relations between synsets, such as hyponym and hypernym relations.",
        "The PageRank algorithm ranks the vertices in a graph according to their importance within the set.",
        "Let M be a (n x n) transition probability matrix, where Mji = outdegree., if there exist a link from vertex i to vertex j.",
        "Then, the PageRank vector pr over the graph G is equivalent to resolve:",
        "whereas c is a damping factor between 0 and 1, and v is an n-dimensional vector whose elements are n. An element of the PageRank vector denotes the probability for the corresponding vertex that a jumper, randomly following the edges in the graph, ends at that vertex, i.e. the importance of that vertex.",
        "Now, vector v can be personalized by assigning stronger initial probabilities to certain vertices in the graph.",
        "This personalized version of the PageRank algorithm (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) is used in our approach in two different ways (see Figure 1):",
        "In the basic version ppr , we represent both, Wikipedia articles and WordNet synsets as bag-of-words (abbreviated as b in the following).",
        "The textual representation is tokenized and lemmatized using the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994); standard stopword removal is applied.",
        "For a given synset-article pair, we calculate two Personalized PageRank vectors.",
        "For each Personalized PageRank vector, we initialize vector v depending on the terms occurring in b:",
        "J – if a synonymous word of synseti in WordNet occurs in b Vi = \\<T else, (2)",
        "where m is the number of synsets with a synonymous word occurring in b.",
        "For example, given the Word-Net synset <payment, defrayal, defrayment: the act of paying money> with its bag-of-words (payment, defrayal, defrayment, act, paying, money), we assign each synset, i.e. vertex in the graph, a weight, for which at least one of its synonymous words occurs in the bag-of-words.",
        "Then, the PageRank vector is a semantic representation over all WordNet synsets for the given bag-of-words.",
        "In the direct version ppr d, the WordNet synset is directly represented in v by assigning a weight of 1 to the corresponding vector element.",

        "In this case, the sense wpi is aligned to the synset wn as it has 4,339 inlinks, about 4,000 more than the article wp2.",

        "We have presented a novel two-step approach to automatically align English Wikipedia articles and WordNet synsets.",
        "We have shown that a threshold-based method models the task properly yielding none, one, or more than one alignment of a Wikipedia article for a given WordNet synset.",
        "This is different to previous sense alignment approaches.",
        "Further, we have shown that it is important to employ semantic relatedness measuring the similarity of textual sense representations.",
        "Our approach to the automatic alignment shows an encouraging performance of 0.78 F1-Measure and 94.5% accuracy based on a comprehensive, well-balanced reference dataset consisting of 1,815 manually annotated sense alignment candidates.",
        "We have created a fully-aligned resource with our best performing setting (ppr + cos , SYN+HYPER, P+T+C, threshold: 0.439 for ppr , 0.048 for cos ), in which two-thirds of all WordNet noun synsets are aligned with one article from the English Wikipedia.",
        "On the one hand, this fact supports our assumption and overall motivation that both resources are partly complementary at the sense level (one-third of all noun synsets are not in Wikipedia).",
        "On the other hand, for the two-thirds of WordNet noun synsets, the alignment yields relational information from WordNet and encyclopedic information from Wikipedia.",
        "We believe that this new resource and the enhanced knowledge therein can boost the performance of various NLP systems that previously had to rely on a single resource only.",
        "We already started research on integrating the aligned resource in WSD and semantic relatedness tasks.",
        "The fully-aligned resource as well as the reference dataset are publicly available at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/ data/sense-alignment for further research activities."
