        "A token-based approach combining the use of local classifiers, which exploit local utterance features, and global classifiers which use the outputs of local classifiers applied to previous and subsequent tokens, is shown to result in excellent dialogue act recognition scores for unsegmented spoken dialogue.",
        "This can be seen as a significant step forward towards the development of fully incremental, on-line methods for computing the meaning of utterances in spoken dialogue."

        "When reading a sentence in a text, a human language understander obviously does not wait trying to understand what he is reading until he has come to the end of the sentence.",
        "Similarly for participants in a spoken conversation.",
        "There is overwhelming psycholinguistic evidence that human understanders construct syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic hypotheses on the fly, while receiving the written or spoken input.",
        "Dialogue phenomena such as backchannelling (providing feedback while someone else is speaking), the completion of a partner utterance, and requests for clarification that overlap the utterance of the main speaker, illustrate this.",
        "Evidence from the analysis of nonverbal behaviour in multimodal dialogue lends further support to the claim that human understanding works incrementally, as input is being received.",
        "Dialogue participants start to perform certain body movements and facial expressions that are perceived and interpreted by others as dialogue acts (such as head nods, smiles, frowns) while another participant is speaking, see e.g. Petukhova and Bunt (2009).",
        "As another kind of evidence, eye-tracking experiments by Tanenhaus et al.",
        "(1995), Sedivy et al.",
        "(1999) and Sedivy (2003) showed that definite descriptions are resolved incrementally when the referent is visually accessible.",
        "Traditional models of language understanding for dialogue systems, by contrast, are pipelined, modular, and operate on complete utterances.",
        "Typically, such a system has an automatic speech recognition module, a language understanding module responsible for syntactic and semantic analysis, an interpretation manager, a dialogue manager, a natural language generation module, and a module for speech synthesis.",
        "The output of each module is the input for another.",
        "The language understanding module typically performs the following tasks: (1) segmentation: identification of relevant segments in the input, such as sentences;(2) lexical analysis: lexical lookup, possibly supported by morphological processing, and by additional resources such as WordNet, VerbNet, or lexical ontologies; (3) parsing: construction of syntactic interpretations; (4) semantic analysis: computation of propositional, referential, or action-related content; and (5) pragmatic analysis: determination of speaker intentions.",
        "Of these tasks, lexical analysis, being concerned with local information at word level, can be done for each word as soon as it has been recognized, and is naturally performed as an incremental part of utterance processing, but syntactic, semantic and pragmatic analysis are traditionally performed on complete utterances.",
        "Tomita's pioneering work in left-to-right syntactic parsing has shown that incremental parsing can be much more efficient and of equal quality as the parsing of complete utterances (Tomita (1986)).",
        "Computational approaches to incremental semantic and pragmatic interpretation have been less successful (see e.g. Haddock (1989); Milward and Cooper (2009)), but work in computational semantics on the design of underspecified representation formalisms has shown that such formalisms, developed originally for the underspecified representation of quantifier scopes, can also be applied in situations where incomplete input information is available (see e.g. Bos (2002); Bunt (2007), Hobbs (1985), Pinkal (1999)) and as such hold a promise for incremental semantic interpretation.",
        "Pragmatic interpretation, in particular the recognition of a speaker's intentions in incoming dialogue utterances, is another major aspect of language understanding for dialogue systems.",
        "Computational modelling of dialogue behaviour in terms of dialogue acts aims to capture speaker intentions in the communicative functions of dialogue acts, and offers an effective integration with semantic content analysis through the information state update approach (Poesio and Traum (1998)).",
        "In this approach, a dialogue act is viewed as having as its main components a communicative function and a semantic content, where the semantic content is the referential, propositional, or action-related information that the dialogue act addresses, and the communicative function defines how an understander's information state is to be updated with that information.",
        "Evaluation of a non-incremental dialogue system and its incremental counterpart reported in Aist et al.",
        "(2007) showed that the latter is faster overall than the former due to the incorporation of pragmatic information in early stages of the understanding process.",
        "Since users formulate utterances incrementally, partial utterances may be available for a substantial amount of time and may be interpreted by the system.",
        "An incremental interpretation strategy may allow the system to respond more quickly, by minimizing the delay between the time the user finishes and the time the utterance is interpreted DeVault and Stone (2003).",
        "This suggests that a dialogue system performance may benefit from reliable partial processing of input.",
        "This paper is concerned with the automatic recognition of dialogue acts based on partially available input and shows that in order to arrive at the best output prediction two different classification strategies are needed: (1) local classification that is based on features observed in dialogue behaviour and that can be extracted from the annotated data; and (2) global classification that takes the locally predicted context into account.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we will outline performed experiments describing the data, tagset, features, algorithms and evaluation metrics that have been used.",
        "Section 3 reports on the experimental results, applying a variety of machine learning techniques and feature selection algorithms, to assess the automatic recognition and classification of dialogue acts using simultaneous incremental segmentation and dialogue act classification.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss strategies in management and correction of the output of local classifies.",
        "Section 5 concludes."

        "(1999)) proposed a method for the incremental understanding of utterances whose boundaries are not known.",
        "The Incremental Sentence Sequence Search (ISSS) algorithm finds plausible boundaries of utterances, called significant utterances (SUs), which can be a full sentence or a subsentential phrase, such as a noun phrase or a verb phrase.",
        "Any phrase that can change the belief state is defined as a SU.",

        "The success scores in terms of F-scores range from 47.7 to 81.7.",
        "It was shown that performing segmentation and classification together results in better segmentation, but affects the dialogue act classification negatively.",
        "The incremental dialogue act recognition system proposed here takes the token-based approach for building classifiers for the recognition (segmentation and classification) of multiple dialogue acts for each input token, and adopts the ISSS idea for information-state updates based on partial input interpretation.",
        "The data selected for the experiments was annotated with the DIT++ tagset Release 4.",
        "The DIT taxonomy distinguishes 10 dimensions, addressing information about: the domain or task (Task), feedback on communicative behaviour of the speaker (Auto-feedback) or other interlocutors (Allo-feedback), managing difficulties in the speaker's contributions (Own-Communication Management) or those of other interlocutors (Partner Communication Management), the speaker's need for time to continue the dialogue (Time Management), establishing and maintaining contact (Contact Management), about who should have the next turn (Turn Management), the way the speaker is planning to structure the dialogue, introducing, changing or closing a topic (Dialogue Structuring), and conditions that trigger dialogue acts by social convention (Social Obligations Management), see Table 1.",
        "For each dimension, at most one communicative function can be assigned, which is either a function that can occur in this dimension alone (a dimension-specific (DS) function) or a function that can occur in any dimension (a general-purpose (GP) function).",
        "Dialogue acts with a DS communicative function are always concerned with a particular type of information, such as a Turn Grabbing act, which is concerned with the allocation of the speaker role, or a Stalling act, which is concerned with the timing of utterance production.",
        "GP functions, by contrast, are not specifically related to any dimension in particular, e.g. one can ask a question about any type of semantic content, provide an answer about any type of content, or request the performance of any type of action (such as Could you please close the door or Could you please repeat that).",
        "These communicative functions include Question, Answer, Request, Offer, Inform, and many other familiar core speech acts.",
        "The tagset used in these studies contains 38 dimension-specific functions and 44 general-purpose functions.",

        "In the recognition experiments we used data from the AMI meeting corpus.",
        "For training we used three annotated AMI meetings that contain 17,335 tokens forming 3,897 functional segments.",
        "The distribution of functional tags across dimensions is given in Table 1.",
        "Features extracted from the data considered here relate to dialogue history: functional tags of the 10 previous turns; timing: token duration and floor-transfer offset computed in milliseconds; prosody: minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation for pitch (F0 in Hz), energy (RMS), voicing (fraction of locally unvoiced frames and number of voice breaks) and speaking rate (number of syllables per second); and lexical information: token occurrence, bi-and trigram of those tokens.",
        "In total, 1,668 features are used for the AMI data.",
        "To be able to identify segment boundaries, we assign to each token its communicative function label and indicate whether a token starts a segment (B), is inside a segment (I), ends a segment (E), is outside a segment (O), or forms a functional segment on its own (BE).",
        "Thus, the class labels consist of a segmentation prefix (IBOE) and a communicative function label, see example in Figure 1.",
        "A wide variety of machine-learning techniques has been used for NLP tasks with various instantiations of feature sets and target class encodings.",
        "For dialogue processing, it is still an open issue which techniques are the most suitable for which task.",
        "We used two different types of classifiers to test their performance on our dialogue data: a probabilistic one and a rule inducer.",
        "As a probabilistic classifier we used Bayes Nets.",
        "This classifier estimates probabilities rather than produce predictions, which is often more useful because this allows us to rank predictions.",
        "Bayes Nets estimate the conditional probability distribution on the values of the class attributes given the values of the other attributes.",
        "As a rule induction algorithm we chose Ripper (Cohen (1995)).",
        "The advantage of a rule inducer is that the regularities discovered in the data are represented as human-readable rules.",
        "The results of all experiments were obtained using 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "As a baseline it is common practice to use the majority class tag, but for our data sets such a baseline is not very useful because of the relatively low frequencies of the tags in some dimensions.",

        "The incremental construction of input interpretation hypotheses is useful in a language understanding system, since it has the effect that the understanding of a relevant input segment is already nearly ready when the last token of the segment is received; when a dialogue act is viewed semantically as a recipe for updating an information state, this means that the specification of the update operation is almost ready at that moment, thus allowing an instantaneous response from the system.",
        "It may even happen that the confidence score of a partially processed input segment is that high, that the system may decide to go forward and update its information state without waiting until the end of the segment, and prepare or produce a response based on that update.",
        "Of course, full incremental understanding of dialogue utterances includes not only the recognition of communicative functions, but also that of semantic content.",
        "However, many dialogue acts have no or only marginal semantic content, such as turn-taking acts, backchannels (m-hm) and other feedback acts (okay), time management acts (Just a moment), apologies and thankings and other social obligation management acts, and in general dialogue acts with a dimension-specific function; for these acts the proposed strategy can work well without semantic content analysis, and will increase the system's interactivity significantly.",
        "Moreover, given that the average length of a functional segment in our data is no more than 4.4 tokens, the semantic content of such a segment tends not to be very complex, and its construction therefore does not seem to require very sophisticated computational semantic methods, applied either in an incremental fashion (see e.g. Aist et al.",
        "(2007) and DeVault and Stone (2003)) or to a complete segment.",
        "Interactivity is however not the sole motivation for incremental interpretation.",
        "The integration of pragmatic information obtained from the dialogue act recognition module, as proposed here, at early processing stage can be beneficially used by the incremental semantic parser (but also syntactic parser module).",
        "For instance, information about the communicative function of the incoming segment at early processing stage can defuse a number of ambiguous interpretations, e.g. used for the resolution of many anaphoric expressions.",
        "A challenge for future work is to integrate the incremental recognition of communicative functions with incremental syntactic and semantic parsing, and to exploit the interaction of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic hypotheses in order to understand incoming dialogue segments incrementally in an optimally efficient manner."
