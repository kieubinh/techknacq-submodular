        "The statements are about figures depicting dots connected to stars.",
        "In the figures, we distinguish between dots and stars that are connected, i.e. such that every dot is connected with at least one star and every star is connected with at least one dot, and dots and stars that are totally connected, i.e. such that every dot is connected to every star.",
        "For instance, in (1), the dots d\\, efe, and ds are connected with the stars s\\, s2, and S3 (on the left) while and cfe are totally connected with s4, S5, and se (on the right).",
        "given these premises, is it true that in the next figure Less than half of the dots are totally connected with exactly three stars?",
        "(do not read below before answering)",
        "I do think that the answer is yes.",
        "The same answer has been given by several friends/colleagues that were asked to judge the example.",
        "In fact, the figure does contain two dots di and ÖL2, which are less than half of all the dots in the figure, and they are both connected with three same stars si, s2, and s3.",
        "Now, is it true in (3) that Few dots are totally connected with few stars?",
        "It is somehow harder to provide an answer to this second question.",
        "At first sight, it seems the sentence is false, or at least 'strange': no English speaker would ever utter that sentence in that context, whatever he wants to describe.",
        "We are ready now to explore the proposals that aimed at formally defining the truth conditions of sentences as the two ones above.",
        "In the literature, most logical approaches to the problem state that the two sentences are both false in contexts (2) and (3).",
        "In (Robaldo, 2009a), drawing from (Sher, 1997), I proposed a new alternative where they are both evaluated as true.",

        "In the Pre-Introduction, it has been asked to judge the truth values of two NL sentences according to their 'Scopeless interpretation', termed in (Robaldo, 2009a) as 'Independent Set (IS) reading'.",

        "An example is Each boy ate two apples, whose preferred reading is a linear reading where Each outscopes Two, i.e. where each boy ate two different apples.",

        "(Kratzer, 2007)",
        "The preferred reading of (4.a) is the one where there are exactly two students and exacly three drug-dealers and each of the students saw each of the drug-dealers.",
        "Note that these are the truth values assigned to (l)-(3) when dots and stars are asked to be totally connected.",
        "(4.b) may be true in case three boys cooperated in the construction of a single chair.",
        "In the preferred reading of (4.c), there are three boys and four girls such that each of the boys invited at least one girl, and each of the girls was invited by at least one boy.",
        "These are the truth values assigned to (1) when dots and stars are asked to be connected, possibly not totally.",
        "Finally, (4.d) allows for any sharing of ten pizzas between twenty children.",
        "In Cumulative readings, the single actions are carried out by atomic individuals only, while in (4.d) it is likely that the pizzas are shared among subgroups of children.",
        "For instance, Three children ate five pizzas is satisfied by the following extension of ate' ('©' is the standard sum operator (Link, 1983)):",
        "In (5), children c\\, c2, and c3 (cut into slices and) share pizzas p\\ and c2 and c3 (cut into slices and) share ps and P4, and c3 also ate pizza ps on his own.",
        "Branching Quantifier readings have been the more controversial (cf. (Beghelli et al., 1997) and (Gierasimczuk and Szymanik, 2009)).",
        "Many authors claim that those readings are always subcases of Cumulative readings, and they often co-occur with certain adverbs (May, 1989), (Schein, 1993).",
        "In fact, in the Pre-Introduction, in order to force such a reading on (l)-(3), it was necessary to add the adverb totally to the verb connected.",
        "Collective and Cumulative readings have been largely studied; see (Scha, 1981), (Link, 1983), (Beck and Sauerland, 2000), and (Ben-Avi and Winter, 2003).",
        "However, the focus here is on Cover readings.",
        "This paper assumes - following (van der Does, 1993), (van der Does and Verkuyl, 1996), (Schwarzschild, 1996), (Kratzer, 2007) - that they are the IS readings, of which the three kinds exemplified in (4.a-c) are merely special cases.",
        "The name \"Cover readings\" comes from the fact that their truth values are traditionally captured in terms of Covers.",
        "A Cover is a mathematical structure defined with respect to one or more sets.",
        "With respect to two sets S*i and S*2, a Cover Gov is formally defined as:",

        "(covi, cov2) € Cov.",
        "Covers may be denoted by 2-order variables called \"Cover variables\".",
        "We may then define a meta-predicate Cover that, taken a Cover variable C and two unary predicates P\\ and P2, asserts that the extension of the former is a Cover of the extensions of the latter:",
        "Thus, it is possible to decouple the quantifications from the predications.",
        "This is done by introducing two relational variables whose extensions include the atomic individuals involved.",
        "Another relational variable that covers them describes how the actions are actually done.",
        "For instance, in (5), in order to evaluate as true the variant of (4.d), we may introduce three variables P\\, P2, and C such that:",
        "The above extensions of Pi, P2, and C satisfy Cover(C, P\\, P2).",
        "Among the Cover approaches mentioned above, an interesting one is (Schwarzschild, 1996).",
        "Schwarzschild discusses numerous NL sentences where the identification of Covers appears to be pragmatically determined, rather than existentially quantified.",
        "In other words, in the formulae the value of the Cover variables ought to be provided by an assignment g. One of the examples mostly discussed in (Schwarzschild, 1996) is:",
        "(8) a.",
        "The cows and the pigs were separated.",
        "The preferred reading of (8.a) is the one where the cows were separated from the pigs.",
        "However, that is actually an implicature that may be rewritten as in (8.b), where the separation is not done by race.",
        "Examples like (8) are used by (Schwarzschild, 1996) in order to argue against the existence of groups and the overgeneration of readings, extensively advocated by (Landman, 2000).",
        "Schwarzschild claims that the NP in (8.a) must correspond to a unary predicate whose extension is the set of individual cows and pigs, while the precise separation is described by a contextually-dependent Cover variable.",
        "Similarly, in (4.c) the Cumulative interpretation is preferred as in real contexts invitations are usually thought as actions among pairs of persons.",
        "But it may be the case that two or more boys collectively invited two or more girls.",
        "On the other hand, in (4.a) the fact that each student saw each drug-dealer seems to be favoured by the low value of the numerals.",
        "If the sentence were Almost all of my students have seen several drug-dealers in front of the school, the preferred reading appears to be Cumulative.",
        "The next section illustrates a final component needed to build whole formulae for representing Cover readings.",
        "This is the requirement of Maximal participancy of the witness sets, e.g. the Maximal partic-ipancy of P\\ and P2 S extension in the formula representing the meaning of the variant of (4.d).",
        "It will be also shown that there are two possible ways to maximize the witness sets: Locally and Globally.",

        "Separately, the elements of these sets are combined as described by the Cover variables, in order to assert the predicates on the correct pairs of (possibly plural) individuals.",
        "Conversely, it is not possible to represent an IS reading by nesting quantifiers into the scope of other quantifiers, as it is done in the standard Generalized Quantifier (GQ) approach (Keenan and Westerstâhl, 1997), because the set of entities quantified by the narrow-scope quantifier would vary on each entity quantified by the wide-scope one.",
        "As argued by (van Benthem, 1986), (Kadmon, 1987), (Sher, 1990), (Sher, 1997), (Spaan, 1996), (Steed-man, 2007), (Robaldo, 2009a), and (Robaldo, 2009b) the relational variables must, however, be Maximized in order to achieve the proper truth values with any quantifier, regardless to its monotonicity.",
        "To see why, let us consider sentences in (9), taken from (Robaldo, 2009a), that involve a single quantifier.",

        "Only (10.a) correctly yields the truth values of the corresponding sentence.",
        "To see why, consider a model in which three men walk.",
        "In such a model, (10.a) is true, while (10.b-c) are false.",
        "Conversely, all formulae in (10) evaluate to true, as all of them allow to choose P such that ||P||M is a set of two walking men.",
        "Therefore, we cannot allow a free choice of P. Instead, P must denote the Maximal set of individuals satisfying the predicates, i.e. the Maximal set of walking men, in (10).",
        "This is achieved by changing (10.b-c) to (1 l.a-b) respectively.",
        "The clauses YP [ ... ] in the second rows are Maximality Conditions asserting the non-existence of a superset P' of P that also satisfies the predication.",
        "There is a single choice for P in (1 l.a-b): it must denote the set of all walking men.",
        "Note that, for the sake of uniformity, the Maximality condition may be added in (lO.a) as well: in case of Mf quantifiers, it does not affect the truth values.",

        "In order to extend (Robaldo, 2009a) to Cover readings, which are assumed to be the most general cases of IS readings, we cannot simply require the inclusion of ||Pi||Mx||P2||M into the main predicate's extension.",
        "Rather, we require the inclusion therein of a pragmatically-determined Cover ||C||M'a of Il Pi IIM and ||P2||M.",
        "Furthermore, the (local) Maximality condition must require the non-existence of a superset of either ||Pi||M or ||P2||M whose corresponding Cover is a superset of ||C||M'a that is also included in the main predicate's extension.",
        "Thus, (4.d) is represented as:",
        "Note that there are two Maximality conditions: Vp/ [ ... ] and Vp/ [...].",
        "In fact, contrary to what is done with Cartesian Products, in Cover readings Pi and P2 must be Maximized independently, as it is no longer required that every member of the former is related with every member of the latter.",
        "Note also that the inner Cover variable C is existentially quantified.",
        "Of course, it would make no sense to pragmatically interpret it as it is done with C.",
        "The other kind of Maximalization of the witness sets, termed here as 'Global Maximalization' has been advocated by (Schein, 1993), and formalized in most formal theories of Cumulativity, e.g. (Landman, 2000), (Hackl, 2000), and (Ben-Avi and Winter, 2003).",
        "With respect to IS readings involving two witness sets 11 Pi ||M and IIP2 ||M, Global Maximalization requires the non-existence of other two witness sets that also satisfy the predication but that do not necessarily include ||Pi||M and ||P2||M.",
        "For instance, the event-based logic defined by (Landman, 2000) represents the Cumulative reading of (4.c) as:",
        "Formula in (14) asserts the existence of a plural event e whose Agent is a plural individual made up of three boys and whose Theme is a plural individual made up of four girls.",

        "No English speaker would ever utter those sentences in those contexts, as they would not be informative enough, and so they would violate a Gricean Maxim.",
        "From the examples above, it seems that sentences involving non-Mj\" quantifiers sound odd in contexts where more pairs of witness sets are available.",
        "For instance, the reader gets confused when he tries to evaluate (19. a) in (20), as multiple pairs of (witness) sets of dots and stars are available, i.e. ({di, d2}, {si,s2}), ({ds, cLJ, {s3, s4}), etc., and he does not have enough information to prefer one of them upon the others.",
        "This does not arises in (3) or (22), where the witness sets are immediatly and uncontroversially identified.",
        "The multiple availability of witness sets does not seem to confuse the reader for sentences involving Mf quantifiers, perhaps because they are simpler to interpret (cf. (Geurts and van der Silk, 2005)).",
        "However, several cognitive experimental results showed that many other factors besides monotonicity, e.g. expressivity/computability, fuzzyness, the fact that quantifiers are cardinal rather than proportional, etc., may affect the accuracy and reaction time of the interpretation of IS readings (cf. (Sanford and Paterson, 1994), (Bott and Radô, 2009), (Musolino, 2009), and (Szymanik and Zajenkowski, 2009)).",
        "As it is clear to understand, however, extralinguistic factors seem the ones that mainly affect the interpretation of quantifiers.",
        "For instance, in (17), if the boys b\\, b2, 63 are friends who decided to go to a party with some girls, and 64 wants to go there with his girlfriend (#5) only, the witness sets are most likely identified for (18.a-b) rather than for (18.c), as the two groups of persons are not related.",
        "Conversely, if the four boys belong to the same group of friends hanging out together, the identification of the witness sets most likely fails in (18.a-b).",
        "That is probably the assumption done by (Ferreira, 2007) and (Brasoveanu, 2009) for claiming that sentences like (18.a-b) are false in contexts like (17).",
        "Analogously, in the children-pizza example in (4.d), the arrangement of the children among the tables of the pizzeria, their mutual friendship, and so on, may affect the identification of the witness sets.",
        "Similar discussions may be found in (Fintel, 1994) and (Winter, 2000).",
        "Of course, an exhaustive study of all factors involved in the pragmatic identification of the witness sets goes much beyond the goal of the present paper.",
        "The aim of this paper is to argue that, once witness sets are identified, Local Maximalization applies to them.",
        "In order to formally obtain this result, a final modification of the formulae is needed: it is necessary to pragmatically interpret the relational variables denoting the witness sets, besides those denoting the Covers.",
        "Formula (13) is then revised as in (23).",
        "The only difference between (23) and (13) is that the value of P\\ and P2 is provided by an assignment g, as it is done for the Cover variable C. g must obey to all (extra-)linguistic pragmatic constraints briefly listed above.",
        "The reader could start thinking that, in the new version of the formulae, we may avoid Maximality conditions, either Local or Global.",
        "In fact, Maximalization could be simply implemented as a constraint on the assignment function g. In other words, we could simply impose g to select only Maximal witness sets.",
        "If g is unable to do so, the intepretation fails as in the cases discussed above.",
        "Such a solution has been actually proposed in (Steedman, 2007) and (Brasoveanu, 2009).",
        "Conversely, in (Robaldo, 2009b) I explained that we do need to explicitly represent the Maximality conditions.",
        "In other words, those are not only seen as necessary conditions needed to determine if a sentence is true or false in a certain context.",
        "Rather, in (Robaldo, 2009b), it is extensively argued that they are part of the knowledge needed to draw the appropriate inferences from the sentences' meaning."

        "The former requires the non-existence of any tuple of supersets of the witness sets that also satisfy the predication.",
        "The latter requires the witness sets to be the only tuple of sets that satisfy the predication.",
        "The present paper argues in favour of Local Maximalization, and claims that the motivations that led to the definition of Global Maximalitation, and its incorporation within most current formal approaches to NL quantification, do not appear to be justified enough.",
        "These claims are supported by showing that, for many NL sentences, Global Maximalization predicts counter-intuitive truth conditions.",
        "Also several examples are hard to reconcile in a logical framework based on Local Maximalization.",
        "It seems, however, that the oddity of such examples depends upon pragmatic grounds.",
        "Based on these assumptions, the solution presented here still adopts Local Maximalization, but advocates a pragmatic interpretation of all relational variables.",
        "Drawing from (Schwarzschild, 1996), the present paper evolves the formulae in (Robaldo, 2009a) and (Robaldo, 2009b), making them able to handle Cover readings, which are assumed to be the more general cases of Independent Set readings.",
        "In the resulting formulae, the witness sets are firstly pragmatically identified, as it is done with Cover variables, then they are locally Maximized.",
        "In other words, Pragmatics is responsible for identifying both the (atomic) individuals involved, and the way they sub-combine to carry out the singular actions.",
        "The result is able to predict the suitable truth values of Cover readings in all examples considered, and seems to mirror the correct interplay between the Semantics and the Pragmatics of NL quantifiers."
