        "Linguistic studies of word meaning generally divide ambiguity into homonymy and polysemy.",
        "Homonymous words exhibit idiosyncratic variation, with essentially unrelated senses, e.g. bank as Financial Institution versus as Natural Object.",
        "In polysemy, meanwhile, sense variation is systematic, i.e., appears for whole sets of words.",
        "E.g., lamb, chicken and salmon have Animal and Food senses.",
        "It is exactly this systematicity that represents a challenge for lexical semantics.",
        "While homonymy is assumed to be encoded in the lexicon for each lemma, there is a substantial body of work on dealing with general polysemy patterns (cf. Nunberg and Zaenen (1992); Copestake and Briscoe (1995); Pustejovsky (1995); Nunberg (1995)).",
        "This work is predominantly theoretical in nature.",
        "Examples of questions addressed are the conditions under which polysemy arises, the representation of polysemy in the semantic lexicon, disambiguation mechanisms in the syntax-semantics interface, and subcategories of polysemy.",
        "The distinction between polysemy and homonymy also has important potential ramifications for computational linguistics, in particular for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",
        "Notably, Ide and Wilks (2006) argue that WSD should focus on modeling homonymous sense distinctions, which are easy to make and provide most benefit.",
        "Another case in point is the one-sense-per-discourse hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992), which claims that within a discourse, instances of a word will strongly tend towards realizing the same sense.",
        "This hypothesis seems to apply primarily to homonyms, as pointed out by Krovetz (1998).",
        "Unfortunately, the distinction between polysemy and homonymy is still very much an unsolved question.",
        "The discussion in the theoretical literature focuses mostly on clear-cut examples and avoids the broader issue.",
        "Work on WSD, and in computational linguistics more generally, almost exclusively builds on the WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) word sense inventory, which lists an unstructured set of senses for each word and does not indicate in which way these senses are semantically related.",
        "Diachronic linguistics proposes etymological criteria; however, these are neither undisputed nor easy to operationalize.",
        "Consequently, there are currently no broad-coverage lexicons that indicate the polysemy status of words, nor even, to our knowledge, precise, automatizable criteria.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to take a first step towards an automatic polysemy classification.",
        "Our approach is based on the aforementioned intuition that meaning variation is systematic in polysemy, but not in homonymy.",
        "This approach is described in Section 2.",
        "We assess systematicity by mapping WordNet senses onto basic types, a set of 39 ontological categories defined by the CoreLex resource (Buitelaar, 1998), and looking at the prevalence of pairs of basic types (such as {Financial Institution, Natural",
        "Object} above) across the lexicon.",
        "We evaluate this model on two tasks.",
        "In Section 3, we apply the measure to the classification of a set of typical polysemy and homonymy lemmas, mostly drawn from the literature.",
        "In Section 4, we apply it to the one-sense-per-discourse hypothesis and show that polysemous words tend to violate this hypothesis more than homonyms.",

        "Our goal is to take the first steps towards an empirical model of polysemy, that is, a computational model which makes predictions for - in principle - arbitrary words on the basis of their semantic behavior.",
        "The basis of our approach mirrors the focus of much linguistic work on polysemy, namely the fact that polysemy is systematic: There is a whole set of words which show the same variation between two (or more) ontological categories, cf. the \"universal grinder\" (Copestake and Briscoe, 1995).",
        "There are different ways of grounding this notion of systematicity empirically.",
        "An obvious choice would be to use a corpus.",
        "However, this would introduce a number of problems.",
        "First, while corpora provide frequency information, the role of frequency with respect to systematicity is unclear: should acceptable but rare senses play a role, or not?",
        "We side with the theoretical literature in assuming that they do.",
        "Another problem with corpora is the actual observation of sense variation.",
        "Few sense-tagged corpora exist, and those that do are typically small.",
        "interpreting context variation in untagged corpora, on the other hand, corresponds to unsupervised WSD, a serious research problem in itself - see, e.g., Navigli (2009).",
        "We therefore decided to adopt a knowledge-based approach that uses the structure of the WordNet ontology to calculate how systematically the senses of a word vary.",
        "The resulting model sets all senses of a word on equal footing.",
        "It is thus vulnerable to shortcomings in the architecture of WordNet, but this danger is alleviated in practice by our use of a \"coarsened\" version of WordNet (see below).",
        "WordNet provides only a flat list of senses for each word.",
        "This list does not indicate the nature of the sense variation among the senses.",
        "However, building on the generative lexicon theory by Pustejovsky (1995), Buitelaar (1998) has developed the \"CoreLex\" resource.",
        "It defines a set of 39 so-called basic types which correspond to coarse-grained ontological categories.",
        "Each basic type is linked to one or more WordNet anchor nodes, which define a complete mapping between WordNet synsets and basic types by dominance.",
        "Table 1 shows the set of basic types and their main anchors; Table 2 shows example lemmas for some basic types.",
        "Ambiguous lemmas are often associated with two or more basic types.",
        "CoreLex therefore further assigns each lemma to what Buitelaar calls a polysemy class, the set of all basic types its synsets belong to; a class with multiple representatives is considered systematic.",
        "These classes subsume both idiosyncratic and systematic patterns, and thus, despite their name, provide no clue about the nature of the ambiguity.",
        "CoreLex makes it possible to represent the meaning of a lemma not through a set of synsets, but instead in terms of a set of basic types.",
        "This constitutes an important step forward.",
        "Our working hypothesis is that these basic types approximate the ontological categories that are used in the literature on polysemy to define polysemy patterns.",
        "That is, we can define a meaning shift to mean that a lemma possesses one sense in one basic type, while another sense belongs to another basic type.",
        "Naturally, this correspondence is not perfect: systematic polysemy did not play a role in the design of the WordNet ontology.",
        "Nevertheless, there is a fairly good approximation that allows us to recover many prominent polysemy patterns.",
        "Table 3 shows three polysemy patterns characterized in terms of basic types.",
        "The first class was already mentioned before.",
        "The second class contains a subset of \"transparent nouns\" which can denote a container or a quantity.",
        "The last class contains words which describe a place or a group of people.",

        "Animal, Food fowl, hare, lobster, octopus, snail, ...",
        "Artifact, Indefinite Quantity bottle, jug, keg, spoon, tub,...",
        "Artifact, Social Group academy, embassy, headquarters, ...",
        "Given the intuitions developed in the previous section, we define a basic ambiguity as a pair of basic types, both of which are associated with a given lemma.",
        "The variation spectrum of a word is then the set of all its basic ambiguities.",
        "For example, bottle would have the variation spectrum {{art qui}} (cf. Table 3); the word course with the three basic types act, art, grs would have the variation spectrum {{act art}; {act grs}; {art grs} }.",
        "There are 39 basic types and thus 39 • 38/2 = 741 possible basic ambiguities.",
        "In practice, only 663 basic ambiguities are attested in WordNet.",
        "We can quantify each basic ambiguity by the number of words that exhibit it.",
        "For the moment, we simply interpret frequency as systematicity.",
        "Thus, we interpret the high-frequency (systematic) basic ambiguities as polysemous, and low-frequency (idiosyncratic) basic ambiguities as homonymous.",
        "Table 4 shows the most frequent basic ambiguities, all of which apply to several hundred lemmas and can safely be interpreted as polysemous.",
        "At the other end, 56 of the 663 basic ambiguities are singletons, i.e. are attested by only a single lemma.",
        "In a second step, we extend this classification from basic ambiguities to lemmas.",
        "The intuition is again fairly straightforward: A word whose basic ambiguities are systematic will be perceived as polysemous, and as homonymous otherwise.",
        "This is clearly an oversimplification, both practically, since we depend on WordNet/CoreLex having made the correct design decisions in defining the ontology and the basic types; as well as conceptually, since not all polysemy patterns will presumably show the same degree of systematicity.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that basic types provide an informative level of abstraction, and that our model is in principle even able to account for conventionalized metaphor, to the extent that the corresponding senses are encoded in WordNet.",

        "Pn = {[Pi], -, [Pn]}, where [P] = {Pj| freq(P) = freq(Pj)} and freq(Pfc) > freq(Pi) for k < l. We call non-polysemous basic ambiguities idiosyncratic.",

        "nN simply measures the ratio of w's basic ambiguities which are polysemous, i.e., high-frequency basic ambiguities.",
        "nN ranges between 0 and 1, and can be interpreted analogously to the intuition that we have developed on the level of basic ambiguities: high values of n (close to 1) mean that the majority of a lemma's basic ambiguities are polysemous, and therefore the lemma is perceived as polysemous.",
        "In contrast, low values of n (close to 0) mean that the lemma's basic ambiguities are predominantly idiosyncratic, and thus the lemma counts as homonymous.",
        "Again, note that we consider basic ambiguities at the type level, and that corpus frequency does not enter into the model.",
        "This model of polysemy relies crucially on the distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic basic ambiguities, and therefore in turn on the parameter N. N corresponds to the sharp cutoff that our model assumes.",
        "At the Nth most frequent basic ambiguity, polysemy turns into homonymy.",
        "Since frequency is our only criterion, we have to lump together all basic ambiguities with the same frequency into 135 bins.",
        "If we set N = 0, none of the bins count as polysemous, so no (w) = 0 for all w - all lemmas are homonymous.",
        "In the other extreme, we can set N to 135, the total number of frequency bins, which makes all basic ambiguities polysemous, and thus all lemmas: 7r13s(w) = 1 for all w. The optimization of N will be discussed in Section 3.",
        "We assign each lemma a polysemy index between 0 and 1.",
        "We thus abandon the dichotomy that is usually made in the literature between two distinct categories of polysemy and homonymy.",
        "Instead, we consider polysemy and homonymy the two end points on a gradient, where words in the middle show elements of both.",
        "This type of behavior can be seen even for prototypical examples of either category, such as the homonym bank, which shows a variation between Social Group and Artifact:",

        "were fairly coarse-grained ones, motivated by translation pairs (e.g., English duty translated as French droit (tax) vs. devoir (obligation)), which correspond mostly to homonymous sense distinctions.",
        "Current WSD, in contrast, uses the much more fine-grained WordNet sense inventory which conflates homonymous and polysemous sense distinctions.",
        "Now, 1spd seems intuitively plausible for homonyms, where the senses describe different entities that are unlikely to occur in the same discourse (or if they do, different words will be used).",
        "However, the situation is different for polysemous words: In a discourse about a party, bottle might felicitously occur both as an object and a measure word.",
        "A study by Krovetz (1998) confirmed this intuition on two sense-tagged corpora, where he found 33% of discourses to break Ispd.",
        "He suggests that knowledge about polysemy classes can be useful as global biases for WSD.",
        "In this section, we analyze the sense-tagged SemCor corpus in terms of the basic type-based framework of polysemy that we have developed in Section 2 both qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate that basic types, and our polysemy index n, help us better understand the 1spd hypothesis.",
        "The first step in our analysis looks specifically at the basic types and basic ambiguities we observe in discourses that break 1spd.",
        "Our study reanalyses SemCor, a subset of the Brown corpus annotated exhaustively with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "SemCor contains a total of 186 discourses, paragraphs of between 645 and 1023 words.",
        "These 186 discourses, in combination with 1088 nouns, give rise to 7520 lemma-discourse pairs, that is, cases where a sense-tagged lemma occurs more than once within a discourse.",
        "These 7520 lemma-discourse pairs form the basis of our analysis.",
        "We started by looking at the relative frequency of Ispd.",
        "We found that the hypothesis holds for 69% of the lemma-discourse pairs, but not for the remaining 31%.",
        "This is a good match with Krovetz' findings, and indicates that there are many discourses where there lemmas are used in different senses.",
        "In accordance with our approach to modeling meaning variation at the level of basic types, we implemented a \"coarsened\" version of 1spd, namely one-basic-type-per-discourse (1btpd).",
        "This hypothesis is parallel to the original, claiming that it is extremely likely that all words in a discourse share the same basic type.",
        "As we have argued before, the basic-type level is a fairly good approximation to the most important ontological categories, while smoothing over some of the most fine-grained (and most troublesome) sense distinctions in WordNet.",
        "In this vein, lbtpd should get rid of \"spurious\" ambiguity, but preserve meaningful ambiguity, be it homonymous or polysemous.",
        "In fact, the basic type with most of these \"within-basic-type\" ambiguities is Psychological Feature, which contains many subtle distinctions such as the following senses of perception:",
        "a. a way of conceiving something b. the process of perceiving c. knowledge gained by perceiving d. becoming aware of something via the senses",
        "Such distinctions are collapsed in 1btpd.",
        "In consequence, we expect a noticeable, but limited, reduction in the cases that break the hypothesis.",
        "Indeed, lbtpd holds for 76% of all lemma-discourse pairs, i.e., for 7% more than Ispd.",
        "For the remainder of this analysis, we will test the lbtpd hypothesis instead of Ispd.",
        "The basic type level also provides a good basis to analyze the lemma-discourse pairs where the hypothesis breaks down.",
        "Table 7 shows the basic ambiguities that break the hypothesis in SemCor most often.",
        "The WordNet frequencies are high throughout, which means that these basic ambiguities are polysemous according to our framework.",
        "It is noticeable that the two basic types Psychological feature and Action participate in almost all of these basic ambiguities.",
        "This observation can be explained straightforwardly through polysemous sense extension as sketched above: Actions are associated, among other things, with attributes, states, and communications, and discussion of an action in a discourse can fairly effortlessly switch to these other basic types.",
        "A very similar situation applies to psychological features, which are also associated with many of the other categories.",
        "In sum, we find that the data bears out our hypothesis: almost all of the most frequent cases of several-basic-types-per-discourse clearly correspond to basic ambiguities that we have classified as polysemous rather than homonymous.",
        "This section complements the qualitative analysis of the previous section with a quantitative analysis which predicts specifically for which lemma-discourse pairs lbtpd breaks down.",
        "To do so, we fit a logit mixed effects model (Breslow and Clayton, 1993) to the SemCor data.",
        "Logit mixed effects models can be seen as a generalization of logistic regression models.",
        "They explain a binary response variable y in terms of a set of fixed effects x, but also include a set of random effects x'.",
        "Fixed effects correspond to \"ordinary\" predictors as in traditional logistic regression, while random effects account for correlations in the data introduced by groups (such as items or subjects) without ascribing these random effects the same causal power as fixed effects - see, e.g., laeger (2008) for details.",
        "The contribution of each factor is modelled by a coefficient ß, and their sum is interpreted as the logit-transformed probability of a positive outcome for the response variable:",
        "Model estimation is usually performed using numeric approximations.",
        "The coefficients ß' of the random effects are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution, centered around 0, which ensures that the majority of random effects are ascribed very small coefficients.",
        "From a linguistic perspective, a desirable property of regression models is that they describe the importance of the different effects.",
        "First of all, each coefficient can be tested for significant difference to zero, which indicates whether the corresponding effect contributes significantly to modeling the data.",
        "Furthermore, the absolute value of each ßi can be interpreted as the log odds - that is, as the (logarifhmized) change in the probability of the response variable being positive depending on Xi being positive.",
        "In our experiment, each datapoint corresponds to one of the 7520 lemma-discourse pair from SemCor (cf.",
        "Section 4.1).",
        "The response variable is binary: whether lbtpd holds for the lemma-discourse pair or not.",
        "We include in the model five predictors which we expect to affect the response variable: three fixed effects and two random ones.",

        "Note that this outcome might result from the limited variation of discourse lengths in SemCor: recall that no discourse contains less than 645 or more than 1023 words.",
        "However, we find a second highly significant negative effect (p < 0.001) in our polysemy index 7T8i.",

        "In this paper, we have approached the problem of distinguishing empirically two different kinds of word sense ambiguity, namely homonymy and polysemy.",

        "We first classify the basic ambiguities (i.e., the pairs of ontological categories) shown by a lemma as either polysemous or homonymous, and then assign the ratio of polysemous basic ambiguities to each word as its polysemy index.",
        "We have evaluated this framework on two tasks.",
        "The first was distinguishing polysemous from homonymous lemmas on the basis of their polysemy index, where it gets 76% of all pairwise rankings correct.",
        "We also used this task to identify an optimal value for the threshold between polysemous and homonymous basic ambiguities.",
        "We located it at around 20% of all basic ambiguities (113 of 663 in the top 81 frequency bins), which apparently corresponds to human intuitions.",
        "The second task was an analysis of the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic, which showed that this hypothesis breaks down frequently in the face of polysemy, and that the polysemy index can be used within a regression model to predict the instances within a discourse where this happens.",

        "Nevertheless, even in the linguistic literature, words are often considered as either polysemous or homonymous.",
        "Our interpretation of this contradiction is that some basic types (or some basic ambiguities) are more prominent than others.",
        "The present study has ignored this level, modeling the polysemy index simply on the ratio of polysemous patterns without any weighting.",
        "In future work, we will investigate human judgments of polysemy vs. homonymy more closely, and assess other correlates of these judgments (e.g., corpus counts).",
