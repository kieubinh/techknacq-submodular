        "WordNet (Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), henceforth WN) is a lexical resource widely used in a host of applications in which language or linguistic concepts play a role.",
        "For instance, it is a central resource for the quantification of semantic relatedness (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), in turn often exploited in applications.",
        "The quality of this resource therefore is very important for NLP as a whole, and beyond, in several AI applications.",
        "Neel and Garzon (2010) show that the quality of a knowledge resource like WN affects the performance in recognizing textual entailment (RLE) and word-sense disambiguation (WSD) tasks.",
        "Lhey observe that the new version of WN induced improvements in recent RLE challenges, but conclude that WN currently is not rich enough to resolve such a task.",
        "What is more, its quality may be too low to even be useful at all.",
        "Bentivogli et al.",
        "(2009) discuss the results of 20 \"ablation tests\" on systems submitted to the main RLE-5 task in which WN (alone) was ablated: 11 of these tests demonstrated that the use of this resource has a positive impact (up to 4%) on the performance of the systems but 9 showed a negative (up to 2% improvement when ablated) or null impact.",
        "In the area of automatic recognition of part-whole relations, Girju and Badulescu (2006) proposed a learning method relying on WN's taxonomy.",
        "Analyzing the classification rules obtained, we could see that WN taxonomical errors lead to absurd rules, which can explain wrong recognition results.",
        "For instance, the authors obtain pairs such as {shape, physical-phenomenon) and {atmospheric-phenomenon, communication) as positive constraints for part-whole recognition, while sentences like a curved shape is part of the electromagnetic radiation or rain is part of this document would make no sense.",
        "Some semantic problems of WN are well-known: confusion between concepts and individuals (in principle solved since WN 2.1), heterogeneous levels of generality, inappropriate use of multiple inheritance, confounding and missing senses, and unclear glosses (Kaplan and Schubert, 2001; Gangemi et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2006).",
        "Nevertheless, the number of applications where WN is used as an ontology has been increasing.",
        "In fact, apart from the synonymy relation on which synsets are defined, the hyponymy/hypernymy relation is WN's semantic relation most exploited in applications; it generates WN's taxonomy, which can be seen as a lightweight ontology, something it was never designed for, though.",
        "Several works tried to address these shortcomings.",
        "Gangemi et al.",
        "(2003) proposed a manual restructuring through the alignment of WN's taxonomy and the foundational ontology DOLCE, but this restructuring just focused on the upper levels of the taxonomy.",

        "it/DOLCE .html",
        "(Guarino, 1998) and the OntoClean methodology (Guarino and Welty, 2004) have also been suggested for manually \"cleaning up\" the whole resource.",
        "This however is extremely demanding, because the philosophical principles involved require a deep analysis of each concept, and as a result, is unlikely to be achieved in a near future.",
        "Clark et al.",
        "(2006) also gave some general suggestions as design criteria for a new WN-like knowledge base and recommended that WN should be cleaned up to make it logically correct, but did not provide any practical method for doing so.",
        "Two other more extensive works rely on manual interventions, either the mapping of each synset in WN to a particular concept in the SUMO ontology (Pease and Fellbaum, 2009), or the tagging of each synset in WN with \"features\" from the Top Concept Ontology (Alvez et al., 2008) to substitute or contrast the original WN taxonomy.",
        "Such approaches are clearly very costly, as each synset needs to be examined.",
        "In addition, the ontological value of these additional resources themselves remains to be proven.",
        "The method used in (Alvez et al., 2008) has though helped pointing out a large number of errors in WN 1.6.",
        "Our purpose in this paper is to show that automatic methods to spot errors, especially in the lower levels of WN's taxonomy, can be developed.",
        "Spotting errors can then efficiently direct the manual correction task.",
        "Such methods could be used to complement a manual top-level restructuring and could be seen as an alternative to fully manual approaches, which are very demanding and in principle require validation between experts.",
        "Here, we explore methods based on internal coherence checks within WN, or on checking the coherence between WN and annotated corpora such as those of Semeval-2007 Task 4 (Girju et al., 2007).",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the data used and the methodology; Section 3 discusses the results; Section 4 concludes, exploring how the method could be extended and applied."

      "text": [
        "To spot errors in WN, our basic idea is to contrast two sources of knowledge and automatically check their coherence.",
        "Here, we contrast part-whole data with WN taxonomy structure, on the basis of constraints stemming from the semantics of the part-whole relations and ontological principles.",
        "The part-whole data used is taken either from the meronymy/holonymy relations of WN or from available annotated corpora.",
        "An incoherence between two sources of knowledge may be caused by an error in either one (or both).",
        "Contrasting part-whole data with the taxonomy will indeed help detecting errors in the taxonomy – the most numerous – but errors are also found in the part-whole data itself (see Section 3.3).",
        "We started extracting WN taxonomy from the hypernym relations in the current version of WN (3.0), a network of 117,798 nouns grouped in 82,155 synsets.",
        "We also extracted WN meronymy relations, i.e., 22,187 synset pairs, split into 12,293 \"member\", 9,097 \"part\" and 797 \"substance\", to constitute the first part-whole dataset.",
        "In order to replicate our methodology, we also extracted 89 part-whole relation word pairs annotated with WN senses from the SemEval-2007 Task 4 datasets (Girju et al., 2007).",
        "We kept the positive examples from the training and test datasets, excluding redundant pairs, and correcting a couple of errors.",
        "This data is also annotated with the meronymy sub-relations inspired from the classification of Winston et al.",
        "(1987), but five subtypes instead of WN's three, although \"member-collection\" can safely be assumed to correspond to WN's \"member\" meronymy.",
        "We will call this sub-relation Member, be it from WN or from SemEval.",
        "We also tried to get similar datasets from the SemEval-2010 Task 8 but, not being annotated with WN senses, they are useless for our purposes.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a WN-extracted meronymy pair from our corpus, encoded in our own xml format.",
        "Synsets are presented with the standard WN sense keys for each word, the recommended reference for stability from one WN release to another.",
        "Figure 1 : Example pair from the annotated dataset",
        "The semantics of the part-whole relation on which the meronymy/holonymy relations are founded involves ontological constraints: in short, the part and the whole should be of a similar nature.",
        "Studies in Mereology show that part-whole relations occur on all sub-domains of reality, concrete or abstract (Simons, 1987; Casati and Varzi, 1999).",
        "As a few cognitively oriented works explicitly state, the part and the whole should nevertheless belong to the same subdomain (Masolo et al., 2003; Vieu and Aur-nague, 2007).",
        "Other work, e.g., the influential (Winston et al., 1987), more or less implicitly exploit this homogeneity constraint.",
        "Our tests examine and compare the nature of the part and the whole in attested examples of meronymy, looking for incoherences.",
        "Here we use only a few basic ontological distinctions, namely, the distinction between:",
        "• endurants (ED) or physical entities (like a dog, a table, a cave, smoke),",
        "• perdurants (PD) or eventualities (like a lecture, a sleep, a downpour), and",
        "• abstract entities (AB – like a number, the content of a text, or a time).",
        "These are only three of the four topmost distinctions in DOLCE (Masolo et al., 2003), that is, we actually group qualities (Q, the fourth top-level category) into abstract entities here.",
        "Tests 1-3 are directly aimed at detecting ontological heterogeneity in meronymy pairs that mix the three categories ED, PD and AB, as just explained.",
        "The tests are queries on our corpus to extract and count meronymy pairs (pairs of synsets of the form (el,e2) where el is the part and e2 is the whole) that involve an ontological heterogeneity.",
        "Test 1 focuses on pairs mixing endurants and abstract entities (pairs of type (ED,AB) or (AB,ED)), Test 2 on endurants and perdurants ((ED,PD) or (PD,ED)) and Test 3 on perdurants and abstract entities ((PD,AB) or (AB,PD)).",
        "However, WN 3.0's top-level is not as simple as DOLCE's, so to recover the three basic categories we had to group several classes from different WN branches.",
        "In particular perdurants are found both under physical .entity %1:03:00 {processed :03:00) and under abstraction%l :03:00 (event%l:03:00 and state%l:03:00).",
        "The map we first established was then as follows:",
        "• AB = abstraction%l:03:00 \\ (event%l:03:00 U state%l:03:00).",
        "Since all groups in WordNet are under abstraction%l:03:00 irrespective of the nature of the members, it was obvious from the start that most \"member\" meronymy pairs would be caught by Tests 1 or 3.",
        "This is the reason why groups were actually removed from AB so the final map posited:",
        "• AB = abstraction%l:03:00 \\ (event%l:03:00 U state%l:03:00 U group%l:03:00).",
        "wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/documentation/",
        "Two more tests were designed to check basic semantic constraints involved in meronymy relations.",
        "Test 0 is related to the problem of confusion between classes and individuals evoked above and checks for meronymy pairs between an individual and a class.",
        "Meronymy in WN applies to pairs of classes and to pairs of individuals, but mixed pairs are also found, either between a class and an individual or between an individual and a class.",
        "The semantics of WN meronymy is not precisely described in Fellbaum (1998), but observing the data, the following appears to fit the semantics of \"is a meronym of\" between two classes A and B: the disjunction of the formulas \"for all/most instances a of A, there is an instance bofB such that P(a, b)\" and \"for all/most instances b of B, there is an instance a of A such that P(a, &)\", where P is the individual-level part-whole relation.",
        "On this basis, a meronymy between a class A and an individual b would simply mean: \"for all/most instances a of A, P(a, &)\", while a meronymy between an individual a and a class B would mean: \"for all/most instances b of B, P(a, &)\".",
        "The former can make sense, cf. (sura%l: 10:00, koran%l: 10:00) (all suras are part of the Koran).",
        "However, the latter would imply that all (most) instances of the class would share a same part, i.e., they would overlap.",
        "That the instances of a given class all overlap is of course not logically impossible, but it is highly unlikely for lexical classes.",
        "The purpose of Test 0 is to check for such cases, expected to reveal confusion between individuals and classes, that is, errors remaining after the introduction of the distinction in WN 2.1.",
        "Test 4 is dedicated to the large number of Member pairs in WN and SemEval data, somehow disregarded by the removal of groups from AB above.",
        "The semantics of this special case of meronymy clearly indicates that the whole denotes some kind of group, e.g., a collection or an organization, and that the part is a member of this group (Winston et al., 1987; Vieu and Aurnague, 2007).",
        "Group concepts in WN are hyponyms of group%l:03:00.",
        "A last coherence check, done by Test 4, thus extracts the Member pairs in which the whole is not considered a group because it is not an hyponym (or instance) of group%l:03:00."

        "The highest error rate is provided by Test 4: 550 (4.47%) of the 12,293 WN Member pairs and 7 (7.87%) of 19 Member pairs in SemEval dataset were identified as semantic errors because the whole is not a group in WN taxonomy.",
        "Test 0 has the lowest rate, just 349 (1.57%) of 22,187 WN meronymy pairs are suspected of confusing classes and individuals.",
        "More important than the error rate is that the tests achieved maximal precision.",
        "After manual inspection of all the suspect pairs extracted, it turns out all the pairs indeed suffered from some sort of error or another.",

        "For Tests 1-3, since the three categories ED, PD and AB are large and diverse, the analysis of the errors started with looking for regularities among the taxonomic chains of hypernyms of the synsets in the pairs.",

        "Some cases of \"dot objects\" (Pustejovsky, 1995) have been accounted this way.",
        "For instance, letter%l: 10:00 inherits both its abstract content from its hypernym text%l:10:00 (AB) and its physical aspect from its hypernym documented: 06:00 (ED).",
        "However, the polysemy of book, the classical similar case, is not accounted for in this way: book%l:10:00 only is ED.",
        "And while document has two separate senses, documented : 10:00 (AB) and documented :06:00 (ED), there is no separate abstract sense for book.",
        "Test 1 points at this problem with the pair (bookjof-psalms%l:10:01, book-of-common-prayer%l: 10:00), where the part is a subclass (rather than an instance, but this is an additional problem pointed by Test 0) of booked: 10:00 (ED), while the whole is an instance of sacredJext%l:10:00, a communication%l:03:00 (AB).",
        "As far as polysemy standardly accounted with multiple senses goes, our tests point at a need for a more principled use there as well.",
        "In particular, the polysemy accounted for at a given level is often not reproduced at lower levels, as just observed for document and book.",
        "We also have seen above that the polysemy of the word country is not \"inherited\" by individual countries.",
        "Similarly the polysemy of precipitation has no repercussion on that of rain, which has a sense rained :19:00 under precipita-tion%l:19:00, and none under precipitation%l :23:00 (on the other hand, the material sense of rain, rained:27:00 \"drops of fresh water that fall\", an ED, lacks for precipitation).",
        "A few pairs extracted with Test 4 show the hesitation of the lexicographer between the classification of a collection as a group, and a classification that accounts for the nature of the collection elements.",
        "For instance constellation%l: 17:00 and archipelago%l:17:00 have members but are ED, while galaxyed: 14:00 is a group.",
        "This could be properly addressed by splitting the group category, erroneously situated among abstract entities anyway, into different group categories (e.g., one for each of ED, PD and AB), or exploit multiple inheritance if compatible with its regimentation.",
        "Although all the pairs retrieved by our tests point at (one or several) errors, in a few cases, these are not solved easily.",
        "In particular, difficult ontological issues are faced with fictional entities.",
        "WN classifies most of these under psychological Jieature%l:03:00 (AB).",
        "However, these fictional entities often show very similar properties to those of concrete entities.",
        "As a result, some of them are classified as ED or PD, e.g., acheron%l:17:00 is an instance of river%l: 17:00 (ED), while being somehow recognized as fictional since it is a meronym of hades%l :09:00, a subclass (here again, not an instance, an additional problem) of psychological Jeature%l :03:00 (AB), something pointed out by Test 1.",
        "Others have concrete parts, e.g. we find the pair (winged:05:00, angel%l: 18:00) among the cases of (ED,AB), i.e. Test 1 results.",
        "Angel wings (and feathers, etc.)",
        "are of course of a different nature than bird wings, and hellish rivers are not real rivers, but how to distinguish them without duplicating most concrete concepts under psychological jeature%l :03:00 (AB) is unclear.",
        "Another regular anomaly is found with roles and relations, e.g., with pairs like (customer%l: 18:00, business jrelationeol:24:00), an (ED,AB) case (Test 1).",
        "A straightforward analysis saying that meronymy has been confused with participation (cf. 3.3) would overlook the fact that the customer role is defined by the business relation itself, i.e., that the dependence is even tighter.",
        "Since currently in WN, cus-tomered: 18:00 simply is a subclass of personed:03:00 (ED), in any case the classical issues related to the representation of roles are not addressed, and a more general solution should be looked for, perhaps along the lines of (Masolo et al., 2004).",
        "Finally, our tests identify a few isolated WN errors, which can be seen as small slips, such as for instance a wrong sense selected in the meronymy, e.g., (seat%l:06:01, seatingMrea%l :06:00) where seat%l:15:01 (the area, not the chair) should have been selected, or a wrong taxonomical attachment, that is, a wrong sense selected for an hypernym, e.g., infrastructure%l:06:01 is an hyponym of struc-ture%l:07:00, a property, instead of structure%l:06:00, an artifact (from the pair (infrastructure%l:06: 01, system%l:06:00) extracted with Test 1).",
        "As can be observed, tests do not all point at a unique type of problem, nor suggest a unique type of solution.",
        "Basically, there are five kinds of formal issues underlying the types of errors analyzed above, each calling for different modifications of WN:",
        "• a synset is considered as a class but should be an individual (3.1): need to change its direct hypernym link into an instance-of link, possibly changing as well the attachment point in the taxonomy;",
        "• a synset is not attached to the right place in the taxonomy (3.4, 3.8): need to move it in the taxonomy;",
        "• a synset mixes two senses (3.2, 3.5): need to introduce a missing sense, either attached elsewhere in the taxonomy or as instance of the synset at hand;",
        "• the meronymy relation is confused with another one (3.3): need to remove it (or change it for another sort of relation when this is introduced in WN);",
        "• the meronomy relation is established between the wrong synsets (3.8): need to change one of the two synsets related by another sense of a same word.",
        "In some cases, the problems should be addressed through more general cures, at a higher level in the taxonomy (3.4) or by imposing more systematic modeling choices (3.6, 3.7)."

      "text": [
        "We showed in this paper that automatic methods can be developed to spot errors in WN, especially in the hyperonymy relations in the lower levels of the taxonomy.",
        "The query system based on ontological principles and semantic constraints we proposed was very effective, as all the items retrieved did point to one or more errors.",
        "With such generic tests though, a manual analysis of the extracted examples by lexicographers, domain or ontological experts is necessary to decide on how the error should be solved.",
        "However, this same analysis showed many regularities pointing at standard ontological errors, which suggested that the tests can be much refined to limit the variety of issues caught by a single test and that simple repair guidelines can be written.",
        "This work can therefore be developed in several directions.",
        "On the one hand, the same tests can be exploited further by expanding the meronymy datasets, for instance if some annotated corpus similar to the SemEval2007 datasets becomes available.",
        "The range of tests can be extended as well.",
        "For instance, one can make further coherence tests exploiting meronymy data, refining or complementing the Tests 0^1 presented here.",
        "The class of abstract entities AB groups a variety of concepts, so incompatible combinations of subclasses are certainly present in (AB,AB) pairs (e.g., across relation%l:03:00, psychological jeature%l :03:00, or measure%l:03:00), suggesting new tests.",
        "Without considering to remove groups from abstract entities, cases of incoherence involving groups could also be addressed by checking the compatibility of the ontological categories of their members.",
        "Among the class of physical entities ED, we disregarded the presence of location entities, so new tests could also examine incompatible combinations of subclasses of ED.",
        "Finally, we could check whether the \"substance\" meronym relation indeed involves substances, in a similar way as Test 4 for groups.",
        "Additional tests can be considered using other knowledge sources than meronymy data.",
        "Within WN, we could exploit the semantics of tagged glosses (cf. Princeton WordNet Gloss Corpus) in order to check the coherence with the taxonomy.",
        "And since WN is more than a network of nouns, others relations can be exploited, for instance between nouns and verbs.",
        "Similarly, SemEval datasets deal with other relations than the one exploited here: from other subtypes of meronymy (e.g., \"place-area\"), to any of the semantic relations analyzed in the literature (e.g., \"instrument-agency\").",
        "In particular, relations involving thematic roles are quite easily associated with ontological constraints and so can constitute the basis for further tests.",
        "On the other hand, methods aiming at improving the quality of WN can be concretely built on the basis of these tests.",
        "A semi-automatic tool for \"cleaning-up\" WN could be fully developed, which could contribute to the next, improved, version of WN.",
        "The analysis of regular errors made in WN could simply lead to guidelines to help lexicographers avoid classical ontological mistakes.",
        "Such guidelines could be used for the extension of Princeton WN, e.g., for new domains.",
        "They could be used also during the creation of new WordNets for other languages, suggesting at the same time to abandon the common practice of simply importing the taxonomy of Princeton WN, importing also its errors.",
        "These two ideas could be combined in creating a tool to assist the development of WordNets by automatically checking errors and pointing out them in the development phase.",
        "This could well complement the TMEO methodology, based on ontological distinctions, used during the creation of the Sensocomune computational lexicon (Oltramarietal.,2010)."
