        "Distributed semantic representations like Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990), probabilistic LSA (Hofmann, 2001), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003), or relational clustering (Taskar et al., 2001) have garnered widespread interest because of their ability to quantitatively capture 'gist' semantic content.",
        "Two modeling assumptions underlie most of these models.",
        "First, the typical assumption is that words in the same document are an unstructured bag of words.",
        "This means that word order and syntactic structure are ignored in the resulting vectorial representations of meaning, and the only relevant relationship between words is the 'same-document' relationship.",
        "Second, these semantic models are not compositional in and of themselves.",
        "They require some external process to aggregate the meaning representations of words to form phrasal or sentential meaning; at best, they can jointly represent whole strings of words without the internal relationships.",
        "This paper introduces structured vectorial semantics (SVS) as a principled response to these weaknesses of vector space models.",
        "In this framework, the syntax-semantics interface is fully interactive: semantic vectors exist in syntactic context, and any composition of semantic vectors necessarily produces a hypothetical syntactic parse.",
        "Since semantic information is used in syntactic disambiguation (MacDonald et al., 1994), we would expect practical improvements in parsing accuracy by accounting for the interactive interpretation process.",
        "Others have incorporated syntactic information with vector-space semantics, challenging the bag-of-words assumption.",
        "Syntax and semantics may be jointly generated with Bayesian methods (Griffiths et al., 2005); syntactic structure may be coupled to the basis elements of a semantic space (Padö and Lapata, 2007); clustered semantics maybe used as a preprocessing step (Koo et al., 2008); or, semantics may be learned in some defined syntactic context (Lin, 1998).",
        "These techniques are interactive, but their semantic models are not syntactically compositional (Frege, 1892).",
        "SVS is a generative model of sentences that uses a variant of the last strategy to incorporate syntax at preterminal tree nodes, but is inherently compositional.",
        "Mitchell and Lapata (2008) provide a general framework for semantic vector composition:",
        "where u and v are the vectors to be composed, R is syntactic context, K is a semantic knowledge base, and p is a resulting composed vector (or tensor).",
        "In this initial work of theirs, they leave out any notion of syntactic context, focusing on additive and multiplicative vector composition (with some variations):",
        "Since the structured vectorial semantics proposed here may be viewed within this framework, our discussion will begin from their definition in Section 2.1.",
        "Erk and Padö's (2008) model also fits inside Mitchell and Lapata's framework, and like SVS, it includes syntactic context.",
        "Their semantic vectors use syntactic information as relations between multiple vectors in arriving at a final meaning representation.",
        "The emphasis, however, is on selectional preferences of individual words; resulting representations are similar to word-sense disambiguation output, and do not construct phrase-level meaning from word meaning.",
        "Mitchell and Lapata's more recent work (2009) combines syntactic parses with distributional semantics; but the underlying compositional model requires (as other existing models would) an interpolation of the vector composition results with a separate parser.",
        "It is thus not fully interactive.",
        "Though the proposed structured vectorial semantics may be defined within Equation 1, the end output necessarily includes not only a semantic vector, but a full parse hypothesis.",
        "This slightly shifts the focus from the semantically-centered Equation 1 to an accounting of meaning that is necessarily interactive (between syntax and semantics); vector composition and parsing are then twin lenses by which the process may be viewed.",
        "Thus, unlike previous models, a unique phrasal vectorial semantic representation is composed during decoding.",
        "Due to the novelty of phrasal vector semantics and lack of existing evaluative measures, we have chosen to report results on the well-understood dual problem of parsing.",
        "The structured vectorial semantic framework subsumes variants of several common parsing algorithms, two of which will be discussed: lexicalized parsing (Charniak, 1996; Collins, 1997, etc.)",
        "and relational clustering (akin to latent annotations (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006; Gesmundo et al., 2009)).",
        "Because previous work has shown that linguistically-motivated syntactic state-splitting already improves parses (Klein and Manning, 2003), syntactic states are split as thoroughly as possible into subcategorization classes (e.g., transitive and intransitive verbs).",
        "This pessimistically isolates the contribution of semantics on parsing accuracy – it will only show parsing gains where semantic information does not overlap with distributional syntactic information.",
        "Evaluations show that interactively considering semantic information with syntax has the predicted positive impact on parsing accuracy over syntax alone; it also lowers per-word perplexity.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes SVS as both vector composition and parsing; Section 3 shows how relational-clustering SVS subsumes PCFG-LAs; and Section 4 evaluates modeling assumptions and empirical performance."

        "Averages are taken over different random seeds, with EM running 4 or 10 iterations.",
        "We should note that relationally-clustered SVS is feasible with respect to random initialization and speed.",
        "Four relationally-clustered SVS models (with 500 headwords clustered into 5 concepts) were trained, each having a different random initialization.",
        "We found that the parsing F-score had a mean of 83.98 and a standard deviation of 0.21 across different initializations of the model.",
        "This indicates that though there are significant difference between the models, they still outperform models without SVS (see next section).",
        "Also, it may seem slow to consider the set of semantic concepts and relations alongside syntax, at least with respect to normal parsing.",
        "The definition of SVS in terms of vectors actually mitigates this effect on WSJ Section 23, according to Figure 3.",
        "Since SVS is probabilistically consistent, the parser could be defined without vectors, but this would have the 'non-vectorized' speed curve.",
        "The contiguous storage and access of information in the 'vectorized' version leads to an efficient implementation.",
        "One important comparison to draw here is between the effectiveness of semantic clusters versus headword-lexicalization.",
        "For fair head-to-head comparison on WSJ Section 23, both models were vectorized and included no smoothing or backoff.",
        "Neither relational clusters nor lexicalization were optimized with backoff or smoothing.",
        "Table la shows precision, recall, and F-score for lexicalized models and for clustered semantic models.",
        "First, note that the 10-cluster model (in bold) improves on a syntax-only parser (top line), showing that the semantic model is contributing useful information to the parsing task.",
        "Next, compare the 50-headword, 10-cluster model (in bold) to the line above it.",
        "It is natural to compare this model to the headword-lexicalized model with 50 headwords, since the same information from the trees is available to both models.",
        "The relationally-clustered model outperforms the headword-lexicalized model, showing that clustering the headwords actually improves their usefulness, despite the fact that fewer referents are used in the actual vectors.",
        "It is also interesting, then, to compare this 50-headword, 10-cluster model to a headword-lexicalized model with 10 headwords.",
        "In this case, the possible size of the grammar is equal.",
        "Again, the relationally-clustered model outperforms plain lexicalization.",
        "This indicates that the 10 clustered referents are much more meaningful than 10 headword referents for the disambiguating of syntax.",
        "The final experiment on relational-clustering SVS was to determine whether performance would vary with the number of clusters.",
        "Table lb compares average performance (over different random initializations) for numbers of clusters from 1 (a syntax-equivalent case) to 20.",
        "First, it should be noted that all of the relationally clustered models improved on the baseline.",

        "This paper has introduced a structured vectorial semantic (SVS) framework in which vector composition and syntactic parsing are a single, interactive process.",

        "Two standard parsing techniques were defined within SVS and evaluated: headword-lexicalization SVS (bilexical parsing) and relational-clustering SVS (latent annotations).",
        "It was found that relationally-clustered SVS outperformed the simpler lexicalized model and syntax-only models, and that additional clusters had a mildly positive effect.",
        "Additionally, perplexity results showed that the integration of distributed semantics in relationally-clustered SVS improved the model over a non-interactive baseline.",
        "It is hoped that this flexible framework will enable new generations of interactive interpretation models that deal with the syntax-semantics interface in a plausible manner."
