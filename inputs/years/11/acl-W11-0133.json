        "Past successes with conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (Graesser et al., 2001), have helped to demonstrate the efficacy of computer-led, tutorial dialogue.",
        "However, ITS will not reach their full potential until they can overcome current limitations in spoken dialogue technologies.",
        "Producing systems capable of leading open-ended, Socratic-style tutorials will likely require more sophisticated models to automate analysis and generation of dialogue.",
        "A well defined tutorial dialogue annotation scheme can serve as a stepping stone towards these goals.",
        "Such a scheme should account for differences in tutoring style and question scaffolding techniques and should capture the subtle distinctions between different question types.",
        "To do this, requires a representation that connects a turn's communicative and rhetorical functions to its underlying semantic content.",
        "While efforts such as DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997) and DIT++ (Bunt, 2009) have helped to make dialogue act annotation more uniform and applicable to a wider audience, and while tutoring-specific initiatives (Tsovaltzi and Karagjosova, 2004; Buckley and Wolska, 2008) have helped to bring dialogue acts to tutorial dialogue, the move granularity in these schémas is too coarse to capture the differences in tutorial questioning styles exhibited in our corpus of Socratic-style tutorial dialogues.",
        "Conversely, question type categories (Graesser and Person, 1994; Nielsen et al., 2008) have been designed with education in mind, but they largely ignore how the student and tutor may work together to construct meaning.",
        "The DISCOUNT scheme's (Pilkington, 1999) combination of dialogue acts and rhetorical functions enabled it to better capture tutoring moves, but its omission of shallow semantics prevents it from capturing how content influences behavior.",
        "Our long-term goals of automatic dialogue characterization, tutorial move prediction and question generation led us to design our own dialogue representation called DISCUSS (Dialogue Scheme for Unifying Speech and Semantics).",
        "Design of this dialogue move taxonomy was based on preliminary observations from our corpus of tutorial dialogues, and was influenced by the aforementioned research.",
        "We hope that undertaking this ambitious endeavor to capture not only a turn's pragmatic interpretation, but also its rhetorical and semantic functions will enable us to better model the complexity of open-ended, tutorial dialogue.",
        "The remainder of the this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we describe our tutorial dialogue setting and our data.",
        "Section 3 discusses the organization of the DISCUSS annotation scheme.",
        "Section 4 briefly explains the current status of our annotation.",

        "The MyST dialogue design and tutoring style is based on a pedagogy called Questioning the Author (QtA) (Beck et al., 1996), wherein the teacher facilitates discovery by challenging students with open-ended questions and by directly keying in on ideas expressed in the student's language.",
        "To gather data for MyST system coverage and dialogue analysis, we ran Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiments that allowed a human tutor to be inserted into the interaction loop.",

        "The Dialogue Scheme for Unifying Speech and Semantics (DISCUSS) is a multifaceted dialogue move taxonomy intended to capture both the pragmatic and semantic interpretations of an utterance.",
        "A DISCUSS move is a tuple composed of values from four dimensions: Dialogue Act, Rhetorical Form, Predicate Type, and Semantic Roles.",
        "Together these dimensions convey the communicative action, surface form, and meaning of an utterance independent of the original utterance text.",
        "We designed DISCUSS to serve as an intermediate representation that will enable future work in dialogue session characterization, dialogue strategy optimization, and automatic question generation.",
        "To facilitate these goals, we have endeavored to create a taxonomy that is both descriptive and curriculum-independent while allowing for expansion as necessary.",
        "A complete listing of all the DISCUSS moves and dimensions can be found in our forthcoming technical report.",
        "In the following subsection we will describe the different DISCUSS move categories.",
        "Descriptions of the Semantic Role and Predicate Type are found in the subsection about semantic dimensions, while discussion about the dialogue act and rhetorical form has been placed in the pragmatic dimensions subsection.",
        "Throughout the rest of this paper we denote DISCUSS tuples using the following notation: Dialogue Act/Rhetorical Form/Predicate Type (Semantic Role).",
        "DISCUSS moves are dictated by the dialogue act dimension and may belong to one of three broad categories: Dialogue Control, Information Exchange, and Attention Management.",
        "Dialogue Control moves are largely concerned with maintaining and enabling the flow of information.",
        "This includes dialogue acts such as Acknowledge, Open, Close, Repeat, and RequestRepeat.",
        "The Information Exchange moves relay content (often lesson-specific) between speakers using moves such as Assert, Ask, Answer, Mark, Revoice.",
        "For tutorial dialogue the bulk of student-tutor interactions reside in this category.",
        "Lastly, Attention Management moves indicate how a speaker exercises initiative over other speakers or topics.",
        "Dialogue acts found in the attention category are Focus, Defer, Elicit, and Direct.",
        "The semantic dimensions define the objects, events, properties and relations contained within an utterance.",
        "The semantic roles at the lowest level of the DISCUSS hierarchy directly capture the propositional entities.",
        "Predicate Types summarize the interactions between all of the semantic roles found within an utterance.",
        "Semantic Roles: The MyST system models a lesson's key concepts as propositions which are realized as semantic frames.",
        "For MyST natural language understanding, these frames serve as the top-level nodes for a manually written semantic grammar used by the Phoenix parser (Ward, 1994).",
        "Two example concepts/frames and Phoenix parses are shown below.",
        "Although these semantic frames form the basis of MyST dialogues, for DISCUSS annotation we sought a more domain-independent representation that would generalize across a wide range of subjects.",
        "We began with VerbNet (Schüler, 2005) for defining our set of semantic roles because of its intuitive balance between descriptiveness and portability.",
        "While we used a majority of the labels as is, we found that the definition of some roles needed to be modified or extended to properly cover our set of concepts.",
        "For example, many concepts that express proportionality relationships can not be easily represented using predicate argument structure, and are more easily decomposed into cause and effect roles.",
        "We also added the catch-all keyword label to reflect terms that may relate to the proposition, but are not part of the core representation.",
        "For our annotation project, rather than manually tagging all of the utterances with VerbNet labels, we created a mapping layer between the Phoenix frame roles and the VerbNet roles.",
        "The table below shows two frames along with their role mappings.",
        "We envision that in future projects, the hand-tuned semantic grammars could be replaced with a statistically trained semantic role labeler.",
        "Predicate Type: Simply knowing an utterance's propositional content is insufficient for inferring what was stated.",
        "Consider the two exchanges shown in the table below.",
        "The mixture of semantic roles in both students' responses are identical.",
        "Additionally, we can not differentiate between the exchanges based solely on dialogue act or rhetorical form.",
        "We need additional information to know the first scenario seeks to elicit discussion about observations while the second scenario focuses on procedures.",
        "One can also imagine such information would be useful for identifying communication breakdowns.",
        "For example, responding with a description of a procedure to a request about a process may indicate that the student did not understand the question or that the student is unwilling or unable to address the question.",
        "To address this need, we created the Predicate Type based partly on the rhetorical predicates used in the DISCOUNT (Pilkington, 1999) scheme.",
        "While DISCOUNT included discourse relations in the set of predicate types, we restrict predicate types to those that encapsulate or summarize the collection of semantic roles in an utterance.",
        "Example predicate types include procedure, observation and purpose.",

        "Like with the majority of dialogue act taxonomies, DISCUSS dialogue acts have a grounding in speech act theory with a focus on what action the utterance performs.",
        "While most of the dialogue acts in the Dialogue Control and Information Exchange move categories have direct corollaries to those found in other taxonomies like DIT++ or DAMSL, we needed to supplement them with two frequently used Questioning the Author discussion moves: marking and revoicing.",
        "In marking, the tutor highlights parts of the student's language to emphasize important points and to steer the conversation towards key concepts.",
        "Revoicing serves a similar purpose, but instead of highlighting, the tutor rephrases student speech to clarify ideas they may have been struggling with.",
