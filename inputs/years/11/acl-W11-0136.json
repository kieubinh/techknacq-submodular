        "Vector based representations of meaning have wide application in natural language processing.",
        "While these techniques work well at the word level, for longer strings, data becomes extremely sparse.",
        "The question of how the principle of compositionality might apply for such representations has thus been recognised as an important one (Widdows, 2008; Clark et al., 2008).",
        "Context-theoretic semantics (Clarke, 2007) is a framework for composing meanings in vector based semantics, in which the composition of the meaning of strings is described by a multiplication on a real vector space A that is bilinear with respect to the addition of the vector space, i.e.",
        "where x,y,z G A and a, ß € M. It is assumed that the multiplication is associative, but not commutative.",
        "The resulting structure is an associative algebra over a field – or simply an algebra when there is no ambiguity.",
        "Clarke (2007) gives a mathematical model of meaning as context, and shows that under this model, the meaning of natural language expressions can be described by an algebra.",
        "The framework is also applied to models of textual entailment, and logical and ontological representations of natural language meaning.",
        "In this paper, we identify three general techniques for constructing algebras.",
        "• Using quotient algebras to impose relations on a free algebra, as described in (Clarke et al., 2010).",
        "• Defining finite-dimensional algebras using matrices.",
        "Any finite-dimensional algebra can be described in this way; we have investigated the possibility of learning such algebras using least squares regression.",
        "• Constructing algebras from a semigroup to give it vector space properties.",
        "We sketch a possible method of using this technique, identified by Clarke (2007), to endow logical semantics with a vector space nature.",
        "This paper presents a preliminary consideration of these general techniques, and our goal is simply to show that they are worthy of further exploration.",

        "One commonly used bilinear multiplication operator on vector spaces is the tensor product (denoted <g>), whose use as a method of combining meaning was first proposed by Smolensky (1990), and has been considered more recently by Clark and Pulman (2007) and Widdows (2008), who also looked at the direct sum (which Widdows calls the direct product, denoted ©).",
        "The tensor algebra on a vector space V (where V is a space of context features) is defined as:",
        "Any element of T(V) can be described as a sum of components with each in a different tensor power of V. Multiplication is defined as the tensor product on these components, and extended linearly to the whole of T(V).",
        "Previous work has not made full use of the tensor product space; only tensor products are used, not sums of tensor products, giving us the equivalent of the product states of quantum mechanics.",
        "Our approach imposes relations on the vectors of the tensor product space that causes some product states to become equivalent to entangled states, containing sums of tensor products of different degrees.",
        "This allows strings of different lengths to share components.",
        "We achieve this by constructing a quotient algebra.",
        "An ideal / of an algebra A is a sub-vector space of A such that xa € / and ax € / for all a € A and all x € /.",
        "An ideal introduces a congruence = on A defined by x = y if and only ifx – yGl.",
        "For any set of elements Aç A there is a unique minimal ideal Ia containing all elements of A; this is called the ideal generated by A.",
        "The quotient algebra A/1 is the set of all equivalence classes defined by this congruence.",
        "Multiplication is defined on A/1 by the multiplication on A, since = is a congruence.",
        "Elements that are congruent with respect to the ideal have equivalence classes that are equal in the quotient algebra.",
        "The construction is thus a way of imposing relations between vector elements: we simply choose a set of pairs that we wish to be equal, and put their difference in the generating set A.",
        "Clarke et al.",
        "(2010), showed how an inner product can be computed for elements of the quotient algebra by taking the quotient of a finite dimensional subspace of the ideal and how a treebank could be used to identify suitable elements to put into the generating set for the ideal in such a way that strings of different lengths become comparable.",
        "Figure 1 shows similarities between adjective phrases computed using vectors derived from the corpus in figure 2.",
        "The construction allows many properties of the tensor product to carry over into the quotient algebra, for example the similarity of red book to red apple is the same as the similarity of book to apple, as we would expect from the tensor product.",
        "Unlike the tensor product, strings of different length are comparable, so for example, the similarity of apple to red apple is non-zero.",

        "An alternative to this is to restrict the space of exploration to finite-dimensional algebras.",
        "In this case, we can explore the space of possible products in relation to the set of relations we wish to hold; in other words, we can view this as an optimisation problem in which we want to find the best possible product given the required relations.",
        "We apply this to the situation where we obtain a vector x for each individual word and pair of words in sequence.",
        "We then find the product that best fits these observed vectors.",
        "Given a set W = {wi,W2 ■ ■ ■ wm} of words, we want to define a product 0 to minimise the difference between Wi 0 Wj and wîwj, for 1 < i, j < m. Specifically, we can define this as minimising",
        "If word vectors have n dimensions, then 0 is defined by an n dimensional vector, which we denote frst for 1 < r, s, t < n, where (er 0 es)t = frst and e is the vector with 1 in every component, and vt is the ith component of v.",

        "Since these parameters are independent for each value of i, each set of n parameters can be learnt in parallel.",
        "We are currently exploring ways of learning these parameters.",
        "The form of the equation above suggests the use of least squares, and we have performed some experiments using this method using a corpus extracted from the ukWaC corpus (Ferraresi et al., 2008).",
        "We extracted a list of verb adjective*noun sequences, and used latent semantic analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990) to generate n-dimensional vectors for the 160 most common adjectives and nouns, and pairs of these adjectives and nouns.",

        "(2008) described a method of composing meanings which they noted was a generalisation of Montague semantics.",
        "However, their version of Montague semantics assumed a particular model, and thus effectively mapped sentences to truth values.",
        "This omits much of the power of Montague semantics in which sentences are mapped to logical forms which then provide restrictions on the set of allowable models, allowing, for example, entailments to be computed between sentences.",
        "We will sketch a method by which Montague semantics can be described within the context-theoretic framework.",
        "We follow a standard method of representing logic in language, but instead of representing words using logic, we represent an individual dimension of meaning of a word by a logical form – we call this dimension a \"aspect\".",

        "This defines a semigroup: the Lambek calculus can be described in terms of a residuated lattice, which is a partially ordered semigroup (Lambek, 1958), and the lambda calculus is equivalent to a Cartesian closed category under /5-equivalence (Lambek, 1985), which can be considered as a semigroup with additional structure.",

        "The predicates adjj and nourij correspond to aspects, in this case each dimension i of the three dimensions in the context vectors has a corresponding adjj and noun^.",
        "We may then represent the vectors for these terms as elements of the algebra big = a\\ + 2ü2 and fish = ns, where we equate an element u of the semigroup with the function in the algebra Ll(S) which maps « to 1 and every other element to zero.",
