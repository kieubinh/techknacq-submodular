        "In this paper we describe some features of a system designed to translate from Italian into Italian Sign Language (henceforth LIS).",
        "The system is being developed within the ATLAS project.",
        "This architecture applies a hard computational linguistic approach: knowledge-based restricted interlingua (Hutchins and Somer, 1992).",
        "We perform a deep linguistic processing in each phase of the translation, i.e (1) syntactic analysis of the Italian input sentence, (2) semantic interpretation and (3) LIS generation.",
        "The main motivation to adopt this ambitious architecture is that Italian and LIS are very different languages.",
        "Moreover, LIS is a poorly studied language, so no large corpus is available and statistical techniques are hardly conceivable.",
        "We reduce our ambitions by restricting ourselves to the weather forecasts application domain.",
        "In this paper we describe some major issues of the semantic interpretation and illustrate a case study on ordinal numbers.",
        "Our semantic interpretation is based on a syntactic analysis that is a dependency tree (Hudson, 1984; Lesmo, 2007).",
        "Each word in the sentence is associated with a node of the syntactic tree.",
        "Nodes are linked via labeled arcs that specify the syntactic role of the dependents with respect to their head (the parent node).",
        "A key point in semantic interpretation is that the syntax-semantics interface used in the analysis is based on an ontology.",
        "The knowledge in the ontology concerns an application domain, i.e. weather forecasts, as well as more general information about the world: the latter information is used to compute the sentence meaning.",
        "Indeed, the sentence meaning consists of a complex fragment of the ontology: predicate-argument structures and semantic roles are contained in this fragment and could be extracted by translating this fragment into usual First Order Logic predicates.",
        "The idea to use the ontological paradigm to represent world knowledge as well as sentence meaning is similar to the work by Nirenburg and Raskin (2004) and Buitelaar et al.",
        "(2009), but in contrast to these approaches (1) we use a syntactic parser to account for syntactic analysis; and (2) we use a recursive semantic interpretation function similar to Cimiano (2009)."

        "where n is the node of a dependency tree and d\\, cfo, • • •, c4 are its dependents.",
        "CMo(w) is a function that extracts the lexical meaning of a word w accessing the dictionary: that is, a class or an individual on the ontology Ö. CVo{y,z) is a function that returns the shortest path on Ö that connects y to z.",
        "The search for connections relies on the rationale that the shortest path between any two ontology nodes represents the stronger semantic connection between them.",
        "In most cases the distance between two concepts is the number of the nodes among them, but in some cases a number of constraints needs to be satisfied too (see the example on ordinal construction).",
        "Finally, the operator Ù is used to denote a particular merge operator, similar to Cimiano (2009).",
        "As a general strategy, shortest paths are composed with the union operation, but each CVo (y, z) conveys a peculiar set of ontological constraints: the merge operator takes all such constraints to build the overall complex ontological representation.",
        "In particular, a number of semantic clashes can arise from the union operation: we use a number of heuristics to resolve these clashes.",
        "For sake of simplicity (and space) in this definition we do not describe the heuristics used in the ambiguity resolution.",
        "However, three distinct types of ambiguity exist: (1) lexical ambiguity, i.e. a word can have more than one lexical meaning; (2) shortest path ambiguity, i.e. two nodes can be connected by two equal-length paths; (3) merge ambiguity, i.e. two fragments of ontology can be merged in different manners.",
        "Whilst lexical ambiguity has not a great impact due to the limited domain (and could be addressed by standard word sense disambiguation techniques), handling shortest path and merge ambiguities needs heuristics expressed as constraints that rely on general world knowledge.",
