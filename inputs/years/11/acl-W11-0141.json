        "Negation and modality are complex aspects of the semantics of language.",
        "Modality was introduced by Jespersen (1924), who distinguishes between two categories of mood that later have been named as deontic modality and epistemic modality.",
        "Lyons (1996) describes epistemic modality as concerned with matters of knowledge and belief, \"the speaker's opinion or attitude towards the proposition that the sentence expresses or the situation that the proposition describes\".",
        "Palmer (1986) defines it as expressing the speaker's degree of commitment to the truth of a proposition.",
        "Polarity is a discrete category that can take two values: positive and negative.",
        "Positive polarity is used by speakers to put information as a fact in the world, whereas negative polarity is used to put information as a counterfact, a fact that does not hold in the world.",
        "Negation is a linguistic resource used to express negative polarity.",
        "Although the treatment of these topics in computational linguistics is relatively new compared to other areas like machine translation, parsing or semantic role labeling, incorporating information about modality and polarity has been shown to be useful for a number of applications, such as biomedical text processing (Di Marco and Mercer, 2005; Chapman et al., 2001), opinion mining and sentiment analysis (Wilson et al., 2005), recognizing textual entailment (Snow et al., 2006), and automatic style checking (Ganter and Strube, 2009).",
        "In general, the treatment of modality and negation is very relevant for computational applications that process factuality (Saurl, 2008).",
        "For example, information extraction systems may be confronted with fragments of texts like the one presented in (1), which contains two negation cues (not, un-) and one speculation cue (likely) that affect the factuality of the events being expressed:",
        "(1) The atovaquone/proguanil combination has not been widely used yet in West Africa so it is unlikely that the patient was initially infected with an atovaquone-resistant strain.",
        "So far two main tasks have been addressed within the natural language processing (NLP) community: (i) the detection of various forms of polarity and modality and (ii) the identification of the scope of negation and modality cues.",
        "In this paper we reflect on the achievements of the recently introduced scope finding task (Section 2), we analyse the scope model that existing systems can process (Section 3), and we point out aspects of the scope finding task that would be different based on observations from a corpus from a different domain (Section 4)."

        "In the last years, several corpora have been annotated with information related to modality and polarity, which have made it possible to develop machine learning systems.",
        "Annotation has been performed at different levels: word (Hassan and Radev, 2010), expression (Baker et al., 2010; Toprak et al., 2010), sentence (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007), event (Saurl and Pustejovsky, 2009), discourse relation (Prasad et al., 2006), text (Amancio et al., 2010), and scope of negation and modality cues (Vincze et al., 2008).",
        "Thanks to the existence of the BioScope corpus, the scope processing task was recently introduced.",
        "BioScope is a freely available resource, that consists of three parts of medical and biological texts annotated with negation and hedge cues and their scope.",
        "The scope processing task is concerned with determining at a sentence level which tokens are affected by modality and negation cues.",
        "It was first modelled as a classification problem by Morante et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Later on several systems have been trained on the same corpus (Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Ozgur and Radev, 2009; Agarwal and Yu, 2010; Li et al., 2010).",
        "Councill et al.",

        "The CoNLL Shared Task 2010 on Learning to detect hedges and their scope in natural language text (Farkas et al., 2010) boosted research on the topic.",
        "It consisted of identifying sentences containing uncertainty and recognizing speculative text spans inside sentences.",
        "Participating systems would, for example, produce the tagged sentence in (2), in which propose, suggest and possible are identified as hedge cues and their scope is marked in agreement with the gold standard.",
        "(2) We [propose propose that the existence of the alternative alignments, specific to distinct groups of genes, [suggest suggests presence of different synchronization modes between the two organisms and [possiwe possible functional decoupling of particular physiological gene networks in the course of evolution poSsibie]suggest]prop0se] .",
        "The best system (Morante et al., 2010) for hedge scope finding in the CoNLL ST 2010 scores 57.32 F-score.",
        "Although the results are lower than the scores obtained in other well established tasks (i.e. semantic role labeling, dependency parsing), we can say that setting the first step towards automatic scope processing is an achievement.",
        "However, it can be useful to revise the characteristics of the scopes that the systems learn to process, not from a technical machine learning perspective, but from the linguistic annotation perspective, since the annotation model that systems learn determines the quality of the system output and the knowledge that can be inferred from the scopes."
