        "In the effort of building a verb lexicon classifying the most used verbs in Arabic and providing information about their syntax and semantics (Mousser, 2010), the problem of classes over-generation arises because of the overt morphology of Arabic, which codes not only agreement and inflection relations but also semantic information related to thematic arity or other semantic information like \"intensity\", \"pretension\", etc.",

        "Verbs like abate, acidify, dry, crystallize, etc.",
        "share a meaning component and are grouped into a class (change-of-state), since they participate in the causative/incoative alternation, the middle alternation, the instrument subject alternation and the resultative alternation (Levin, 1993).",
        "Class based lexica have turned out to be usefull lexical resources such as the English VerbNet (Kipper Schuler, 2005), which provides information about thematic roles, syntactic and semantic structure of 5879 English verbs.",
        "Trying to use the same approach to classify verbs of a morphologically rich language like Arabic, the researcher is faced with difficulties because many alternations require morphological operations to express meaning aspects, especially those related to thematic roles.",

        "For each class one sibling class was generated with a total of 3360 verbs and 368 frames.",
        "The high number of generated verbs is due to the fact that some verbs have more than one way to express the causative or the inchoative.",
        "After checking the quality of the produced classes, we count 71% accuracy in identifying the patterns of the verbs and 82% in generating their derived forms.",
        "After manually adjusting the new sibling classes (deleting unsuitable verb forms and adding the correct ones, adding frame examples, etc.",
        "), we noted that Arabic VerbNet counts now 291 classes populating 7937 verbs and 1202 frames, which represents an expansion rate of 44%.",
        "Noteworthy, not all verbs formed by the root-pattern system exist synchronically.",
        "We observed that inside the same sibling class one verb can be widely found in different Arabic corpora whereas another verb of the same sibling class is not attested in the same corpora.",
        "For instance, the verb nabaha 'to bark' of the class animalsounds has a causative form anbaha 'cause to bark', but for the most members of the same class the causative form are not attested to be used in the \"real world\".",
        "However, they are potential lexicon entries and native Arabic speakers will most likely recognize their meaning without being exposed to them before.",
        "Additionally, given the fact that human lexica are brittle and incomplete, the scope of Levin's class approach (Levin, 1993) can be expanded to explain the derivational behaviour of verbs: Verbs which belong to the same class and share the same syntactic and semantic properties are likely to share the same derivational behaviour, especially when this behaviour is related to the general semantic properties of the class."
