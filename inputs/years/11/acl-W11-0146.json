        "This corpus is composed of human-machine dialogues in the domain of hotel reservation and tourist information.",
        "Utterances in dialogues have been previously annotated with a concept-value flat semantics for studying and evaluating spoken language understanding modules in dialogue systems.",
        "We are now interested in investigating the use of more complex representations to improve the understanding capability.",
        "The MMIL intermediate language is a high level semantic formalism that bears relevant linguistic information, from syntax up to discourse.",
        "This representation should increase the expressivity of the current annotation though at the expense of the annotation process complexity.",
        "In this paper we present our first attempt in defining the annotation guidelines for the HLS annotation of the MEDIA corpus and its effect on the annotation process itself, revealed by annotators' disagreements due to the different levels of hierarchy and the granularity of the features defined in MMIL.",
        "1 Introduction",
        "MMIL is an ontology-oriented representation language that has been used in several natural language processing (NLP) applications, Denis et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "It permits the integration of divergent resources in distributed systems as well as the representation of various levels of linguistic analysis.",
        "In this work we are particularly interested in exploring the representation of these linguistic levels for analyzing utterances in the context of human-machine interactions.",
        "To be able to evaluate the representation on a large set of data the French MEDIA dialogue corpus is used, Bonneau-Maynard et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "The MEDIA corpus collects about 70 hours of spontaneous speech in the task of hotel room reservation and tourist information.",
        "It has been created using a Wizard-of-Oz technique, as a consequence, the utterances are made of many disfluencies, hesitations, false starts, truncations or fillers words (e.g., euh or ben).",
        "Thus, the syntactic analysis is relevant for keeping valuable information for further processing (e.g., reference resolution).",
        "The semantics describe fine grained predicates, arguments and features based on the domain knowledge.",
        "Similarly, the possibility of link references for pragmatic analysis and the representation of the illocutionary force of utterances are relevant to improve the understanding in NLP applications.",
        "We selected MMIL for the semantic annotation because it supports the representation of all these features.",
        "Although these features enrich the semantic annotation of utterances in the corpus, they also increase the complexity of the annotation and compromise the agreement between annotators.",
        "The possibility of representing different instantiations in MMIL has been the main cause of disagreement between annotators.",
        "On the one hand, linguists tend to annotate the surface form of the utterance.",
        "On the other",

        "Afterwards, a linguist expert and a project designer were in charge of defining the annotation guidelines.",

        "330 utterances were selected.",
        "They are all directly related to the reservation task (first two rows in Figure 4) and mostly occurred in the first 3 turns of the dialogues when the user is describing his goal, defined as an overall objective along with a set of constraints.",
        "Hereafter, we present the preliminary evaluation of the experts' agreement on these utterances.",
        "The annotation process has been supported by an annotation tool: ATool.",
        "It accesses two knowledgebases, one for the MMIL formalism and the other for the MEDIA domain.",
        "The latter is adapted from the MEDIA evaluation campaign, Bonneau-Maynard et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "ATool permits annotators to navigate through utterances, while displaying the MMIL representation.",
        "Annotators can design the MMIL components graphs, define the MMIL entities by associating features, values and segment.",
        "ATool will suggest the possible features and values for the MMIL formalism and for the domain according to the knowledge-bases ensuring the integrity of the constructed MMIL components in the annotation.",
        "The MEDIA corpus is rich in expressions that evoke several communicative actions.",
        "Figure 4 shows a few examples.",
        "For the purpose of the task, we are interested in the underlying meaning of sentences, thus politeness and indirectness are discarded from the HLS representation.",
        "For this reason, in requests the speaker is the patient, while the hearer is the agent (see Figure 4).",
        "Because when translating the utterance into its deep instantiation, the speaker will benefit from the execution of the action, while the hearer has the obligation to perform the action.",
        "All the expressions in the corpus that bear the semantics of \"command for a reservation\" (e.g., je veux réserver, je souhaite réserver, je voudrais faire une réservation, j'aimerais faire une réservation, all equivalent to I would like to reserve), have been normalized with the deep component shown in Figure 3, exemplifying unequivocally the user's desire to request for a reservation.",
        "The possible arguments and roles have been detailed in the domain knowledge-base.",
        "As a consequence the knowledge-base defines relations between hotels, rooms, customers, prices, equipments, services, locations and dates.",
        "Besides, the grammatical relations and features, such as coordination, have been defined in the MMIL knowledge-base.",
        "Coordination is indicated with the \"coordtype\" feature and it is used in cases of conjunction (je veux une chambre simple et deux chambres double, I want a single room and two double bedrooms), disjunction (Paris ou en proche banlieue, in Paris or suburbs) or adversation (en ville mais pas trop loin de la mer, in the city but not too far from the sea).",
        "For annotating events we can find the main verb in the utterance and represent it as the main event in MMIL by following a domain-specific classification of verbs, from which Figure 4 shows some equivalences among dialogue acts and verbs.",
        "For each participant or event, several features can be",

        "Fi gure 4: Some of the observed dialogue acts and main events with their arguments in the corpus.",
        "added.",
        "The most important of them are \"object type\" (for participants) or \"event type\" (for events), which specify their ontological concepts.",
        "They may be réserver (reserve), hôtel (hotel), chambre (room), périodedetemps (time), ville (city), person, adulte (adult), enfant (child), localisationnommée (places), among others.",
        "There are more specific features, for instance, the journey dates, hotel features (e.g., name, standing, services, etc).",
        "Some of these features have predefined values, such as the gender of an object (either masculine or feminine).",
        "On the other side, features such as cardinality, have not predefined values, in that case, the annotator has to manually indicate the correct value.",
        "Obviously, the annotation task difficulty increases with the utterance's complexity.",
        "The representation is rather tedious to define in elliptical utterances, such as multiple reservations, in which implicit and explicit information must be taken under consideration.",
        "Furthermore, the MMIL formalism does not support the association of discontinuous segments to entities, generating some imprecisions in the HLS annotation.",
        "For instance, in je voudrais une chambre pour deux personnes euh simple (I would like a room for two people uh simple),\"une chambre\" (a room) and \"simple\" should be linked to an unique participant, having as object type (\"Room\") and as type of room \"simple\".",
        "However, given that the speaker has not mentioned \"simple\"right after \"chambre\", there is a new element imbricated between them: \"pour deux personnes\".",
        "As a result, the annotator must integrate the subsegment 'pour deux personnes\" in the \"Room\" participant.",
