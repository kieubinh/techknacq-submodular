        "In the past few years, there has been a surge of interests in utilizing text mining techniques to provide in-depth bio-related information services.",
        "With an increasing number of publications reporting on protein-protein interactions (PPIs), much effort has been made in extracting information from biomedical articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "Several shared tasks, such as LLL [7] and BioCreative [4], have been arranged for the BioNLP community to compare different methodologies for biomedical information extraction.",
        "Comparing to LLL and BioCreative which primarily focus on a simple representation of relations of biomolecules, i.e. protein-protein interaction, the BioNLP'09 Shared Task [5] involves the recognition of bio-molecular events in scientific abstracts, such as gene expression, transcription, protein catabolism, localization and binding, plus (positive or negative) regulation of proteins.",
        "The task concerns the detailed behavior of biomolecules, and can be used to support the development of biomedical-related databases.",
        "In the BioNLP'09 shared task evaluation, the system constructed by UTurku [2] achieved an F-score of 51.95% on the core task, the best results among all the participants.",
        "In this paper, we describe a system, called HVS-BioEvent, which employs the hidden vector state model (HVS) to automatically extract biomedical events from biomedical literature.",
        "The HVS model has been successfully employed to extract PPIs [9].",
        "However, it is not straightforward to extend the usage of the HVS model for biomedical events extraction.",
        "There are two main challenges.",
        "First, comparing to the trigger words used for PPIs which are often expressed as single words or at most two words, the trigger words for biomedical event are more complex.",
        "For example, controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, spanning over 6 words, is considered as the trigger word for the regulation event.",
        "In addition, the same word can be the trigger word for different types of biomedical events in different context.",
        "Second, biomedical events consist of both simple events and complex events.",
        "While simple events are more similar to PPIs which only involve binary or pairwise relations, complex events involve both nary (n > 2) and nested relations.",
        "For example, a regulation event may take another event as its theme or cause which represents a structurally more complex relation.",
        "Being able to handle both simple and complex events thus poses a huge challenge to the development of our HVS-BioEvent system.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the overall process of the HVS-BioEvent system, which consists of three steps, trigger words identification, semantic parsing based on the HVS model, and biomedical events extraction from the HVS parse results.",
        "Experimental results are discussed in section 3.",
        "Finally, section 4 concludes the paper."

        "We perform biomedical event extraction with the following steps.",
        "At the beginning, abstracts are retrieved from MEDLINE and split into sentences.",
        "Protein names, gene names, trigger words for biomedical events are then identified.",
        "After that, each sentence is parsed by the HVS semantic parser.",
        "Finally, biomedical events are extracted from the HVS parse results using a hybrid method based on rules and machine learning.",
        "All these steps process one sentence at a time.",
        "Since 95% of all annotated events are fully annotated within a single sentence, this does not incur a large performance penalty but greatly reduces the size and complexity of the problem.",
        "The remainder of the section will discuss each of the steps in details.",
        "Event trigger words are crucial to biomedical events extraction.",
        "In our system, we employ two approaches for event trigger words identification, one is a hybrid approach using both rules and a dictionary, the other treats trigger words identification as a sequence labeling problem and uses a Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) to detect trigger words.",
        "For the hybrid approach using both rules and a dictionary, firstly, we constructed a trigger dictionary from the original GENIA event corpus [6] by extracting the annotated trigger words.",
        "These trigger words were subsequently lemmatized and stemmed.",
        "However, the wide variety of potential lexicalized triggers for an event means that lots of triggers lack discriminative power relative to individual event types.",
        "For example, in certain context, through is the trigger word for the binding event type and are is the trigger word for localization.",
        "Such words are too common and cause potential ambiguities and therefore lead to many false positive events extracted.",
        "We could perform disambiguation by counting the co-occurrence of a event trigger and a particular event type from the training data and discard those event triggers whose co-occurrence counts are lower than certain threshold for that event type.",
        "After this filtering stage, still, there might be cases where one trigger might representing multiple event types, we thus define a set of rules to further process the trigger words matched from the constructed dictionary.",
        "In the second approach, we treat trigger words identification as a sequence labeling problem and train a first-order MEMM model [8] from the BioNLP'09 shared task training data.",
        "As in typical named entity recognition tasks, the training data are converted into BIO format where 'B' refers to the word which is the beginning word of an event trigger, T indicates the rest of the words (if the trigger contains more than one words) and 'O' refers to the other words which are not event triggers.",
        "The features used in the MEMM model was extracted from the surface string and the part-of-speech information of the words corresponding to (or adjacent to) the target BIO tags.",
        "The Hidden Vector State (HVS) model [3] is a discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in which each HMM state represents the state of a push-down automaton with a finite stack size.",
        "State transitions are factored into separate stack pop and push operations constrained to give a tractable search space.",
        "The sequence of HVS stack states corresponding to the given parse tree is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The result is a model which is complex enough to capture hierarchical structure but which can be trained automatically from only lightly annotated data.",
        "In the HVS-based semantic parser, conventional grammar rules are replaced by three probability tables.",
        "Let each state at time t be denoted by a vector of Dt semantic concept labels (tags) Ct = [ct[l],ct[2], ..ct[Dt\\] where ct[l] is the preterminal concept label and ct[Dt] is the root concept label (SS in Figure 3).",
        "Given a word sequence W, concept vector sequence C and a sequence of stack pop operations N, the joint probability of P(W, C, N) can be decomposed as",
        "Figure 1 : Example of a parse tree and its vector state equivalent.",
        "where rit is the vector stack shift operation and takes values in the range 0, • • • , Dt-\\, and Ct[l] = cWt is the new pre-terminal semantic label assigned to word Wt at word position t.",
        "Thus, the HVS model consists of three types of probabilistic move, each move being determined by a discrete probability table: (1) popping semantic labels off the stack - P(n\\c); (2) pushing a pre-terminal semantic label onto the stack - P(c[l]\\c[2 ■ ■ ■ D}); (3) generating the next word - P(w\\c).",
        "Each of these tables are estimated in training using an EM algorithm and then used to compute parse trees at runtime using Viterbi decoding.",
        "In training, each word string W is marked with the set of semantic concepts C that it contains.",
        "For example, the sentence IFN-alpha enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 contains the semantic concept/value pairs as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Its corresponding abstract semantic annotation is:",
        "Positive_regulation (Site (Phosphorylation (protein) ) )",
        "where brackets denote the hierarchical relations among semantic concepts.",
        "For each word Wk of a training sentence W, EM training uses the forward-backward algorithm to compute the probability of the model being in stack state c when Wk is processed.",
        "Without any constraints, the set of possible stack states would be intractably large.",
        "However, in the HVS model this problem can be avoided by pruning out all states which are inconsistent with the semantic concepts associated with W. The details of how this is done are given in [3].",
        "For the sentences in the BioNLP'09 shared task, only event information is provided.",
        "However, the abstract semantic annotation as shown above is required for training the HVS model.",
        "We propose Algorithm 1 to automatically convert the annotated event information into the abstract semantic annotations.",
        "An example of how the abstract annotations are generated is given as follows.",
        "Sentence: According to current models the inhibitory capacity of l(kappa)B(alpha) would be mediated through the retention of Rel/NF-kappaB proteins in the cytosol.",
        "Corresponding Events: E1 Negative_regulation: inhibitory .capacity Theme: l(kappa)B(alpha)",

        "Based on HVS parse results, it seems straightforward to extract the event information.",
        "However, after detailed investigation, we found that sentences having the same semantic tags might contain different events information.",
        "For example, the two sentences shown in Table 1 have the same semantic parsing results but with different event information.",
        "This problem can be solved by classification.",
        "For the semantic tags which can represent multiple event information, we considered each event information as a class and employed hidden Markov support vector machines (HM-SVMs) [1] for disambiguation among possible events.",
        "The features used in HM-SVMs are extracted from surface strings and part-of-speech information of the words corresponding to (or adjacent to) trigger words.",
