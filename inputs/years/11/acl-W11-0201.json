      "text": [
        "Insights about protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are vital to understand the biological processes within organisms.",
        "Accordingly, several databases, such as",
        "IntAct, DIP, or MINT, contain detailed information about PPIs.",
        "This information is often manually harvested from peer reviewed publications (Ceol et al., 2010).",
        "However, it is assumed that a high amount of PPIs is still hidden in publications.",
        "Therefore, the automated extraction of PPIs from text has attracted considerable attention from biology research.",
        "A number of different techniques have been proposed to solve the problem of extracting PPIs from natural language text.",
        "These can be roughly organized into one of three classes: co-occurrence, machine learning, and pattern matching (for a recent survey, see (Zhou and He, 2008)).",
        "The cooccurrence based approaches use only information on the coexistence of protein mentions in a given scope.",
        "They are easy to implement and allow for efficient processing of huge amounts of texts, but they are also prone to generate many false positives because they cannot distinguish positive from negative pairs.",
        "The second class is based on machine learning.",
        "Here, a statistical model is learned from a set of positive and negative examples and then applied to unseen texts.",
        "In general, machine learning-based methods to relation extraction perform very well for any task where sufficient, representative and high quality training data is available (Kazama et al., 2002).",
        "This need for training data is their major drawback, as annotated texts are, especially in the Life Sciences, rather costly to produce.",
        "Furthermore, they are prone to over-fit to the training corpus, which renders evaluation results less inferable to real applications.",
        "A third class of methods is based on pattern matching.",
        "Such methods work with patterns constructed from linguistically annotated text, which are matched against unseen text to detect relationships.",
        "Patterns can either be inferred from examples (Hakenberg et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010) or can be defined manually (Fundel et al., 2007).",
        "Systems based on manually defined patterns typically use few patterns, leading to high precision but low recall (Blaschke et al., 2002).",
        "In contrast, systems that learn patterns automatically often produce more patterns and exhibit a better recall, at the cost of a decrease in precision.",
        "To circumvent this penalty, several works have tried to improve patterns.",
        "E.g., SPIES (Hao et al., 2005) filters patterns using the minimum description length (MDL) method which improves its F1 by 6.72%.",
        "Another classification of PPI extraction methods is based on the sentence representation that is applied.",
        "The simplest such representation is the bag of words (BoW) that occur in the sentence; more complex representations are constituent trees, capturing the syntactic structure of the sentence, and dependency trees (DTs), which represent the main grammatical entities and their relationships to each other.",
        "PPI extraction methods use various sentence representation, e.g., are based only on BoW (Bunescu and Mooney, 2006; Giuliano et al., 2006), use only DTs (Erkan et al., 2007), or combine representations (Airola et al., 2008; Miwa et al., 2008).",
        "In the last years, dependency trees have become the most popular representation for relation extraction.",
        "DTs characterize, via their dependency links, grammatical relationships among words.",
        "They are particularly favored by kernel-based learning approaches, see e.g. (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; 2008; Kim et al., 2010) but also graph matching approaches using DTs have been proposed (Liu et al., 2010).",
        "However, these methods do not further utilize the grammatical information encoded in the dependency types (edge labels).",
        "Recently proposed methods like (Buyko et al., 2009; Rinaldi et al., 2010) modify the DTs by e.g. trimming irrelevant dependencies.",
        "In contrast to these approaches, our method exploits the dependency types of DTs and performs basic transformations on DTs; we use Stanford dependencies, which are presumably the most often used DT representation in PPI extraction.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We describe our novel method for extracting PPIs from text that is based on pattern matching in dependency graphs.",
        "We evaluate our method against benchmark PPI corpora, and discuss results with a focus on dependency type information based methods."

      "text": [
        "Our approach consists of a series of steps: First, we extract sentences from Medline and PMC open access that contain pairs of genes/proteins known to interact.",
        "Second, we convert each of those sentences into DTs and derive putative tree patterns for each pair.",
        "Having a set of such patterns, we apply a number of generalization methods to improve recall and filtering methods to improve precision.",
        "We discern between methods that are purely heuristic (termed shallow) and steps that incorporate dependency type information (termed grammatical).",
        "To predict PPIs in unseen text, the resulting patterns are matched against the corresponding DTs.",
        "We apply the method described in (Hakenberg et al., 2006) to extract a set of sentences from Medline and PMC potentially describing protein interactions.",
        "Essentially, this method takes a database of PPIs (here IntAct; (Aranda et al., 2010)) and searches all sentences in Medline and PMC containing any of those pairs.",
        "Proteins were tagged and normalized using GNAT (Hakenberg et al., 2008).",
        "To avoid a possible bias, articles contained in any of the five evaluation corpora are excluded.",
        "This resulted in 763,027 interacting protein pairs.",
        "For each protein pair we generate a new sentence and apply entity blinding, meaning that named entities are replaced by placeholders to avoid systemic bias.",
        "Specifically, the mentions of the two proteins known to interact are replaced by the placeholder ENTITYJi and any additional proteins in the same sentence are replaced by ENTITY Ji.",
        "Tokens are tagged with their part-of-speech (POS) using Med-Post (Smith et al., 2004), which is specifically optimized for biomedical articles.",
        "Constituent parse trees are generated using the Bikel parser (Bikel, 2002) and converted to DTs by the Stanford converter (De Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "In a DT, the shortest path between two tokens is often assumed to contain the most valuable information about their mutual relationship.",
        "Therefore, we generate a pattern from each DT by extracting the shortest, undirected path between the two occurrences of ENTITY Ji.",
        "The set of initial patterns is denoted by SIP.",
        "We employ several methods to improve the quality of this initial set of patterns.",
        "We systematically evaluated possible constellations and identified those that help in improving performance of PPI extraction.",
        "The modifications are of two kinds.",
        "Pattern generalizers are intended to elevate recall, whereas pattern filters should raise precision.",
        "We present two types of methods: Shallow methods are simple heuristics whereas grammatical methods are rules that exploit the information in dependency types.",
        "We use a strict graph matching approach for pattern matching.",
        "We consider a pattern to match a subgraph of a DT iff all their nodes and edges match exactly, including edge labels and edge directions.",
        "It is a common practice in NLP to apply some preprocessing on patterns to reduce corpus-specificity.",
        "In particular, we perform stemming (GST), removal of common protein name prefixes and suffixes (Gpn), and replacement of interaction phrases by single words (GIW).",
        "We summarize these steps as shallow generalization steps.",
        "We only describe the latter two (GPN, GIW) in more detail.",
        "Protein names are often modified by suffixes like -kinase, receptor or -HeLa or by prefixes like phospho- or anti-.",
        "These affixes are usually not covered by entity blinding as the entity recognition method does not consider them as part of the protein name.",
        "As such affixes are not relevant for relation extraction but do interfere with our exact graph matching approach, we apply the GPN heuristic to remove them.",
        "Interactions between proteins can be expressed very diversely in natural language.",
        "In almost all cases there is at least one word that specifies the interaction semantically, called the interaction word; this is often a verb, such as \"binds\" or \"phospho-rylates\", but can as well be a noun, such as \"[induced] phosphorylation\", or an adjective, such as \"binding\".",
        "The GIW heuristic generalizes patterns by substituting all contained interaction words with generic placeholders.",
        "We assembled a list of 851 interaction words (including inflection variants) based on (Temkin and Gilder, 2003; Hakenberg et al., 2006) that was further enriched manually.",
        "Based on their POS-tags, interaction words are assigned to one of the three placeholders IVERB, INOUN, IAD-JECTIVE.",
        "We also experimented with a single interaction word placeholder, IWORD, handling the case of incorrect POS-tags.",
        "Unifying dependency types (GUD): The Stanford typed dependency format contains 55 grammatical relations organized in a generalization hierarchy.",
        "Therefore, it is a natural idea to treat similar (e.g., sibling) dependency types equally by replacing them with their common parent type.",
        "We manually evaluated all dependency types to assess whether such replacements are viable.",
        "The final list of replacements is listed in Table 1.",
        "Note that we used the so-called collapsed representation of dependency types of the Stanford scheme.",
        "This means that prepositional and conjunctive dependencies are collapsed to form a single direct dependency between content words, and the type of this dependency is suffixed with the removed word.",
        "In the GUDgeneralizer, these dependency subtypes are substituted by their ancestors (e.g., prep, conj).",
        "Table 1: Unification of specific dependency types to a single common type by the generalizer GUD.",
        "Note that agent is merged with dependency type prep as it is inferred for the preposition \"by\".",
        "Collapsing dependency links (GCD): In addition to the collapsing performed by Stanford converter, we remove edges that likely are irrelevant for PPIs.",
        "We focused on removing the dependencies nn (noun compound modifier) and appos (ap-positional modifier).",
        "These grammatical constructions have the same syntactic role but they carry somewhat different meaning.",
        "They function as noun phrase modifiers and often specify the subtype of an entity, which is irrelevant for our task.",
        "As these two dependency types convey no information about the interaction itself, the dependency itself and the corresponding noun can be removed, as long as the noun is not an entity itself.",
        "As an example, this generalizer is applied on the dependency parse tree of the sentence \"ENTITYJA protein recognized antibody (ENTITYJA)\" shown on Figure 1a.",

      "text": [
        "We presented a pattern-based approach to extract protein-protein interactions from text.",
        "Our main contribution in this paper was a systematic study on the usage of dependency types within this approach.",
        "We showed that using such knowledge, F1 on average improves by 9.4 percentage points (pp) (27.8 % to 37.2 %) as measured on the five benchmark PPI corpora.",
        "Apart from this result, we note that our method also has a number advantageous features: First, patterns are learned from co-mentions of pairs of proteins known to interact, and hence no annotated corpus is necessary.",
        "This does not only make an application of the method for new tasks easier and cheaper, but also prevents over-fitting to a training corpus.",
        "Note, that as shown recently by (Airola et al., 2008; Tikk et al., 2010), essentially all state-of-the-art machine learning methods show large performance differences depending on whether or not the evaluation and training examples are drawn from the same corpus.",
        "In particular, cross-validation results of those are consistently more optimistic than the more realistic cross-learning results.",
        "In contrast, a pattern-based approach like ours is not prone to over-fitting.",
        "Furthermore, debugging our method is rather simple.",
        "Unlike when using a black-box machine learning method, whenever a false positive match is found, one can pinpoint the specific pattern producing it and take action.",
        "The work most closely related to ours is RelEx (Fundel et al., 2007).",
        "RelEx uses a small set of fixed rules to extract directed PPIs from dependency trees.",
        "Some of these rules also take advantage of dependency types, for instance, to properly treat enumerations.",
        "A reimplementation of RelEx (Pyysalo et al., 2008) was recently evaluated on the same corpora we used (see Table 7) and was found to be on par with other systems, though some of its measures were considerably worse than those reported in the original publication.",
        "Compared to our approach, RelEx is similar in that it performs pattern matching on DTs using information encoded in dependency types, however, there are some notable differences: First, RelEx rules were defined manually and are highly specific to protein-protein interactions.",
        "It is not clear how these could be adapted to other applications; in contrast, we described a general method that performs pattern learning from automatically generated examples.",
        "Second, it is not clear how RelEx results could be further improved except by trial-and-error with more rules.",
        "In contrast, our pattern learning method offers a natural way of improvement by simply increasing the number of examples and hence the number of patterns.",
        "We compared the results of our approach using an increasingly larger pattern set and observed a continuous increase in F1, due to a continuous improvement in recall.",
        "Consequently, using more PPI databases would likely produce better results.",
        "Third, our generalization methods can be seen as graph rewriting rules.",
        "The result of applying them to a DT is, again, a DT; thus, they can easily be used as preprocessing coupled with other PPI extraction methods (a direction we are currently exploring).",
        "In contrast, RelEx matches patterns against DTs, but cannot be used to transform DTs.",
        "In the following, we discuss the impact of the refinement methods individually and provide a brief error analysis based on a random sample of false negative pairs and a random sample of low precision patterns.",
        "We also compare our best results with those of several state-of-the-art methods.",
        "As can be seen in Table 3, all of the generalizers increased recall and even provide minor improvement in precision.",
        "For the combination of all five generalizers (Sgeneralizers), an overall increase of 34.2 pp in recall and 5 pp in precision was observed.",
        "From the shallow generalizers, merging interaction phrases (GIW) was proven to be the most effective, accounting for an increase of 10.5 pp in recall and 3 pp in precision.",
        "As shown in Table 4, the general variant, which merges all interaction phrases to a common word, is slightly superior to the variant in which interaction words are merged class-wise.",
        "For the grammar-based generalizer unifying dependency types (GUD), each of the different variants was evaluated separately (see Table 5).",
        "The combination of the all different variants leads to an increase of 3.5 pp in recall.",
        "As shown in Table 6, collapsing the dependency types nn and appos (GCD) also provides the highest improvement when applied in combination.",
        "In contrast to generalizers that alter patterns, constraints remove patterns from the pattern set.",
        "As shown in Table 3, application of all constraints",
        "Table 5: Dependency type aggregations used in generalizer Gud.",
        "sopn combines the dependency aggregations for subj, obj, prep, and nn.",
        "(Sconstraints) leads to an increase in precision of 45.1 pp at the cost of 22.1 pp reduced recall.",
        "The shallow constraint that disallows patterns with negation words (Cnw) has comparably little impact and removes only 5 % of the patterns.",
        "In contrast, the interaction word constraint (CIW) is less conservative and removes more than 32.6 % of the patterns, trading off an increase of 19.3 pp in precision to a decrease of 17.6 pp in recall.",
        "Among the grammar-based constraints, the dependency combination constraint Cdc is superseded by the syntax filter constraint (CSF) that removes 12 % of the patterns and increases precision about 5 pp while recall drops by only 2.2 pp.",
        "Note that CSFis the only constraint substantially increasing F1.",
        "As seen in Table 3, combinations of generalizers and constraints yield almost fully additive improvements.",
        "The combination of all shallow refinements only (Sshallow) leads to an increase of 7.7 pp in F1, whereas with the addition of our grammar-based refinements (Sall) a total increase of 17.2 pp in F1 is achieved.",
        "We justify that the inclusion of dependency type information adds a source of knowledge that further improves on conventional methods such as stemming or negation filtering.",
        "We compare the results of our best setting (Sall) with the results of the recently published analysis of nine state-of-the-art machine learning methods for PPI extraction (Tikk et al., 2010).",
        "For these methods, a cross-learning evaluation by training each kernel on the ensemble of four corpora and evaluating it on the fifth has been performed.",
        "Detailed results are given in Table 7.",
        "In terms of F1 we achieve on Biolnfer, the corpus with most protein pairs, the second-best result.",
        "On IEPA and LLL we achieve midrange results and on AIMed and HPRD50 we yield results below average.",
        "Overfitting remains a severe problem in ML based methods as these results are inferior to those measured in cross-validation (Tikk et al., 2010), though there are suggestions to overcome this issue even in a ML setting (Miwa et al., 2009).",
        "We randomly picked 30 gold standard sentences (all corpora) containing false negatives pairs and investigated all 72 false negative pairs included therein.",
        "For 29 positive pairs, possibly matching pattern were removed by Cdc, as the corresponding dependency combination was not covered in our rule set.",
        "Further 16 graphs passed the filtering, but our set of sentences contained no adequate pattern.",
