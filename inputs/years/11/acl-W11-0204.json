        "In a final step, these links can be used to generalize the text mining events to their homology-based variants (Section 3.3).",
        "The entity occurrences predicted by BANNER (Section 2.1) follow the guidelines of GENETAG (Tan-abe et al., 2005), the corpus it was trained on.",
        "These guidelines allow not only gene and gene products, but also related entities such as protein complexes and gene promoters.",
        "Furthermore, BANNER frequently tags noun phrases such as human Esr-1 gene rather than only the minimal symbol Esr-1.",
        "To enable integration of text mining predictions with external databases, it is necessary to refine the entity occurrences to canonical forms that can be linked to gene records such as those in Entrez Gene.",
        "To this end, common prefixes and suffixes such as gene and wild-type should be removed.",
        "In a first step towards canonicalization of the entities, a mapping table was assembled containing common contexts in which a gene symbol appears and where the full noun phrase can be reduced to that embedded symbol for the sake of information retrieval (Table 1).",
        "This mapping table was created by matching a list of candidate minimal gene symbols to the extracted BANNER entities.",
        "To define the list of candidate minimal gene symbols, two approaches have been combined.",
        "First, a set of around 15,000 likely gene symbols is extracted by looking for single token strings that were tagged by BANNER at least 50% of the times they occur in a PubMed abstract.",
        "Secondly, all official gene names are extracted from Entrez Gene.",
        "As this latter list also contains common English words such as was and protein, we have only selected those that were likely to be standalone gene symbols.",
        "We calculate this likelihood by Cs/(Cs + Cn) where Cs GGP contexts",
        "-ORG- -GGP - gene -GGP- sequences mutant -GGP- proteins -GGP- homologs cytoplasmic wild-type -GGP-",

        "is the number of times a string is tagged standalone and Cn is the number of times the string occurs in PubMed but is not tagged (neither as standalone, nor as part of a larger entity).",
        "This likelihood represents the proportion of standalone occurrences of the string that are tagged.",
        "We experimentally set a threshold on this value to be higher than 0.01, excluding a list of 2,865 common English words.",
        "Subsequently, all BANNER entity occurrences are screened and likely minimal gene symbols substituted with -GGP-, resulting in generalized contexts.",
        "Then, we have matched these contexts with an extensive list of organism names from the Linneaus distribution (Gerner et al., 2010) and a small collection of miscellaneous non-formal organism terms (e.g. monkey), replacing all known organisms with an -ORG- placeholder.",
        "Finally, we have excluded all contexts where the embedded GGP is likely to be functionally too far removed from the embedding noun phrase (e.g. \"-GGP- inhibitor\"), relying on a corpus defining and categorizing such relationships (Ohta et al., 2009).",
        "Some of the contexts that were retained after this step, such as \"-GGP-mutant\" or \"-GGP- promoter\" still refer to entities that are distinctly different from the embedded GGP.",
        "These results are considered valid, as the goal of the affix stripping algorithm is to increase recall and offer explorative results involving various types of information on gene symbols.",
        "The final list of contexts, generalized with -GGP-and -ORG- placeholders, is split into two separate lists of prefixes and suffixes, ranked by frequency.",
        "Also, numerical affixes as well as those shorter than 3 characters are discarded from these lists.",

        "We evaluate its impact using manually tagged entities from the publicly available BioNLP'09 Shared Task (ST) training set, which specifically aims at identifying entities that are likely to match gene and protein symbol databases (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "Further, the ST set comprises of PubMed abstracts and its underlying text is thus covered in our data.",

        "The affix stripping results in a notable gain in both precision and recall.",
        "In particular, the nearly 15pp gain on recall clearly demonstrates that the affix stripping results in entity strings more likely to match existing resources.",
        "Second, the effect of affix stripping is evaluated on the subset of entity strings that can be uniquely mapped into Ensembl and HomoloGene (77.3% and 75.5% of the ST entity strings, respectively).",
        "This subset is of particular interest, since the generalized events are built on top of the entities that can be found in these resources and any gain on this particular subset is thus likely to be beneficial for the overall quality of the generalized events.",

        "However, this more coarse-grained Ensembl family contains all genes from the two closely related subgroups Estrogen receptor and Estrogen related receptor, both belonging to the Estrogen Receptor-like group of the superfamily of nuclear receptors (Zhang et al., 2004).",
        "On top of the synonyms mentioned previously, this family thus also includes erb, esr2b, errbetagamma and similartoesrrbpro-tein.",
        "By using this list for query expansion, more general text mining predictions can be retrieved.",
        "It is to be noted that both homology-based approaches will also include events mentioning Esr-1 as the abbreviation for Enhancer of shoot regeneration.",
        "While this usage is much less common, it will result in a few false positive hits.",
        "These false positives may be prevented by taking into account local context such as organism mentions, as the Enhancer of shoot regeneration gene is only present in A. thaliana.",
        "We believe our current homology-based approach could be integrated with existing or future normalization algorithms (Krallinger and Hirschman, 2007; Wermter et al., 2009) to provide such fine-grained resolution.",
        "This is regarded as interesting future work.",
        "Consider a newly annotated, protein-coding gene for which no database information currently exists.",
        "To generate homology-based text mining hypotheses, the orthologs of this gene first have to be defined by assessing sequence similarity through",
        "BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997).",
        "Imagine for example a newly sequenced genome X for which a gene similar to the mouse gene Esr-1 is identified.",
        "This gene will soon be known as \"genome X Esr-1\" and thus related to the Esr-1 gene family.",
        "As described in Section 4.3.1, homologybased query expansion can then be used to retrieve all events involving lexical variants and synonyms of the canonical string esr1."

        "We present a large-scale resource for research and application of text mining from biomedical literature.",
        "The resource is obtained by integrating text mining predictions in the dataset of Bjorne et al.",
        "(2010) with public databases of gene symbols and gene families: Entrez Gene, Ensembl, and Homolo-Gene.",
        "The integration is performed on the level of gene families, allowing for a number of novel use cases for both text mining and exploratory analysis of the biological statements in PubMed literature.",
        "To achieve the linking between text-based event predictions and gene databases, several algorithms are introduced to solve the problems involved.",
        "First, we propose an algorithm for stripping affixes in entity occurrences tagged by the BANNER named entity recognizer, addressing the problem of such entities often including wider context which prevents direct matching against gene symbol databases.",
        "Using the BioNLP'09 Shared Task data as gold standard, we show that the algorithm substantially increases both precision and recall of the resulting canonical entities, the gain in recall being particularly pronounced.",
        "Second, we propose an algorithm which assigns to the vast majority of gene symbols found in Ho-moloGene and Ensembl a single unique gene family, resolving the present intra-organism ambiguity based on symbol occurrence statistics and symbol type information.",
        "Matching these disambiguated symbols with the affix-stripped canonical forms of entity occurrences, we were able to assign a unique gene family from either HomoloGene or Ensembl to nearly 60% of all entities in the text, thus linking the text-bound predictions with gene databases.",
        "Finally, we use the resolution of entity occurrences to unique gene families to generalize the events in the text mining data, aggregating together event occurrences whose arguments are equivalent with respect to their gene family.",
        "Depending on whether HomoloGene or Ensembl is used for the gene family definition, this generalization process results in 500K-600K generalized events, which together aggregate over 11.2M (58.4%) of all event occurrences in the text mining data.",
        "Being able to link the literature-based events with well-defined gene families opens a number of interesting new use-cases for biomedical text mining, such as the ability to use the homology information to search for events relevant to newly discovered sequences.",
        "The remaining 41.6% of event occurrences not generalizable to gene families can still be retrieved through an additional generalization on the level of entity canonical forms.",
        "All relevant data, namely all original events and entities together with their canonical forms, the generalizations of events based on canonical entity forms and gene families, as well as the gene symbol to unique family mapping are made publicly available as records in a MySQL database.",
        "We also provide detailed online documentation of the database scheme and example queries.",
        "Finally, we release the affix lists used in the canonicalization algorithm.",
        "We believe this resource to be very valuable for explorative analysis of text mining results and homology-based hypothesis generation, as well as for supporting future research on data integration and biomedical text mining.",
        "One important future work direction is a further disambiguation of canonical gene symbols to unique gene identifiers rather than entire gene families, which would allow for more fine-grained event generalization.",
        "There is an ongoing active, community-wide research focusing on this challenge and the current resource could be integrated as an additional source of information.",
        "Another future work direction is to create a visualization method and a web interface which would allow simple, user-friendly access to the data for researchers outside of the BioNLP research community itself."
