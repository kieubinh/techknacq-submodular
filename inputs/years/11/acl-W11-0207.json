        "Medical Entity Recognition (MER) consists in two main steps: (i) detection and delimitation of phrasal information referring to medical entities in textual corpora (e.g. pyogenic liver abscess, infection of biliary system) and (ii) identification of the semantic category of located entities (e.g. Medical Problem, Test).",
        "Example 1 shows the result of MER on a sentence where the located entity and its category are marked with treatment and problem tags.",
        "(1) <treatment> Adrenal-sparing surgery </treatment> is safe and effective, and may become the treatment ofchoice in patients with <problem> hereditary phaeochromocytoma </problem>.",
        "This task is very important for many applications such as Question-Answering where MER is used in the question analysis step (to determine the expected answers' type, the question focus, etc.)",
        "and in the offline text tagging or annotation.",
        "One of the most important obstacles to identifying medical entities is the high terminological variation in the medical domain (e.g. Diabetes melli-tus type 1, Type 1 diabetes, IDDM, or juvenile diabetes all express the same concept).",
        "Other aspects also have incidence on MER processes such as the evolution of entity naming (e.g. new abbreviations, names for new drugs or diseases).",
        "These obstacles limit the scalability of methods relying on dictionaries and/or gazetteers.",
        "Thus, it is often the case that other types of approaches are developed by exploiting not only domain knowledge but also domain-independent techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing tools.",
        "In this paper, we study MER with three different methods: (i) a semantic method relying on MetaMap (Aronson, 2001) (a state-of-the-art tool for MER) (ii) chunker-based noun phrase extraction and SVM classification and (iii) a last method using supervised learning with Conditional Random Fields (CRF), which is then combined with the semantic method.",
        "With these methods we particularly study two processing directions: (i) pre-extraction of noun phrases with specialized tools, followed by a medical classification step and (ii) exploitation of machine-learning techniques to detect simultaneously entity boundaries and their categories.",
        "We also present a comparative study of the performance of different noun phrase chunkers on medical texts: Treetagger-chunker, OpenNLP and MetaMap.",
        "The best chunker was then used to feed some of the proposed MER approaches.",
        "All three methods were experimented on the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge corpus of clinical texts (Uzuner, 2010).",
        "Our study shows that hybrid methods achieve the best performance w.r.t machine learning approaches or domain knowledge-based approaches if applied separately.",
        "After a review of related work (Section 2), we describe the chunker comparison and the three MER methods (Section 3).",
        "We present experiments on clinical texts (Section 4), followed by a discussion and variant experiments on literature abstracts (Section 5), then conclude and draw some perspectives for further work (Section 6)."

        "The system exploits the MEDLINE database and the UMLS.",
        "Protein name extraction has also been studied through several approaches (e.g. (Liang and Shih, 2005; Wang, 2007)).",
        "(Embarek and Ferret, 2008) proposed an approach relying on linguistic patterns and canonical entities for the extraction of medical entities belonging to five categories: Disease, Treatment, Drug, Test, and Symptom.",
        "Another kind of approach uses domain-specific tools such as MetaMap (Aronson, 2001).",
        "MetaMap recognizes and categorizes medical terms by associating them to concepts and semantic types of the UMLS Metathesaurus and Semantic Network.",
        "(Shadow and MacDonald, 2003) presented an approach based on MetaMap for the extraction of medical entities of 20 medical classes from pathologist reports.",
        "(Meystre and Haug, 2005) obtained 89.9% recall and 75.5% precision for the extraction of medical problems with an approach based on MetaMap Transfer (MMTx) and the NegEx negation detection algorithm.",
        "In contrast with semantic approaches which require rich domain-knowledge for rule or pattern construction, statistical approaches are more scalable.",
        "Several approaches used classifiers such as decision trees or SVMs (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).",
        "Markov models-based methods are also frequently used (e.g. Hidden Markov Models, or CRFs (He and Kayaalp, 2008)).",
        "However, the performance achieved by such supervised algorithms depends on the availability of a well-annotated training corpus and on the selection of a relevant feature set.",
        "Hybrid approaches aim to combine the advantages of semantic and statistical approaches and to bypass some of their weaknesses (e.g. scalability of rule-based approaches, performance of statistical methods with small training corpora).",

        "Named entity recognition from medical texts involves two main tasks: (i) identification of entity boundaries in the sentences and (ii) entity categorization.",
        "We address these tasks through three main approaches which are listed in Table 1.",
        "Although noun phrase segmentation is an important task for MER, few comparative studies on available tools have been published.",
        "A recent study (Kang et al., 2010), which claims to be the first to do such comparative experiments, tested six state-of-the-art chunkers on a biomedical corpus: GATE chunker, Genia Tagger, Lingpipe, MetaMap, OpenNLP, and Yamcha.",
        "This study encompassed sentence splitting, tokenization and part-of-speech tagging and showed that for both noun-phrase chunking and verb-phrase chunking, OpenNLP performed best (F-scores 89.7% and 95.7%, respectively), but differences with Genia Tagger and Yamcha were small.",
        "With a similar objective, we compared the performance of three different noun-phrase chunkers in the medical domain: (i) Treetagger-chunker, a state-of-the-art open-domain tool, (ii) OpenNLP and (iii)",
        "MetaMap.",
        "Regardless of the differences in corpora with (Kang et al., 2010) we chose these particular tools to compare medical-domain specific tools with open domain tools and to highlight the lower performance of MetaMap for noun-phrase chunking compared to other tools.",
        "This last point led us to introduce the MetaMap+ approach for MER (Ben Abacha and Zweigenbaum, 2011) in order to take advantage of MetaMap's domain-knowledge approach while increasing performance by relying on external tools for noun-phrase chunking.",
        "We evaluate these tools on the subset of noun phrases referring to medical entities in our corpora (cf.",
        "Section 4.1 for a description of the i2b2 corpus and Section 5 for the Berkeley corpus).",
        "We consider that a noun phrase is correctly extracted if it corresponds exactly to an annotated medical entity from the reference corpora.",
        "Also, as our corpora are not fully annotated (only entities of the targeted types are annotated), we do not evaluate \"extra noun-phrases\" corresponding to non-annotated entities.",
        "The retrieved noun phrases are heterogeneous: many of them are not all relevant to the medical field and therefore not relevant to the MER task.",
        "Our goal is to obtain the maximal number of correct noun phrases and leave it to the next step to filter out those that are irrelevant.",
        "We therefore wish to maximize recall at this stage.",
        "Table 2 shows that in this framework, Treetagger-chunker obtains the best recall.",
        "We thus used it for noun-phrase segmentation in the experimented MER approaches (cf.",
        "Sections 3.2 and 3.3).",
        "MetaMap is a reference tool which uses the UMLS to map noun phrases in raw texts to the best matching UMLS concepts according to matching scores.",
        "MetaMap leads however to some residual problems, which we can arrange into three classes: (i) noun phrase chunking is not at the same level of performance as some specialized NLP tools, (ii) medical entity detection often retrieves general words and verbs which are not medical entities and (iii) some ambiguity is left in entity categorization since MetaMap can provide several concepts for the same term as well as several semantic types for the same concept.",

        "Section 4 presented experiments in MER on English clinical texts.",
        "To have a complementary view on the performance of our methods, we performed additional experiments on the Berkeley corpus (Rosario and Hearst, 2004) of scientific literature abstracts and titles extracted from MEDLINE.",
        "The original aim of this corpus was to study the extraction of semantic relationships between problems and treatments (e.g. cures, prevents, and side effect).",
        "In our context, we only use its annotation of medical entities.",
        "The corpus contains two categories of medical entities: problems (1,660 entities) and treatments (1,179 entities) in 3,654 sentences (74,754 words) with a mean of 20.05 words per sentence.",
        "We divided the corpus into 1,462 sentences for training and 2,193 for testing.",
        "We tested the MetaMap (MM), MetaMap+ (MM+) and BIO-CRF methods on the Berkeley corpus.",
        "Table 6 presents the results.",
        "BIO-CRF again obtain the best results, but it is not much better than MM+ in this case.",
        "We constructed three different models for the BIO-CRF method: a first model constructed from the Berkeley training corpus, a second model constructed from the i2b2 corpus and a third model constructed from a combination of the former two.",
        "We obtained the best results with the last model: F=34.37% (F=22.97% for the first model and F=30.08% for the second model).",
        "These results were obtained with a feature set with which we obtained 76.17% F-measure on the i2b2 corpus (i.e. words, lemmas, morphosyntactic categories, orthographic features, suffixes and prefixes, cf. set A4 in",
        "Table 7).",
        "The results obtained on the two corpora are not on the same scale of performance.",
        "This is mainly due to the characteristics of each corpus.",
        "For instance, the i2b2 2010 corpus has an average words-per-sentence ratio of 8.7 while the Berkeley corpus has a ratio of 20.45 words per sentence.",
        "Besides, the i2b2 corpus uses a quite specific vocabulary such as conventional abbreviations of medical terms (e.g. k/p for kidney pancreas and d&c for dilation and curettage) and abbreviations of domain-independent words (e.g. w/o for without and y/o for year old).",
        "However, according to our observations, the most important characteristic which may explain these results may be the quality of annotation.",
        "The i2b2 corpus was annotated according to well-specified criteria to be relevant for the challenge, while the Berkeley corpus was annotated with different rules and less control measures.",
        "We evaluated a random sample of 200 annotated medical entities in the Berkeley corpus, using the i2b2 annotation criteria, and found that 20% did not adhere to these criteria.",
        "The semantic methods have the advantage of being reproducible on all types of corpora without a preprocessing or learning step.",
        "However, their dependency to knowledge reduces their performance w.r.t.",
        "machine learning approaches.",
        "Also the development of their knowledge bases is a relatively slow process if we compare it with the time which is necessary for machine learning approaches to build new extraction and categorization models.",
        "On the other hand, a clear advantage of semantic approaches is that they facilitate semantic access to the extracted information through conventional semantics (e.g. the UMLS Semantic Network).",
        "In our experiments we did not obtain good results when applying MetaMap alone.",
        "This is mainly due to the detection of entity boundaries (e.g. \"no pericardial effusion. \"",
        "instead of \"pericardial effusion\" and \"( Warfarin\" instead of \"Warfarin\").",
        "We were able to enhance the overall performance of MetaMap for this task by applying several input and output filtering primitives, among which the use of an external chunker to obtain the noun phrases.",
        "Our observation is that the final results are limited by chunker performance.",
        "Nevertheless, the approach provided the correct categories for 52.28% correctly extracted entities while the total ratio of the retrieved entities with correct boundaries is 60.76%.",

        "The same effect was observed by using the UMLS semantic type instead of the final category for each word, with an F-measure decrease from 76.17% to 73.55%.",
        "This can be explained by a reduction in feature value space size (22 UMLS types instead of 3 final categories) but also by the reduced performance of MetaMap if it is applied at the word level.",
        "The best solution was obtained by transforming the output of the MM+ approach into BIO format tags and feeding them to the learning process as features for each word.",
        "Thus, each word in an entity tagged by MM+ has an input feature value corresponding to one of the following: B-problem, I-problem, B-treatment, I-treatment, B-test and I-test.",
        "Words outside entities tagged by MM+ received an 'O' feature value.",
        "With these semantic features we were able to increase the F-measure from 76.19% to 77.55%.",

        "We presented and compared three different approaches to MER.",
