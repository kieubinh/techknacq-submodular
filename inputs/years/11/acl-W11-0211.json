        "Annotated corpora are knowledge resources indispensable to the design, testing and evaluation of language tools.",
        "Medical language differs significantly from the everyday language used in newspapers, magazines or fiction.",
        "Therefore, general language corpora are insufficient when creating tools for (bio)medical text processing.",
        "There are several biomedical corpora available for English such as GENIA (Kim et al., 2010) – the best known and most used one, containing MED-LINE abstracts annotated on several levels; BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007) targeted at protein, gene, and RNA relationships annotation; or CLEF (Roberts et al., 2009) containing 20,000 cancer patient records annotated with clinical relations.",
        "Medical corpora are also collected for lesser spoken languages, e.g. MEDLEX – Swedish medical corpus (Kokkinakis, 2006); IATROLEXI project for Greek (Tsalidis et al., 2007); or Norwegian corpus of patients' histories (R0st et al., 2008).",
        "The paper (Cohen et al., 2005) contains a survey of 6 biomedical corpora.",
        "The authors emphasize the importance of a standard format and give guidelines for careful annotation and evaluation of corpora.",
        "The immediate goal of the paper is to establish and test a method of annotating Polish clinical data with low level linguistic information, i.e. token and morpheme descriptions.",
        "The research is done on a relatively small set of data (more than 450,000 tokens) but to gain the experience necessary to create a much larger annotated corpus of Polish medical texts.",
        "We would like to use our corpus to refine and test domain tools for: tagging, Named Entity Recognition or annotation of nominal phrases.",
        "We have already annotated the corpus with semantic information (Marciniak and Mykowiecka, 2011) using an existing rule based extraction system (Mykowiecka et al., 2009) and performed experiments with machine learning approaches to semantic labeling (Mykowiecka and Marciniak, 2011).",
        "Thus, to enable the realization of various scientific goals, a detailed and universal morphologic annotation of the corpus was introduced.",
        "The division into tokens is the first level of text analysis.",
        "It is frequently performed without paying special attention to potential problems, just by dividing text on spaces, line breaks and punctuation marks.",
        "In many applications this is quite a satisfactory solution, but in case of texts that contain a lot of non-letter characters, using universal tokenization rules frequently causes problems.",
        "Some examples, in the case of using the Penn Treebank tok-enization scheme in annotating the GENIA corpus were pointed out in (Teteisi and Tsujii, 2006).",
        "Jiang and Zhai (2007) show the importance of tokenization strategies in the biomedical domain, and the influence of this process on the results of information retrieval.",
        "Our approach consists of dividing text into simple tokens which can be grouped at subsequent levels of analysis using domain specific knowledge.",
        "For languages with rich inflection, like Polish, morphological annotation is indispensable for further text analysis.",
        "As there are no Polish taggers which can analyze medical texts, nor medical lexicons containing inflected forms, we combine a general purpose tagger with a set of domain specific rules referring to a small data induced vocabulary.",
        "A portion of the automatically annotated data was checked by two linguists to assess data quality.",
        "The results obtained are given in 8.",

        "These documents are summaries of hospital treatment and are originally written in MS Word with spelling correction turned on, so the errors observed are mainly in words that are not included in the dictionary.",
        "The documents are converted into plain text files to facilitate their linguistic analysis and corpus construction.",
        "Clinical data include information serving identification purposes (names and addresses) which are substituted by symbolic codes before making the documents accessible for further analysis.",
        "The annonymization task was performed in order to make the data available for scientific purposes.",
        "We plan to inspect the data manually, to remove all indirect information enabling a patient's identification, and negotiate the terms for making the corpus publicly available.",
        "Each document is 1.5 - 2.5 pages long, and begins with the identification information of the patient and his/her visit in hospital.",
        "Next, the following information is given in short form: significant past and current illnesses, diagnoses and patient's health at the beginning of the hospitalization.",
        "After these data, the document describes results of examinations such as height, weight, BMI and blood pressure, ophthalmology examinations, blood tests, lipid profile tests, radiology or ultrasound.",

        "It contains: data about a patient's diabetes, a description of diabetic complications, and other illnesses, selected examination results and surgical interventions, information about education, diet observed, self monitoring, patient's reactions, and other remarks.",
        "Finally, all recommendations are mentioned, including information about prescribed diet, insulin treatment (type and doses) and oral medication.",
        "Most information is given as free-form text, but the vocabulary of these documents is very specific, and significantly differs from texts included in corpora of general Polish like IPIPAN Corpus (Przepiörkowski, 2004) or NKJP (National Corpus of Polish, http://nkjp.pl).",
        "The texts contain many dates in different formats, and a lot of test results with numerical values, whose descriptions are omitted in NKJP.",
        "The texts contains also a lot of medication names, like Cefepime or Acard not present in any general Polish dictionary.",
        "Some of them are multi-word names like Diaprel MR, Mono Mack Depot, Mixtard 10.",
        "The same medication can be referred to in different ways depending on international or Polish spelling rules (e.g. Amitriptylinum and its Polish equivalent Amit-ryptylina).",
        "Polish names could be inflected by cases (e.g. Amitryptylinygen).",

        "4 Tokenization",
        "The first level of text analysis is its segmentation into tokens.",
        "In general, most tokens in texts are lowercase words, words beginning with a capital letter and punctuation marks.",
        "The most common (thus the most important) tokenization problem is then to decide whether a particular dot ends a sentence or belongs to the preceding abbreviation (or both).",
        "In some texts there are also many numbers representing dates, time points, time intervals or various numerical values.",
        "For texts in which uniform standards of expressing these notions are obeyed, recognizing such complex tokens is much easier and simplifies further text analysis.",
        "In medical texts the problem of non-word tokens is harder than in the case of newspapers or novel content as they constitute a much larger portion of the text itself.",
        "Apart from descriptions of time (dates, hours, periods of time) there are numbers that refer to values of different medical tests or medicine doses and sizes.",
        "There are also many specific names which sometimes contain non-letter characters (e.g. Na+) as well as locally used abbreviations and acronyms.",
        "An additional difficulty is caused by the lack of will to obey writing standards.",
        "Physicians use different ways of describing dates (e.g.",
        "02.09.2004, 30.09/1.10.2003, 06/01/2004, 14.05.05, 28 .04.",
        "05, 12.05.2005r.)",
        "or time (8:00 vs 8.00).",
        "They also do not pay enough attention to punctuation rules and mix Polish and English standards of writing decimal numbers.",
        "In Polish we use a comma not a dot, but the influence of English results in common usage of the decimal point.",
        "Sometimes both notations can be found in the same line of text.",
        "Further, the sequence '2,3' may mean either '2.3' or two separate values: '2' and '3'.",
        "Two tools used in the process of constructing the corpus have embedded tokenizers.",
        "The first one is a part of the information extraction system SProUT (Drozdzytiski et al., 2004) which was used to write grammars identifying semantically important pieces of text.",
        "The general assumption adopted while building its tokenizer was \"not to interpret too much\", which means that tokens are relatively simple and do not rely on any semantic interpretation.",
        "Their self explanatory names, together with token examples and their frequencies in the entire input data set, are listed in table 1.",
        "Two other tokenization modules are embedded in the TaKIPI tagger used to disambiguate the morphological descriptions of word forms (Piasecki, 2007).",
        "The first one divides all character sequences into words and non-words which are assigned the ign label.",
        "The second tokenizer interprets these non-word sequences and assigns them ttime, tdate, turi (for sequences with dots inside) and tsym labels.",
        "It also applies a different identification strategy for token limits - for all non-word tokens only a space or a line break ends a token.",
        "Although treating a date is appropriate, in the case of sequences where spaces are omitted by mistake, the resulting tokens are often too long (e.g. 'dnia13/14.07.04', 'iVS-1,5').",
        "After analyzing the results given by three different tokenizers we decided to use the token classes identified by the SProUT tokenizer and align its results with the results of the 'simple' TaKIPI to-kenizer.",
        "SProUT tokens which were longer than TaKIPI tokens, e.g. '1x2mg', '100mg', '50x16x18', were divided into smaller onces.",
        "The changes introduced to token limits concern those tokens of the other_symbol type which contain punctuation marks.",
        "The other_symbol class comprises sequences which do not fit into any other class, i.e.",
        "Symbols for which separate classes are not defined (e.g. '=') and mixed sequences of letters and digits.",
        "In this latter case a token ends only when a space or a line break is encountered.",
        "The most typical case when this strategy fails in our data is the sequence 'HbAJc:' as the name of the test according to the tokenizer rules is classified as an 'other_symbol' the following colon is not separated.",
        "There are also other similar sequences: 'HbA1c=9,1%:' or '(HbAlC'.",
        "To make the results more uniform we divided these tokens on punctuation characters.",
        "This process resulted in replacing 1226 complex tokens by 4627 simple ones.",
        "Among these newly created tokens the most numerous class was lower-case_word and numbers which were formed after separating numbers and unit names, e.g. 10g, 100cm and sequences describing repetitions or sizes, like 2x3, 2mmx5mm.",
        "The longest sequence of this kind was 'ml/min.,GFR/C-G/-37,5ml/min/1,73m2'.",
        "This string was divided into 18 tokens by TAKIPI but finally represented as 23 tokens in the corpus.",
        "Finally, in the entire data set 465004 tokens (1802864 characters) were identiied.",
        "The most numerous class represents numbers - 18.8% (9% of characters), all punctuation characters constitute 25% of the total number of tokens (6.5% characters)."

        "The problems described in the paper are twofold, some of them are language independent like tok-enization, description of: abbreviations, acronyms, foreign expressions and spelling errors; while the others are speciic for rich-morphology languages.",
        "Our experiment showed that analyzing specialized texts written in highly inflected language with a general purpose morphologic analyzer can give satisfactory results if it is combined with manually created global domain dependent rules.",
        "Our rules were created on the basis of a sorted list of all token descriptions.",
        "That allowed us to analyze a group of tokens with the same base form e.g. an inflected noun.",
        "Additional information concerning the frequency of each description, indicated which token corrections would be important.",
        "Unfortunately, the process of rule creation is time-consuming (it took about 90 hours to create them).",
        "To speed up the process we postulate to prepare three sets of tokens for which rules will be created separately.",
        "The irst one shall contain tokens which are not recognized by a morphological analyzer, and hence requiring transformation rules to be created for them.",
        "The second set shall contain tokens with more than one interpretation, for which a decision is necessary.",
        "Finally we propose to take into account the set of frequent descriptions.",
        "Infrequent tokens can be left to the manual correction stage as it is easier to correct them knowing the context.",
        "At the moment our corpus contains three annotation levels - segmentation into tokens, morphological tags and semantic annotation.",
        "After the irst phase of corpus creation we decided to introduce an additional level of annotation – extended tok-enization, see (Marcus Hassler, 2006).",
        "Current tok-enization divides text into simple unstructured fragments.",
        "This solution makes it easy to address any important fragment of a text, but leaves the interpretation of all complex strings to the next levels of analysis.",
        "A new extended tokenization is planned to create higher level tokens, semantically motivated.",
        "It will allow the annotation of complex strings like: dates (02.12.2004, 02/12/2004); decimal numbers; ranges (10-15, 10-15); sizes and frequencies (10 x 15, 10x15); complex units (mm/h);abbreviations with full stops (r. - rok 'year'); acronyms containing non-letter characters (K+); complex medication names (Mono Mack Depot).",
        "Extended tokens can be recognized by rules taking into account two aspects: speciicity of the domain and problems resulting from careless typing.",
        "In the case of abbreviations and acronyms, the best method is to use dictionaries, but some heuristics can be useful too.",
        "Electronic dictionaries of acronyms and abbreviations are not available for Polish, but on the basis of annotated data, a domain speciic lexicon can be created.",
        "Moreover, we want to test ideas from (Kokkinakis, 2008), the author presents a method for the application of the MeSH lexicon (that contains English and Latin data) to Swedish medical corpus annotation.",
        "We will use a similar approach for acronyms and complex medication name recognition."
