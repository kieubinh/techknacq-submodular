        "Protein modifications, in particular post-translational modifications, have a central role in bringing about the full repertoire of protein functions, and the identification of specific protein modifications is important for understanding biological systems.",
        "This task presents a number of opportunities for the automatic support of manual curation efforts.",
        "However, the sheer number of different types of protein modifications is a daunting challenge for automatic extraction that has so far not been met in full, with most studies focusing on single modifications or a few prominent ones.",
        "In this work, aim to meet this challenge: we analyse protein modification types through ontologies, databases, and literature and introduce a corpus of 360 abstracts manually annotated in the BioNLP Shared Task event representation for over 4500 mentions of proteins and 1000 statements of modification events of nearly 40 different types.",
        "We argue that together with existing resources, this corpus provides sufficient coverage of modification types to make effectively exhaustive extraction of protein modifications from text feasible."

        "In the decade following the sequencing of the human genome, the critical role of protein modifications in establishing the full set of protein functions from forms transcribed from the fixed DNA is increasingly appreciated, reflected in the rise of pro-teomics as an extension and complement to genetics in efforts to understand gene and protein functions.",
        "The mapping of the space of modifications of specific proteins is a formidable undertaking: the number of known types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) is as high as 300 (Witze et al., 2007) with new types identified regularly (e.g. (Brennan and Barford, 2009)), and the number of specific molecular variants ofproteins in cells may be several orders of magnitude larger than that encoded in the genome; up to millions for humans (Walsh, 2006).",
        "Automatic extraction of protein modifications from the massive literature on the topic could contribute significantly to addressing these challenges.",
        "Biomedical information extraction (IE) has advanced substantially in recent years, shifting from the detection of simple binary associations such as protein-protein interactions toward resources and methods for the extraction of multiple types of structured associations of varying numbers participants in specific roles.",
        "These IE approaches are frequently termed event extraction (Ananiadou et al., 2010).",
        "While protein modifications have been considered in numerous IE studies in the domain (e.g. (Friedman et al., 2001; Rzhetsky et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2005; Narayanaswamy et al., 2005; Saric et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2008; Ohta et al., 2010), event extraction efforts have brought increased focus also on the extraction of protein modifications: in the BioNLP Shared Task series that has popularized event extraction, the 2009 shared task (Kim et al., 2009) involved the extraction of nine event types including one PTM, and in the 2011 follow-up event (Kim et al., 2011) the Epigenet-ics and Post-translational modifications (EPI) task (Ohta et al., 2011) targeted six PTM types, their reverse reactions, and statements regarding their catalysis.",
        "The results of these tasks were promising, suggesting that the single PTM type could be extracted at over 80% F-score (Buyko et al., 2009) and the core arguments of the larger set at nearly 70% F-score (Björne and Salakoski, 2011).",
        "The increasing availability of systems capable of detailed IE for protein modifications, their high performance also for multiple modifications types, and demonstrations of the scalability of the technology to the full scale of the literature (Bjorne et al., 2010) are highly encouraging for automatic extraction of protein modifications.",
        "However, previous efforts have been restricted by the relatively narrow scope of targeted modification types.",
        "In the present study, we seek to address the task in full by identifying all modifications of substantial biological significance and creating an annotated resource with effectively complete type-level coverage.",
        "We additionally present preliminary extraction results to assess the difficulty of exhaustive modification extraction."

        "To be able to benefit from the substantial number of existing resources and systems for event extraction, we apply the event representation of the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) for annotating protein modifications.",
        "Specifically, we directly extend the approach of the BioNLP ST 2011 EPI task (Ohta et al., 2011).",
        "In brief, in the applied representation, each event is marked as being expressed by a specific span of text (the event trigger) and assigned a type from a fixed ontology defining event types.",
        "Events can take a conceptually open-ended number of participants, each of which is similarly bound to a specific textual expression and marked as participating in the event in a specific role.",
        "In this work, we apply three roles: Theme identifies the entity or event that is affected by the event (e.g. the protein that is modified), Cause its cause, and Site specifies a specific part on the Theme participant that is affected, i.e. the modification site or region.",
        "Further, events are primary objects of annotation and can thus in turn be participants in other events as well as being marked as e.g. explicitly negated (\"is not phosphorylated\") or stated speculatively (\"may be phosphorylated\").",
        "An event annotation example is shown in Figure 1.",
        "ART2 catalyses P2X7 ADP-ribosylation.",
        "Figure 1: Illustration of the event representation.",
        "An event of type ADP-ribosylation (expressed through the text \"ADP-ribosylation\") with a Protein (\"P2X7\") participant in the Theme role is in turn the Theme of a Catalysis event with another Protein (\"ART2\") as its Cause."

        "We next present our selection of protein modification types relevant to event annotation and an extended analysis of their relative prominence.",
        "For mapping and structuring the space of protein modification concepts, we primarily build on the community-standard Gene Ontology (GO) (Ash-burner et al., 2000).",
        "GO has substantial representation of protein modifications: the sub-ontology rooted at protein modification process (GO:0006464) in the GO biological process ontology contains 805 terms (including both leaf and internal nodes).",
        "This set of terms is the starting point for our selection of modifications types to target.",
        "First, many specific GO terms can be excluded due to the different approach to semantic representation taken in event annotation: while GO terms represent detailed concepts without explicit structure (see e.g. (Ogren et al., 2004)), the event representation is structured, allowing more general terms to be applied while capturing the same information.",
        "For example, many GO modification terms have child nodes that identify the target (substrate) of modification, e.g. protein phosphorylation has the child actin phosphorylation.",
        "In the event representation, the target of modification is captured through the Theme argument.",
        "Similarly, GO terms may identify the site or region of modification, which becomes a Site argument in the event representation (see Figure 2).",
        "To avoid redundancy, we exclude GO terms that differ from a more general included term only in specifying a substrate or modification site.",
        "We similarly exclude terms that specify a catalyst or refer to regulation of modifi-",

        "cation, as these are captured using separate events in the applied representation, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "For an analogous reason, we do not separately include type-level distinctions for \"magnitude\" variants of terms (e.g. monoubiquitination, polyubiquitination) as these can be systematically modeled as aspects that can mark any event (cf. the low/neutral/high Manner of Nawaz et al.",
        "(2010)).",
        "Second, a number of the GO terms identify reactions that are in scope of previously defined (non-modification) event types in existing resources.",
        "To avoid introducing redundant or conflicting annotation with e.g. the GENIA Event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) or BioNLP ST resources, we excluded terms that involve predominantly (or exclusively) non-covalent binding (included in the scope of the event type BINDING) and terms involving the removal of or binding between the amino acids of a protein, including protein maturation by peptide bond cleavage (annotated - arguably somewhat inaccurately as Protein catabolism in GENIA/BioNLP ST data).",
        "By contrast, we do differentiate between reactions involving the addition of chemical groups or small proteins and those involving their removal, including e.g. Palmitoylation and Depalmitoy-LATION as distinct types.",
        "To preserve the ontology structure, we further include also internal nodes appearing in GO for the purposes of structuring the ontology (e.g. small protein conjugation or removal), although we only apply more specific leaf nodes in event annotation.",
        "This selection, aiming to identify the maximal subset of the protein modification branch of the GO ontology relevant to event annotation, resulted in the inclusion of 74 terms, approximately 9% of the branch total.",
        "Table 1 shows the relevant part of the GO protein modification subontology term structure, showing each term only once and excluding very rare terms for space.",
        "(A detailed description of other information in the table is given in the following sections.)",
        "In addition to GO, we consider protein modifications in the MeSH ontology, used to index PubMed citations with concepts relevant to them.",
        "Further, for resolving cases not appearing in GO, we refer to the Uniprot controlled vocabulary of posttranslational modifications and the Proteomics Standards Initiative Protein Modification Ontology (PSI-MOD) (Montecchi-Palazzi et al., 2008).",
        "A substantial number of databases tracking protein modifications from a variety of perspectives exist, and new ones are introduced regularly.",
        "The databases range from the specific (e.g. (Gupta et al., 1999; Diella et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2010)) to the broad in scope (Lee et al., 2005; Li et al., 2009).",
        "Information on protein modifications is also found in general protein knowledge resources such as Swiss2003).",
        "The relative number of entries relevant to each protein modification in such resources is one possible proxy for the biological significance of the various modifications.",
        "We apply two such estimates in this work.",
        "One of the primary applications of GO is the use of the ontology terms to annotate gene products, identifying their functions.",
        "These annotations, provided by a variety of groups in different efforts (e.g. (Camon et al., 2004)), are readily available in GO and used in various GO tools as a reflection of the prominence of each of the ontology concepts.",

        "The columns labeled GPA and SysPTM in Table 1 show the number of gene product associations for each selected type in GO and entries per type in SysPTM, respectively.",
        "As a final estimate of the relative prominence of the various protein modification types, we estimated the relative frequency with which they are discussed in the literature through simple PubMed search, querying the Entrez system for each modification in its basic nominalized form (e.g. phosphorylation) in a protein-related article.",
        "Specifically, for each modification string Mod we searched Entrez for",
        "\"Mod\"[TIAB] AND \"protein\"[TIAB] The modifier [TIAB] specifies to search the title and abstract.",
        "The literal string \"protein\" is included to improve the estimate by removing references that involve the modification of non-proteins or related concepts that happen to share the term.",
        "While this query is far from a perfect estimate of the actual number of protein modifications, we expect it to be a useful as a rough indicator of their relative frequencies and more straightforward to assess than more involved statistical analyses (e.g. (Pyysalo et al., 2010)).",
        "The results for these queries are given in the PubMed column of Table 1.",
        "The rightmost four columns of Table 1 present the number of annotations for each modification type in previously introduced event-annotated resources following the BioNLP ST representation as well as those annotated in the present study.",
        "While modification annotations are found also in other corpora (e.g. (Wu et al., 2003; Pyysalo et al., 2007)), we only include here resources readily compatible with the BioNLP ST representation.",
        "Separating for the moment from consideration the question of what level of practical extraction performance can be supported by these event annotations, we can now provide an estimate of the upper bound on the coverage of relevant modification statements for each of the three proxies (GO GPA, SysPTM DB entries, PubMed query hits) simply by dividing the sum of instances of modifications for which annotations exist by the total.",
        "Thus, for example, there are 8246 GPA annotations for Phosphorylation and a total of 15597 GPA annotations, so the BioNLP ST'09 data (containing only Phosphorylation events) could by the GPA estimate cover 8246/15597, or approximately 53% of individual modifications.",

        "GO GPA: 98.2%, SysPTM 99.6%, PubMed 97.5%.",
        "Thus, we estimate that correct extraction of the included types would, depending on whether one takes a gene association, database entry, or literature mention point of view, cover between 97.5% to 99.6% of protein modification instances - a level of coverage we suggest is effectively exhaustive for most practical purposes.",

        "As the distribution of protein modifications in PubMed is extremely skewed, random sampling would recover almost solely instances of major types such as phosphorylation.",

        "All development was performed using cross-validation on the visible portion of the data, and a single final experiment was performed on the test dataset.",

        "Second, to allow generalization across argument types, we added support for solving a single classification problem for event argument detection instead of solving multiple classification problems separated by argument types.",
        "Finally, to facilitate the use of other event resources for extraction, we added functionality to incorporate models trained by other corpora as reference models, using predictions from these models as features in classification.",
        "We first performed a set of experiments to determine whether models can beneficially generalize across different modification event types.",
        "The EventMine pipeline has separate classification stages for event trigger detection, event-argument detection, and the extraction of complete event structures.",
        "Each of these stages involves a separate set of features and output labels, some of which derive directly from the involved event types: for example, in determining whether a specific entity is the Theme of an event triggered by the string \"phosphorylation\", the system by default uses the predicted event type (Phosphorylation) among its features.",
        "It is possible to force the model to generalize across event types by replacing specific types with placeholders, for example replacing Phosphorylation, Methylation, etc.",

        "In preliminary experiments on the development set, we experimented with a number of such generalizations.",
        "Results indicated that while some generalization was essential for achieving good extraction performance, most implementation variants produced broadly comparable results.",
        "We chose the following generalizations for the final test: in the trigger detection model, no generalization was performed (allowing specific types to be extracted), for argument detection, all instances of event types were replaced with a generic type (Event), and for event structure prediction, all instances of specific modification event types (but not Catalysis) were replaced with a generic type (Modification).",

        "A learning curve for the generalized model is shown in Figure 3.",

        "In a second set of experiments, we investigated the compatibility of the newly introduced annotations with existing event resources by incorporating their annotations either directly as training data (+Ann) or indirectly through features from predictions from a model trained on existing resources (+Model), as well as their combination.",
