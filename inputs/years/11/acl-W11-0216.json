        "After identification of the relevant named entities (NE, in this case proteins) C8 and C5, the RE task determines whether there is a PPI relationship between the entities above (which is true in the example).",
        "Kernel based approaches for RE have drawn a lot of interest in recent years since they can exploit a huge amount of features without an explicit representation.",
        "Some of these approaches are structure kernels (e.g. tree kernels), which carry out structural similarities between instances of relations, represented as phrase structures or dependency trees, in terms of common substructures.",
        "Other kernels simply use techniques such as bag-of-words, subsequences, etc.",
        "to map the syntactic and contextual information to flat features, and later compute similarity.",
        "One variation of tree kernels is the dependency tree (DT) kernel (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Nguyen et al., 2009).",
        "A DT kernel (DTK) is a tree kernel that is computed on a dependency tree (or subtree).",
        "A dependency tree encodes grammatical relations between words in a sentence where the words are nodes, and dependency types (i.e. grammatical functions of children nodes with respect to their parents) are edges.",
        "The main advantage of a DT in comparison with phrase structure tree (PST) is that the former allows for relating two words directly (and in more compact substructures than PST) even if they are far apart in the corresponding sentence according to their lexical word order.",
        "Several kernel approaches exploit syntactic dependencies among words for PPI extraction from biomedical text in the form of dependency graphs or dependency paths (e.g. Kim et al.",
        "(2010) or Airola et al.",
        "(2008)).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, there are only few works on the use of DT kernels for this task.",
        "Therefore, exploring the potential of DTKs applied to different structures is a worthwhile research direction.",
        "A DTK, pioneered by Culotta and Sorensen (2004), is typically applied to the minimal or smallest common subtree that includes a target pair of entities.",

        "Nevertheless, there are cases where a minimal subtree might not contain important cue words or predicates.",

        "• We propose the use of new DT structures, which are improvement on the structures defined in Nguyen et al.",
        "(2009) with the most general (in terms of substructures) DTK, i.e.",
        "Partial Tree Kernel (PTK) (Moschitti, 2006).",
        "• We firstly propose the use of the Unlexicalized PTK (Severyn and Moschitti, 2010) with our dependency structures, which significantly improves PTK.",
        "• We compare the performance of the proposed DTKs on PPI with the one of PST kernels and",
        "show that, on biomedical text, DT kernels perform better.",
        "• Finally, we introduce a novel approach (called mildly extended dependency tree (MEDT) kernel, which achieves the best performance among various (both DT and PST) tree kernels.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce tree kernels and relation extraction and we also review previous work.",
        "Section 3 describes the unlexicalized PTK (uPTK).",
        "Then, in Section 4, we define our proposed DT structures including MEDT.",
        "Section 5 describes the experimental results on the AIMed corpus (Bunescu et al., 2005) and discusses their outcomes.",

        "The main stream work for Relation Extraction uses kernel methods.",
        "In particular, as the syntactic structure is very important to derive the relationships between entities in text, several tree kernels have been designed and experimented.",
        "In this section, we introduce such kernels, the problem of relation extraction and we also focus on the biomedical domain.",
        "The objective behind the use of tree kernels is to compute the similarity between two instances through counting similarities of their sub-structures.",
        "Among the different proposed methods, two of the most effective approaches are Subset Tree (SST) kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001) and Partial Tree",
        "Kernel (PTK) (Moschitti, 2006).",
        "The SST kernel generalizes the subtree kernel (Vishwanathan and Smola, 2002), which considers all common subtrees in the tree representation of two compared sentences.",
        "In other words, two subtrees are identical if the node labels and order of children are identical for all nodes.",
        "The SST kernel relaxes the constraint that requires leaves to be always included in the sub-structures.",
        "In SST, for a given node, either none or all of its children have to be included in the resulting subset tree.",
        "An extension of the SST kernel is the SST+bow (bag-of-words) kernel (Zhang and Lee, 2003; Moschitti, 2006a), which considers individual leaves as substructures as well.",
        "The PT kernel (Moschitti, 2006) is more flexible than SST by virtually allowing any tree substructure; the only constraint is that the order ofchild nodes must be identical.",
        "Both SST and PT kernels are convolution tree kernels.",
        "The PT kernel is the most complete in terms of structures.",
        "However, the massive presence of child node subsequences and single child nodes, which in a DT often correspond to words, may cause overfit-ting.",
        "Thus we propose the use of the unlexicalized (i.e. PT kernel without leaves) tree kernel (uPTK) (Severyn and Moschitti, 2010), in which structures composed by only one lexical element, i.e. single nodes, are removed from the feature space (see Section 3).",
        "A first version of dependency tree kernels (DTKs) was proposed by Culotta and Sorensen (2004).",
        "In their approach, they find the smallest common subtree in the DT that includes a given pair of entities.",
        "Then, each node of the subtree is represented as a feature vector.",
        "Finally, these vectors are used to compute similarity.",
        "However, the tree kernel they defined is not a convolution kernel, and hence it generates a much lower number of substructures resulting in lower performance.",
        "For any two entities eland e2 in a DT, Nguyen et al.",
        "(2009) defined the following three dependency structures to be exploited by convolution tree kernels:",
        "• Dependency Words (DW) tree: a DW tree is the minimal subtree of a DT, which includes eland e2.",
        "An extra node is inserted as parent of the corresponding NE, labeled with the NE category.",
        "Only words are considered in this tree.",
        "• Grammatical Relation (GR) tree: a GR tree is similar to a DW tree except that words are replaced by their grammatical functions, e.g.",
        "prep, nsubj, etc.",
        "• Grammatical Relation and Words (GRW) tree: a GRW tree is the minimal subtree that uses both words and grammatical functions, where the latter are inserted as parent nodes of the former.",
        "Using PTK for the above dependency tree structures, the authors achieved an F-measure of 56.3 (for DW), 60.2 (for GR) and 58.5 (for GRW) on the ACE 2004 corpus.",
        "Moschitti (2004) proposed the so called path-enclosed tree (PET) of a PST for Semantic Role Labeling.",
        "This was later adapted by Zhang et al.",
        "(2005) for relation extraction.",
        "A PET is the smallest common subtree of a PST, which includes the two entities involved in a relation.",
        "Zhou et al.",
        "(2007) proposed the so called context-sensitive tree kernel approach based on PST, which expands PET to include necessary contextual information.",

        "Nguyen et al.",
        "(2009) improved the PET representation by inserting extra nodes for denoting the NE category of the entities inside the subtree.",
        "They also used sequence kernels from tree paths, which provided higher accuracy.",
        "There are several benchmarks for the PPI task, which adopt different PPI annotations.",
        "Consequently the experimental results obtained by different approaches are often difficult to compare.",

        "Each ofthese corpora is known as converted corpus ofthe corresponding original corpus.",
        "Several kernel-based RE approaches have been reported to date for the PPI task.",

        "The results were far better when they combined the output of the dependency parser with that of a Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) parser, and applied tree kernel on it.",
        "Miwa et al.",
        "(2009) also proposed a hybrid kernel , which is a composition of all-dependency-paths kernel (Airola et al., 2008), bag-of-words kernel and SST kernel.",
        "They used multiple parser inputs.",
        "Their system is the current state-of-the-art for PPI extraction on several benchmarks.",
        "Interestingly, they applied SST kernel on the shortest dependency paths between pairs of proteins and achieved a relatively high F-score of55.1.",
        "However, the trees they constructed from the shortest dependency paths are actually not dependency trees.",
        "In a dependency tree, there is only one node for each individual word whereas in their constructed trees (please refer to Fig. 6 of Miwa et al.",
        "(2009)), a word (that belongs to the shortest path) has as many node representations as the number of dependency relations with other words (those belonging to the shortest path).",
        "Perhaps, this redundancy of information might be the reason their approach achieved higher result.",
        "In addition to work on PPI pair extraction, there has been some approaches that exploited dependency parse analyses along with kernel methods for identifying sentences that might contain PPI pairs (e.g. Erkan et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "In this paper, we focus on finding the best representation based on a single structure.",
        "We speculate that this can be helpful to improve the state-of-the-art using several combinations of structures and features.",
