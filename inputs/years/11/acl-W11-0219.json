        "While various types of clinical records (e.g., discharge summaries, consultation notes, etc.)",
        "contain comprehensive medical history information, it can be often challenging and time-consuming to comprehend the medical history of patients when the information is stored in multiple documents in different formats and the relations among various pieces of information is not explicit.",
        "For decades, researchers have investigated temporal information extraction and reasoning in the medical domain (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007).",
        "However, information extraction in the medical domain typically relies on shallow NLP techniques (e.g., pattern matching, chunking, templates, etc.",
        "), and most temporal reasoning techniques are based on structured data with temporal tags (Augusto, 2005; Stacey and McGregor, 2007).",
        "In this paper, we present our work on developing an end-to-end system that (i) extracts interesting medical concepts (e.g., medical conditions/ tests/treatments), related events and temporal expressions from raw clinical text records, (ii) constructs timelines of the extracted information; and (iii) visualizes the timelines, all using deep semantic natural language understanding (NLU).",
        "Our deep NLU system extracts rich semantic information from narrative text records and builds logical forms that contain ontology types as well as linguistic features.",
        "Ontology- and pattern-based extraction rules are used on the logical forms to retrieve time points/intervals, medical concepts/ events and their temporal/causal relations that are pieced together by our system's temporal reasoning component to create comprehensive timelines.",
        "Our system is an extension to a well-proven general-purpose NLP system (Allen et al., 2000) rather than a system specialized to the clinical domain, and the temporal reasoning in our system is tightly integrated into the NLP system's deep semantic analysis.",
        "We believe this approach will allow us to process a broader variety of documents and complex forms of temporal expressions.",

        "For classes such as state and occurrence, the concrete time value of the event is used.",
        "In contrast, for an aspectual event, we check its feature (e.g., initiation or termination) and look for other aspectual events related to the clinical concept and compute a time span.",
        "For instance, regarding \"Afinitor\", Line 4 and Line 9 have events with classes (aspectual initiation) and (aspectual termination) respectively, which leads to a time span between the two dates in Line 4 and Line 9.",
        "Currently, we do not resolve conflicting hypotheses.",
        "Assertion of Presence or Absence of Clinical Concepts: To check if a certain concept is present or not, we take into account quantifier information (e.g., none), the negation role values of events, and the verb types of events (e.g., \"deny\" indicates the absence assertion).",
        "In addition to such information readily available in the output specifications of the clinical concept-and event-extraction rules, we also check the path (as in Step 1) that relates the clinical concepts and the events, and the quantifiers of the concepts in the path are used to compute negation values.",
        "For instance, given \"The scan shows no evidence of lung nodules\", the quantifier of the concept \"evidence\" indicates the absence of the clinical finding \"lung nodules\".",
        "Timeline Results and Discussion",
        "For the example in Section 2 (Line 1 ~ 12), we extract all the instances of the clinical concepts and the temporal expressions.",
        "Out of 23 events, 17 were extracted.",
        "While we missed events such as state/was (Line 5), done (Line 8), and walk/do/ swim (Line 10), our event extraction rules can be extended to cover them if need be.",
        "Figure 10 visualizes the extraction results of the example.",
        "We use a web widget tool called Simile Timeline (www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/).",
        "Some property values (that were also extracted by rules) are shown alongside some concepts (e.g., weight measurement).",
        "Note that not all extracted clinical findings are displayed in Figure 10 because we visualize clinical concepts only when they are associated with temporal expressions in our LFs.",
        "For instance, the CT-scan on 05/14/08 in Line 8 is not shown because the date was not associated with it due to fragmented LFs from the Parser.",
        "However, we were still able to extract \"no infiltrates\" and \"scan\" from a meaningful fragment.",
        "In addition to the fragmented LF issue, we plan to work on temporal reasoning for concepts in the sentences without explicit temporal expressions, and the current limited event reference resolution will be improved.",
        "We are also working on evaluation with 48 clinical records from 10 patients.",
        "Annotated results will be created as a gold-standard and precision/recall will be measured."

        "Temporal information is of crucial importance in clinical applications, which is why it has attracted a lot interest over the last two decades or more (Augusto, 2005).",
        "Since so much clinical information is still residing in unstructured form, in particular as text in the patient's health record, the last decade has seen a number of serious efforts in medical NLP in general (Meystre et al., 2008) and in extracting temporal information from clinical text in particular.",
        "Some of this surge in interest has been spurred by dedicated competitions on extraction of concepts and events from clinical text (such as the i2b2 NLP challenges).",
        "At the same time, the evolution of temporal markup languages such as Ti-meML (Sauri et al., 2006), and temporal extraction/inference competitions (such as the two TempEval challenges, Verhagen et al., 2009) in the general area of NLP have led to the development of tools such as TARSQI (Verhagen et al., 2005) that could be adapted to the clinical domain.",
        "Although the prevailing paradigm in this area is to use superficial methods for extracting and classifying temporal expressions, it has long been recognized that higher level semantic processing, including discourse-level analysis, would have to be performed to get past the limits of the current approaches (cf. Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007).",
        "Recent attempts to use deeper linguistic features include the work of Bethard et al.",
        "(2007), who used syntactic structure in addition to lexical and some minor semantic features to classify temporal relations of the type we discussed in Section 4.3.",
        "Savova and her team have also expressed interest in testing off-the-shelf deep parsers and semantic role labelers for aiding in temporal relation identification and classification (Savova et al., 2009); although we are not aware of any temporal extraction results yet, we appreciate their effort in expanding the TimeML annotation schema for the clinical domain, as well as their efforts in developing corpora of clinical text annotated with temporal information.",
        "deserves a mention, even though they apply their techniques to biomedical text rather than clinical text.",
        "They obtain a shallow logical form that represents predicate-argument relations implicit in the syntax by post-processing the results of a statistical parser.",
        "Temporal relations are obtained from the shallow LF based on a set of hand-built rules by an abductive inference engine.",
        "To our knowledge, however, our system is the first general-purpose NLU system that produces a full, deep syntactic and semantic analysis of the text as a prerequisite to the extraction and analysis of relevant clinical and temporal information."
