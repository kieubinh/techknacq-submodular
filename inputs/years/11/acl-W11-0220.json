        "Given a large collection of documents, a few of which are labeled as interesting, our task is to identify unlabeled documents that are also interesting.",
        "Since the labeled data represents the data we are interested in, we will refer to it as the positive class and to the remainder of the data as the negative class.",
        "We use the term negative class, however, documents in the negative class are not necessarily negative, they are simply unlabeled and the negative class may contain documents relevant to the topic of interest.",
        "Our goal is to retrieve these unknown relevant documents.",
        "A naïve approach to this problem would simply take the positive examples as the positive class and the rest of the collection as the negative class and apply machine learning to learn the difference and rank the negative class based on the resulting scores.",
        "It is reasonable to expect that the top of this ranking would be enriched for the positive class.",
        "But an appropriate choice of methods can improve over the naïve approach.",
        "One issue of importance would be choosing the most appropriate machine learning method.",
        "Our problem can be viewed from two different perspectives: the problem of learning from imbalanced data as well as the problem of recommender systems.",
        "In terms of learning from imbalanced data, our positive class is significantly smaller than the negative, which is the remainder of the collection.",
        "Therefore we are learning from imbalanced data.",
        "Our problem is also a recommender problem in that based on a few examples found of interest to a customer we seek similar positive examples amongst a large collection of unknown status.",
        "Our bias is to use some form of wide margin classifier for our problem as such classifiers have given good performance for both the imbalanced data problem and the recommender problem (Zhang and Iyengar 2002; Abkani, Kwek et al.",
        "2004; Lewis, Yang et al.",
        "2004).",
        "Imbalanced data sets arise very frequently in text classification problems.",
        "The issue with imbalanced learning is that the large prevalence of negative documents dominates the decision process and harms classification performance.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the problem including sampling methods and cost-sensitive learning methods and are described in (Chawla, Bowyer et al.",
        "2002; Maloof 2003; Weiss, McCarthy et al.",
        "2007).",
        "These studies have shown that there is no clear advantage of one approach versus another.",
        "Elkan (2001) points out that cost-sensitive methods and sampling methods are related in the sense that altering the class distribution of training data is equivalent to altering misclassification cost.",
        "Based on these studies we examine cost-sensitive learning in which the cost on the positive set is increased, as a useful approach to consider when using an SVM.",
        "In order to show how cost-sensitive learning for an SVM is formulated, we write the standard equations for an SVM following (Zhang 2004).",
        "depending on whether the data point xi is classified as positive or negative, an SVM seeks that vector wi which minimizes where the loss function is defined by",
        "h ( z ) = «j (2) W [ 0, z>1.",
        "The cost-sensitive version modifies (1) to become and now we can choose r+ and r-to magnify the losses appropriately.",
        "Generally we take r to be 1, and r+ to be some factor larger than 1.",
        "We refer to this formulation as CS-SVM.",
        "Generally, the same algorithms used to minimize (1) can be used to minimize (3).",
        "Recommender systems use historical data on user preferences, purchases and other available data to predict items of interest to a user.",
        "Zhang and Iyengar (2002) propose a wide margin classifier with a quadratic loss function as very effective for this purpose (see appendix).",
        "It is used in (1) and requires no adjustment in cost between positive and negative examples.",
        "It is proposed as a better method than varying costs because it does not require searching for the optimal cost relationship between positive and negative examples.",
        "We will use for our wide margin classifier the modified Huber loss function (Zhang 2004).",
        "The modified Huber loss function is quadratic where this is important and has the form f-4 • z, z <-1 0, z>1.",
        "We also use it in (1).",
        "We refer to this approach as the Huber method (Zhang 2004) as opposed to SVM.",
        "We compare it with SVM and CS-SVM.",
        "We used our own implementations for SVM, CS-SVM, and Huber that use gradient descent to optimize the objective function.",
        "The methods we develop are related to semi-supervised learning approaches (Blum and active learning (Roy and McCallum 2001; Tong and Koller 2001).",
        "Our method differs from active learning in that active learning seeks those unlabeled examples for which labels prove most informative in improving the classifier.",
        "Typically these examples are the most uncertain.",
        "Some semi-supervised learning approaches start with labeled examples and iteratively seek unlabeled examples closest to already labeled data and impute the known label to the nearby unlabeled examples.",
        "Our goal is simply to retrieve plausible members for the positive class with as high a precision as possible.",
        "Our method has value even in cases where human review of retrieved examples is necessary.",
        "The imbalanced nature of the data and the presence of positives in the negative class make this a challenging problem.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss additional strategies proposed in this work, describe the data used and design of experiments, and provide the evaluation measure used.",
        "In Section 3 we present our results, in Sections 4 and 5 we discuss our approach and draw conclusions.",
        "Let D represent our set of documents, and C+ those documents that are known positives in D .",
        "Generally C+ would be a small fraction of D and for the purposes of learning we assume that",
        "C = D \\ C+.",
        "We are interested in the case when some of the negatively labeled documents actually belong to the positive class.",
        "We will apply machine learning to learn the difference between the documents in the class C+ and documents in the class C-and use the weights obtained by training to score the documents in the negative class C .",
        "The highest scoring documents in set Care candidate mislabeled documents.",
        "However, there may be a problem with this approach, because the classifier is based on partially mislabeled data.",
        "Candidate mislabeled documents are part of the C class.",
        "In the process of training, the algorithm purposely learns to score them low.",
        "This effect can be magnified by any overtraining that takes place.",
        "It will also be promoted by a large number of features, which makes it more likely that any positive point in the negative class is in some aspect different from any member ofC+ .",
        "Another way to set up the learning is by excluding documents from directly participating in the training used to score them.",
        "We first divide the negative set into disjoint pieces",
        "C- = Z1 Z2Then train documents in C+ versus documents in Z1 to rank documents in Z 2 and train documents in C+ versus documents in Z2 to rank documents",
        "in Z 1 .",
        "We refer to this method as cross training (CT).",
        "We will apply this approach and show that it confers benefit in ranking the false negatives in",

        "A standard way to measure the success of a classifier is to evaluate its performance on a collection of documents that have been previously classified as positive or negative.",
        "This is usually accomplished by randomly dividing up the data into training and test portions which are separate.",
        "The classifier is then trained on the training portion, and is tested on test portion.",
        "This can be done in a cross-validation scheme or by randomly re-sampling train and test portions repeatedly.",

        "We also analyze an example where cost-sensitive learning is effective.",
        "We hypothesize that with datasets having few features, cost-sensitive learning can be beneficial and comparable to using the Huber classifier.",

        "Under these conditions, all C points",
        "In order to reduce the loss at a C+ data point (x , y ), we must choose Aw such that xi • Aw > 0.",
        "But we assume that there are significantly more C-class data points than C+ and many such points x' are mislabeled and close to xi such that x' • Aw > 0.",
        "Then h(z) is likely be increased by x' • Aw(> 0) for these mislabeled points.",
        "Clearly, if there are significantly more C-class data than those of C+ class and the C-set contains a lot of mislabeled points, it may be difficult to find Aw that can result in a net effect of decreasing the right hand side of (2).",
        "The above analysis shows why the standard support vector machine formulation in (2) is vulnerable to an unbalanced and noisy training data set.",
        "The problem is clearly caused by the fact that the SVM loss function h(z) in (2) has a constant slope for z < 1.",
        "In order to alleviate this problem, Zhang and Iyengar (2002) proposed the loss function h(z) which is a smooth nonincreasing function with slope 0 at z =1 .",
        "This allows the loss to decrease while the positive points move a small distance away from the bulk of the negative points and take mislabeled points with them.",
        "The same argument applies to the Huber loss function defined in (4).",
        "The drawback of the standard SVM for the problem with an unbalanced class distribution results from the shape of h(z) in (2).",
