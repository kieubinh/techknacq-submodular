        "Since the variation of main verbs in GTREC imperatives is very small (see Section 2) and that of interrogatives is also very small, in order to correct the above two types of errors, we would require only small training data.",
        "In addition, these types of errors widely occurred among imperatives or questions, the accuracy improvement by correcting the errors was very large.",
        "The initial rapid improvement would thus occur.",
        "Cause of improvement depression",
        "\"NN – NNP\" tagging errors would come from the description style of words.",
        "In the GTREC queries, technical terms, such as the names of diseases or proteins, sometimes begin with capital characters.",
        "The GENIA tagger would take the capitalized words not as a normal noun (NN) but as a proper noun (NNP).",
        "By adaptation, the tagger would have learned the capital usage for terms and the errors then decreased.",
        "However, in order to achieve such improvement, we would have to wait until a target capitalized term is added to the training corpus.",
        "\"FW – NNP / NN / JJ\", \"NN – JJ\", and several other errors would be similar to this type of errors in the point that, they would be caused by the difference in annotation policy or description style between the training data for the GENIA tagger and the GTREC queries.",
        "\"VB – VBP\" errors were found in questions.",
        "For example, \"affect\" in the question \"How do mutations in Sonic Hedgehog genes affect developmental disorders?\"",
        "was base form (VB), while the GE-NIA tagger took it as a present tense (VBP) since the GENIA tagger would be unfamiliar with such verb behavior in questions.",
        "By adaptation, the tagger would learn that verbs in the domain tend to take base forms and the errors then decreased.",
        "However, the tagger model based on local context features could not substantially solve the problem.",
        "VBP of course could appear in question sentences.",
        "We observed that a verb to be VBP was tagged with VB by the adapted tagger.",
        "In order to distinguish VB from VBP, we should capture longer distance dependencies between auxiliary and main verbs.",
        "In tagging, the fact that the above two types of errors occupied most of the errors other than the errors involved in the initial jump, would be related to why the accuracy improvement got so slowly, which would lead to the improvement depression of the parsing performances.",
        "With the POS candidates with probabilities, the possibilities of correct POSs would increase, and therefore the parser would give higher parsing performances than using only one-best POSs (see Table 3 and Figure 4).",
        "Anyway, the problems were not substantially solved.",
        "For these tagging problems, just adding the training data would not work.",
        "We might need reconstruct the tagging system or reconsider the feature designs of the model.",
        "For the GTREC corpora, the GENIA parser with gold POSs lowered the parsing accuracy by more than three points than for the GENIA Corpus, while the adaptation of the parser recovered a few points for each domain (second and fifth column in Table 3).",
        "Figure 4 would also show that we could improve the parser's performance with more training data for each domain.",
        "For GTREC questions, the parsing accuracy dropped given the maximum size of the training data.",
        "Our training data is small and therefore small irregular might easily make accuracies drop or rise.",
        "We might have to prepare more corpora for confirming our observation.",
        "Table 6 would imply that the major errors for all of these three corpora seem not straightforwardly associated with the properties specific to imperative or question sentences.",
        "Actually, when we explored the parse results, errors on the sentence constructions specific to the two types of sentences would hardly be observed.",
        "(\"Failure in detecting verb\" errors in GTREC questions came from other causes.)",
        "This would mean that the GENIA parser itself has potential to parse the imperative or question sentences.",
        "The training data of the GENIA parser consists of the WSJ Penn Treebank and the GENIA Corpus.",
        "As long as we searched with our extraction method in Section 4.3, the WSJ and GENIA Corpus seem respectively contain 115 and 0 imperative, and 432 and seven question sentences.",
        "Unlike the POS tagger, the parser could convey more global sentence constructions from these sentences.",
        "Although the GENIA parser might understand the basic constructions of imperative or question sentences, by adaptation of the parser to the GTREC corpora, we could further learn more local construction features specific to GTREC, such as word sequence constructing a noun phrase, attachment preference of prepositions or other modifiers.",
        "The error reduction in Table 6 would thus be observed.",
        "However, we also observed that several types of errors were still mostly unsolved after the adaptation.",
        "Choosing whether to add complements for verbs or not, and distinguishing coordinations from conjunctions seems to be difficult for the parser.",
        "If two question sentences were concatenated by conjunctions into one sentence, the parser would tend to fail to analyze the sentence construction for the latter sentence.",
        "The remaining errors in Table 6 would imply that we should also reconsider the model designs or the framework itself for the parser in addition to just increasing the training data."

        "Since domain adaptation has been an extensive research area in parsing research (Nivre et al., 2007), a lot of ideas have been proposed, including un/semi-supervised approaches (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Blitzer et al., 2006; Steedman et al., 2003; McClosky et al., 2006; Clegg and Shepherd, 2005; McClosky et al., 2010) and supervised approaches (Titov and Henderson, 2006; Hara et al., 2007).",
        "Their main focus was on adapting parsing models trained with a specific genre of text (in most cases PTB-WSJ) to other genres of text, such as biomedical research papers.",
        "A major problem tackled in such a task setting is the handling of unknown words and domain-specific ways of expressions.",
        "However, as we explored, parsing NL queries involves a significantly different problem; even when all words in a sentence are known, the sentence has a very different construction from declarative sentences.",
        "Although sentence constructions have gained little attention, a notable exception is (Judge et al., 2006).",
        "They pointed out low accuracy of state-of-the-art parsers on questions, and proposed supervised parser adaptation by manually creating a treebank of questions.",
        "The question sentences are annotated with phrase structure trees in the PTB scheme, although function tags and empty categories are omitted.",
        "An LFG parser trained on the treebank then achieved a significant improvement in parsing accuracy.",
        "(Rimell and Clark, 2008) also worked on question parsing.",
        "They collected question sentences from TREC 9-12, and annotated the sentences with POSs and CCG (Steedman, 2000) lexical categories.",
        "They reported a significant improvement in CCG parsing without phrase structure annotations.",
        "On the other hand, (Judge et al., 2006) also implied that just increasing the training data would not be enough.",
        "We went further from their work, built a small but complete treebank for NL queries, and explored what really occurred in HPSG parsing."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we explored the problem in parsing queries.",
        "We first attempted to build a treebank on queries for biological knowledge and successfully obtained 196 annotated GTREC queries.",
        "We next examined the performances of the POS tagger and the HPSG parser on the treebank.",
        "In the experiments, we focused on the two dominant sentence constructions in our corpus: imperatives and questions, extracted them from our corpus, and then also examined the parser and tagger for them.",
        "The experimental results showed that the POS tagger's mis-tagging to main verbs in imperatives and w//-interrogatives in questions critically decreased the parsing performances, and that our small corpus could drastically decrease such mis-tagging and consequently improve the parsing performances.",
        "The experimental results also showed that the parser itself could improve its own performance by increasing the training data.",
        "On the other hand, the experimental results suggested that the POS tagger or the parser performance would stagnate just by increasing the training data.",
        "In our future research, on the basis of our findings, we would like both to build more training data for queries and to reconstruct the model or reconsider the feature design for the POS tagger and the parser.",
        "We would then incorporate the optimized parser and tagger into NL query processing applications."
