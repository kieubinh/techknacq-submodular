        "Given the nature of our problem, we need to focus on the semantics of the discourse that can accommodate the nature of ontology axioms.",

        "RST is a theory of discourse that addresses issues of semantics, communication and the nature of the coherence of texts, and plays an important role in computational methods for generating natural language texts (Hovy, 1990;Scott and Souza, 1990;Mellish et al., 1998;Power et al., 2003).",

This suggests that with careful selection of RST relations, and applying appropriate discourse markers, ontologies can be represented as RST structures, and generated as natural language paragraphs that are not far from human written text.",
        "To investigate the feasibility of this proposal, we have experimented with feeding axioms into RST trees, and have achieved a positive outcome.",

        "For a given SNOMED class, our verbalisation process starts with its super-, sub-and equivalent-classes, within an elaboration relation.",
        "The use of the elaboration relation allows the first part of the text to connect all classes relating to the topic class; the second part then starts to introduce more complex information directly related to the topic class.",

        "For example, the characteristics of a scientific article, a newspaper article or a twitter will be rather different, even though they may convey the same \"message\".",
        "The same is true for natural language descriptions of <Structure of thoracic viscus> ontological content, which can range from the fully-fluent to the closely literal (e.g., something likely to be thought of as a kind of \"SNOMEDese\"), depending on whether it is intended, say, for inclusion in a narrative summary of an electronic patient record (Hallett et al., 2006) or for ontology developers or users who want to know the precise ontological representation of some part of the ontology.",
        "So far, our aim has been to generate descriptions that fall into the latter category.",
        "For this purpose we retain the full expressions of the pseudo-English labels found in the official SNOMED Descriptions document , representing them within our generation process as \"quotes\" (Mellish et al., 2006) and signalling them through the use of italics.",
        "The texts still need to be grammatical, however, and achieving this can be challenging.",
        "In what follows we give a few examples of why this is so.",
        "It is a convention of ontology design to treat each class as singular; we follow this convention, introducing each class with the indefinite article.",
        "So, for example, the SNOMED labels",
        "<Intrathoracic cardiovascular structure> and < Structure of thoracic viscus> can be expressed straightforwardly as \"a structure of thoracic viscus\" and \"an intratrathoracic cardiovascular structure\".",
        "However, matters are not so simple.",
        "For example, <Heart structure> will require the definite article (\"the heart structure\") and while will attract an indefinite article at its front, it would read much better if it also had a definite article within it, giving \"a structure of the thoracic viscus\".",
        "A similar story holds for <Abdomen and pelvis> which properly should be \"the abdomen and pelvis\" or \"the abdomen and the pelvis\".",
        "Achieving this level of grammaticality will rely on knowledge that, for example, the human body contains only one heart and abdomen.",
        "Interestingly, this information is not captured within the SNOMED",
        "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snome dctarchive.html",
        "ontology, and so external resources will be required.",
        "Additionally, introducing articles within the labels (as in \"abdomen and the pelvis\", above) will require some level of natural language interpretation of the labels themselves.",
        "The same applies to number.",
        "While we currently follow the SNOMED convention of describing entities in the singular, there are occasions where the plural is called for.",
        "For example:",
        "<Abdominal vascular structure>",
        "SubClassOf <Abdomial structure>",
        "SubClassOf <Lower body part structure> <Abdominal cavity structure>",
        "SubClassOf <Abdominal structure> would be better expressed as \"Lower body part structures include all abdominal structures\", instead of as currently \"A lower body part structure includes an abdominal structure\".",
        "Another issue to consider is the roles of properties in SNOMED.",
        "This problem can be characterised by the following example:",
        "<Hypertension secondary to kidney transplant> EquivalentTo (<Hypertension associated with transplantation> and (<After> some <Transplant of kidney>))> which is currently verbalised as Hypertension secondary to kidney transplant is defined as hypertension associated with transplantation that has an after in a transplant of kidney.",
        "In SNOMED, the property after is used to give an after-effect (i.e., \"Hypertension associated with transplantation\" is an after-effect of a kidney transplant), and for a non-SNOMED expert, this meaning is not at all clear in the generated text.",
        "This applies to many properties in SNOMED.",

        "and \"Abdominal organ finding is a general finding of abdomen that has a finding site in a structure of abdominal viscus.\"",
