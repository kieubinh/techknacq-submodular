        "For self-training we use the definition by (Clark et al., 2003): \"a tagger that is retrained on its own labeled cache on each round\".",
        "The classifier is trained on the available training data which is then used to label the unlabeled examples from which the ones with enough prediction confidence are selected and added to the training set.",
        "The process is repeated for a number of predefined iterations.",
        "Co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) uses several classifiers trained on independent views of the same instances.",
        "These classifiers are then used to label the unlabeled set, and from this newly annotated data set the annotations with higher prediction probability are selected.",
        "These newly labeled examples are added to the training set and the process is repeated for a number of iterations.",
        "Both bootstrapping algorithms produce an enlarged training data set.",
        "Co-training requires two independent views on the same data set.",
        "As first view, we use the context around the ambiguous word.",
        "As second view, we use the MEDLINE MeSH indexing available from PubMed which is obtained by human assignment of MeSH heading based on their full-text articles.",
        "Methods are evaluated with the accuracy measure on the MSH WSD set built automatically using MeSH indexing from MEDLINE (Jimeno-Yepes et al., 2011) in which senses are denoted by UMLS concept identifiers.",
        "To avoid any bias derived from the indexing ofthe UMLS concept related to the ambiguous word, the concept has been removed from the MeSH indexing of the recovered citations.",
        "10-fold cross validation using Na√Øve Bayes (NB) has been used to compare both views which achieve similar accuracy (0.9386 context text, 0.9317 MeSH indexing) while the combined view achieves even better accuracy (0.9491).",
        "In both algorithms a set of parameters is used: the number of iterations (1-10), the size of the pool of unlabeled examples (100, 500, 1000) and the growth rate or number of unlabeled examples which are selected to be added to the training set (1, 10, 20, 50, 100)."

        "Results shown in Table 1 have been obtained from 21 ambiguous words which achieved lower performance in a preliminary cross-validation study.",
        "Each ambiguous word has around 2 candidate senses with 100 examples for each sense.",
        "We have split the examples for each ambiguous word into 2/3 for training and 1/3 for test.",
        "The baseline is NB trained and tested using this split.",
        "Semi-supervised algorithms use this split, but the training data is enlarged with selected unlabeled examples.",
        "Self-training and the baseline use the combined views while co-training relies on two NB classifiers, each trained on one view of the training data.",
        "Even though we are willing to evaluate other classifiers, NB was selected for this exploratory work since it is fast and space efficient.",
        "Unlabeled examples are MEDLINE citations which contain the ambiguous word and MeSH heading terms.",
        "Any mention of MeSH heading related to the ambiguous word has been removed.",
        "Optimal parameters were selected, and average accuracy is shown in Table 1.",
        "Both semi-supervised algorithms show a modest improvement on the baseline which is a bit higher for self-training.",
        "Best results are achieved with a small number of iterations (< 5), a small growth rate (1-10) and a pool of unlabeled data over 100 instances.",
        "Noise affects the performance with a larger number of iterations, which after an initial increase, shows a steep decrease in accuracy.",
        "Small growth rate ensures a smoothed increase in accuracy.",
        "A larger growth rate adds more noise after each iteration.",
        "A larger pool of unlabeled data offers a larger set of candidate unlabeled examples to choose from at a higher computational cost."
