        "The main task is to gather, revise, verify, classify, and explain the TTM knowledge.",
        "There are many ongoing project collaboration to digitize the TTM knowledge, many of which are documented on palm leaves.",
        "The digitized contents contain information on Thai medical herbal formulations with the healing properties.",

        "Apart from the traditional knowledge, today biomedical research has advanced into the genetic level.",
        "Many researchers have performed in-depth studies of herbs' medical properties on disease treatment.",

        "Text mining has become a widely applied technique for analyzing biomedical texts (Cohen and Hersh, 2005).",
        "The proposed ThaiHerbMiner is designed with the standard text mining process.",
        "We started by collecting PubMed articles by using herb names as keywords.",
        "Currently, we have obtained approximately 18,000 articles related to Thai herbs such as garlic, curcuma and ginger.",
        "Figure 1 shows the text mining process of extracting relations from given input texts.",
        "The process includes sentence segmentation, tokenization, POS tagging and entity & relation recognition.",
        "We used OpenNLP to perform all text processing tasks.",
        "For relation recognition based on syntactic structure, we focus on a group of causal verbs such as activate, induce, inhibit, prevent, regulate and suppress.",
        "Then the information visualization based on JavaScript is applied to represent the extracted relations.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example of a hyperbolic tree visualizing relations between curcuma and other entities.",
        "For example, curcuma has the property of inhibit with NF-kappaB, tumor and cancer.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example of a force-directed graph visualizing similar herbs sharing two entities, cancer and NF-kappaB.",
        "The visualizing result is useful to researchers for finding herbs which share similar medical properties."
