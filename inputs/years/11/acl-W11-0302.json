        "In spite of the high accuracy on the modules, the very few errors in tokenization, which reaches an accuracy of 99.34%, lead to a drop of more than 10% in parsing, indicating that no high quality dependency parsing of Arabic, and possibly other morphologically rich languages, can be reached without (semi-)perfect tokenization.",

        "Arabic is a morphologically rich language in which words may be composed of several tokens and hold several syntactic relations.",
        "We define word to be a whitespace delimited unit and token to be (part of) a word that has a syntactic function.",
        "For example, the word wsytzwjhA (^jj^j)(English: And he will marry her) consists of 4 tokens: a conjunction w, a future marker s, a verb inflected for the singular masculine in the perfective form ytzwj, and a feminine singular 3rd person object pronoun.",
        "Parsing such a word requires tokenization, and performing dependency parsing in the tradition of the CoNLL-X (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) and CoNLL 2007 shared task (Nivre et al., 2007) also requires part of speech tagging, lemmatization, linguistic features, and vocalization, all of which were in the human annotated gold standard form in the shared task.",
        "The current study aims at measuring the effect of a pipeline of non gold standard tokenization, lemmatization, vocalization, linguistic features and POS tagging on the quality of Arabic dependency parsing.",
        "We only assume that we have gold standard sentence boundaries since we do not agree with the sentence boundaries in the data, and introducing our own will have a complicating effect on evaluation.",
        "The CoNLL shared tasks of 2006 and 2007 used gold standard components in all fields, which is not realistic for Arabic, or for any other language.",
        "For Arabic and other morphologically rich languages, it may be more unrealistic than it is for English, for example, since the CoNLL 2007 Arabic dataset has tokens, rather than white space delimited words, as entries.",
        "A single word may have more than one syntactically functional token.",
        "Dependency parsing has been selected in belief that it is more suitable for Arabic than constituent-based parsing.",
        "All grammatical relations in Arabic are binary asymmetrical relations that exist between the tokens of a sentence.",
        "According to Jonathan Owens (1997: 52): \"In general the Arabic notion of dependency and that defined in certain modern versions e.g. Tesniere (1959) rest on common principles\".",
        "With a tokenization accuracy of 99.34%, a POS tagging accuracy of 96.39%, and with the absence of linguistic features and the use of word stems instead of lemmas, the Labeled Attachment Score drops from 74.75% in the gold standard experiment to 63.10% in the completely automatic experiment.",
        "Most errors are a direct result of tokenization errors, which indicates that despite the high accuracy on tokenization, it is still not enough to produce satisfactory parsing numbers."

        "The data is in the CoNLL column format.",
        "In this format, each token is represented through columns each of which has some specific information.",
        "The first column is the ID, the second the token, the third the lemma, the fourth the coarse-grained POS tag, the fifth the POS tag, and the sixth column is a list of linguistic features.",
        "The last two columns of the vector include the head of the token and the dependency relation between the token and its head.",

        "Care has been taken not to use the parts of the ATB that are also used in the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank (Haijc et al. 2004) since the PADT and the ATB share material.",
        "We implement a pipeline as follows (1) We build a memory-based word segmenter which treats segmentation as a per letter classification in which each word segment is delimited by a + sign whether it is syntactic or inflectional.",
        "A set of handwritten rules then produces tokens and stems based on this.",
        "Tokens are syntactically functional units, and stems are the tokens without the inflectional segments, For example, the word wsytzwjhA above is segmented as w+s+y+tzwj+hA.",
        "The tokenizer splits this into four tokens w, s, ytzwj, and hA, and the stemmer strips the inflectional prefix from ytzwj to produce tzwj.",
        "In the segmentation experiments, the best results were obtained with the IB1 algorithm with similarity computed as weighted overlap, relevance weights computed with gain ratio, and the number of k nearest distances equal to 1.",

        "Tagger, MBT, (Daelemans et al: 2007).",

        "Although the purpose of this experiment is to perform dependency parsing of Arabic without any assumptions, one assumption we cannot avoid is that the input text should be divided into sentences.",
        "For this purpose, we use the gold standard division of text into sentences without trying to detect the sentence boundaries, although this would be necessary in actual real-world use of dependency parsing.",
        "The reason for this is that it is not clear how sentence boundaries are marked in the data as there are sentences whose length exceeds 300 tokens.",
        "If we detected the boundaries automatically, then we would face the problem of aligning our sentences with those of the test set for evaluation, and many of the dependencies would not still hold.",
        "In the parsing experiments below, we will use the dependency parser MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006).",
        "We will use Single MaltParser, as used by Hall et al. (2007), with the same settings for Arabic that were used in the CoNLL 2007 shared task on the same data to be as close as possible to the original results in order to be able to compare the effect of non gold standard elements in the parsing process.",

        "We will use the same metrics here.",
        "One major difference between the parsing experiments which were performed in the 2007 shared task and the ones performed here is vocalization.",
        "The data set which was used in the shared task was completely vocalized with both word-internal short vowels and case markings.",
        "Since vocalization in such a perfect form is almost impossible to produce automatically, we have decided to primarily use unvocalized data instead.",
        "We have removed the word internal short vowels as well as the case markings from both the training set and the test set.",
        "This has the advantage of representing naturally occurring Arabic more closely, and the disadvantage of losing information that is only available through vocalization.",
        "We will, however, report on the effect of vocalization on dependency parsing in the discussion.",

        "17 of the errors can be characterized as over-tokenization while the other 13 are undertokenization.",
        "13 of the over tokenization cases are different tokens of the word blywn (Eng.",
        "billion) as the initial b in the words was treated as a preposition while it is an original part of the word.",
        "A closer examination of the errors in the tokenization process reveals that most of the words which are incorrectly tokenized do not occur in the training set, or occur there only in the form produced by the tokenizer.",
        "For example, the word blywn does not occur in the training set, but the form b+lywn+p occurs in the training set, and this is the reason the word is tokenized erroneously.",
        "Another example is the word bAsm, which is ambiguous between a one-token word bAsm (Eng.",
        "smiling), and a two-token word, b+Asm (Eng.",

        "Although the word should be tokenized as b+Asm, the word occurs in the training set as bAsm, which is a personal name.",
        "In fact, only five words in the 30 mis-tokenized words are available in the training set, which means that the tokenizer has a very high accuracy on known words.",
        "There are yet two examples that are worthy of discussion.",
        "The first one involves suboptimal orthography.",
        "The word r>smAl (Eng.",
        "capital in the financial sense) is in the training set but is nonetheless incorrectly tokenized in our experiments because it is written as brAsmAl (with the preposition b) but with an alif instead of the hamza.",
        "The word was thus not tokenized correctly.",
        "The other example involves an error in the tokenization in the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank.",

        "I give/address) has been tokenized in the Prague Arabic dependency treebank as >wj+h (Eng.",
        "its utmost/prime), which is not the correct tokenization in this context as the h is part of the word and is not a different token.",
        "The classifier did nonetheless tokenize it correctly but it was counted as wrong in the evaluation since it does not agree with the PADT gold standard.",
        "Since stemming involves removing all the inflectional prefixes and suffixes from the words, and since inflectional affixes are not demarcated in the PADT data set used in the CoNLL shared tasks, there is no way to know the exact accuracy of the stemming process in that specific experiment, but since stemming is a by-product of segmentation, and since segmentation in general reaches an accuracy in excess of 98%, stemming should be trusted as an accurate process.",
        "The performance of the tagger on gold standard data with gold standard tokenization is shown in table 2.",
        "The experiment yields an accuracy of 96.39% on all tokens.",
        "Known tokens reach an accuracy of 97.49% while unknown tokens reach an accuracy of 81.48%.",

        "The drop in quality in part of speech tagging is almost identical to the drop in quality in tokenization.",
        "While some of the errors made by the part of speech tagger are due to the fact that nouns, adjectives, and proper nouns cannot be distinguished by any formal features, a large number of the nominal class annotation in the gold standard data can hardly be justified.",
        "For example, the expression ^jjjVI IäjVI (Eng.",
        "the European Union) is annotated once in the training data as proper noun and adjective, and another time as a noun and adjective.",

        "While this introduces an automatic element in the training set, it guarantees the similarity between the features in the training set and those in the test set.",
        "In order to discover whether the finegrained POS tagset is necessary, we have run two parsing experiments using gold standard parts of speech with stems instead of lemmas, but without any of the linguistic features included in the gold standard: the first experiment has the two distinct part of speech tags and the other one has only the coarse-grained part of speech tags.",
        "Table 3 outlines the results.",

        "The same is also true for Label Accuracy Score as the numbers go down from 84.39% when using only one tagset compared to 84.04% when using two tagsets.",
        "This means that the fine-grained tagset is not needed to perform real world parsing.",
        "We have thus decided to use the coarse-grained tagset in the two positions of the part of speech tags.",
        "We can also see that this setting produces results that are 1.64% lower than those of the Single MaltParser results reported in the CoNLL 2007 shared task in terms of Labeled Accuracy Score.",
        "The difference can be attributed to the lack of linguistic features, vocalization, and the use of stems instead of lemmas.",
        "The LAS of 73.11% now constitutes the upper bound for real world experiments where also parts of speech and tokens have to be obtained automatically (since vocalization has been removed, linguistic features have been removed, and lemmas have been replaced with automatic stems).",
        "It should be noted that our experiments, with the complete set of gold standard features, achieve higher results than those reported in the CoNLL 2007 shared task: a LAS of 2007).",
        "This may be attributed to the change of the parser since we use the 1.3.1 version whereas the parser used in the 2007 shared task was the 0.4 version.",

        "We have presented an experiment in real world dependency parsing of Arabic using the same data, algorithm and settings used in the CoNLL (2007) shared task on dependency parsing.",
        "The real world experiment included performing tokenization, stemming, and part of speech tagging of the data before it was passed to MaltParser.",
        "Tokenization was performed using the memory-based segmenter/tokenizer/stemmer and it reached an accuracy of 99.34% on the CoNLL 2007 test set.",
        "We performed stemming rather than lemmatization due to the many problems and difficulties involved in obtaining the lemmas.",
        "Part of speech tagging scored 96.39% on all tokens on gold standard tokenization, but the accuracy dropped to 95.70% on automatic tokens.",
        "We also found that using the coarse grained POS tagset alone yielded better results than using it in combination with the fine-grained POS tagset.",
        "The tokens, stems, and CPOS tags were then fed into the dependency parser, but the linguistic features were not since it was not feasible to obtain these automatically.",
        "The parser yielded a Labeled Accuracy Score of 63.10%, more than 10% below the accuracy obtained on when all the components are gold standard.",
        "The main reason behind the accuracy drop is the tokenization module, since tokenization is responsible for creating the nodes that carry syntactic functions.",
        "Since this process was not perfect, many nodes were wrong, and the right heads were missing.",
        "When we evaluated the parser on correctly tokenized sentences, we obtained a Labeled Accuracy Score of 71.56%.",
        "On incorrectly tokenized sentences, however, the LAS score drops to 33.60%.",
        "We have also found that the full tagset of the Penn Arabic Treebank improves parsing results minimally in the automatic experiments, but not in the gold standard experiments.",
        "Vocalization does not help in the real world experiment unlike in the gold standard one.",
        "These results show that tokenization is the major hindrance to obtaining high quality parsing in Arabic.",
        "Arabic computational linguistics should thus focus on ways to perfect tokenization, or try to find ways to parsing without having to perform tokenization.",
