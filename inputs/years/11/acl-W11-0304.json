        "The last fifteen years have seen an increased interest in the problem of how infants learn to segment a continuous stream of speech into words.",
        "Much of this work has been inspired by experiments with infants focusing on what capabilities infants have and which cues they attend to.",
        "While experimental work provides insight into the types of cues infants may be using, computational modeling of the task provides a unique opportunity to test proposed cues on representative data and validate potential approaches to using them.",
        "While there are many potential approaches to the problem, a desirable solution to the problem should demonstrate acceptable performance in a simulation of the task, rely on cues in the input that an infant learner is able to detect at the relevant age, and exhibit learning patterns similar to those of infant learners.",
        "Most work in computational modeling of language acquisition has primarily focused on achieving acceptable performance using a single cue, transitional probabilities, but little effort has been made in that work to try to connect these learning solutions to the actual learning patterns observed in children outside of performance on short artificial language learning experiments.",
        "In this work we present a simple, easily extended algorithm for unsupervised word segmentation that, in addition to achieving a high level of performance in the task, correlates with the developmental patterns observed in infants.",
        "We discuss the connections between the design and behavior of our algorithm and the cognitive capabilities of infants at the age at which they appear to begin segmenting words.",
        "We also discuss how our technique can easily be extended to accept additional cues to word segmentation beyond those implemented in our learner."

        "As this paper examines the intersection of infants' capabilities and computational modeling, we discuss work in both domains, beginning with experimental approaches to understanding how infants may perform the task of word segmentation.",
        "A potential account of how infants learn to identify words in fluent speech is that they learn words in isolation and then use those words to segment longer utterances (Peters, 1983; Pinker et al., 1984).",
        "It is not clear, however, that infant-directed speech provides enough detectable words in isolation for such a strategy (Aslin et al., 1996).",
        "Whatever isolated words children do hear, they appear to attend to them; whether a word is heard in isolation is a better predictor of whether a child has learned a word than the word's frequency (Brent and Siskind, 2001).",
        "A more plausible alternative account to assume children attend to patterns in the input, using them to identify likely word units.",
        "Much experimental work has followed from the finding that in artificial learning tasks, infants and adults appear to prefer wordlike units that match statistical patterns in the input (Saffranetal., 1996b; Saffranetal., 1996a).",
        "Saffran et al.",
        "and the authors of following studies (Aslin et al., 1998; Saffran, 2001, among many others) suggest that participants used transitional probabilities to succeed in these experiments, but the actual strategy used is unclear and may even be an artifact of the perceptual system (Perruchet and Vinter, 1998; Hewlett and Cohen, 2009).",
        "More recent work using real language data has not shown transitional probabilities to be as useful a cue as originally suggested.",
        "Lew-Williams et al.",
        "(2011) found that 9-month-old English-learning infants were not able to learn high-transitional probability words in fluent Italian speech unless those words were also presented in isolation.",
        "Given this finding and the extensive exisiting modeling work focusing on the used of transitional probabilities, we believe it is crucial to additionally explore segmentation strategies that rely on other cues in the input.",
        "While experimental work has posited simple algorithms that infants might use to accomplish the task of word segmentation, when applied to real language data these techniques have yielded very poor results (Yang, 2004).",
        "This problem has created a challenge for researchers modeling language acquisition to suggest more sophisticated strategies that infants might use.",
        "These approaches have fallen into two primary categories: optimization-based and bootstrapping algorithm strategies.",
        "Optimization-based strategies have focused on techniques that a learner might use to arrive at an optimal segmentation, either through a dynamic programming approach (Brent, 1999), online learning (Venkataraman, 2001), or nonparametric Bayesian inference (Goldwater et al., 2009; Johnson and",
        "Goldwater, 2009).",
        "These approaches fit within standard statistical approaches to natural language processing, defining statistical objectives and inference strategies, with the learners trying to optimize some combination of the quality of its lexicon and representations of the corpus.",
        "In contrast, bootstrapping approaches (Gambell and Yang, 2004; Lignos and Yang, 2010) to word segmentation have focused on simple heuristics for populating a lexicon and strategies for using the contents of the lexicon to segment utterances.",
        "These approaches have focused on a procedure for segmentation rather than defining an optimal segmentation explicitly, and do not define a formal objective that is to be optimized.",
        "While bootstrapping approaches have generally made stronger attempts to align with infants abilities to process the speech signal (Gambell and Yang, 2004) than other approaches, little effort has been made to connect the details of an implemented segmentation strategy with children's learning patterns since the earliest computational models of the task (Olivier, 1968).",
        "It is important to draw a contrast here between attempts to match patterns of human development with regard to word segmentation with attempts to model performance in artificial language learning experiments whose goal is to probe word segmentation abilities in humans (Frank et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper we are focused on matching the progression of development and performance in naturalistic experiments to characteristics of a segmentation strategy, an approach similar to that employed in English past tense learning (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986; Pinker, 2000; Yang, 2002).",
        "We will now discuss the patterns of development for children learning to segment English words, which form the motivation for the design of our segmenter."

        "While the developmental patterns of English-learning infants have been broadly studied, it has been difficult to identify errors that must be caused by failures to correctly segment words and not other cognitive limitations, issues of morphological productivity, or syntactic competency issues.",
        "Brown (1973) offers one of the most comprehensive examinations of the types of errors that young infants make regarding word segmentation.",
        "He notes that Adam's common errors included treating it's-a, that-a, get-a, put-a, want-to, and at-that as single words, as judged by various misproduc-tions that involved these items.",
        "A possible analysis of these errors is that in addition to the high level of frequency with which those syllables co-occur, elements such as a and to do not carry any identifiable amount of stress in natural speech.",
        "In addition to the undersegmentations that Brown identifies, Peters (1983) identifies the pattern of oversegmenting function words begin other words, including this famous dialog between a parent and child, where in the child's response have is pronounced in the same way as the second syllable of behave: Parent: Behave!",
        "Child: I am have!",
        "The response by the child indicates that they have analyzed behave as be have.",
        "There are two major factors that could contribute to such an analysis: the high frequency of be leading to it being treated as a separate word (Saffran et al., 1996b), and the lack of stress on be but stress on have which forms a word contrary to the dominant pattern of stress in English (Cutler and Butterfield, 1992).",
        "Infants appear to use the ends of utterances to aid segmentation, and as early at 7.5 months old they are able to recognize novel words in fluent speech if the novel words are presented at the ends of an utterance and not utterance medially (Seidl and Johnson, 2006).",
        "Thus the reliable boundaries presented by the edge of an utterance should be treated as informative for a learner.",
        "Most crucially, the syllable seems to be the unit children use to form words.",
        "Experiments that have been performed to gauge adult and infant competency in word segmentation have been designed with the assumption that the only possible segmentation points are at syllable boundaries.",
        "That infants should be able to operate on syllables is unsurprising; infants as young as 4-days-old are able to discriminate words based on syllable length (Bijeljac-Babic et al., 1993) and phonotactic cues to syllable boundaries seem to be rapidly acquired by infants (On-ishi et al., 2002).",
        "The use of the syllable in experimental work on word segmentation stands in contrast to many computational models that have operated at the phoneme level (Brent, 1999; Venkatara-man, 2001; Goldwater et al., 2009).",
        "An exception to the focus on phoneme-based segmentation is the joint learning model proposed by Johnson (2008) that learns syllabification and other levels of representation jointly with word segmentation, but that model poses problems as a developmentally relevant approach in that it predicts unattested joint syllabification/segmentation errors by infants and problems as a linguistically relevant approach due to its non-phonotactic approach to learning syllabification.",
        "From this survey, we see some relevant phenomena that a good model of infant word segmentation should replicate.",
        "(1) The learner should operate on syllables.",
        "(2) At some stage of learning, underseg-mentation function word collocations (e.g., that-a should occur.",
        "(3) At some stage of learning, over-segmentation of function words that may begin other words (e.g., be-have) should occur.",

        "First, it inserts word boundaries in a left-to-right fashion as it processes each utterance (i.e., in temporal order), unlike previous models which have worked from the outside in.",
        "Second, it can handle cases where the segmentation is ambiguous given the current lexicon and score multiple possible segmentations.",
        "Finally, the use of wordlevel stress information is an optional part of the model, and not an essential part of the segmentation process.",
        "This allows us to examine the additional power that stress provides on top of a subtractive segmentation system and allows the model to generalize to languages where word-level stress is not present in the same fashion as English (e.g., French).",
        "We first discuss the individual operations the algorithm uses to segment an utterance, and then discuss how they are combined in the segmenter.",

        "The score assigned to each entry in the lexicon represents the relative confidence that it is a true word of the language.",
        "Each increment simply adds to the score of an individual word and each decrement subtracts from it.",
        "Subtractive segmentation is the process of using known words to segment the speech signal, which infants appear to be able to do as young as at six months of age (Bortfeld et al., 2005).",
        "Subtractive Segmentation.",
        "When possible, remove a known word in the lexicon from the front ofthe utterance being segmented.",
        "One way to apply subtractive segmentation is a greedy score-based heuristic for subtractive segmentation (Lignos and Yang, 2010), such that whenever multiple words in the lexicon could be subtracted from an utterance, the entry with the highest score will deterministically be used.",
        "This greedy approach results in a \"rich get richer\" effect of the sort seen in Dirichlet processes (Goldwater et al., 2009).",

        "High-frequency words are preferred.",
        "When presented with a choice of multiple words to subtract, the highest scored word will be subtracted, which will prefer higher frequency words over lower frequency words in segmentation.",
        "Syllables between words are not necessarily considered words.",
        "Syllables that occur between subtractions are not added as words in the lexicon.",
        "For example, if play and please are in the lexicon but checkers is not, the utterance play checkers please will be correctly segmented, but checkers will not be added to the lexicon.",
        "Much like infants appear to do, the learner does not place as much weight on less reliable boundaries hypothesized in the middle of an utterance (Seidl and Johnson, 2006).",
        "A particularly useful constraint for defining a word, introduced to the problem of word segmentation by Yang (2004) but previously discussed by Halle and Vergnaud (1987), is as follows:",
        "Unique Stress Constraint (USC): A word can bear at most one primary stress.",
        "Yang (2004) evaluated the effectiveness of the USC in conjunction with a simple approach to using transitional probabilities, showing significant performance improvements.",
        "The availability of such stress cues is not, however, an uncontroversial assumption; there are no language-universal cues to stress and even within a single language automatic detection of word-level stress is still unreliable (Van Kuijk and Boves, 1999), making automatic capture of such data for simulation purposes difficult.",
        "Before taking advantage of word-level stress information, the infant learner would need to identify the acoustic correlates to word-level stress in her language, and we will not address the specific mechanisms that an infant learner may use to accomplish the task of identifying word-level stress in this paper.",
        "Based on strong experimental evidence that infants discriminate between weakly and strongly stressed syllables and use it to group syllables into word-like units (Jusczyk et al., 1999), we assume that an infant may attend to this cue and we evaluate our model with and without it.",

        "Any utterance in which a word could not be transcribed using CMUDICT was excluded, leaving 55,840 utterances.",

        "For any n adjacent primary-stress syllables, only the nth syllable retains primary stress; all others are made into weak syllables.",
        "This reflects the fact that stress clash is avoided in English and that infants may not reliably detect acoustic correlates of stress in the input.",
        "In addition to variations of our algorithm, we evaluated a baseline segmenter which marks every syllable boundary as a word boundary, treating each syllable as a word.",
        "We tested five variants of our algorithm, adding combinations of USS, subtractive segmentation, and adding beam search with a beam size of two to subtractive segmentation.",

        "The segmenter's task is effectively to classify each syllable boundary as a word boundary or not.",

        "The standard metric of evaluating precision and recall over word boundaries rather than words identified in each utterance also contributes to this performance; when this baseline is evaluated with a word-level precision and recall it does not perform as well (Lignos and Yang, 2010).",
        "Subtractive Segmentation provides an improvement in utterance evaluation over the Syllable Baseline, and adding beam search to it slightly improves F-score, sacrificing precision for recall.",

        "Other research has suggested a more complex hierarchy of cues (Mat-tys et al., 2005), but how the weighting of the various cues can be adjusted with more input remains an open question.",
        "A crucial frontier in word segmentation is the expansion of evaluation to include other languages.",
        "As with many other tasks, creating solutions that perform well in a broad variety of languages is important but has not yet been pursued.",
        "Future work should attempt to match developmental patterns in other languages, which will require adding morphological complexity to the system; the techniques developed for English are unlikely to succeed unchanged in other languages.",
        "Comparing with other algorithms' published results is difficult because of varying choices of data sets and metrics.",
        "For example, other syllable-based algorithms have evaluated their performance using word-level, as opposed to boundary-level, precision and recall (Gambell and Yang, 2004; Lignos and Yang, 2010).",
        "We have adopted the more popular boundary-based metric here, but there is no way to directly compare with work that does not use syllabified input.",
        "The variety of possible evaluation metrics obviates the need for a longer-form exploration of how existing approaches perform when evaluated against varying metrics.",
        "Additionally, a more standard set of evaluation data in many languages would greatly improve the ability to compare different approaches to this task."

        "The work presented here represents a step toward bringing together developmental knowledge regarding word segmentation and computational modeling.",
        "Rather than focusing on cues in artificial learning experiments which may or may not generalize to the natural development of word segmentation in children, we have shown how a simple algorithm for segmentation mimics many of the patterns seen in infants' developing competence.",
        "We believe this work opens the door to a promising line of research that will make a stronger effort to see simulations of language acquisition as not just an unsupervised learning task but rather a modeling task that must take into account a broad variety of phenomena."
