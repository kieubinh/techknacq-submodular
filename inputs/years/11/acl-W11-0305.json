        "Algorithms should learn in a completely unsupervised fashion, should segment incrementally (i.e., segment each utterance before considering the next one), and should not have any built-in knowledge about specific natural languages (Brent, 1999).",
        "However, the word segmentation paradigm Brent describes as \"completely unsupervised\" is actually semi-supervised, because the boundaries at the beginning and end of each utterance are known to be true boundaries.",
        "A fully unsupervised paradigm would include no boundary information at all, meaning that the input is, or is treated as, a continuous sequences of phonemes.",
        "The MBDP-1 algorithm was not designed for operation in this continuous condition, as it relies on having at least some true boundary information to generalize.",
        "MBDP-1 achieves a robust form of bootstrapping through the use of Bayesian maximum-likelihood estimation of the parameters of a language model.",
        "More recent algorithms in the same tradition, including the refined MBDP-1 of Venkataraman (2001), the WordEnds algorithm of Fleck (2008), and the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) algorithm of Goldwater (2007), share this limitation.",

        "Jin, 2006) but these algorithms are easily adapted to the semi-supervised, incremental condition.",
        "Recall that these methods make one pass over the entire corpus to gather statistics, and then make a second pass to segment the corpus, thus violating Brent's requirement of incremental segmentation.",
        "To adhere to the incremental requirement, the algorithms simply must segment each sentence as it is seen, and then update their trie(s) with statistics from that sentence.",
        "While VE and PtM have no natural way to store true boundary information, and so cannot benefit from the supervision inherent in the incremental paradigm, BVE has the knowledge trie which serves exactly this purpose.",

        "If we assume children can syllabify their phonemic representation, and that word boundaries only occur at syllable boundaries, then word segmentation becomes a very different, and potentially much easier, problem.",

        "These early results, based on a corpus of child-directed speech, strongly suggest that words are objects that maximize chunkiness.",
        "Keep in mind that the chunkiness score knows nothing of words: The probabilities and entropies on which it is based are estimated from continuous sequences that contain no boundaries.",
        "It is therefore not obvious or necessary that the objects that maximize chunkiness scores should be words.",
        "It might be that letters, or phones, or morphemes, or syllables, or something altogether novel maximize chunkiness scores.",

        "Whether segmentation is performed on phonemic or syllabic sequences, and whether it is unsupervised or provided information such as utterance boundaries and pauses, information-theoretic algorithms such as VE, PtM and especially BVE perform segmentation very well.",
        "The performance of VE on BR87 is on par with other state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation algorithms such as WordEnds (Fleck, 2008) and HDP (Goldwater et al., 2009).",
        "The performance of BVE on corpora of child-directed speech is unmatched in the unconstrained case, to the best of our knowledge.",
        "These results suggest that BVE provides a single, general chunking ability that that accounts for word segmentation in both scenarios, and potentially a wide variety of other cognitive tasks as well.",
        "We now consider other properties of BVE that are especially relevant to natural language learning.",
        "Over time, BVE's knowledge trie comes to represent the distribution of phoneme sequences that begin and end words it has found.",
        "We now discuss how this knowledge trie models phonotactic constraints, and ultimately becomes an emergent lexicon.",
        "Every language has a set of constraints on how phonemes can combine together into syllables, called phonotactic constraints.",
        "These constraints affect the distribution of phonemes found at the beginnings and ends of words.",
        "For example, words in English never begin with /ts/, because it is not a valid syllable onset in English.",
        "Knowledge of these constraints allows a language learner to simplify the segmentation problem by eliminating many possible segmentations, as demonstrated in Section 4.3.",
        "This approach has inspired algorithms in the literature, such as WordEnds (Fleck, 2008), which builds a statistical model of phoneme distributions at the beginnings and ends of words.",
        "BVE also learns a model of phonotactics at word boundaries by keeping similar statistics in its knowledge trie, but can do so in a fully unsupervised setting by inferring its own set of high-precision word boundaries with the chunk signature.",
        "VE does not represent explicitly a \"lexicon\" of chunks that it has discovered.",
        "VE produces chunks when applied to a sequence, but its internal data structures do not represent the chunks it has discovered explicitly.",
        "By contrast, BVE stores boundary information in the knowledge trie and refines it over time.",
        "Simply by storing the beginnings and endings of segments, the knowledge trie comes to store sequences like #cat#, where # represents a word boundary.",
        "The set of such bounded sequences constitutes an emergent lexicon.",
        "After segmenting a corpus of child-directed speech, the ten most frequent words of this lexicon are you, the, that, what, is, it, this, what's, to, and look.",
        "Of the 100 most frequent words, 93 are correct.",
        "The 7 errors include splitting off morphemes such as ing, and merging frequently co-occurring word pairs such as do you."

        "Recently, researchers have begun to empirically assess the degree to which segmentation algorithms accurately model human performance.",

        "Frank et al.",
        "(2010) compared the segmentation predictions made by TP and a Bayesian Lexical model against the segmentation performance of adults, and found that the predictions of the Bayesian model were a better match for the human data.",
        "As mentioned in Section 4.3, computational evaluation has demonstrated repeatedly that TP provides a poor model of segmentation ability in natural language.",
        "Any of the entropic chunking methods investigated here can explain the artificial language results motivating TP, as well as the segmentation of natural language, which argues for their inclusion in future empirical investigations of human segmentation ability.",
        "The word segmentation problem provides a revealing case study of the relationship between nativism and statistical learning.",
        "The initial statistical proposals, such as TP, were too simple to explain the phenomenon.",
        "However, robust statistical methods were eventually developed that perform the linguistic task successfully.",
        "With statistical learning models in place that perform as well as (or better than) models based on innate knowledge, the argument for an impoverished stimulus becomes difficult to maintain, and thus the need for a nativist explanation is removed.",
        "Importantly, it should be noted that the success of a statistical learning method is not an argument that nothing is innate in the domain of word segmentation, but simply that it is the learning procedure, rather than any specific linguistic knowledge, that is innate.",
        "The position that a statistical segmentation ability is innate is bolstered by speech segmentation experiments with cotton-top tamarins (Hauser et al., 2001) that have yielded similar results to Saffran's experiments with human infants, suggesting that the ability may be present in the common ancestor of humans and cotton-top tamarins.",
        "Further evidence for a domain-general chunking ability can be found in experiments where human subjects proved capable of discovering chunks in a single continuous sequence of non-linguistic inputs.",
        "Saffran et al.",
        "(1999) found that adults and 8-month-old infants were able to segment sequences of tones at the level of performance previously established for syllable sequences (Saffran et al., 1996).",
        "Hunt and Aslin (1998) measured the reaction time of adults when responding to a single continuous sequence of light patterns, and found that subjects quickly learned to exploit predictive subsequences with quicker reactions, while delaying reaction at subsequence boundaries where prediction was uncertain.",
        "In both of these results, as well as the word segmentation experiments of Saffran et al., humans learned to segment the sequences quickly, usually within minutes, just as general chunking algorithms quickly reach high levels of performance."

        "We have shown that a domain-independent theory of chunking can be applied effectively to the problem of word segmentation, and can explain the ability of children to segment a continuous sequence, which other computational models examined here do not attempt to explain.",
        "The human ability to segment continuous sequences extends to non-linguistic domains as well, which further strengthens the general chunking account, as these chunking algorithms have been successfully applied to a diverse array of non-linguistic sequences.",
        "In particular, BVE combines the power of the information-theoretic chunk signature with a bootstrapping capability to achieve high levels of performance in both the continuous and incremental paradigms."

        "In English, where many words in child-directed speech are mono-morphemic, the difference between finding words and finding morphs is small.",
        "In some languages, ignoring the word/morph distinction is likely to be a more costly assumption, especially for highly agglutinative or even polysynthetic languages.",
        "One possibility that merits further exploration is that, in such languages, morphs rather than words are the units that optimize chunkiness."
