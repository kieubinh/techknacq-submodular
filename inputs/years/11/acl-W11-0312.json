        "A child learning his or her native language typically does so while interacting with other people who are using the language to communicate in shared situations.",
        "The correspondence between situations and utterances seems likely to be a very important source of information for the language learner.",
        "Once a child begins to produce his or her own utterances, other people's responses to them (or lack thereof) are another source of information about the language.",
        "When the child's utterances fall short of adult-level competence, sometimes the other person in the conversation will repeat the child's utterance in a more correct form.",
        "A number of studies have focused on the phenomenon of such corrections and questions of their frequency in child-directed speech",
        "*Research supported by the National Science Foundation, Grant CCF-0916389.",
        "and whether children can and do make use of them; some of these studies are discussed in the next section.",
        "In this paper we construct a computational model with a learner and a teacher who interact in a sequence of shared situations.",
        "In each situation the teacher and learner interact as follows.",
        "First the learner uses what it has learned about the language to (attempt to) generate an utterance appropriate to the situation.",
        "The teacher then analyzes the correctness of the learner's utterance and either generates an utterance intended as a correction of the learner's utterance, or generates another utterance of its own appropriate to the situation.",
        "Finally, the learner uses information given by its own utterance, the teacher's utterance and the situation to update its knowledge of the language.",
        "At the conclusion of this interaction, a new interaction is begun with the next situation in the sequence.",
        "Both the learner and the teacher engage in comprehension and production of utterances which are intended to be appropriate to their shared situation.",
        "This setting allows us to study several questions: whether the teacher can offer meaningful corrections to the learner, whether the learner can detect intended corrections by the teacher, and whether the presence of corrections by the teacher has an effect on language acquisition by the learner.",
        "For our model, the answer to each of these questions is yes, and while the model is in many respects artificial and simplified, we believe it sheds new light on these issues.",

        "Formal models of language acquisition have mainly focused on learning from positive data, that is, utterances that are grammatically correct.",

        "Chomsky's poverty of stimulus argument has been used to support the idea of human innate linguistic capacity.",
        "It is claimed that there are principles of grammar that cannot be learned from positive data only, and negative evidence is not available to children.",
        "Hence, since children do not have enough evidence to induce the grammar of their native language, the additional knowledge language learners need is provided by some form of innate linguistic capacity.",
        "E. M. Gold's negative results in the framework of formal language learning have also been used to support the innateness of language.",
        "Gold proved that superfinite classes of languages are not learn-able from positive data only, which implies than none of the language classes defined by Chomsky to model natural language is learnable from positive data only (Gold, 1967).",
        "Brown and Hanlon (Brown and Hanlon, 1970) studied negative evidence understood as explicit approvals or disapprovals of a child's utterance (e.g.,\"That's right\" or \"That's wrong.\")",
        "They showed that there is no dependence between these kinds of answers and the grammaticality of children's utterances.",
        "These results were taken as showing that children do not receive negative data.",
        "But do these results really show this?",
        "It seems evident that parents rarely address their children in that way.",
        "During the first stages of language acquisition children make a lot of errors, and parents are not constantly telling them that their sentences are wrong; rather the important thing is that they can communicate with each other.",
        "However, it is worth studying whether other sources of negative evidence are provided to children.",
        "Is this the only form of negative data?",
        "Do adults correct children in a different way?",
        "Some researchers have studied other kinds of negative data based on reply-types (e.g., Hirsh-Pasek et al.",
        "(Hirsh-Pasek et al., 1984), Demetras et al.",
        "(Demetras et al., 1986) and Morgan and Travis (Morgan and Travis, 1989).)",
        "These studies argue that parents provide negative evidence to their children by using different types of reply to grammatical versus ungrammatical sentences.",
        "Marcus analyzed such studies and concluded that there is no evidence that this kind of feedback (he called it noisy feedback) is required for language learning, or even that it exists (Marcus, 1993).",
        "He argued for the weakness, inconsistency and inherently artificial nature of this kind of feedback.",
        "Moreover, he suggested that even if such feedback exists, a child would learn which forms are erroneous only after complex statistical comparisons.",
        "Therefore, he concluded that internal mechanisms are necessary to explain how children recover from errors in language acquisition.",
        "Since the publication of the work of Marcus, the consensus seemed to be that children do not have access to negative data.",
        "However, a study carried out by Chouinard and Clark shows that this conclusion may be wrong (Chouinard and Clark, 2003).",
        "First, they point out that the reply-type approach does not consider whether the reply itself also contains corrective information, and consequently, replies that are corrective are erroneously grouped with those that are not.",
        "Moreover, if we consider only reply-types, they may not help to identify the error made.",
        "Hence, Chouinard and Clark propose another view of negative evidence that builds on Clark's principle of contrast (Clark, 1987; Clark, 1993).",
        "Parents often check up on a child's erroneous utterances, to make sure they have understood them.",
        "They do this by reformulating what they think the child intended to express.",
        "Hence, the child's utterance and the adult's reformulation have the same meaning, but different forms.",
        "Because children attend to contrasts in form, any change in form that does not mark a different meaning will signal to children that they may have produced an utterance that is not acceptable in the target language.",
        "In this way, reformulations identify the locus of any error, and hence the existence of an error.",
        "Chouinard and Clark analyze longitudinal data from five children between two and four years old, and show that adults reformulate erroneous child utterances often enough to help learning.",
        "Moreover, these results show that children not only detect differences between their own utterance and the adult reformulation, but that they make use of that information.",
        "In this paper we explore this new view of negative data proposed by Chouinard and Clark.",
        "Corrections (in form of reformulations) have a semantic component that has not been taken into account in previous studies.",
        "Hence, we propose a new computational model of language learning that gives an account of meaning-preserving corrections, and in which we can address questions such as: What are the effects of corrections on learning syntax?",

        "We assume each utterance in the target language is assigned a unique meaning.",
        "An utterance is denoting in a situation if the meaning assigned to utterance is denoting in the situation.",

        "The learner attempts to produce a denoting utterance for the situation, and the teacher analyzes the learner's utterance and decides whether to produce a correction of the learner's utterance or a new denoting utterance of its own.",
        "Finally, the learner uses the situation and the teacher's utterance to update its current grammar for the language.",
        "In this section we describe the algorithms used by the learner and teacher to carry out the steps of this process.",
        "4.1 Comprehension and the co-occurrence graph.",
        "To process the teacher's utterance, the learner records the words in the utterance and the predicates in the situation in an undirected co-occurrence graph.",
        "Each node is a word or predicate symbol and there is an edge for each pair of nodes.",
        "Each node u has an occurrence count, c(u), recording the number of utterances or situations it has occurred in.",
        "Each edge (u,v) also has an occurrence count, c(u,v), recording the number of utterance/situation pairs in which the endpoints of the edge have occurred together.",
        "From the co-occurrence graph the learner derives a directed graph with the same nodes, the implication graph, parameterized by a noise threshold 9 (set at 0.95 in the experiments.)",
        "For each ordered pair of nodes u and v, the directed edge (u, v) is included in the implication graph if c(u, v)/c(u) > 9.",
        "The learner then deletes edges from predicates to words and computes the transitively reduced implication graph.",
        "The learner uses the transitively reduced implication graph to try to find the meaning of the teacher's utterance by translating the words of the utterance into a set of sequences of predicates, and determining if there is a unique denoting meaning corresponding to one of the predicate sequences.",
        "If so, the unique meaning is generalized into a general form by replacing each predicate by its category generalization.",
        "For example, if the learner detects the unique meaning (trl (xi), rel (xi)), it is generalized to the general form (shapel (xi), oolorl (xi)).",
        "The learner's set of general forms is the basis for its production.",
        "4.2 Production by the learner.",
        "Each general form denotes the set of possible meanings obtained by substituting appropriate symbols from P for the category symbols.",
        "To produce a denoting utterance for a situation, the learner finds all the meanings generated by its general forms using predicates from the situation and tests each meaning to see if it is denoting, producing a set of possible denoting meanings.",
        "If the set is empty, the learner produces no utterance.",
        "Otherwise, it attempts to translate each denoting meaning into an utterance.",
        "The learner selects one of these utterances with a probability depending on a number stored with the corresponding general form recording the last time a teacher utterance matched it.",
        "This ensures that repeatedly matched general forms are selected with asymptotically uniform probability, while general forms that are only matched a few times are selected with probability tending to zero.",
        "4.3 From meaning to utterance.",
        "The process the learner uses to produce an utterance from a denoting meaning is as follows.",
        "For a meaning that is a sequence of k atoms, there are two related sequences of positions: the atom positions 1,2,..., k and the gap positions 0,1,..., k. The atom positions refer to the corresponding atoms, and gap position i refers to the position to the right of atom i, (where gap position 0 is to the left of atom ai.)",
        "The learner generates a sequence of zero or more words for each position in left to right order: gap position 0, atom position 1, gap position 1, atom position 2, and so on, until gap position k. The resulting sequences of words are concatenated to form the final utterance.",
        "The choice of what sequence of words to produce for each position is represented by a decision tree.",
        "For each variable atom the learner has encountered, there is a decision tree that determines what sequence of words to produce for that atom in the context of the whole meaning.",
        "For example, in a sublanguage of Spanish in which there are both masculine and feminine nouns for shapes, the atom rel (xi) has a decision tree that branches on the value of the shape predicate applied to xi to select either rojo or roja as appropriate.",
        "For the gap positions, there are decision trees indexed by the generalizations of all the variable atoms that have occurred; the variable atom at position i is generalized, and the corresponding decision tree is used to generate a sequence ofwords for gap positioni.",
        "Gap position 0 does not follow any atom position and has a separate decision tree.",
        "If there is no decision tree associated with a given atom or gap position in a meaning, the learner falls back on a \"telegraphic speech\" strategy.",
        "For a gap position with no decision tree, no words are produced.",
        "For an atom position whose atom has no associated decision tree, the learner searches the transitively reduced implication graph for words that approximately imply the predicate of the atom and chooses one of maximum observed frequency.",
        "4.4 The teacher's response.",
        "If the learner produces an utterance, the teacher analyzes it and then chooses its own utterance for the situation.",
        "The teacher may find the learner's utterance correct, incorrect but correctable, or incorrect and uncorrectable.",
        "If the learner's utterance is incorrect but correctable, the teacher chooses a possible correction for it.",
        "The teacher randomly decides whether or not to use the correction as its utterance according to the correction probability.",
        "If the teacher does not use the correction, then its own utterance is chosen uniformly at random from the denoting utterances for the situation.",
        "If the learner's utterance is one of the correct denoting utterances for the situation, the teacher classifies it as correct.",
        "If the learner's utterance is not correct, the teacher \"translates\" the learner's utterance into a sequence of predicates by using the meaning transducer for the language.",
        "If the resulting sequence of predicates corresponds to a denoting meaning, the learner's utterance is classified as having an error in form.",
        "The correction is chosen by considering the denoting utterances with the same sequence of predicates as the learner's utterance, and choosing one that is \"most similar\" to the learner's utterance.",
        "For example, if the learner's utterance was el elipse pequeno and (ell, sml ) corresponds to a denoting utterance for the situation, the teacher chooses la elipse pequena as the correction.",
        "If the learner's utterance is neither correct nor an error in form, the teacher uses a measure of similarity between the learner's sequence of predicates and those of denoting utterances to determine whether there is a \"close enough\" match.",
        "If so, the teacher classifies the learner's utterance as having an error in meaning and chooses as the possible correction a denoting utterance whose predicate sequence is \"most similar\" to the learner's predicate sequence.",
        "If the learner produces an utterance and none of these cases apply, then the teacher classifies the learner's utterance as uninterpretable and does not offer a correction.",
        "When the teacher has produced an utterance, the learner analyzes it and updates its grammar of the language as reflected in the co-occurrence graph, the general forms, and the decision trees for word choice.",
        "The decision trees are updated by computing an alignment between the teacher's utterance and the learner's understanding of the teacher's meaning, which assigns a subsequence of words from the utterance to each atom or gap position in the meaning.",
        "Each subsequence of words is then added to the data for the decision tree corresponding to the position of that subsequence.",
        "If the learner has produced an utterance and finds that the teacher's utterance has the same meaning, but is expressed differently, then the learner classifies the teacher's utterance as a correction.",

        "Our model of language is very simplified, and would have to be modified to deal with issues such as multi-word phrases bearing meaning, morphological relations between words, phonological rules for word choice, words with more than one meaning and meanings that can be expressed in more than one way, languages with freer word-orders and meaning components expressed by non-contiguous sequences of words.",
        "Other desirable directions to explore include more sophisticated use of cooccurrence information, more powerful methods of learning the grammars of meanings, feedback to allow the learning of production to improve comprehension, better methods of alignment between utterances and meanings, methods to allow the learner's semantic categories to evolve in response to language learning, and methods allowing the learner to make use of its ability to detect corrections.",
