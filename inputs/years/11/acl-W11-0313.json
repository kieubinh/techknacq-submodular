        "Linear classifiers model the response as a weighted linear combination of the features in input instances.",
        "A supervised approach to learning a linear classifier involves learning the weights for the features from labeled data.",
        "A large number of labeled instances may be needed to determine the class association of the features and learn accurate weights for them.",
        "Alternatively, the user may directly label the features.",
        "For example, for a sentiment classification task, the user may label features, such as words or phrases, as expressing positive or negative sentiment.",
        "Prior work (Raghavan et al., 2006; Zaidan et al., 2007) has demonstrated that users are able to reliably provide useful feedback on features.",
        "Direct feedback on a list of features (Raghavan et al., 2006; Druck et al., 2008) is limited to simple features like unigrams.",
        "However, unigrams are limited in the linguistic phenomena they can capture.",
        "Structured features such as dependency relations, paths in syntactic parse trees, etc., are often needed for learning the target concept (Pradhan et al., 2004; Joshi and Rose, 2009).",
        "It is not clear how direct feature feedback can be extended straightforwardly to structured features, as they are difficult to present visually for feedback and may require special expertise to comprehend.",
        "An alternative approach is to seek indirect feedback on structured features (Arora and Nyberg, 2009) by asking the user to highlight spans of text, called rationales, that support the instance label (Zaidan et al., 2007).",
        "For example, when classifying the sentiment of a movie review, rationales are spans of text in the review that support the sentiment label for the review.",
        "Assuming a fixed cost per unit of work, it might be cheaper to ask the user to label a few features, i.e. identify relevant features and their class association, than to label several instances.",
        "Prior work (Ragha2009; Zaidan et al., 2007) has shown that a combination of instance and feature labeling can be used to reduce the total annotation cost required to learn the target concept.",
        "However, the benefit from feature feedback may vary across learning problems.",
        "If we can estimate the benefit from feature feedback for a given problem, we can minimize the total annotation cost for achieving the desired performance by selecting the optimal annotation strategy (feature feedback or not) at every stage in learning.",
        "In this paper, we present the ground work for this research problem by analyzing how benefit from feature feedback varies across different learning problems and what characteristics of a learning problem have a significant effect on benefit from feature feedback.",
        "We define a learning problem (P = {D, G, F, L, I, S}) as a tuple of the domain (D), instance granularity (G), feature representation (F), labeled data units (L), amount of irrelevant text (I) and instance selection strategy (S).",
        "With enough labeled data, we may not benefit from feature feedback.",
        "Benefit from feature feedback also depends on the features used to represent the instances.",
        "If the feature space is large, we may need several labeled instances to identify the relevant features, while relatively fewer labeled features may help us quickly find these relevant features.",
        "Apart from the feature space size, it also matters what types of features are used.",
        "When hand crafted features from a domain expert are used (Pradhan et al., 2004) we expect to gain less from feature feedback as most of the features will be relevant.",
        "On the other hand, when features are extracted automatically as patterns in annotation graphs (Arora et al., 2010) feature feedback can help to identify relevant features from the large feature space.",
        "In active learning, instances to be labeled are selectively sampled in each iteration.",
        "Benefit from feature feedback will depend on the instances that were used to train the model in each iteration.",
        "In the case of indirect feature feedback through rationales or direct feature feedback in context, instances selected will also determine what features receive feedback.",
        "Hence, instance selection strategy should affect the benefit from feature feedback.",
        "In text classification, an instance may contain a large amount of text, and even a simple unigram representation will generate a lot of features.",
        "Often only a part of the text is relevant for the classification task.",
        "For example, in movie reviews, often the reviewers talk about the plot and characters in addition to providing their opinion about the movie.",
        "Often this extra information is not relevant to the classification task and bloats the feature space without adding many useful features.",
        "With feature feedback, we hope to filter out some of this noise and improve the model.",
        "Thus, the amount of irrelevant information in the instance should play an important role in determining the benefit from feature feedback.",
        "We expect to see less of such noise when the text instance is more concise.",
        "For example, a movie review snippet (about a sentence length) tends to have less irrelevant text than a full movie review (several sentences).",
        "In addition to analyzing document instances with varying amount of noise, we also compare the benefit from feature feedback for problems with different granularity.",
        "Granularity for a learning problem is defined based on the average amount of text in its instances.",
        "Benefit from feature feedback will also depend on how feedback is solicited from the user and how it is incorporated back into the model.",
        "Independently from these factors, we estimate the maximum possible benefit and analyze how it varies across problems.",
        "Next we describe measures proposed in the literature and propose some new ones for categorizing learning problems.",

        "They categorize problems in terms of their feature complexity.",
        "Feature complexity is defined in terms of the minimum number of features required to learn a good classifier (close to maximum performance).",
        "If the concept can be described by a weighted combination of a few well-selected features, it is considered to be of low complexity.",
        "In this estimate of complexity, an assumption is made that the best performance is achieved when the learner has access to all available features and not for any subset of the features.",
        "This is a reasonable assumption for text classification problems with robust learners like SVMs together with appropriate regularization and sufficient training data.",
        "Instead of evaluating all possible combinations of features to determine the minimum number of features required to achieve close to the best performance, feature complexity is estimated using an intelligent ranking of the features.",
        "This ranking is based on their discriminative ability determined using a large amount of labeled data (referred to as oracle) and a feature selection criterion such as Information Gain (Rijsbergen, 1979).",
        "It is intuitive that the rate of learning, i.e., the rate at which performance improves as we add more features to the model, is also associated with problem complexity.",

        "The three feature complexity measures proposed by Raghavan et al.",
        "(2007) are the following: 1) Feature size complexity (Nf): Logarithm (base 2) of the number of features needed to achieve 95% of the best performance (when all instances are available), 2) Feature profile complexity (Fpc), given by Fpc = 1 – pfl, and 3) Combined feature complexity (Cf ), Cf = Fpc * nf, incorporates both the learning profile and the number of features required.",
        "In order to evaluate the benefit from feature feedback, Raghavan et al.",
        "(2007) use their tandem learning approach of interleaving instance and feature feedback (Raghavan et al., 2006), referred to as interactive feature selection (ifs).",
        "The features are labeled as 'relevant' (feature discriminates well among the classes), or 'non-relevant/don't know'.",
        "The labeled features are incorporated into learning by scaling the value of the relevant features by a constant factor in all instances.",
        "Raghavan et al.",
        "(2007) measure the benefit from feature feedback as the gain in the learning speed with feature feedback.",
        "The learning speed measures the rate of performance improvement with increasing amount of supervision.",
        "It is defined in terms of the convergence profile similar to feature learning convergence profile in Equation 1, except in terms of the number of labeled units instead of the number of features.",
        "A labeled unit is either a labeled instance or an equivalent set of labeled features with the same annotation time.",
        "The benefit from feature feedback is then measured as the difference in the convergence profile with interactive feature selection (pifg) and with labeled instances only (pal).",
        "Raghavan et al.",
        "(2007) analysed 9 corpora and 358 binary classification tasks.",
        "Most of these corpora, such as Reuters (Lewis, 1995), 20-newsgroup (Lang, 1995), etc., have topic-based category labels.",
        "For all classification tasks, they used simple and fixed feature space containing only unigram features (n-gram features were added where it seemed to improve performance).",
        "They observed a negative correlation (r = – 0.65) between the benefit from feature feedback and combined feature complexity (Cf ), i.e., feature feedback accelerates active learning by an amount that is inversely proportional to the feature complexity of the problem.",
        "If a concept can be expressed using a few well-selected features from a large feature space, we stand to benefit from feature feedback as few labeled features can provide this information.",
        "On the other hand, if learning a concept requires all or most of the features in the feature space, there is little knowledge that feature feedback can provide."

        "Table 3: Correlation coefficient (R) for feature size complexity (Nf ), feature profile complexity (Fpc) and combined feature complexity (Cf ) with improvement in performance (IP) and improvement in learning rate (ILR).",
        "All results are statistically significant (p < 0.05)",
        "Feature complexity measures require an 'oracle' simulated using a large amount of labeled data which is not available for real annotation tasks.",
        "In Section 3.2, we proposed measures based on model's uncertainty that do not require an oracle.",
        "We calculate the mean, maximum and median of the probability scores from the learned model on instances in the held out dateset.",
        "We found a significant but low negative correlation of these measures with improvement in performance with feature feedback (maxProb = – 0.384, meanProb = – 0.256, medianProb = – 0.242).",
        "This may seem counterintuitive.",
        "However, note that when the training data is very small, the model might be quite certain about its prediction even when it is wrong and feature feedback may help by correcting the model's beliefs.",
        "We observed that these probability measures have only medium and significant positive correlation (around 0.5) with training datasize.",
        "Also, the held out dataset we used may not be representative of the whole set and using a larger dataset may give us more accurate estimate of the model's uncertainty.",
        "There are also other ways to measure the model's uncertainty, for example, in SVMs the distance of an instance from the decision boundary gives us an estimate of the model's uncertainty about that instance.",

        "In this work, we analyze how the benefit from feature feedback varies with different problem characteristics and how measures for categorizing learning problems correlate with benefit from feature feedback.",
        "We define a problem instance as a tuple of domain, instance granularity, feature representation, labeled data, amount of irrelevant text and selective sampling strategy.",
        "We compare the two annotation strategies, with and without feature feedback, in terms of both improvement in performance at a given stage in learning and improvement in learning rate.",
        "Instead of evaluating the benefit from feature feedback using a specific feedback incorporation approach, we estimate and compare how the maximum benefit from feature feedback varies across different learning problems.",
        "This tells us what is the best feature feedback can do for a given learning problem.",
        "We find a strong and significant correlation between feature complexity measures and the two measures of maximum benefit from feature feedback.",
        "However, these measures require an 'oracle', simulated using a large amount of labeled data which is not available in real world annotation tasks.",
        "We present measures based on the uncertainty of the model on its prediction that do not require an oracle.",
        "The proposed measures have a low but significant correlation with benefit from feature feedback.",
        "In our current work, we are exploring other measures of uncertainty of the model.",
        "It is intuitive that a metric that measures the uncertainty of the model on parameter estimates should correlate strongly with benefit from feature feedback.",
        "Variance in parameter estimates is one measure of uncertainty.",
        "The Bootstrap or Jacknife method (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994) of resampling from the training data is one way of estimating variance in parameter estimates that we are exploring.",
        "So far only a linear relationship of various measures with benefit from feature feedback has been considered.",
        "However, some of these relationships may not be linear or a combination of several measures together may be stronger indicators of the benefit from feature feedback.",
        "We plan to do further analysis in this direction in the future.",
        "We only considered one selective sampling strategy based on model's uncertainty which we found to provide more benefit from feature feedback.",
        "In the future, we plan to explore other selective sampling strategies.",
        "For example, density-based sampling (Donmez and Carbonell, 2008) selects the instances that are representative of clusters of similar instances, and may facilitate more effective feedback on a diverse set of features.",
        "In this work, feature feedback was simulated using an oracle.",
        "Feedback from the users, however, might be less accurate.",
        "Our next step will be to analyze how the benefit from feature feedback varies as the quality of feature feedback varies.",
        "Our eventual goal is to estimate the benefit from feature feedback for a given problem so that the right annotation strategy can be selected for a given learning problem at a given stage in learning and the total annotation cost for learning the target concept can be minimized.",
        "Note that in addition to the characteristics of the labeled data analyzed so far, expected benefit from feature feedback will also depend on the properties of the data to be labeled next for the two annotation strategies - with or without feature feedback."
