        "The training of single word based translation models (Brown et al., 1993b; Vogel et al., 1996) is an essential building block for most state-of-the-art translation systems.",
        "Indeed, even more refined translation models (Wang and Waibel, 1998; Sumita et al., 2004; Deng and Byrne, 2005; Fraser and Marcu, 2007a) are initialized by the parameters of single word based ones.",
        "The exception is here the joint approach of Marcu and Wong (2002), but its refinement by Birch et al.",
        "(2006) again relies on the well-known IBM models.",
        "Traditionally (Brown et al., 1993b; Al-Onaizan et al., 1999) single word based models are trained by the EM-algorithm, which has the advantageous property that the collection of counts can be decomposed over the sentences.",
        "Refinements that also allow symmetrized models are based on bipartite graph matching (Matusov et al., 2004; Taskar et al., 2005) or quadratic assignment problems (LacosteJulien et al., 2006).",
        "Recently, Bodrumlu et al.",
        "(2009) proposed the first method that treats a non-decomposable problem by handling all sentence pairs at once and via integer linear programming.",
        "Their (non-probabilistic) approach finds dictionaries with a minimal number of entries.",
        "However, the approach does not include a position model.",
        "In this work we combine the two strategies into a single framework.",
        "That is, the dictionary sparsity objective of Bodrumlu et al.",
        "will become a regularity term in our framework.",
        "It is combined with the maximal alignment probability of every sentence pair, where we consider the models IBM-1, IBM-2 and HMM.",
        "This allows us to write dictionary sparsity as the (non-convex) L0 norm of the dictionary parameters of the respective models.",
        "For supervised training, regularity terms are quite common, e.g. (Taskar et al., 2005; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006).",
        "For the unsupervised problem addressed in this paper they have recently been introduced in the form of posterior constraints (Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "In related fields of NLP lately Dirichlet priors have been investigated, e.g. (Johnson, 2007).",
        "We present two strategies to handle the objective function addressed in this paper.",
        "One of these schemes relies, like (Germann et al., 2004; LacosteJulien et al., 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2008; Bo-drumlu et al., 2009), on integer linear programming (see e.g. (Schrijver, 1986; Achterberg, 2007)), but due to the large-scale nature of our problem we solve only the LP-relaxation, followed by successive strengthening.",
        "For the latter, we develop our own, exponentially large set of cuts and show that it can be handled as a polynomially sized system, though in practice this is too inefficient."

        "Before we introduce our objective function we give a brief description of the (standard) models we consider.",
        "In all cases, one is given a set of bilingual sentence pairs containing a foreign language and English.",
        "The models formalize the probability of obtaining the foreign sentence from a given English sentence, by considering hidden variables called alignments:",
        "Pd,i(fs|es) = Pd,i(fs, as|es) .",
        "Here, the subscripts d and l denote two sets of parameters: whereas the set l defines the probability of an alignment without knowing any of the sentences, d describes the translational probability given an alignment and a source sentence.",
        "For a source (English) sentence of length I and a target (foreign) sentence of length J, the set of admissible alignments is generally the set of subsets of {1,..., I} x {1,..., J}.",
        "However, for computational reasons the considered models only allow restricted alignments, where each target word may align to at most one source word.",
        "Any such alignment is expressed as a vector aJ G {0,..., I} J.",
        "For a source sentence es = e{ and a target sentence fs = /J, the considered models all factor as follows:",
        "In all cases, the translational probability is non-parametric, i.e. d contains one parameter for every co-occurring pair of source and target words.",
        "Since the model is probabilistic, the parameters of all / for a given e have to sum up to one.",
        "With respect to the alignment probability, the models differ.",
        "For the IBM-1 the set l is actually empty, sopl(aj\\aj_1,j,I) = + 1).",
        "TheIBM-2 models p(aj ), with a respective set of parameters.",
        "Finally, the HMM models p(aj\\aj_i, I).",
        "It is common to further reduce the alignment parameters.",
        "In this paper we consider a nonparametric distribution for the IBM-2, but both a nonparamet-ric and a parametric one for the HMM.",
        "In contrast to GIZA++, we have a parameter for every possible difference, i.e. we do not group differences with absolutes greater than 5.",
        "Also, commonly one uses a distribution p(i\\i', I) = r(i â€“ %')/Yli\"=1 r(i\" ~ i'), but for technical reasons, we drop the denominator and instead constrain the r( )-parameters to sum to 1 .",
        "In future work we hope to implement both the normalization and the grouping of bins.",
        "Originally the considered models were used for the actual translation problem.",
        "Hence, the parameters d and l had to be inferred from a training corpus, which was based on maximizing the probability",
        "Today the major application of the models lies in word alignment.",
        "Instead of estimating continuous parameters, one is now faced with the discrete optimization problem of assigning a single alignment to every sentence pair in the corpus.",
        "This lead to the recent innovative work of (Bodrumlu et al., 2009) where the alignments are the only unknown quantities.",
        "Nevertheless, the use of probabilistic models remains attractive, in particular since they contribute statistics of likely alignments.",
        "In this work, we combine the two concepts into the criterion where A > 0 is a weighting parameter and we now estimate a single alignment for every sentence.",
        "The second term denotes the Lo-norm of the translational parameters, i.e. the numberofnon-zero parameters.",
        "Since we only consider a single alignment per sentence, this term is equivalent to Bo-drumlu et al.",
        "'s objective function.",
        "Minimizing the first term is closely related to the common criterion (2).",
        "For parameter estimation it is known as the maximum approximation, but for word alignment it is a perfectly valid model.",
        "For the IBM-1 model the first term alone results in a convex, but not strictly convex minimization problem.",
        "However, EM-like iterative methods generally do not reach the minimum: they are doing block coordinate descent (Bertsekas, 1999, chap.",
        "2.7) which generally gives the optimum only for strictly convex functions.",
        "Indeed, our experiments showed a strong dependence on initialization and lead to heavily local solutions.",
        "In the following we present two strategies to minimize the new objective.",

        "Ignoring the L0-term for the moment, we now make use of a result of (Vicente et al., 2009) in their recent work on histogram-based image segmentation: for any given set of alignments, the inner minimization over the parameters is solved by relative frequencies.",
        "When plugging this solution into the functional, one gets a model that does not decompose over the sentences, but one that is still reasonably easy to handle.",
        "Before we get into details, we observe that this minimizer is valid even when including the L0 term: if two words are never linked, both terms will set the respective parameter to 0.",
        "If they are linked, however, then setting this parameter to 0 would make the first term infinite.",
        "All non-zero parameters are treated equally by the L0 term, so the restriction to relative frequencies does not change the optimal value.",
