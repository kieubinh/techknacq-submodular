        "The problem of authorship attribution - attributing texts to their original authors - has received considerable attention in the last decade (Juola, 2006; Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "Most of the work in this field focuses on cases where texts must be attributed to one of a few candidate authors, e.g., (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Gamon, 2004).",
        "Recently, researchers have turned their attention to scenarios with tens to thousands of candidate authors (Koppel et al., 2011).",
        "In this paper, we study authorship attribution with few to many candidate authors, and introduce a new method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in the latter case.",
        "Our approach to authorship attribution consists of building models of authors and their texts using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "We compare these models to models built from texts with unknown authors to find the most likely authors of these texts (Section 3.2).",

        "The field of authorship attribution predates modern computing.",
        "For example, in the late 19th century, Mendenhall (1887) suggested that word length can be used to distinguish works by different authors.",
        "In recent years, increased interest in authorship attribution was fuelled by advances in machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing (Juola, 2006; Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "Commonly used features in authorship attribution range from \"shallow\" features, such as token and character n-gram frequencies, to features that require deeper analysis, such as part-of-speech and rewrite rule frequencies (Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "As in other text classification tasks, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have delivered high accuracy, as they are designed to handle feature vectors of high dimensionality (Juola, 2006).",
        "For example, one-vs.-all (OVA) is an effective approach to using binary SVMs for multi-class (i.e., multi-author) problems (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004).",
        "Given A authors,",
        "OVA trains A binary classifiers, where each classifier is trained on texts by one author as positive examples and all the other texts as negative examples.",
        "However, if A is large, each classifier has many more negative than positive examples, often yielding poor results due to class imbalance (Raskutti and Kowal-czyk, 2004).",
        "Other setups, such as one-vs.-one or directed acyclic graph, require training O(A) classifiers, making them impractical where thousands of authors exist.",
        "Multi-class SVMs have also been suggested, but they generally perform comparably to OVA while taking longer to train (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004).",
        "Hence, using SVMs for scenarios with many candidate authors is problematic (Koppel et al., 2011).",
        "Recent approaches to employing binary SVMs consider class similarity to improve performance (Bickerstaffe and Zukerman, 2010; Cheng et al., 2007).",
        "We leave experiments with such approaches for future work (Section 5).",
        "In this paper, we focus on authorship attribution with many candidate authors.",
        "This problem was previously addressed by Madigan et al.",
        "(2005) and Luy-ckx and Daelemans (2008), who worked on datasets with texts by 114 and 145 authors respectively.",
        "In both cases, the reported results were much poorer than those reported in the binary case.",
        "More recently, Koppel et al.",
        "(2011) considered author similarity to handle cases with thousands of candidate authors.",
        "Their method, which we use as our baseline, is described in Section 3.1.",
        "Our approach to authorship attribution utilises Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) to build models of authors from their texts.",
        "LDA is a generative probabilistic model that is traditionally used to find topics in textual data.",
        "The main idea behind LDA is that each document in a corpus is generated from a distribution of topics, and each word in the document is generated according to the per-topic word distribution.",
        "Blei et al.",
        "(2003) showed that using LDA for dimensionality reduction can improve performance for supervised text classification.",
        "We know of only one case where LDA was used in authorship attribution: Rajkumar et al.",
        "(2009) reported preliminary results on using LDA topic distributions as feature vectors for SVMs, but they did not compare the results obtained with LDA-based SVMs to those obtained with SVMs trained on tokens directly.",
        "Our comparison shows that both methods perform comparably (Section 4.3).",
        "Nonetheless, the main focus of our work is on authorship attribution with many candidate authors, where it is problematic to use SVMs.",

        "This section describes the authorship attribution methods considered in this paper.",
        "While all these methods can employ various representations of documents, e.g., token frequencies or part-of-speech n-gram frequencies, we only experimented with token frequencies.",
        "This is because they are simple to extract, and can achieve good performance (Section 4).",
        "Further, the focus of this paper is on comparing the performance of our methods to that of the baseline methods.",
        "Thus, we leave experiments on other feature types for future work (Section 5).",
        "We consider two baseline methods, depending on whether there are two or many candidate authors.",
        "If there are only two, we use Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which have been shown to deliver state-of-the-art performance on this task (Juola, 2006).",
        "If there are many, we follow Koppel et al.",
        "'s (2011) approach, which we denote KOP.",
        "The main idea behind KOP is that different pairs of authors may be distinguished by different subsets of the feature space.",
        "Hence, KOP randomly chooses k\\ subsets of size k2F (k2 < 1) from a set of F features; for each of the k\\ subsets, it calculates the cosine similarity between a test document and all the documents by one author (each author is represented by one feature vector); it then outputs the author who had most of the top matches.",
        "KOP also includes a threshold a* to handle cases where a higher level of precision is required, at the cost of lower recall.",
        "If the top-matching author was the top match less than a* times, then KOP outputs \"unknown author\".",
        "In our experiments we set a* =0 to obtain full coverage, as this makes it easier to interpret the results using a single measure of accuracy.",
        "In this work, we follow the extended LDA model defined by Griffiths and Steyvers (2004).",
        "Under the assumptions of the extended model, given a corpus of M documents, a document i with N tokens is generated by choosing a document topic distribution 6i ~ Dir (a), where Dir(a) is a T-dimensional symmetric Dirichlet distribution, and a and T are parameters of the model.",
        "Then, each token in the document Wij is generated by choosing a topic from the document topic distribution zij ~ Multinomial(6i), and choosing a token from the token topic distribution Wij ~ Multinomial ((f)Zij ), where ffZij ~ Dir(ß), and ß is a parameter of the model.",
        "The model can be inferred from the data using Gibbs sampling, as outlined in (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) - an approach we follow in our experiments.",
        "Note that the topics obtained by LDA do not have to correspond to actual, human-interpretable topics.",
        "A more appropriate name may be \"latent factors\", but we adopt the convention of calling these factors \"topics\" throughout this paper.",
        "The meaning of the factors depends on the type of tokens that are used as input to the LDA inference process.",
        "For example, if stopwords are removed from the corpus, the resulting factors often, but not necessarily, correspond to topics.",
        "However, if only stopwords are retained, as is commonly done in authorship attribution studies, the resulting factors lose their in-terpretability as topics; rather, they can be seen as stylistic markers.",
        "Note that even if stopwords are discarded, nothing forces the factors to stand for actual topics.",
        "Indeed, in a preliminary experiment on a corpus of movie reviews and message board posts, we found that some factors correspond to topics, with words such as \"noir\" and \"detective\" considered to be highly probable for one topic.",
        "However, other factors seemed to correspond to authorship style as reflected by authors' vocabulary, with net-speak words such as \"wanna\", \"alot\" and \"haha\" assigned to one topic, and words such as \"compelling\" and \"beautifully\" assigned to a different topic.",
        "We consider two ways of using LDA in authorship attribution: (1) Topic SVM, and (2) LDA+Hellinger.",
        "The LDA part of both approaches consists of applying a frequency filter to the features in the training documents, and then using LDA to reduce the dimensionality of each document to a topic distribution of dimensionality T.",
        "Topic SVM.",
        "The topic distributions are used as features for a binary SVM classifier that discriminates between authors.",
        "This approach has been employed in the past for document classification, e.g., in (Blei et al., 2003), but it has been applied to authorship attribution only in a limited study that considered just stopwords (Rajkumar et al., 2009).",
        "In Section 4.3, we present the results of more thorough experiments in applying this approach to binary authorship attribution.",
        "Our results show that the performance of this approach is comparable to that obtained without using LDA.",
        "This indicates that we do not lose authorship-related information when employing LDA, even though the dimensionality of the document representations is greatly reduced.",
        "LDA+Hellinger.",
        "This method is our main contribution, as it achieves state-of-the-art performance in authorship attribution with many candidate authors, where it is problematic to use SVMs (Section 2).",
        "The main idea of our approach is to use the Hellinger distance between document topic distributions to find the most likely author of a document: D(e1,02) = ^2 EL (\\/0M - y^t) where 0%is a T-dimensional multinomial topic distribution, and 6iyt is the probability of the t-th topic.",
        "We propose two representations of an author's documents: multi-document and single-document.",
        "• Multi-document (LDAH-M).",
        "The LDA model is built based on all the training documents.",
        "Given a test document, we measure the Hellinger distance between its topic distribution and the topic distributions of the training documents.",
        "The author with the lowest mean distance for all of his/her documents is returned as the most likely author of the test document.",
        "• Single-document (LDAH-S).",
        "Each author's documents are concatenated into a single document (the profile document), and the LDA model is learned from the profile documents.Given a test document, the Hellinger distance between the topic distributions of the test document and all the profile documents is measured, and the author of the profile document with the shortest distance is returned.",
        "The time it takes to learn the LDA model depends on the number of Gibbs samples S, the number of tokens in the training corpus W, and the number of topics T. For each Gibbs sample, the algorithm iterates through all the tokens in the corpus, and for each token it iterates through all the topics.",
        "Thus, the time complexity of learning the model is O(SWT).",
        "Once the model is learned, inferring the topic distribution of a test document of length N takes O(SNT).",
        "Therefore, the time it takes to classify a document when using LDAH-S is O(SNT+AT), where A is the number of authors, and O(T) is the time complexity of calculating the Hellinger distance between two T-dimensional distributions.",
        "The time it takes to classify a document when using LDAH-M is O(SNT + MT), where M is the total number of training documents, and M > A, because every candidate author has written at least one document.",
        "An advantage of LDAH-S over LDAH-M is that LDAH-S requires much less time to classify a test document when many documents per author are available.",
        "However, this improvement in runtime may come at the price of accuracy, as authorship markers that are present only in a few short documents by one author may lose their prominence if these documents are concatenated to longer documents.",
        "In our evaluation we found that LDAH-M outperforms LDAH-S when applied to one of the datasets (Section 4.3), while LDAH-S yields a higher accuracy when applied to the other two datasets (Sections 4.4 and 4.5).",
        "Hence, we present the results obtained with both variants."

        "For this purpose, we split the dataset according to the prolificness of the authors, i.e., we ordered the authors by the number of blog posts, and considered subsets that contain all the posts by the 1000, 2000, 5000 and 19320 most prolific authors.",
        "Due to the large number of posts, we could not run KOP for more than k\\ = 10 iterations on the smallest subset of the dataset and 5 iterations on the other subsets, as the runtime was prohibitive for more iterations.",
        "For example, 10 iterations on the smallest subset required about 90 hours per fold (the LDA+Hellinger runtimes were substantially shorter, with maximum runtimes of 56 hours for LDAH-S and 77 hours for LDAH-M, when 200 topics were considered).",
        "Interestingly, running KOP for 5 iterations on the larger subsets decreased performance compared to running it for 1 iteration.",
        "Thus, on the larger subsets, the most accurate KOP results took less time to obtain than those of our LDA+Hellinger variants.",
        "Figure 4 shows the results of this experiment.",
        "For each author subset, it compares the results obtained by LDAH-S and LDAH-M to the best result obtained by KOP.",
        "All the differences between the methods are statistically significant.",
        "For up to 2000 prolific authors (Figures 4(a), 4(b)), LDAH-S outperforms KOP by up to 50%.",
        "For 5000 prolific users (figure omitted due to space limitations), the methods perform comparably, and KOP outperforms LDAH-S by a small margin.",
        "However, with all the authors (Figure 4(c)), KOP yields a higher accuracy than both LDA+Hellinger variants.",
        "This may be because considering non-prolific authors introduces noise that results in an LDA model that does not capture the differences between authors.",
        "However, it is encouraging that LDAH-S outperforms KOP when less than 5000 prolific authors are considered.",

        "In this paper, we introduced an approach to authorship attribution that models texts and authors using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and considers the distance between the LDA-based representations of the training and test texts when classifying test texts.",
        "We showed that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance in terms of classification accuracy when tens or a few thousand authors are considered, and prolific authors exist in the training data.",
        "This accuracy improvement was achieved together with a substantial reduction in runtime compared to Koppel et al.",
        "'s (2011) baseline method.",
        "While we found that our approach performs well on texts by prolific authors, there is still room for improvement on authors who have not written many texts - an issue that we will address in the future.",
        "One approach that may improve performance on such authors involves considering other types of features than tokens, such as parts of speech and character n-grams.",
        "Since our approach is based on LDA, it can easily employ different feature types, which makes this a straightforward extension to the work presented in this paper.",
        "In the future, we also plan to explore ways of extending LDA to model authors directly, rather than using it as a black box.",
        "Authors were considered by Rosen-Zvi et al.",
        "(2004; 2010), who extended LDA to form an author-topic model.",
        "However, this model was not used for authorship attribution, and was mostly aimed at topic modelling of multi-authored texts, such as research papers.",
        "Another possible research direction is to improve the scalability of our methods.",
        "Our approach, like Koppel et al.",
        "'s (2011) baseline, requires linear time in the number of possible authors to classify a single document.",
        "One possible way of reducing the time needed for prediction is by employing a hierarchical approach that builds a tree of classifiers based on class similarity, as done by Bickerstaffe and Zukerman (2010) for the sentiment analysis task.",
        "Under this framework, class similarity (in our case, author similarity) can be measured using LDA, while small groups of classes can be discriminated using SVMs.",
        "In addition to authorship attribution, we plan to employ text-based author models in user modelling tasks such as rating prediction - a direction that we already started working on by successfully applying our LDA-based approach to model users for the rating prediction task (Seroussi et al., 2011)."
