        "Rich and free opinions published electronically and, more recently, on the WWW offer ample opportunities to discover individual's attitudes towards certain topics, products, or services.",
        "To capitalize on this enormous body of opinions, researchers have been working in the area of opinion mining since the late 1990s.",
        "Opinion detection seeks to automatically determine the presence or absence of opinions in a text, and it is therefore a fundamental task for opinion mining.",
        "In order to capture subtle and creative opinions, opinion detection systems generally assume that a large body of opinion-labeled data are available.",
        "However, collections of opinion-labeled data are often limited, especially at the granularity level of sentences; and manual annotation is tedious, expensive and error-prone.",
        "The shortage of opinion-labeled data is less challenging in some data domains (e.g., reviews) than in others (e.g., blog posts).",
        "A simple method for improving accuracies in challenging domains would be to borrow opinion-labeled data from a non-target data domain; but this approach often fails because opinion detection strategies designed for one data domain generally do not perform well in another domain.",
        "One reason for failure of the simple transfer approach is that the information used for opinion detection is typically lexical, and lexical means of expressing opinions may vary not only from domain to domain, but also from register to register.",
        "For example, while the word \"awesome\" is a good indicator of an opinion in blogs, it is less likely to occur in the same role in newspaper texts.",
        "While it is difficult to obtain opinion-labeled data, one can easily collect almost infinite unlabeled usergenerated data that contain opinions.",
        "The use of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), motivated by limited labeled data and plentiful unlabeled data in the real world, has achieved promising results in various NLP studies (e.g., (Fürstenau and Lapata, 2009; Talukdar and Pereira, 2010)), yet it has not been fully investigated for use in opinion detection.",
        "Although studies have shown that simple SSL methods are promising for extracting opinion features or patterns using limited opinion-labeled data (e.g., (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005)), few efforts have been made either to apply SSL directly to opinion detection or to examine more sophisticated SSL methods.",
        "This research is intended to fill the gap regarding application of SSL in opinion detection.",
        "We investigate a range of SSL algorithms with a focus on self-training and co-training in three types of electronic documents: edited news articles, semi-structured movie reviews, and the informal and unstructured content of the blogosphere.",
        "We conclude that SSL is a successful method for handling the shortage of opinion labeled data and the domain transfer problem."

      "text": [
        "There is a wide range of literature on opinion detection.",
        "We concentrate here on supervised and semi-supervised approaches.",
        "Supervised learning algorithms that can automatically learn important opinion-bearing features from an annotated corpus have been adopted and investigated for opinion detection and yielded satisfying results (Wiebe et al., 2004; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Zhang and Yu, 2007).",
        "With no classification techniques developed specifically for opinion detection, state-of-the-art topical supervised classification algorithms can achieve performance comparable to complex linguistic approaches when using binary values (i.e., presence or absence) and incorporating different types of features.",
        "Commonly used opinion-bearing features include bag-of-words, POS tags, ngrams, low frequency words or unique words (Wiebe et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2007), semantically oriented adjectives (e.g., \"great\", \"poor\") and more complex linguistic patterns.",
        "Both the scale and quality of the annotated corpus play an important role in the supervised learning approach.",
        "In contrast to supervised learning, SSL learns from both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "SSL assumes that, although unlabeled data hold no information about classes (e.g., \"opinion\" or \"non-opinion\"), they do contain information about joint distribution over classification features.",
        "Therefore, when a limited set of labeled data is available in the target domain, using SSL with unlabeled data is expected to achieve an improvement over supervised learning.",
        "Self-training Self-training is the simplest and most commonly adopted form of SSL for opinion detection.",
        "Self-training was originally used to facilitate automatic identification of opinion-bearing features.",
        "For example, Riloff and Wiebe (2003) proposed a bootstrapping process to automatically identify subjective patterns.",
        "Self-training has also been applied directly for identifying subjective sentences by following a standard self-training procedure: (1) train an initial supervised classifier on the labeled data; (2) apply this classifier to unlabeled data and select the most confidently labeled data, as determined by the classifier, to augment the labeled data set; and (3) retrain the classifier by restarting the whole process.",
        "Wiebe and Riloff (2005) used a self-trained Naïve Bayes classifier for classifying subjective sentences and achieved better recall with modest precision over several rule-based classifiers.",
        "One shortcoming of self-training is that the resulting data may be biased: That is, the final labeled data may consist of examples that are easiest for this particular opinion detector to identify.",
        "Co-training The core idea of co-training is to use two classifiers and trade additional examples between them, assuming that the resulting union of classified examples is more balanced than examples resulting from using either classifier alone.",
        "When labeling new examples, a final decision is made by combining the predictions of the two updated learners.",
        "The original co-training algorithm assumes redundancy in the training data and thus more than one view can be used to represent and classify each example independently and successfully (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "For example, an image can be naturally represented by its text description or by its visual attributes.",
        "Even when a natural split in the feature set is not available, studies have shown that the key to co-training is the existence of two largely different initial learners, regardless of whether they are built by using two feature sets or two learning algorithms (Wang and Zhou, 2007).",
        "When there are different views for the target examples, co-training is conceptually clearer than self-training, which simply mixes features.",
        "Since co-training uses each labeled example twice, it requires less labeled data and converges faster than self-training.",
        "However, the lack of natural feature splits has kept researchers from exploring co-training for opinion detection.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the only co-training application for opinion detection was reported by Jin et al.",
        "(2009), who created disjoint training sets for building two initial classifiers and successfully identified opinion sentences in camera reviews by selecting auto-labeled sentences agreed upon by both classifiers.",
        "EM-Based SSL Expectation-Maximization (EM) refers to a class of iterative algorithms for maximum-likelihood estimation when dealing with incomplete data.",
        "Nigam et al.",
        "(1999) combined EM with a Naive Bayes classifier to resolve the problem of topical classification, where unlabeled data were treated as incomplete data.",
        "The EM-NB SSL algorithm yielded better performance than either an unsupervised lexicon-based approach or a supervised approach for sentiment classification in different data domains, including blog data (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Takamura et al., 2006).",
        "No opinion detection applications of EM-based SSL have been reported in the literature.",
        "SVMs Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a natural extension of SVMs in the semi-supervised spectrum.",
        "They are designed to find the maximal margin decision boundary in a vector space containing both labeled and unlabeled examples.",
        "Although SVMs are the most favored supervised learning method for opinion detection, SVMs have not been used in opinion detection.",
        "Graph-based SSL learning has been successfully applied to opinion detection (Pang and Lee, 2004) but is not appropriate for dealing with large scale data sets.",
        "When there are few opinion-labeled data in the target domain and/or when the characteristics of the target domain make it challenging to detect opinions, opinion detection systems usually borrow opinion-labeled data from other data domains.",
        "This is especially common in opinion detection in the bl-ogosphere (Chesley et al., 2006).",
        "To evaluate this shallow approach, Aue and Gamon (2005) compared four strategies for utilizing opinion-labeled data from one or more non-target domains and concluded that using non-targeted labeled data without an adaptation strategy is less efficient than using labeled data from the target domain, even when the majority of labels are assigned automatically by a self-training algorithm.",
        "Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) and Tan et al.",
        "(2009) implemented domain adaptation strategies for sentiment analysis.",

        "While SSL is especially attractive for opinion detection because it only requires a small number of labeled examples, the studies described in the previous section have concentrated on simple SSL methods.",
        "We intend to fill this research gap by comparing the feasibility and effectiveness of a range of SSL approaches for opinion detection.",
        "Specifically, we aim to achieve the following goals:",
        "First, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the utility of SSL in opinion detection.",
        "We examine four major SSL methods: self-training, co-training, EM-NB, and SVM.",
        "We focus on self-training and co-training because they are both wrapper approaches that can be easily adopted by any existing opinion detection system.",
        "Second, to design and evaluate co-training strategies for opinion detection.",
        "Since recent work has shown that co-training is not restricted by the original multi-view assumption for target data and that it is more robust than self-training, we evaluate new co-training strategies for opinion detection.",

        "It is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy.",
        "Since a document is normally a mixture of facts and opinions (Wiebe et al., 2001), sub-document level opinion detection is more useful and meaningful than document-level opinion detection.",
        "Thus, we conduct all experiments on the sentence level.",
        "The remainder of this section explains the data sets and tools used in this study and presents the experimental design and parameter settings.",
        "Three types of data sets have been explored in opinion detection studies: news articles, online reviews, and online discourse in blogs or discussion forums.",
        "These three types of text differ from one another in terms of structure, text genre (e.g., level of formality), and proportion of opinions found therein.",
        "We selected a data set from each type in order to investigate the robustness and adaptability of SSL algorithms for opinion detection and to test the feasibility of SSL for domain adaptation.",
        "Movie Review One of the standard data sets in opinion detection is the movie review data set created by Pang and Lee (2004).",
        "It contains 5,000 subjective sentences or snippets from the Rotten Tomatoes pages and 5,000 objective sentences or snippets from IMDB plot summaries, all in lowercase.",
        "Sentences containing less than 10 tokens were excluded and the data set was labeled automatically by assuming opinion inheritance: every sentence in an opinion-bearing document expresses an opinion, and every sentence in a factual document is factual.",
        "Although this assumption appears to be acceptable for movie review data, it is generally unreliable for other domains.",

        "This set is widely used as a gold-standard corpus in opinion detection research.",
        "According to the coding manual (Wiebe et al., 1999), subjective sentences are those expressing evaluations, opinions, emotions, and speculations.",
        "For our research, 5,174 objective sentences and 5,297 subjective sentences were selected based on the absence or presence of manually labeled subjective expressions.",
        "JDPA Blog Post The JDPA corpus (Kessler et al., 2010) is a new opinion corpus released in 2010.",
        "It consists of blog posts that express opinions about automobile and digital cameras with named entities and sentiments expressed about them manually annotated.",
        "For our purpose, we extracted all sentences containing sentiment-bearing expressions as subjective sentences and manually chose objective sentences from the rest by eliminating subjective sentences that were not targeted to any labeled entities.",
        "After this process, we had approximately 10,000 subjective sentences and 4,348 objective sentences.",
        "To balance the number of subjective and objective sentences, we used 4,348 sentences from each category.",
        "We removed a small number of stop words.",
        "No stemming was conducted since the literature shows no clear gain from stemming in opinion detection.",
        "One reason for this may be that stemming actually erases subtle opinion cues such as past tense verbs.",
        "All words were converted to lowercase and numbers were replaced by a placeholder #.",
        "Both unigrams and bigrams were generated for each sentence.",
        "Each data set was randomly split into three portions: 5% of the sentences were selected as the evaluation set and were not available during SSL and supervised learning (SL) runs; 90% were treated as unlabeled data (U) for SSL runs and i% (1 < i < 5) as labeled data (L) for both SL and SSL runs.",
        "For each SSL run, a baseline SL run was designed with the same number of labeled sentences (i%) and a full SL run was designed with all available sentences (90% + If effective, an SSL run would significantly outperform its corresponding baseline SL run and approach the performance of a full SL run.",
        "We conducted three groups of experiments: 1) to investigate the effectiveness of the SSL approach for opinion detection; 2) to explore different co-training strategies; and 3) to evaluate the applicability ofSSL for domain adaptation.",
        "The Naive Bayes classifier was selected as the initial classifier for self-training because of its ability to produce prediction scores and to work well with small labeled data sets.",
        "We used binary values for unigram and bigram features, motivated by the brevity of the text unit at the sentence level as well as by the characteristics of opinion detection, where occurrence frequency has proven to be less influential.",
        "We implemented two feature selection options: Chi square and Information Gain.",
        "Parameters for SSL included: (1) Threshold k for number of iterations.",
        "If k is set to 0, the stopping criterion is convergence; (2) Number of unlabeled sentences available in each iteration u (u << U); (3) Number of opinion and non-opinion sentences, p and n, to augment L during each iteration; and (4) Weighting parameter A for auto-labeled data.",
        "When A is set to 0, auto-labeled and labeled data are treated equally; when A is set to 1, feature values in an auto-labeled sentence are multiplied by the prediction score assigned to the sentence.",
        "We used the WEKA data mining software (Hall et al., 2009) for data processing and classification of the self-training and co-training experiments.",

        "SVMs implemented in SVM1ight (Joachims, 1999) and based on local search were adopted for the SVM runs.",
        "Since hyper-parameter optimization for EM-NB and SVM is not the focus of this research and preliminary explorations on parameter settings suggested no significant benefit, default settings were applied for EM-NB and SVM.",
        "For co-training, we investigated five strategies for creating two initial classifiers following the criteria that these two classifiers either capture different features or based on different learning assumptions.",
        "Two initial classifiers were generated: (1) Using unigrams and bigrams respectively to create two classifiers based on the assumption that low-order n-grams and high-order n-grams contain redundant information and represent different views of an example: content and context; (2) Randomly splitting feature set into two; (3) Randomly splitting training set into two; (4) Applying two different learning algorithms (i.e., Naïive Bayes and SVM) with different biases; and (5) Applying a character-based language model (CLM) and a bag-of-words (BOW) model where the former takes into consideration the sequence of words while the latter does not.",
        "In practice, for strategy (1), bigrams were used in combination with unigrams because bigrams alone are weak features when extracted from limited labeled data at sentence level.",
        "Auto-labeled sentences were selected if they were assigned a label that both classifiers agreed on with highest confidence.",
        "Because our initial classifiers violated the original co-training assumptions, forcing agreement between confident predictions improved the maintenance of high precision.",

        "Further investigation is needed for an in-depth explanation.",
        "The best co-training runs reported in Table 1 and Figure 1 used an 8-grams CLM to train one classifier and a BOW model to train the other classifier.",
        "These two classifiers differ both in feature representation (i.e., character vs. word) and in learning algorithm (language model vs. pure statistical model).",
        "To investigate whether the two different classifiers improve each other's performance during iterations, we analyzed the CLM and BOW classifiers individually.",
        "When comparing the BOW classifier during co-training iterations to the performance of corresponding SL runs based on BOW, the former using both CLM and BOW classifiers always outperformed the latter, indicating that the BOW classifier learned from CLM.",
        "Similarly, the CLM classifier also gained from the BOW classifier during co-training.",
        "Figure 2 shows that for the movie review domain, other simple co-training configurations also produced promising results by using different feature sets (e.g., unigrams and the union of unigrams and bigrams, or randomly split feature sets) or different training sets.",
        "In the news domain, we observed similar trends.",
        "This shows the robustness and great potential of co-training.",
        "Because even with the logistic model to output probabilistic scores for the SVM classifier, the difference in probabilities was too small to select a small number of top predictions, adding an SVM classifier for co-training did not improve accuracy and is not discussed here.",
        "An observation of the performance of self-training and co-training over iterations confirmed that co-training used labeled data more effectively for opinion detection than self-training, as suggested for traditional topical classification.",
        "We found that, overall, co-training produces better performance than self-training and reaches optimal performance faster.",
        "For instance, with 500 labeled sentences, a self-training run reached an optimal classification accuracy of 88.2% after adding 4,828 automatically annotated sentences for training, while the co-training run reached an optimal performance of 89.4% after adding only 2,588 sentences.",
        "Even without any explicit domain adaptation methods, results indicate that simple self-training alone is promising for tackling domain transfer between the source domain movie reviews and the target domains news articles and blog posts.",
        "Target domain news articles We used 9,500 labeled movie review sentences to train a Naive Bayes classifier for news articles.",
        "Although this classifier produced a fairly good classification accuracy of 89.2% on movie review data, its accuracy was poor (64.1%) on news data (i.e., domain-transfer SL), demonstrating the severity ofthe domain transfer problem.",
        "Self-training with Naïve Bayes using unlabeled data from the news domain (i.e., domaintransfer SSL run) improved the situation somewhat: it achieved a classification accuracy of 75.1% surpassing the domain-transfer SL run by more than 17%.",
        "To finvestigate how well SSL handles the domain transfer problem, a full in-domain SL run that used all labeled news sentences was also performed.",
        "This full SL run achieved 76.9% classification accuracy, only 1.8% higher than the domain-transfer SSL run, which did not use any labeled news data.",
        "Target domain blog posts Because blog data are more challenging than news data, we kept 5% blog data as labeled data.",
        "Both SSL runs with and without out-of-domain data are depicted in Figure 3.",
        "Self-training using only blog data decreases SL baseline performance (dashed black line).",
        "Keeping the same settings, we added additional labeled data from the movie reviews, and self-training (gray line) came",
        "X: # iteration Y: classification accuracy (%)",
        "Figure 3: Self-training for domain transfer between movie reviews (source domain) and blogs (target domain)",
        "closer to the performance of the full SL run (red line), which used 90% of the labeled blog data.",
        "We then added a control factor that reduced the impact of movie review data gradually (i.e., a decrease of 0.001 in each iteration).",
        "Using this control, the self-training run (solid black line) reached and occasionally exceeded the performance of the full SL run."

        "We investigated major SSL methods for identifying opinionated sentences in three domains.",
        "For movie review data, SSL methods attained state-of-the-art results with a small number of labeled sentences.",
        "Even without a natural feature split, different co-training strategies increased the baseline SL performance and outperformed other SSL methods.",
        "Due to the nature of the movie review data, we suspect that opinion detection on movie reviews is an 'easy' problem because it relies, strictly speaking, on distinguishing movie reviews from plot summaries, which also involves genre classification.",
        "For other manually created data sets that are expected to reflect real opinion characteristics, the SSL approach was impeded by low baseline precision and showed limited improvement.",
        "With the addition of out-of-domain labeled data, however, self-training exceeded full SL.",
        "This constitutes a successful new approach to domain adaptation.",
        "Future work will include integrating opinion lexicons to bootstrap baseline precision and exploring co-training for domain adaptation."
