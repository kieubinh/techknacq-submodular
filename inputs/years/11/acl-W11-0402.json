        "In the last 15 years, the heterogeneity of linguistic annotations has been identified as a key problem limiting the interoperability and reusability of NLP tools and linguistic data collections.",
        "The multitude of linguistic tagsets complicates the combination of NLP modules within a single pipeline; similar problems exist in language documentation, typology and corpus linguistics, where researchers are interested to access and query data collections on a homogeneous terminological basis.",
        "One way to enhance the consistency of linguistic annotations is to provide explicit semantics for tags by grounding annotations in terminology repositories such as the General Ontology of Linguistics Descriptions (Farrar and Langen-doen, 2003, GOLD) or the ISO TC37/SC4 Data Category Registry (Kemps-Snijders et al., 2009, ISOcat).",
        "Reference definitions provide an inter-lingua that allows the mapping of linguistic annotations from annotation scheme A to scheme B.",
        "This application requires linking annotation schemes with the terminological repository.",
        "This relation can be formalized within the Linked Data paradigm (Berners-Lee, 2006), which requires the use of uniform resource identifiers (URIs), the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), standard representation formats (such as RDF) and links to other URIs.",
        "Here, we propose a formalization of this linking in OWL/DL, a notational variant of the Description Logic SHOIM(D) that builds on RDF and Linked Data.",
        "Another way to enhance the consistency of linguistic annotations is to make use of cross-linguistic meta schemes or annotation standards, problem is that these enforce the use of the same categories across multiple languages, and this may be inappropriate for historically and geographically unrelated languages.",
        "For specific linguistic and historical regions, the application of standardization approaches has, however, been performed with great success, e.g., for Western (Leech and Wilson, 1996) and Eastern Europe (Erjavec et al., 2003) or the Indian subcontinent (Baskaran et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we illustrate differences and commonalities of both approaches by creating an OWL/DL terminology repository from the MULTEXT-East (MTE) specifications (Erjavec et al., 2003; Erjavec, 2010), which define features for the morphosyntactic level of linguistic description, instantiate them for 16 languages and provide morphosyntactic tagsets for these languages.",
        "The specifications are a part of the MTE resources, which also include lexicons and an annotated parallel corpus that use these morphosyn-tactic tagsets.",
        "The encoding of the MTE specifications follows the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines, TEI P5 (TEI Consortium, 2007), and this paper concentrates on developing a semi-automatic procedure for converting them from TEI XML to OWL.",
        "While TEI is more appropriate for authoring the specifications and displaying them in a book-oriented format, the OWL encoding has the advantages of enabling formally specifying interrelationships between the various features (concepts, or classes) and making logical inferences based on the relationships between them, useful in mediating between different tagsets and tools (Chiarcos, 2008)."

        "There have been, by now, several approaches to develop terminology repositories and data category registries for language resources, systems for mapping between diverse (morphosyn-tactic) vocabularies and for integrating annotations from different tools and tagsets, ranging from early texts on annotation standards (Bakker et al., 1993; Leech and Wilson, 1996) over relational models and concept hierarchies (Bickel and Nichols, 2002; Rosen, 2010) to more formal specifications in OWL/RDF (or with OWL/RDF export), e.g., the already mentioned GOLD and ISOcat, OntoTag (Aguado de Cea et al., 2002) or the Typological Database System ontology (Saulwick et al., 2005).",
        "Despite their common level of representation these efforts have not yet converged into a unified and generally accepted ontology of linguistic annotation terminology and there is still a considerable amount of disagreement between their definitions.",
        "As these repositories nevertheless play an important role in their respective communities, it is desirable to link the MTE specifications with the most representative of them, notably with GOLD and the morphosyntactic profile of ISOcat.",
        "As we argue below, different design decisions in the terminology repositories make it necessary to use a linking formalism that is capable of expressing both disjunctions and conjunctions of concepts.",
        "For this reason, we propose the application of OWL/DL.",
        "By representing the MTE specifications, the repositories, and the linking between them as separate OWL/DL models, we follow the architectural concept of the OLiA architecture (Chiar-cos, 2008), see Sect.",
        "5.",
        "The classic approach to link annotations with reference concepts is to specify rules that define a direct mapping (Zeman, 2008).",

        "'new palace', a Prussian royal palace in Potsdam/Germany.",
        "Palais is thus both a proper noun (in its function), and a common noun (in its form).",
        "Such conceptual overlap is sometimes represented with a specialized tag, e.g., in the TIGER scheme (Brants and Hansen, 2002).",
        "ISOcat (like other terminological repositories) does currently not provide the corresponding hybrid category, so that Palais is to be linked to both properNoun/DC-1371 and commonNoun/DC-1256 if the information carried by the original annotation is to be preserved.",
        "Contractions pose similar problems: English gonna combines going (PTB tag vbg, Marcus et al., 1994) and to (to).",
        "If whitespace tokenization is applied, both tags need to be assigned to the same token.",
        "A related problem is the representation of ambiguity: The SUSANNE (Sampson, 1995) tag ICSt applies to English after both as a preposition and as a subordinating conjunction.",
        "The corresponding ISOcat category is thus either preposition/DC-1366 or subordinating Conjunction/DC-1393.",
        "Without additional disambiguation, ICSt needs to be linked to both data categories.",
        "Technically, such problems can be solved with a 1:n mapping between annotations and reference concepts.",
        "Yet, overlap/contraction and ambiguity differ in their meaning: While overlapping/contracted categories are in the intersection (n) of reference categories, ambiguous categories are in their join (U).",

        "We have described the semi-automatic creation of an ontological model of the MTE morphosyn-tactic specifications for 16 different languages.",
        "Such a model may be fruitfully applied in various ways, e.g., within an NLP pipeline that uses ontological specifications of annotations rather than their string representations (Buyko et al., 2008; Hellmann, 2010).",
        "The ontological modeling may serve also as a first step towards an ontology-based documentation of the annotations within a corpus query system or even the ontological modeling of entire corpora (Burchardt et al., 2008; Hellmann et al., 2010) and lexicons (Martin et al., 2009).",
        "As an interesting side-effect of the OWL conversion of the entire body of MTE resources, they could be easily integrated with existing lexical-semantic resources as Linked Data, e.g., OWL/RDF versions of WordNet (Gangemi et al., 2003), which are currently being assembled by various initiatives, e.g., in the context of the LOD2 project (http://lod2.eu) and by the Open Linguistics Working Group at the OpenKnowledge Foundation (http://linguistics .okfn.org).",
        "Another very important element is that the ontological modeling of the MTE annotations allows it to be interpreted in terms of existing repositories of annotation terminology such as ISOcat and GOLD.",
        "A bridge between these terminology repositories and the MTE ontology may be developed, for example, by integrating the ontology in an architecture of modular ontologies such as the Ontologies of Linguistic Annotations (Chiarcos, 2008, OLiA), where the linking between annotations and terminology repositories is mediated by a so-called 'Reference Model' that serves as an interface between different levels of representation.",
        "The MTE ontology will be integrated in this model as an annotation model, i.e., its concepts will be defined as subconcepts of concepts of the OLiA Reference Model and thereby inherit the linking with GOLD (Chiarcos et al., 2008) and ISOcat (Chiarcos, 2010).",
        "The linking with these standard repositories increases the comparability of MTE annotations and it serves an important documentation function.",
        "More important than merely potential applications of the MTE ontology, however, is that its creation provides us with a new, global perspective on the MTE specifications.",
        "A number of internal inconsistencies could be identified and strategies for their resolution (or formalization) were developed.",
        "Redundancies and overload were documented, and we further added expert definitions of controversial or non-standard concepts.",
        "When used as a documentation, these specifications may prevent misunderstandings with respect to the meaning of the actual annotations.",
        "For later versions of the MTE morphosyntactic specifications, they may even guide the refactoring of the annotation scheme.",
        "The result of the development process described above is a prototype, that has to be augmented with definitions for non-controversial and well-understood concepts, which can be derived from the linking with OLiA, GOLD and ISOcat.",
        "As for its language type, our strategy to resolve overload requires OWL/DL (owl:join).",
        "Without value overload and redundancy, the ontology would be OWL/Lite, as were the initial ontologies (Sect.",
        "4.1 and Sect.",
        "4.2).",
        "However, the current modeling is still sufficiently restricted to allow the application of reasoners, thereby opening up the possibility to use SemanticWeb technologies on MTE data, to connect it with other sources of information and to draw inferences from such Linked Data.",
        "We would also like to point out that the conversion of the MTE specifications to OWL required relatively little effort.",
        "The total time required for conversion (without the revision phase) took approximately four days of work for a computational linguist familiar with OWL and part-of-speech tagsets in general (the most labor-intense part were discussions and literature consultation during the revision phase).",
        "Given the complexity of the MTE specifications (a highly elaborate set of morphosyntactic specifications for 16typolog-ically diverse languages and with more than thousand tags for many of the languages), this may be regarded an upper limit for the time necessary to create OWL models for annotation schemes.",
        "We have thus not only shown that the ontological modeling of annotation schemes is possible and that it allows us to use our data in novel ways and to perform consistency control, but also that this was achievable with relatively low efforts in time and personnel."
