        "Since an increasing number of annotated speech corpora become available, a number of self-learning or probabilistic models for prosodic prediction have been suggested.",
        "To obtain reliable results from data-driven models, the corpus must be large scale, noise-free and annotated consistently.",

        "As linguistically-annotated corpora became critical resources, science of corpus annotation has been highlighted and evolved to reflect various interests in the field as shown in (Ide, 2007).",
        "In order to annotate linguistic information to large-scale corpora, two methods have been used; existing natural language processing (NLP) tools such as part-of-speech taggers, syntactic parsers, sentence boundary recognizers, named entity recognizers as have been used to generate annotations for ANC data (Ide and Suderman, 2006).",
        "Big advantages of using existing tools are that much cost and time can be saved and that the annotation result is consistent.",
        "In addition, it could obtain reliable accuracies and reduce the prohibitive cost of hand-validation by combining results of multiple NLP tools.",
        "However, tagging for all other linguistic phenomena is still mainly a manual effort as presented in (Eugenio, 2000).",
        "Thus, human annotators are required for tagging, correcting or validating the linguistic information although human annotators are very expensive and inconsistent in various aspects.",
        "Linguists and language engineers have recognized the importance of the consistency of annotation among multiple annotators while they construct a large-scale corpus and have focused on how to measure the inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Their annotators had difficulties in discriminating one annotation category from others that are closely related to each other.",
        "Fellbaum et al.",
        "(1999) who performed a semantic annotation project which aimed at linking each content word in a text to a corresponding synset in WordNet found out that, with increasing polysemy, both inter-annotator and annotator-expert matches decreased significantly.",

        "A greedy algorithm for increasing the inter-annotator agreement has been suggested by Ng et al.",

        "However, automatic correction of the manual tagging cannot reflect natural linguistic information tagged by human.",

        "The designers and developers of adaptations of ToBI for other languages and dialects such as G-ToBI, GlaToBI and K-ToBI have proved the usability of their labeling system rather than have suggested the method of maintaining the intertran-scriber agreement based on the aforementioned criteria (Grice et al., 1996; Mayo et al., 1996; Jun et al., 2000)."

        "First, learning and testing of the prosodic break prediction models used a corpus constructed by a single group.",
        "Five-fold cross-validation was used for evaluating the models.",
        "Second, learning and evaluation of the models used a different corpus constructed by each group.",

        "The deterioration of the performance presented in Section 3.2 is quite considerable, despite the fact that the same genre and level of prosodic break labeling system was selected.",
        "After analyzing the data, we identified three main reasons as follows.",
        "(1) Perceptual Prominence of Prosodic Labeling Systems",
        "Despite the fact that three types of prosodic break have been commonly used in the speech engineering field for a considerable time as shown in (Ostendorf and Veilleux, 1994), they have not been clearly defined or referenced in standard prosodic labeling conventions.",
        "In particular, the notion of the minor break is rather vague, whereas those of no break and major break are intuitively clear as in (Mayo et al., 1996).",
        "In the MBC news data labeled by Postech, sentences that had all prosodic breaks tagged as no break were frequently found, even if two long clauses exist in a sentence.",
        "Most sentences had been annotated only with no break.",
        "The speaking rate of news announcers on air is relatively fast and no obvious audible break seems to exist in their speech.",
        "However, Kim (1991) showed that even well-trained news announcers rarely read a sentence without breaks.",
        "Therefore, minor breaks need to be recognized not only by the duration of the break, but also by the tonal changes or lengthening of the final syllable as shown in (Kim, 1991; Jun, 2006; Jung et al., 2008).",
        "(2) Different Perceptibility of Prosodic Breaks among Transcribers",
        "Grice et al.",
        "(1996), Mayo et al.",
        "(1996) and Jun et al.",
        "(2000) have focused on reliability-agreement between different transcribers as the main criterion of evaluation.",
        "This fact indicates that individual labeling of a single utterance can differ, because each transcriber's recognition of the prosodic labeling system varies.",
        "And, the perceptibility of each transcriber differs.",
        "A large-scale corpus is necessary for modeling a data-driven framework, and the greater the number of transcribers cooperating, the poorer the intertranscriber agreement becomes.",
        "However, maintaining the intertranscriber agreements is often neglected as empirical work when researchers build and analyze a speech annotated corpus for implementation of the prosody model.",
        "(3) Syntactic or Semantic Ambiguities",
        "A single sentence with syntactic ambiguities has several different interpretations.",
        "In spoken language, prosody prevents garden path sentences and enables resolution of syntactic ambiguity as shown in (Kjelgaard and Speer, 1999; Schafer, 1997).",
        "Sentences such as the one in the following example (E1) can be grammatically constructed with multiple syntactic structures.",

        "#: no break, //: minor break, ///: major break_",
        "The prosodic phrasing in both (a) or (b) can be correct, depending on the sentence's syntactic structure.",
        "The pattern in (E1) is quite frequent in Korean, particularly in situations where the topic is broad.",
        "This kind of syntactic ambiguity needs to be resolved by semantic or pragmatic information, since it cannot be resolved using syntactic information only.",
        "As we previously mentioned, three main problems arise when annotated speech data are both constructed by multiple labelers in a research group and the data are collected from different groups.",
        "Considering the impact of the quality of annotated corpora on the data-driven models, the overall procedure of corpus construction including the data collection and preprocess, labeling system selection and intertranscriber agreement maintenance should be designed and then evaluated as shown in Section 4."

        "The suggested method for constructing a consistently annotated corpus and validating the consistency of the resultant annotation must be applied prior to implementation of data-driven models for predicting prosodic breaks.",
        "As our future work, the resultant corpus will be used for building a robust prediction model of prosodic boundary.",
        "In addition, the method can be utilized for semantic annotation tasks, discourse tagging and others, which have a similar problem due to the differing perceptions of transcribers in recognizing the closely related categories.",
