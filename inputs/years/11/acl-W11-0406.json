        "Whereas Wikipedia currently uses only manual flagging to detect possible bias, our scheme provides a foundation for the automating of bias flagging by improving upon the methodology of annotation schemes in classic sentiment analysis.",
        "We also address challenges unique to the task of identifying biased writing within the specific context of Wikipedia's neutrality policy.",
        "We perform a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement, which shows that although the agreement scores for intra-sentential tags were relatively low, the agreement scores on the sentence and entry levels were encouraging (74.8% and 66.7%, respectively).",
        "Based on an analysis of our first implementation of our scheme, we suggest possible improvements to our guidelines, in hope that further rounds of annotation after incorporating them could provide appropriate data for use within a machine learning framework for automated detection of bias within Wikipedia."

      "text": [
        "Neutral Point of View (NPOV) is one of three core tenets of Wikipedia's content policy.",
        "Wikipedia describes NPOV as \"representing fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources\" (Wikipedia, 2011a).",
        "The collaborative design of Wikipedia is such that anyone can submit content, and so the detection and flagging of bias within articles is an essential and ongoing task in maintaining the quality and utility of Wikipedia.",
        "Currently, NPOV is enforced manually via the same open process that creates content on the site.",
        "Users can flag pages with suspect content as containing a \"NPOV dispute\".",
        "This is problematic: definitions of bias vary from editor to editor, and accusations of bias can themselves come from a biased perspective.",
        "Additionally, this practice is weighted towards the attention of Wikipedia users, such that the scrutiny an article receives is proportional to its broader popularity.",
        "For example, though the pages for Land of Israel and restaurant franchise Fresh to Order have both been flagged for NPOV disputes, they have been edited 1,480 and 46 times by 536 and 22 users, respectively (Wikipedia, 2011b; Wikipedia, 2011c).",
        "The average Wikipedia page receives just under 20 edits (Wikipedia, 2011d).",
        "In light of this, an automated pass at bias detection is highly desirable.",
        "Instead of wholesale reliance on human editors, a system based on our annotation scheme could serve as an initial filter in monitoring user contributions.",
        "If integrated into the Wikipedia framework, this system could aid in the regulation of NPOV policy violations, e.g. tracking repeat offenders.",
        "With this goal in mind we have designed Bi-asML to flag NPOV issues in a specific subset of Wikipedia articles.",
        "We have constrained our task to the pages of service providers such as small businesses, schools, and hospitals.",
        "As a genre, the pages of service providers are especially worthy of scrutiny because they are both less likely to be closely vetted, and more likely to be edited by someone with a commercial interest in the reputation of the organization.",
        "In addition, service provider pages are particularly appropriate for automatic POV-flagging because the bias complaints leveled against them tend to be much more systematic and objective compared with those of an especially controversial or divisive topic.",
        "Sentiment analysis efforts usually rely on the prior polarity of words (their polarity out of context).",
        "For example, Turney (2002) proposes a method to classify reviews as \"rec-ommended\"/\"not recommended\", based on the average semantic orientation of the review.",
        "Semantic orientation is the mutual information measure of selected phrases with the word excellent minus their mutual information with the word poor.",
        "However, as Wilson et al.",
        "(2005) point out, even using a lexicon of positive/negative words marked for their prior polarity is merely a starting point, since a word's polarity in context might differ from its prior polarity.",
        "The distinction between prior and contextual polarity is crucial for detecting bias, since words with a prior positive/negative polarity may or may not convey bias, depending on their context.",
        "Notably, the inverse is also true - generally neutral words can be used to create a favorable tone towards a sentence's topic, thereby expressing bias.",
        "An example of the latter case are the words own and even in the sentence The hospital has its own pharmacy, maternity ward, and even a morgue.",
        "Though generally neutral, their usage here contributes to the sentence's overall non-neutrality.",
        "In order to deal with contextual polarity, Wilson et al.",
        "propose a two-stage process that first uses clues marked with contextual polarity to determine whether the phrases containing these clues are polar or neutral.",
        "The second stage then determines the actual polarity of the phrases deemed non-neutral.",
        "However, Wilson et al.",
        "'s approach would not suit our task of bias detection in Wikipedia, as the abovementioned example, taken from a Wikipedia entry, shows.",
        "Blatant expression of opinions or emotions is rare in the Wikipedia entries of service providers.",
        "Words which explicitly convey that an opinion/emotion is being expressed are rarely used (e.g.",
        "I think).",
        "Rather, bias is introduced either in more subtle ways (e.g. using words that are usually neutral) or in ways that differ from the ones addressed by previous approaches.",
        "For example, bias is introduced by preceding positive information about the provided service by phrases such as it is widely believed.",
        "Clearly, this phrase does not have contextual polarity, but it does introduce bias.",
        "Within the realm of Wikipedia, phrases that create an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said when only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated, such as it is widely believed, are referred to as weasels shared task (Farkas et al., 2010), aimed at detecting uncertainty cues in texts, focused on these phrases in trying to determine whether sentences contain uncertain information.",
        "In the same vein, we include weasel words as part of our annotation scheme to detect bias.",
        "Finally, as Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) point out, although the typical word-level analysis captures the finer-grained aspects of sentiment language, it falls short in capturing broader structurally or contextually-based bias.",
        "Bias can also be introduced by repetitive usage of words that in typical usage do not have prior polarity, but when used in a repetitive manner, create a favorable depiction of a sentence's topic.",
        "This cannot be captured by approaches such as those of Wilson et al.",
        "or Turney.",
        "To tackle cases like those described above, our annotation scheme extends beyond lexical tags, and includes tags that capture dependencies between a word and its context, as well as tags that are aimed at capturing subtle expressions of bias."

        "After tagging the word/phrase level tags, the sentence should be evaluated for its neutrality, and tagged SENTENCEPOV with one of two possible attributes (POV or NPOV), depending on the word/phrase level tags it has.",
        "After all the sentences are tagged with the SEN-TENCE_POV tag, the entire entry is tagged with the ENTRY_POV tag, whose attribute values are numeric, ranging between 1 and 4, where 1 is completely neutral and 4 is clearly nonneutral (i.e., written as an advertisement).",

        "While unique is tagged as a POLARPHRASE, the other underlined elements are all REPETITION, with the attribute value set to 3, since 3 elements are repeated unnecessarily, without adding new information.",

        "The second sentence's neutrality is therefore POV, while the first one's is NPOV.",
        "As elaborated in the background section, weasel words also introduce bias, by presenting the appearance of support for statements while denying the reader the possibility to assess the viewpoint's source.",

        "These words/phrases are captured by the WEASEL tag.",

        "Otherwise, it should be tagged as POV.",
        "For example, in the sentence It is widely believed that John Smith started the tradition of pro-bono work.",
        "[1], the phrase is widely believed is tagged WEASEL, whereas [1] is tagged FACTIVEPHRASE.",
        "In addition, a",

        "The SENTENCEPOV tag will therefore have the attribute value NPOV (whereas it would be POV if there were no FACTIVEPHRASE).",
        "To further illustrate this point, consider the sentence Jones and Sons ranked number one in The American Lawyer's Annual Survey.",
        "Number one is tagged as a POLARPHRASE (positive), The American Lawyer's Annual Survey is a FACTIVE_PHRASE, and there is a LEGITIMIZE link between them.",

        ", which would have the attribute value POV, because its polar phrases have no factive phrase to back them up.",
        "Our framework also enables tagging a sentence as POV even if none of the possible tags apply to them.",
        "See Figure 1 for an example of an annotated entry.",
        "BiasML Innovations: The annotation scheme elaborated above is an innovative yet practical answer to the theoretical linguistic considerations of sentiment analysis within the genre of Wikipedia.",
        "As previously mentioned, our scheme improves upon approaches that rely upon prior polarity (e.g. Turney, 2002) by identifying cases of biased language that stem from intra-sentential and cross-sentential dependencies, rather than isolated words.",
        "Our POLARPHRASE tag resembles phrases with non-neutral contextual polarity that Wilson et al.",
        "'s (2005) approach introduces, but it captures cases that their approach does not - namely, generally neutral words that nevertheless make a sentence biased.",
        "Another innovation of our framework is enabling the legitimization of weasel words.",
        "Whereas the CoNLL-2010 shared task (Farkas et al., 2010) annotated all occurrences of weasels as uncertainty markers, we acknowledge the possibility of sources (e.g. citations) that actually nullify the weasel.",
        "The multiple-level discourse association of our tag scheme also allows observation of shifts in polarity within the larger discourse of the article.",
        "The sentence-level POV tag allows the annotator to identify the overall neutrality of each sentence, thus producing a landscape of how biased language is distributed across the article.",
        "This landscape not only provides an indicator of where to look for contextual clues and dependencies among more local tags, but it is particularly relevant to Wikipedia's wiki platform, where it is likely that different authors contributed to different portions of the article, making it more prone to variance in biased tone.",
        "While developing this scheme, we wanted to make sure it tapped into the capacity of the annotator to identify both subjective language use and objective linguistic phenomena.",
        "While tags like PERSONARTONE and WEASEL require the annotator to mark precise occurrences of language, the sentence and document-level POV tags allow the annotator to identify point of view without having to explicitly point to a specific linguistic structure.",
        "To preserve the value of the human annotator's subjective judgments, our scheme permitted the co-occurrence of a sentence or document POV tag with the absence of any local lexical tags.",
        "This allowed our scheme to recognize the difficult cases in sentiment analysis where one intuitively senses opinionated language, but is unable to formally define what makes it so.",
        "Another aim of our work was to develop a scheme that captured the way information is portrayed in Wikipedia, while avoiding judgment on what information is actually communicated.",
        "A significant source of dispute within Wikipedia is disagreement as to the veracity of an article's content; however, identification of this is truly a different task then the one we have defined here.",
        "In order to tease apart these distinct types of evaluation, annotators were instructed to identify citations that legitimize statements that are potentially POV, but not to consider the truthfulness of the statement or validity of the source when tagging."

        "Our corpus of 33 articles of varying degrees of neutrality was distributed among three annotators, each annotator receiving 2/3 of the entire corpus.",
        "The articles were presented as plain text in the annotation environment, and were stripped of images, titles, section headings, or other information extraneous to the main body of the text (inline references, however, were preserved).",
        "The annotators were graduate linguistics students.",
        "Their training consisted of a brief information session on the motivation of our work, a set of annotation guidelines, and optional question and answer sessions.",
        "Adjudication of the annotation was performed with the",
        "MAI adjudication tool (Stubbs, 2011).",
        "For each tag, an average percent agreement score was calculated (for extents and attributes) per document, then averaged to get the agreement over all documents in the corpus.",
        "Note that extent agreement was defined as strictly as possible, requiring an exact character index match, meaning cases of overlap would not be considered agreement (e.g. best and the best would not be a match, even if they referred to the same instance of best).",
        "The percent agreement scores are displayed in Table 1.",
        "Note that calculations were not performed for the LEGITMIZE link tag, because it relies on the extent of other tags.",
        "Agreement is notably stronger among the higher level tags, ENTRY_POV and SENTENCE-POV.",
        "For the ENTRY_POV neutrality attribute, we had decided to measure overall Entry_POV neutrality along a 4-point scale, after noticing our own hesitation to assign the same tag to both slightly preferential and flagrantly biased entries.",
        "However, this more nuanced system was at odds with our original objective of creating an annotation scheme for use in a binary classification of bias.",
        "Though it might manifest to different degrees, bias either is or is not present within an entry.",
        "Our intention in collapsing the scale after the fact was to recover a more organic division in Entry_POV judgments.",
        "With the built-in 4-way division, inter-annotator agreement on Entry_POV attributes stood at 42.42%.",
        "This number rose considerably when the scale was reduced to a 2-way division.",
        "To reflect the notion that any bias is unacceptable, we chose to divide EN-TRY_POV into two groups: not-at-all-biased (ENTRY_POV=1) and containing bias (EN-TRY_POV>1).",
        "This division yielded an inter-annotator agreement of 66.7%.",
        "In the case of the SENTENCEPOV attribute, which is binary, agreement on neutrality is even higher at 74.8%.",
        "The strength of scores for attributes at the sentence and document levels suggest that annotators had similar perceptions of what kinds of discourse entailed a bias not fit for an encyclopedic entry.",
        "This in turn suggests that there is conceptual validity in our task on a higher level, as well as validity in how that concept was defined and conveyed to annotators.",
        "Interestingly, agreement numbers decline for the intra-sentential tags.",
        "Both POLARPHRASE and PERSONARTONE have attribute agreement scores at or near 60%, but PERSONARTONE has an extent agreement of 33%, while POLARPHRASE has only 6.5% for extent.",
        "WEASEL and REPETITION have low scores for both extent and attribute, with REPETITION being 0% for both (note that extent agreement is a prerequisite for attribute agreement).",
        "FACTIVE_PHRASE also has low extent agreement, making extent agreement generally low across the board for intra-sentential tags.",
        "Attribute agreement is expected to be high for the intra-sentential tags, given that attributes are almost always positive (pro/positive) within the service provider genre.",
        "Based on the adjudication process, we suspect that the main contributor to instances of attribute disagreement for these tags was simply a failure on the annotators' part to specify the attribute at all, perhaps because they encountered mainly positive/pro instances of PO-LARPHRASEs/WEASELs, thereby forgetting that an attribute is relevant.",
        "The annotators also reported confusion about cases where a generally negative word/phrase is used to support or promote the article's topic (in these cases, the attribute should be positive).",

        "This annotator had set his/her acceptability threshold for this tag too low, which resulted in over-selection.",
        "This could hopefully be avoided in future annotation efforts by more exposure to correct and incorrect examples of polar phrases.",

        "Like POLARPHRASE, this makes its definition rather subjective, and thus prone to different interpretations.",
        "Throughout the corpus, all annotators tended to miss the REPETITION we had identified in the gold standard, and there were also cases of annotators marking literal repetitions that did not match the guidelines' criteria.",
        "Although the linguistic phenomenon that the REPETITION tag was intended to capture is indeed indicative of bias (especially for service provider articles), it is relatively rare.",
        "Its rarity and elusiveness, combined with the fact that agreement was 0%, would motivate us to exclude this as a tag in future versions of the annotation scheme.",
        "Table 2 reports how each annotator compares to the gold standard (which was determined by the authors).",
        "Overall, annotator B clearly outperformed the other two, with both strong precision and recall scores.",
        "For all the intra-sentential tags with the exception of WEASEL, there seems to be a consistent trend where annotator B has the highest scores, a second annotator has somewhat lower scores (either A or C), and the third one has very low scores.",
        "This trend suggests that for each of these tags, a single annotator tended to pull down its agreement scores, though not consistently the same annotator.",
        "For example, annotator C performed relatively poorly on FACTIVEPHRASE and PERSONARTONE, while the same was true for annotator A on the POLARPHRASE and REPETITION tags.",
        "For the higher level tags (SEN-",
        "TENCEPOV and ENTRYPOV), performance was excellent for all annotators, which is consistent with the percent agreement scores from",
        "Table 1.",
        "While the low individual scores on intra-sentential tags is disconcerting, the overall higher scores for annotator B are a positive indication that a decent understanding and execution of the scheme and guidelines are possible, and agreement could potentially improve greatly with better training for adherence to the guidelines in the case of the other two annotators.",
        "Post-annotation analyses have provided a basis for changes to our annotation scheme, guidelines, and implementation process for the future.",
        "In addition to the changes to the guidelines we have suggested in the previous section, we believe that the greatest amount of improvement for our tag agreement could be achieved by conducting a training session for annotators, in which they study and then practice with positive and negative examples of the different tags.",
        "This would hopefully solidify understanding of the tagging scheme, since it became apparent during comparison with the gold standard that certain annotators had trouble with specific tags.",
        "Furthermore, it would be worth experimenting with less rigorous forms of extent matching, and perhaps allowing extents with a certain degree of overlap to qualify as agreement."

        "The work presented here offers a new annotation scheme for the automatic detection of bias in the unique genre of Wikipedia entries.",
        "In addition to a tagset designed to identify linguistic characteristics associated with bias within an encyclopedic corpus, our scheme works beyond typical sentiment analysis approaches to capture cross-sentential linguistic phenomena that lead to encyclopedia bias.",
        "Strong agreement results for sentence and document levels bias tags (74.8% and 66.7%, respectively) indicate that there is conceptual validity in our task on a higher level, as well as validity in how that concept was defined and conveyed to annotators.",
        "While agreement for intra-sentential tags was lower, the fact that one annotator consistently scored high on agreement with the gold standard suggests that improved annotator training, and specification of unforeseen cases in the guidelines would provide more reliable annotator performance for these tags.",
        "It is our hope that upon implementing the suggested improvements outlined in this work, further rounds of annotation could provide appropriate data for use within a machine learning framework for automated detection of various sorts of bias within Wikipedia."
