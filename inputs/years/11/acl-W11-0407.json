        "On the basis of the success of the research on the corpus-based development in NLP, the demand for a variety of corpora has increased, for use as both a training resource and an evaluation data-set.",
        "However, the development of a richly annotated corpus such as an HPSG treebank is not an easy task, since the traditional two-step annotation, in which a parser first generates the candidates and then an annotator checks each candidate, needs intensive efforts even for well-trained annotators (Marcus et al., 1994; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998).",
        "Among many NLP problems, adapting a parser for out-domain texts, which is usually referred to as domain adaptation problem, is one of the most remarkable problems.",
        "The main cause of this problem is the lack of corpora in that domain.",
        "Because it is difficult to prepare a sufficient corpus for each domain without reducing the annotation cost, research on annotation methodologies has been intensively studied.",
        "There has been a number of research projects to efficiently develop richly annotated corpora with the help of parsers, one of which is called a discriminant-based treebanking (Carter, 1997).",
        "In discriminant-based treebanking, the annotation process consists of two steps: a parser first generates the parse trees, which are annotation candidates, and then a human annotator selects the most plausible one.",
        "One of the most important characteristics of this methodology is to use easily-understandable questions called discriminants for picking up the final annotation results.",
        "Human annotators can perform annotations simply by answering those questions without closely examining the whole tree.",
        "Although this approach has been successful in breaking down the difficult annotations into a set of easy questions, specific knowledge about the grammar, especially in the case of a deep grammar, is still required for an annotator.",
        "This would be the bottleneck to reduce the cost of annotator training and can restrict the size of annotations.",
        "Interactive predictive parsing (Sanchez-Saez et al., 2009; Sanchez-Saez et al., 2010) is another approach of annotations, which focuses on CFG trees.",
        "In this system, an annotator revises the currently proposed CFG tree until he or she gets the correct tree by using a simple graphical user interface.",
        "Although our target product is a more richly annotated treebanks, the interface of CFG can be useful to develop deep annotations such as HPSG features by cooperating with a statistical deep parser.",
        "Since CFG is easier to understand than HPSG, it can reduce the cost of annotator training; non-experts can perform annotations without decent training.",
        "As a result, crowd-sourcing or similar approach can be adopted and the annotation process would be accelerated.",
        "Before conducting manual annotation, we simulated the annotation procedure for validating our system.",
        "In order to check whether the CFG-based annotations can lead to sufficiently accurate HPSG annotations, several HPSG treebanks were created with various qualities of CFG and evaluated by their HPSG qualities.",
        "We further conducted manual annotation experiments by two human annotators to evaluate the efficiency of the annotation system and the accuracy of the resulting annotations.",

        "The first step is the conversion of the annotator's revision into a collection of dead edges or dead cells; a dead edge means the edge must not be a part of the correct tree, and a dead cell means all edges in the cell are dead.",

        "Apparently wrong analysis left untouched due to the limitation of the annotation system.",
        "We suspect some of the errors of type 1 have been caused by the experimental setting of the annotation; we gave the test sentences randomly drawn from the corpus in a randomized order.",
        "This would have made it difficult for the annotators to interpret the sentences correctly.",
        "We thus expect this kind of errors would be reduced by doing the annotation on a larger chunk of text.",
        "The second type of the errors are due to the fact that the annotators are not familiar with the details of the Enju English HPSG grammar.",
        "For example, one of the annotators systematically chose a structure like (NP (NP a cat) (PP on the mat)).",
        "This structure is however always analysed as (NP a (NP' cat (PP on the mat))) by the Enju grammar.",
        "The style of the analysis implemented in the grammar thus sometimes conflicts with the annotators' intuition and it introduces errors in the annotation results.",
        "Our intention behind the design of the annotation system was to make the annotation system more accessible to non-experts and reduce the cost of the annotation.",
        "To reduce the type 2 errors, rather than the training of the annotators for a specific grammar, we plan to introduce another representation system in which the grammar-specific conventions become invisible to the annotators.",
        "For example, the above-shown difference in the bracketing structures of a determiner-noun-PP sequence can be hidden by showing the noun phrase as a ternary branch on the three children: (NP a cat (PP on the mat)).",
        "The third type of the errors are mainly due to the rather arbitrary choice of the HPSG analysis introduced through the semi-automatic treebank conversion used to extract the HPSG grammar.",
        "For instance, the Penn Treebank annotates a structure including an adverb that intervenes an auxiliary verb and a following verb as in (VP is (ADVP already) installed).",
        "The attachment direction of the adverb is thus left unspecified.",
        "Such structures are however indistinguishably transformed to a binary structure like (VP (VP' is already) installed) in the course of the conversion to HPSG analysis since there is no way to choose the proper direction only with the information given in the source corpus.",
        "This design could be considered as a best-effort, systematic choice under the insufficient information, but it conflicts with the annotators' intuition in some cases.",

        "This can happen either when the correct analysis is not covered by the HPSG grammar, or the correct analysis has been pruned by the beam-search mechanism in the parser.",
        "To correct a wrong analysis from the insufficient grammar coverage, an expansion of the grammar is necessary, either in the form of the expansion of the lexicon, or an introduction of a new lexical type.",

        "The introduction of a new lexical type definitely requires a deep knowledge on the grammar and thus out of the scope of our annotation framework.",
        "The other cases can in principle be handled in the current framework, e.g., by a dynamic expansion of the lexicon (i.e., an introduction of a new association between a word and known lexical type), and by a dynamic tuning of the beam size.",
        "To see the significance of the last type of the error, we re-evaluated the annotation results on the Brown sentences after classifying them into: (1) those for which the correct analyses were included in the parser's chart (in-chart, 65 sentences) and (2) those for which the correct analyses were not in the chart (out-chart, 35 sentences), either because of the pruning effect or the insufficient grammar coverage.",
        "The results shown in Table 8 clearly show that there is a large difference in the accuracy of the annotation results between these two cases.",
        "Actually, on the in-chart sentences, the parser has returned the correct analysis as the initial solution for over 50% of the sentences, and the annotators saved it without any operations.",
        "Thus, we believe it is quite effective to add the above-mentioned functionalities to reduce this type of errors."
