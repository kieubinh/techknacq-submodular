        "It has recently been suggested that in addition to more, bigger, and better resources, we need a science of creating them (Palmer et al., Download date December 17 2010).",
        "The corpus linguistics community has arguably in some of these studies should not be taken as a been developing at least a nascent science of anno- significance-reducing factor for the development of tation for years, represented by publications such as quality assurance measures for lexical resources – (Leech, 1993; Ide and Brew, 2000; Wynne, 2005; Cohen et al., 2005a; Cohen et al., 2005b) that address architectural, sampling, and procedural issues, as well as publications such as (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005; Artstein and Poesio, 2008) that address issues in inter-annotator agreement.",
        "However, there is not yet a significant body of work on the subject of quality assurance for corpora, or for that matter, for many other types of linguistic resources.",
        "(Meyers et al., 2004) describe three error-checking measures used in the construction of NomBank, and the use of inter-annotator agreement as a quality control measure for corpus construction is discussed at some length in (Marcus et al., 1993; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "However, discussion of quality control for corpora is otherwise limited or nonexistent.",
        "With the exception of the inter-annotator-agreement-oriented work mentioned above, none of this work is quantitative.",
        "This is a problem if our goal is the development of a true science of annotation.",
        "Work on quality assurance for computational lexical resources other than ontologies is especially lacking.",
        "However, the body of work on quality assurance for ontologies (Kohler et al., 2006; Ceusters",
        "Cimino, 2001; Ogren et al., 2004) is worth considering in the context of this paper.",
        "One common theme in that work is that even manually curated lexical resources contain some percentage of errors.",
        "The small size of the numbers of errors uncovered rather, the opposite: as lexical resources become larger, it becomes correspondingly more difficult to locate errors in them.",
        "Finding problems in a very errorful resource is easy; finding them in a mostly correct resource is an entirely different challenge.",
        "We present here an evaluation of a methodology for quality assurance for a particular type of lexical resource: the class of semantic representation known as a predicate argument structure (PAS).",
        "Predicate argument structures are important in the context of resource development in part because they are the fundamental annotation target of the class of corpus known as a proposition bank.",
        "Much of the significance claim for this work comes from the significance of proposition banks themselves in recent research on natural language processing and computational lexical semantics.",
        "The impact of proposition banks on work in these fields is suggested by the large number of citations of just the three publications (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Kingsbury et al., 2002; Palmer et al., 2005) – at the time of writing, 290, 220, and 567, respectively.",
        "Additional indications of the impact of PropBank on the field of natural language processing include its use as the data source for two shared tasks ((Carreras and Marquez, 2005)).",
        "The methodology consists of looking for arguments that never cooccur with each other.",
        "In structural linguistics, this property of non-cooccurrence is known as complementary distribution.",
        "Complementary distribution occurs when two linguistic elements never occur in the same environment.",
        "In this case, the environment is defined as any sentence containing a given predicate.",
        "Earlier work showed a proof-of-concept application to a small set of rolesets (defined below) representing the potential PAS of 34 biomedical predicates (Cohen and Hunter 2006).",
        "The only inputs to the method are a set of rolesets and a corpus annotated with respect to those rolesets.",
        "Here, we evaluate the ability of the technique to scale to a set of semantic representations 137 times larger (4,654 in PropBank versus 34 in Cohen and Hunter's pilot project) and to a corpus about 1500 times larger (1M words in PropBank versus about 680 in Cohen and Hunter's pilot project) than that considered in previous work.",
        "We also use a set of independent judges to assess the technique, where in the earlier work, the results were only as-",
        "sessed by one of the authors.",
        "Novel aspects of the current study include:",
        "• Investigating the feasibility of automating the previously manual process",
        "• Scaling up the size of the set of semantic representations evaluated",
        "• Scaling up the size of the corpus against which the representations are evaluated",
        "• Using independent judges to assess the predictions of the method",
        "For clarity, we define the terms roleset, frame file, and predicate here.",
        "A roleset is a 2-tuple of a sense for a predicate, identified by a combination of a lemma and a number – e.g., love.01 – and a set of individual thematic roles for that predicate – e.g., Arg0 lover and Arg1 loved.",
        "A frame file is the set of all rolesets for a single lemma – e.g., for love, the role-sets are love.01 (the sense whose antonym is hate) and love.02, the \"semi-modal\" sense in whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it (Austen, 1811).",
        "Finally, we refer to sense-labelled predicates (e.g. love.01) as predicates in the remainder of the paper.",
        "PropBank rolesets contain two sorts of thematic roles: (core) arguments and (non-core) adjuncts.",
        "Arguments are considered central to the semantics of the predicate, e.g. the Arg0 lover of love.01.",
        "Adjuncts are not central to the semantics and can occur with many predicates; examples of adjuncts include negation, temporal expressions, and locations.",
        "In this paper, the arity of a roleset is determined by its count of arguments, disregarding adjuncts.",
        "1.2 The relationship between observed argument distributions and various characteristics of the corpus",
        "This work is predicated on the hypothesis that argument distributions are affected by goodness of the fit between the argument set and the actual semantics of the predicate.",
        "However, the argument distributions that are observed in a specific data set can be affected by other factors, as well.",
        "These include at least:",
        "• Inflectional and derivational forms attested in the corpus",
        "• Sublanguage characteristics",
        "• Incidence of the predicate in the corpus",
        "A likely cause of derivational effects on observed distributions is nominalization processes.",
        "Nomi-nalization is well known for being associated with the omission of agentive arguments (Koptjevskaja-Tamm, 1993).",
        "A genre in which nominalization is frequent might therefore show fewer cooccurrences of Arg0s with other arguments.",
        "Since PropBank does not include annotations ofnominalizations, this phenomenon had no effect on this particular study.",
        "Sublanguage characteristics might also affect observed distributions.",
        "The sublanguage of recipes has been noted to exhibit rampant deletions of definite object noun phrases both in French and in English, as has the sublanguage of technical manuals in English.",
        "(Neither of these sublanguages have been noted to occur in the PropBank corpus.",
        "The sublanguage of stock reports, however, presumably does occur in the corpus; this sublanguage has been noted to exhibit distributional subtleties of predicates and their arguments that might be relevant to the accuracy of the semantic representations in Prop-Bank, but the distributional facts do not seem to include variability in argument cooccurrence so much as patterns of argument/predicate cooccurrence (Kit-",
        "Finally, incidence of the predicate in the corpus could affect the observed distribution, and in particular, the range of argument cooccurrences that are attested: the lower the number of observations of a predicate, the lower the chance of observing any two arguments together, and as the number of arguments in a roleset increases, the higher the chance of failing to see any pair together.",
        "That is, for a roleset with an arity of three and an incidence of n occurrences in a corpus, the likelihood of never seeing any two of the three arguments together is much lower than for a roleset with an arity of six and an incidence of n occurrences in the corpus.",
        "The number of observations required in order to be able to draw conclusions about the observed argument distributions with some degree of confidence is an empirical question; prior work (Cohen and Hunter 2006) suggests that as few as ten tokens can be sufficient to uncover erroneous representations for rolesets with an arity of four or less, although that number of observations of one roleset with an arity of four showed multiple non-cooccurring arguments that were not obviously indicative of problems with the representation (i.e., a false positive finding).",
        "Besides the effects of these aspects of the corpus contents on the observed distributions, there are also a number of theoretical and practical issues in the design and construction of the corpus (as distinct from the rolesets, or the distributional characteristics of the contents) which have nontrivial implications for the methodology being evaluated here.",
        "In particular, the implications of the argument/adjunct distinction, of the choice of syntactic representation, and of annotation errors are all discussed in Section 4.",
        "Note that we are aware that corpus-based studies generally yield new lexical items and usages any time a new corpus is introduced, so we do not make the naive assumption that PropBank will give complete coverage of all cooccurring arguments, and in fact our evaluation procedure took this into account explicitly, as described in Section 2.3."

        "As we discuss in Section 4.1, this is a non-trivial decision with potential implications for the ability of the algorithm to detect problematic representations in general, and with implications for PropBank in particular.",
        "The rationale behind the choice to consider only arguments is that our goal is to evaluate the representation of the semantics of the predicates, and that by definition, the PropBank arguments are essential to defining that semantics, while by definition, the adjuncts are not.",
        "In the first processing step, for each roleset, we used the corresponding framefile as input and generated a lookup table of the possible argument pairs for that predicate.",
        "For example, the predicatepost.01 has the three arguments Arg0, Arg1, and Arg2; we generated the set {<Arg0, Arg1>, <Arg0, Arg2>, <Arg1, Arg2>} for it.",
        "In the second processing step, we iterated over all annotations in the PropBank corpus, and for each token of each predicate, we extracted the complete set of arguments that occurred in association with that token.",
        "We then constructed the set of coöccurring arguments for that annotation, and used it to increment the counts of each potential argument pair for the predicate in question.",
        "For example, the PropBank annotation for Oils and fats also did well, posting a 5.3%o sales increase (wsj/06/wsj_0663.mrg) contains an Arg0 and an Arg1, so we incremented the count for that argument pair by 1; it contains no other argument pairs, so we did not increment the counts for <Arg0, Arg2> or <Arg1, Arg2>.",
        "The output of this step was a table with the count of occurrence of every potential pair of arguments for every roleset; members of pairs whose count was zero were then output as arguments in complementary distribution.",
        "For example, for post.01, the pairs <Arg0, Arg2> and <Arg1, Arg2> never occurred, even as traces, so the arguments Arg0 and Arg2 are in complementary distribution for this predicate, as are the arguments Arg1 and Arg2.",

        "For this larger-scale project, one of the goals was to obtain goodness judgements from completely independent third parties.",
        "Towards that end, two judges with experience in working with PropBank were assigned to judge the predictions of the algorithm.",
        "Judge 1 had two years of experience, and Judge 2 had four years of experience.",
        "The judges were then given a typology of classification to assign to the predicates: good, bad, and conditionally bad.",
        "The definitions of these categories, with the topology of the typology, were:",
        "• Good: This label is assigned to predicates that the algorithm predicted to have bad representations, but that are actually good.",

        "• Not good: (This label was not actually assigned, but rather was used to group the following two categories.)",

        "In all of these cases, the judges did suggest changes to the representations, and they were counted as not good, per the typology, and are also true positives.",
        "Judges were also asked to indicate whether bad representations should be fixed by splitting predicates into more word senses, or by eliminating or merging one or more arguments.",
        "We then took the lists of all predicted bad predicates that appeared at least 50, 100, or 200 times in the PropBank corpus.",
        "These were combined into a single list of 107 predicates and randomized.",
        "The judges then split the list into halves, and each judge examined half of the list.",

        "The validity and usefulness of the distinction between arguments and adjuncts is an ongoing controversy in biomedical computational lexical semantics.",
        "The BioProp project (Chou et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2006) makes considerable use of adjuncts, essentially identically to PropBank; however, most biomedical PAS-oriented projects have relatively larger numbers of arguments and lesser use of adjuncts (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004; Kogan et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2005) than PropBank.",
        "Overall, one would predict fewer non-cooccurring arguments with a set of representations that made a stronger distinction between arguments and adjuncts; overall arity of rolesets would be smaller (see above for the effect of arity on the number of observations required for a predicate), and the arguments for such a representation might be more \"core\" to the semantics of the predicate, and might therefore be less likely to not occur overall, and therefore less likely to not cooccur.",
        "4.2 The effect of syntactic representation on observed argument distributions",
        "The original work by Cohen and Hunter assumed a very simple, and very surface, syntactic representation.",
        "In particular, there was no representation of traces.",
        "In contrast, PropBank is built on Treebank II, which does include representation of traces, and arguments can, in fact, be filled by traces.",
        "This could be expected to reduce the number of tokens of apparently absent arguments, and thereby the number of non-coooccurring arguments.",
        "This doesn't seem to have had a strong enough effect to interfere with the ability of the method to uncover errors.",
        "The mode for distribution of arities in the Prop-Bank framefiles was 2 (see Table 3).",
        "In contrast, the modes for distribution of rolesets with at least one argument pair in complementary distribution across arities and for distribution of argument pairs in complementary distribution across arities was 4 or 5 for the full range of minimum observations of the predicates from 200 to 10 (data omitted for space).",
        "This supports the initial assumption that higher-arity predicates are more likely to have argument pairs in complementary distribution – see Section 1.2 above.",
        "One aspect of a granular analysis of the data is worth pointing out with respect to the effects of ar-ity: as a validation check, note that for all arities, the number of predicates and the number of argument pairs rises as the minimum required number of tokens of the predicate in the corpus goes down.",
        "The goals of this study were to investigate the au-tomatability and scalability of a technique for PAS quality assurance that had previously only been shown to work for a small lexical resource and a small corpus, and to use it to characterize the quality of the shallow semantic representations in the PropBank framefiles.",
        "The evaluation procedure was found to be automatable: the process of finding argument pairs in complementary distribution is achievable by running a single Java application.",
        "In addition, the use of a common representation for argument sets in a framefile and argument sets in a PropBank annotation enabled the fortuitous discovery of a number of problems in the framefiles and in the corpus (see Section 3.6) as a side-effect of application of the technique.",
        "The process was also found to scale well, with a running time of less than one and a half minutes for a set of 4,654 rolesets and a 1-million-word corpus on a moderately priced laptop; additionally, the resource maintainer's efforts can easily be focussed towards the most likely and the most prevalent error sources by adjusting the minimum number of observations required before reporting a case of complementary distribution.",
        "The process was also found to be able to identify missing sense distinctions and to identify bad arguments.",
        "In addition to our findings regarding the quality assurance technique, a granular breakdown of the errors found by the algorithm by arity and minimum number of observations (data not shown due to space) allows us to estimate the number of errors in the PropBank framefiles.",
        "A reasonable upper-bound estimate for the number of errorful rolesets is the number of predicates that were observed at least 10 times and were found to have at least one pair of arguments in complementary distribution (the bottom row of Table 4), adjusted by the accuracy of the technique that we reported in Section 3.1, i.e. 0.69.",
        "This yields a worst-case scenario of (0.69*328)/4,654 rolesets, or 4.9% of the rolesets in PropBank, being in need of revision.",
        "The best-case scenario would assume that we can only draw conclusions about the predicates with high numbers of observations and high arity, again adjusted downward for the accuracy of the technique; taking 5 or more arguments as high arity, this yields a best-case scenario of (0.69*17)/4,654 rolesets, or 0.3% of the rolesets in PropBank, being in need of revision.",
        "A different sort of worst-case scenario assumes that the major problem in maintaining a proposition bank is not fixing inadequate representations, but finding them.",
        "On this assumption, the problematic representations are the ones with small numbers of tokens and low ar-ity.",
        "Taking 3 or fewer arguments as low arity yields a worst-case scenario of 99/4,654 rolesets (no adjustment for accuracy required), or 2.13% of the rolesets in PropBank, being essentially uncharacterizable as to the goodness of their semantic representation.",
        "Besides its obvious role in quality assurance for proposition banks, there may be other uses for this technique, as well.",
        "The output of the technique may also be useful in sense grouping and splitting and in detecting metaphorical uses of verbs (e.g. the accept example).",
        "As the PropBank model is extended to an increasingly large set of languages (currently Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, and Russian), the need for a quality assurance mechanism for proposition banks – both to ensure the quality of their contents, and to assure funding agencies that they are evaluatable – will only grow larger."
