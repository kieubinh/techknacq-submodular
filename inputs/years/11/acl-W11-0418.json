        "In recent years a renewed interest in temporal processing has spread in the NLP community, thanks to the success of the TimeML annotation scheme (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) and to the availability of annotated resources, such as the English and French TimeBanks (Pustejovsky et corpora (Verhagen et al., 2010).",
        "The ISO TC 37 / SC 4 initiative (\"Terminology and other language and content resources\") and the TempEval-2 contest have contributed to the development of TimeML-compliant annotation schemes in languages other than English, namely Spanish, Korean, Chinese, French and Italian.",
        "Once the corresponding corpora will be completed and made available, the NLP community will benefit from having access to different language resources with a common layer of annotation which could boost studies in multilingual temporal processing and improve the performance of complex multilingual NLP systems, such as Question-Answering and Textual Entailment.",
        "This paper focuses on the annotation guidelines and specifications which have been developed for the creation of the Italian TimeBank (hereafter, Ita-TimeBank).",
        "The distinction between annotation guidelines and annotation specifications is of utmost importance in order to distinguish between the abstract, formal definition of an annotation scheme and the actual realization of the annotated language resource.",
        "In addition to this, documenting the annotation specification facilitates the reduplication of annotations and justify the annotated items.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 will describe in detail specific issues related to the temporal annotation of Italian for the two main tags of the TimeML annotation scheme, namely <EVENT> and <TIMEX3>.",
        "Section 3 will present the realization of the annotation specifications and will document them.",
        "Section 4 focuses on the evaluation of the annotation scheme on the Ita-TimeBank, formed by two corpora independently realized by applying the annotation specifications.",
        "Finally, in Section 5 conclusions and extensions to the current annotation effort will be reported.",
        "Notice that, for clarity's sake, in this paper the examples will focus only on the tag (or attribute or link) under discussion."

        "Applying an annotation scheme to a language other than the one for which it was initially developed, requires a careful study of the language specific issues related to the linguistic phenomena taken into account (Im et al., 2009;",
        "Bittar, 2008).",
        "TimeML focuses on Events (i.e. actions, states, and processes - <EVENT> tag), Temporal Expressions (i.e. durations, calendar dates, times of day and sets of time -<TIMEX3> tag), Signals (e.g. temporal prepositions and subordinators - <SIGNAL> tag) and various kind of dependencies between Events and/or Temporal Expressions (i.e. temporal, aspectual and subordination relations -<TLINK>, <ALINK> and <SLINK> tags respectively).",
        "An ISO language-independent specification of TimeML is under development but it is still in the enquiry stage.",
        "For this reason, in the following subsections we will mostly compare the Italian annotation guidelines with the latest version of the English annotation guidelines (TimeML Working group, 2010), focusing on the two main tags, i.e <EVENT> and <TIMEX3>, in Italian.",

        "In the adaptation to Italian, two annotation principles adopted for English, that is an orientation towards surface linguistic phenomena and the notion of minimal chunk for the tag extent, have been preserved without major modifications.",

        "In Italian 12 core attributes apply with respect to the 10 attributes in English.",
        "The newly introduced attributes are MOOD and VFORM which capture key distinctions of the Tense-Mood-Aspect (TMA) system of the Italian language.",
        "These two attributes are common to other languages, such as Spanish, Catalan, French and Korean.",
        "The MOOD attribute captures the contrastive grammatical expression of different modalities of presentation of an Event when realized by a verb.",
        "Annotating this attribute is important since grammatical modality has an impact on the identification of temporal and subordinating relations, and on the assessment of veridicity/factivity values.",
        "Mood in Italian is expressed as part of the verb morphology and not by means of modal auxiliary verbs as in English (e.g. through the auxiliary \"would\"),.",

        "These differences are due to language specific phenomena related to the expression of the grammatical aspect in Italian and English and to the application of the TimeML surface oriented annotation philosophy.",
        "In particular, the assignment of the aspectual values is strictly determined by the verb surface forms.",
        "For instance, in English the verb form \"is teaching\" requires the PROGRESSIVE value.",
        "On the other hand, the Italian counterpart of \"is teaching\" can be realized in two ways: either by means of the simple present (insegna [s/he teaches]) or by means of a specific verbal periphrasis (sta insegnando [s/he is teaching]).",
        "In order to distinguish between these two verb forms, and to account also for other typical Romance languages tense forms, such as the Italian Imperfetto, the use of the additional IMPERFECTIVE value is necessary.",
        "Thus, insegna [s/he teaches], as well as the Imperfetto insegnava [s/he was teaching] are annotated as IMPERFECTIVE, whereas sta insegnando [s/he is teaching] is annotated as PROGRESSIVE.",
        "On the other hand, the absence of the",
        "PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE value, used for",
        "English tense forms of the kind \"he has been teaching\", is due to the lack of Italian verb surface forms which may require its use.",
        "In English, modal verbs are not annotated as",
        "Events and the MODALITY attribute is associated to the main verb (the value of the attribute is the token corresponding to the modal verb).",
        "Unlike English modals, Italian modal verbs, such as potere [can/could; may/might], volere [want; will/would] and dovere [must/have to; ought to; shall/should], are to be considered similar to other lexical verbs in that it is possible to assign them values for tense and aspect.",
        "Consequently, each instance of Italian modal verbs will be annotated with the tag <EVENT>.",
        "The value of the MODALITY attribute is the lemma of the verb (e.g. dovere).",
        "A further language specific aspect concerns the annotation of verbal periphrases, that is special constructions with at least two verbs (and sometimes other words) that behave as a group like a single verb would.",
        "In Italian, it is possible to identify different instances of verbal periphrases, namely:",
        "• aspectual periphrases (example 8 below), which encode progressive or habitual aspect;",
        "• modal periphrases (example 9), which encode modality not realized by proper modal verbs;",
        "• phasal periphrases (example 10), which encode information on a particular phase in the description of an Event.",
        "Following Bertinetto (1991), in the last two cases, i.e. modal periphrases and phasal periphrases, both verbal elements involved should be annotated, while in the case of the aspectual periphrasis only the main verb (verb head) has to be marked; e.g.:",

        "[Demonstrators started to throw stones.]",
        "Similarly to what proposed for English, in presence of multi-tokens realization of Events, two main annotation strategies have been followed:",
        "• in case the multi-token Event expression corresponds to an instance of a collocation or of an idiomatic expression, then only the",
        "head (verbal, nominal or other) of the expression is marked up; • in case the multi-token Event is realized by light verb expressions, then two separate <EVENT> tags are to be created both for the verb and the nominal/prepositional complement.",
        "The TIMEX3 tag relies on and is as much compliant as possible with the TIDES TIMEX2 annotation.",
        "The Italian adaptation of this annotation scheme is presented in Magnini et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "The only difference concerns the annotation of articulated prepositions which are annotated as signals, while in the TIMEX2 specifications they are considered as part of the textual realization of Temporal Expressions:",
        "On the other hand, with respect to the TIMEX3 annotation of other languages such as English, we decided to follow the TIMEX2 specification by annotating many adjectives as Temporal Expressions (e.g. recente [recent], ex [former]) and including modifiers like che rimane in l'anno che rimane [the remaining year] into the extent of the TIMEX3 tag since it is essential for the normalization of temporal expressions."

        "As already stated, the annotation guidelines represent an abstract, formal level of description which, in this case, is mainly based on a detailed study of the relevant linguistic levels.",
        "Once the guidelines are applied to real language data, further issues arise and need to be tackled.",
        "This section focuses on a method for developing annotation specifications.",
        "Annotation specifications are to be seen as the actual realization of the annotation guidelines.",
        "The identification and distinction of annotation guidelines from annotation specification is of major importance as it is to be conceived as a new level of Best Practice for the creation of semantically annotated Language Resources (Calzolari and Caselli, 2009).",
        "The process of realization of the annotation specifications is strategic both to realize good quality annotated resources and to justify why certain textual items have to be annotated.",
        "As for the It-TimeML experience we will illustrate this process by making reference and reporting examples for two tags, namely for the <EVENT> and the <TLINK> tags.",
        "As a general procedure for the development of the annotation specifications, we have taken inspiration from the DAMSL Manual (Core and Allen, 1997).",
        "Different decision trees have been created for each task.",
        "For instance, for the annotation of the <EVENT> tag, four different decision trees have been designed for each POS (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositional phrases) which could be involved in the realization of an Event.",
        "In particular, the most complex decision tree is that developed for noun annotation.",
        "The identification of the eventive reading of nouns has been formalized into a discrimination process of different properties: firstly superficial properties are taken into consideration, i.e. whether a morphologically related verb exists or not, and whether the noun co-occurs with special verb predicates (for instance aspectual verbs such as iniziare [to start] or light verbs such as fare [to do]); then, deeper semantic properties are analyzed, which involve other levels such as word sense disambiguation and noun classification (e.g. whether the noun is a functional or an incremental one).",
        "Other decision trees have been improved to avoid inconsistencies in Event classification.",
        "For instance, the identification of Reporting Events showed to be problematic because of the vague definition adopted in the guidelines.",
        "A Reporting Event is a giving information speech act in which a communicator conveys a message to an addressee.",
        "To help annotators in deciding whether an event is a Reporting one, the annotation specifications suggest to rely on FrameNet as a starting point (Baker, et al.",
        "1998).",
        "More specifically, an Italian lexical unit has been classified as Reporting if it is the translation equivalent of one of the lexical units assigned to the Communication frame, which has Message as a core element.",
        "Among the frames using and inherited from the Communication frame, only the ones having the Message as a core element and conveying a giving information speech act have been selected and the lexical units belonging to them have been classified as Reporting Events: e.g. urlare [to scream] from the Communication_noise frame, sottolineare [to stress] from the Convey_importance frame, dichiarare [to declare] from the Statement frame.",
        "Similarly, for the identification of TLINKs, a set of decision trees has been developed to identify the conditions under which a temporal relation is to be annotated and a method to decide the value of the reltype attribute.",
        "For instance, the annotation of temporal relations between nominal Events and Temporal Expressions in the same sentence is allowed only when the Temporal Expression is realized either by an adjective or a prepositional phrase of the form ''di (of) + TEMPORAL </TIMEX3> [yesterday meeting] relatedToTime=''t01 signalID=\"s1 \" relType=''IS_INCLUDED''/>",
        "In addition, decision trees based on the idea that signals provide useful information to TLINK classification have been used to assign the reltype value to TLINKs holding between a duration and an Event.",
        "For example, the pattern \"EVENT + tra (in) + DURATION\" identifies the value AFTER, while the pattern \"EVENT + per (for) + DURATION\" is associated with the value MEASURE.",
        "relatedToTime=\"t1\" signalID=Ms1MrelType=''AFTER\"/> </TIMEX3> [they have been married for ten years] relatedToTime=\"tr signalID=\"s1 \" relType=''MEASURE\"/>",
        "The advantages of this formalization are many.",
        "The impact of the annotators' subjectivity is limited, thus reducing the risk of disagreement.",

        "A comparison with the inter-coder agreement achieved during the annotation of the English TimeBank 1.2 (Pustejovsky et al., 2006a), shows that the scores obtained for the CELCT and the ILC corpora are substantially higher in the following results: (i) average precision and recall on the identification of tag extent (e.g. 0.83 vs. 0.95 of ILC Corpus and 0.94 of CELCT Corpus for TIMEX3; 0.78 vs. 0.87 of ILC Corpus and 0.93 of CECLT Corpus); (ii) kappa score on Event classification (0.67 vs. 0.82 of ILC Corpus and 0.87 of the CELCT Corpus); (iii) kappa score on TLINK classification (0.77 vs. 0.86 of CELCT Corpus).",

        "This paper reports on the creation of a new semantic resource for Italian which has been developed independently but with a joint effort between two different research institutions.",
        "The Ita-TimeBank will represent a large corpus annotated with information for temporal processing which can boost the multilingual research in this field and represent a case study for the creation of semantic annotated resources.",
        "One of the most interesting point of this work is represented by the methodology followed for the development of the corpora: in addition to the guidelines, annotation specifications have been created in order to report in detail the actual choices done during the annotation.",
        "This element should be pushed forward in the community as a new best practice for the creation of good quality semantically annotated resources.",
        "The results obtained show the reliability of the adaptation of the annotation guidelines to Italian and of the methodology used for the creation of the resources.",
        "Future works will concentrate in different directions, mainly due to the research interests of the two groups which have taken part to this effort but they will be coordinated.",
        "An interesting aspect which could be investigated is the annotation of the anaphoric relations between Events.",
        "This effort could be done in a more reliable way since the primary linguistic items have been already annotated.",
        "Moreover, this should boost research in the development of annotation schemes which could be easily integrated with each other without losing descriptive and representational information for other language phenomena.",
        "Another topic to deepen regards the definition of the appropriate argument structure in It-TimeML in order to annotate relations between entities (e.g. persons and organizations) and Events in which they are involved (Pustejovsky et al., 2006b).",
        "As regards the distribution of the ItaTimeBank, the resource will soon be available in an in-line format.",
        "In order to integrate the temporal annotation with other linguistic annotations, a standoff version of the ItaTimeBank needs to be developed.",
        "When this is made available, we plan to merge the manual annotation of temporal and event information with other types of linguistic stand-off annotations (i.e. tokenization, lemma, PoS, multi-words, various kinds of named entities) which are already available for the I-CAB corpus.",
        "In order to encourage research on systems capable of temporal inference and event-based reasoning, the Ita-TimeBank could be used as gold standard within specific evaluation campaigns as the next TempEval initiative.",
        "Finally, the use of crowdsourcing will be explored to reduce annotation effort in terms of financial cost and time.",
        "The most difficult challenge to face will be the splitting of a complicated annotation scheme as It-TimeML into simple tasks which can be effectively performed by not expert contributors."
