        "In linguistic annotation projects, there is often a gap between what the annotation schema is designed to capture and how the guidelines are interpreted by the annotators and adjudicators given a specific corpus and task (Ide and Bunt, 2010; Ide, 2007).",
        "The difficulty in resolving these two aspects of annotation is compounded when tasks are looked at in a potentially incomplete annotation task; namely, where the guideline is following a specification to a point, but in fact human annotation is not even suggested as complete because it would be infeasible.",
        "Creating temporal links to represent the timeline of events in a document is an example of this: human annotation of every possible temporal relationship between events and times in a narrative would be an overwhelming task.",
        "In this paper, we discuss how temporal relation annotation must be sensitive to two aspects of the task that were not mentioned in the TimeBank guideline (Pustejovsky et al., 2005): (a) sensitivity to the genre and style of the text; and (b) the interaction with discourse relations that explicitly reference the flow of the narrative in the text.",
        "We believe that making reference to both these aspects in the text during the annotation process will increase overall informativeness and accuracy of the annotation.",
        "In the present paper, we focus primarily on the first of these points, and introduce a document level information structure we call a narrative container (NC).",
        "Because of the impossibility of humans capturing every relationship, it is vital that the annotation guidelines describe an approach that will result in maximally informative temporal links without relying on standards that are too difficult to apply.",
        "With this in mind, we have been examining the TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) and the annotation guideline that created it, and have come to these realizations:",
        "(1) • The guideline does not specify certain types of annotations that should be performed; • The guideline forces some annotations to be performed when they should not always be.",
        "Additionally, we have discovered some inconsistencies in the TimeBank corpus related to temporal links.",
        "Furthermore, upon examination, we have become aware of the importance of the text style and genre, and how readers interpret temporally unah-chored events.",
        "This gave rise, in examining the genres that are most frequent in TimeBank (namely news and finance), to the possibility that readers of news articles and narratives have possible default assumptions about when unanchored events take place.",
        "It seems reasonable for a reader to assume in a sentence such as: Oneida Ltd. declared a 10% stock dividend, payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 17, that the \"declared\" event took place soon before the article's Document Creation Time (DCT).",
        "Exactly how soon before may be related to some proximate interval of time associated with both the publication time and frequency.",
        "That is, it appears that just as importantly, if not more so, than the DCT, is a related and dependent notion of the salient interval surrounding the creation time, for interpreting the events that are being reported or written about.",
        "We will call this the Narrative Container.",
        "There seems to be a default value for this container affected by many variables.",
        "For example, a print newspaper seems to associate in the content and style a narrative container of approximately 24 hours, or one business day.",
        "A newswire article, on the other hand, has a narrative container of 2-10 hours.",
        "Conversely, weekly and monthly publications would likely have a narrative container of a much longer duration (a week or more).",
        "Along with the narrative container, there are two related concepts that proved useful in framing this new approach to temporal annotation.",
        "The Narrative Scope describes the timespan described in the document, with the left marker defined by the earliest event mentioned in the document, and the right by the event furthest in the future.",
        "The other important concept is that of Narrative Time.",
        "A Narrative Time is essentially the current temporal anchor for events in a document, and can change as the reader moves through the narrative.",
        "With these as initial assumptions we did some cursory inspection of the TimeBank data to determine if there was a correlation between Narrative Container length and genre, and found it to be a compelling assumption.",
        "With that in mind, we determined that TLINK creation should be focused on relationships to the narrative container, rather than to the DCT.",
        "Our goal is, to the extent possible, to see how we can use a container metaphor, albeit somewhat underspecified, to left-delineate the container within which unanchored events might be in relation to."

        "While low-level temporal annotation tasks such as identifying events and time expressions are relatively straightforward and can be marked up with high consistency, high-level tasks such as arranging events in a document in a temporal order have proved to be much more challenging.",
        "The temporal ordering of events in a document, for example, is accomplished by identifying all distinct event-event pairings.",
        "For a document that has n events, this requires the annotation of events pairs.",
        "Obviously, for general-purpose annotation, where all possible events are considered, the number of event pairs grows essentially quadratically to the number of events, and the task quickly becomes unmanageable.",
        "There are, however, strategies that we can adopt to make this labeling task more tractable.",
        "First we need to distinguish the domains over which ordering relations are performed.",
        "Temporal ordering relations in text are of three kinds:",
        "(2) a.",
        "A relation between two events; b.",
        "A relation between two times; c. A relation between a time and an event.",
        "TimeML, as a formal specification of the temporal information conveyed in language, makes no distinction between these ordering types.",
        "But a human reader of a text does make a distinction, based on the discourse relations established by the author of the narrative (Miltsakaki et al., 2004; Poesio, 2004).",
        "Temporal expressions denoting the local Narrative Container in the text act as embedding intervals within which events occur.",
        "Within TimeML, these are event-time anchoring relations (TLINKs).",
        "Discourse relations establish how events relate to one another in the narrative, and hence should constrain temporal relations between two events.",
        "Thus, one of the most significant constraints we can impose is to take advantage of the discourse structure in the document before event-event ordering relations are identified.",
        "Although, in principle, during an annotation a temporal relation can be specified between any two events in the text, it is worth asking what informativeness a given temporal relation introduces to the annotation.",
        "The informativeness of an annotation will be characterized as a function of the information contained in the individual links and their closure.",
        "We can distinguish, somewhat informally for now, two sources of informativeness in how events are temporally ordered relative to each other in a text: (a) externally and (b) internally.",
        "Consider first external informativeness.",
        "This is information derived from relations outside the temporal relation constraint set, e.g., as coming from explicit discourse relations between events (and hence is associated with the relations in (2a) above).",
        "For example, we will assume that, for two events, e1 and e2, in a text, the temporal relation between them is more informative if they are also linked through a discourse relation, e.g., a PDTB relation (Prasad et al., 2008).",
        "Making such an assumption will allow us to focus in on the temporal relations that are most valuable without having to exhaustively annotate all event pairs.",
        "Now consider internal informativeness.",
        "This is information derived from the nature of the relation itself, as defined largely by the algebra of relations (Allen, 1984; Vilain et al., 1986).",
        "First, we assume that, for two events, ei and e2, a temporal relation R1 is more informative than R2 if R1 entails R2.",
        "More significantly, however, as noted above, is to capitalize on the relations that inhere between events and the times that anchor them (i.e., (2c) above).",
        "Hence, we will say that, given an event, e1 and a time t1, a temporal relation R is more informative the more it anchors e1 to t1.",
        "That is, a containment relation is more informative than an ordering relation, and the smaller the container, the more informative the relation.",
        "The Document Creation Time (DCT) as designed in TimeML is introduced as a reference time, against which the mentioned events and time expressions in the document can be ordered.",
        "Consider the text fragment below.",
        "Local officials reported yesterday that a car exploded in downtown Basra.",
        "The TimeML annotation guideline (AG) suggests identifying relations between the DCT and textual events.",
        "Hence standard markup as in TimeBank results in the following sort of annotation:",
        "This is a prototypical annotation fragment.",
        "Notice that by focusing on the link between events and the DCT, the annotator is forced to engage in a kind of periodic \"back-and-forth\" evaluation of the events in the text, relative to the DCT.",
        "While there is a container TIMEX3 that bounds e1, there is no information given grounding the actual time of the event of interest, namely, the explosion, e2.",
        "By following the AG literally and through no fault of their own, the annotators have missed an opportunity to provide a more informative markup; namely, the identification oftheTLINK below:",
        "That is, the explosion occurred on the date valued for yesterday, i.e., \"09-04-2011\".",
        "The point of this paper is to discuss the difference encountered when applying a specification given a particular guideline for annotating a body of text.",
        "The example we want to discuss is the manner in which events are linked (related) to the Document Creation Time (DCT) in TimeML.",

        "However, consider how we can use Narrative Times to increase accuracy of the TLINKS over a document in TimeML.",
        "As mentioned above, we distinguish three types of temporal orderings in a text: time-time, event-time, and event-event.",
        "The first identifies orderings between two TIMEX3 expressions and is performed automatically.",
        "The second identifies what the local Narrative Time for an event is, i.e., how an EVENT is anchored to a TIMEX3.",
        "Event-event pairings, for the purposes of this paper, will not be discussed, though they are a vital and complex component of temporal annotation, largely involving discourse relations.",

        "text: the Document Creation time, t0; and two TIMEXes, t1 and t2.",

        "In this case, all the events are located within the Narrative Time appropriate to them.",
        "Hence, the number of orderings is linearly determined by the number of events in the document, since each is identified with a single Narrative Time.",

        "Because these annotations are not comprehensive in their scope, the analysis provided here is somewhat preliminary, but we believe it is clear that the use of a Narrative Container in temporal annotations is both informative and intuitive.",

        "All the annotators agreed that an NC would not extend forward beyond the document creation time (DCT), and that in most cases the NC would end at the DCT.",
        "Because the annotators gave their data on the size of the NC in free text (for example, an annotator would say \"1 day\" to indicate that the NC for an article began the day before the article was published) the comparison of the narrative containers was performed manually by one of the authors to determine if the annotators agreed on the size of the",
        "NC.",
        "Agreement was determined using a fairly strict matching criterion – if the narrative containers given were clearly referring to the same interval they were interpreted to be the same.",
        "If, however, there was ambiguity about the date or one annotator indicated a smaller time period than another, then they were judged to be different.",
        "A common example of ambiguity was related to newspaper articles that were written on Mondays – annotators could not always determine if the events described occurred the day before, or on the previous business day For evaluation purposes, the ambiguous cases were given \"maybe\" values, but were not included in analysis that relied on the NCs being the same.",
        "Overall, using the strict agreement metric all the annotators agreed on the size of the narrative container in 95 out of 183 articles – slightly over 50% of the time.",
        "However, the annotators only completely disagreed on 6 of the 183 articles – in all other cases there was some level of agreement between pairs of annotators.",
        "We compared Narrative Container agreements against the categories outlined above: style, channel, production circumstances, and temporal anchorings in order to determine if any of those attributes lent themselves to agreement about the size of the Narrative Container.",
        "We disregarded the biography, quiz, and editorial classifications as those categories were too small to provide useful data.",

        "While the higher disagreement levels over Narrative Container size in the presence of a temporal anchor seems counter-intuitive, it stems from a simple cause: if the temporal anchor overlapped with the expected narrative container but was not exactly the same size, sometimes one annotator would use that anchor as the Narrative Container, while the others would not.",
        "This sometimes also happened with a Narrative Time that was not at the start of the document or sometimes even the Narrative Scope would be used as the Narrative Container.",
        "While in some articles it is the case that a Narrative Time anchors more events than the Narrative Container,",
        "Bsé Bb ag as",
        "that does not make that Narrative Time the Narrative Container for the document – the Narrative Container is always the interval during which an unanchored event would be assumed to have taken place.",

        "Spoken/broadcast articles had the lowest agreement on Narrative Container size, with none of those articles having complete agreement between annotators.",
        "This was largely caused by our annotators not agreeing on how much time those categories would encompass by default-two felt that the narrative containers for broadcast news would extend to only a few hours before going on air, and the other felt that, like a daily paper, the entire previous day would be included when dealing with unanchored times.",
        "As for the question of how large a Narrative Container should be for broadcast articles, the size of all Narrative Containers will need to be studied more in depth in order to determine how widely they can be applied – it is possible that in general, the actual size is less important than the simple concept of the Narrative Container.",
        "The annotators were asked to read each article in TimeBank and \"create links from each event to the nearest timex or to the DNC.\"",
        "They were asked specifically to not link an event to another event, only to find the time that would be used to anchor each event in a timeline.",
        "The annotators were also asked to use only three relationship types: before, after, and isJncluded (which also stood in for \"overlap\").",
        "This was done in order to keep the annotation as simple as possible: we wanted to see if the narrative container was a useful tool in temporal annotation, not produce a full gold standard corpus.",
        "This differs from the TimeML annotation guidelines, which suggested only that \"A TLINK has to be created each time a temporal relationship holding between events or an event and a time needs to be annotated.\"",
        "(Saurl et al., 2006) Examples given were for sentences such as \"John drove to Boston on Monday\" – cases where an event was specifically related to a time or another event.",
        "However, because such examples were relatively rare, and temporal relationships are not always so clearly expressed, this annotation method resulted in a corpus that was not optimally informative.",
        "TimeML also uses a fuller set of temporal relations.",
        "The NC annotations, on the other hand, are much richer in terms of informativeness.",
        "Annotators most often linked to the NC, often with an \"isJncluded\" relationship (as in: e1 isJncluded NC).",
        "In fact, roughly 50% of the events were linked to the narrative container and had \"isJncluded\" as the relationship type.",

        "Clearly the narrative container was an intuitive concept for the annotators, and one that was relevant to their annotations.",
        "We used Fleiss' kappa (Fleiss, 1971) to obtain values for agreement between the three annotators: first, we compared the number of times they agreed what the temporal anchor for an event should be, then we compared whether those links that matched had the same relation type.",

        "As we previously described, Narrative Containers are theoretically more informative than Document Creation Times when trying to place unanchored events on a timeline.",
        "In practice, they are as informative as we anticipated: compare the visualizations of TLINK annotations between TimeBank and the NC links in Figure 3.",
        "These were created from the file wsj_1042.tml, one that had complete agreement between annotators about both the size of the NC (one day before the DCT through the DCT) and all the temporal anchors and temporal relations.",
        "Clearly, the NC task has resulted in a more informative annotation-all the events have at least one constraint, and most have both left and right constraints."

        "Narrative Containers, Narrative Times, and Narrative Scopes are important tools for temporal annotation tasks.",
        "The analysis provided here clearly shows that annotating with an NC increases informativeness, and that the concept is sufficiently intuitive for it to not add confusion to the already complicated task of temporal annotation.",
        "However, the work in this area is far from complete.",
        "In the future we intend to study where the left boundary of the NC should be placed for different genres and publication frequencies.",
        "Another annotation task must be performed, requiring a more comprehensive TLINK creation guideline, using both event-time and eventevent links.",
        "Finally, the use of all three concepts for automated annotation tasks should be examined, as they may prove as useful to machines as they are to humans."
