        "Abstractive summarization has been a longstanding and long-term goal in automatic summarization, because systems that can generate abstracts demonstrate a deeper understanding of language and the meaning of documents than systems that merely extract sentences from those documents.",
        "Genest (2009) showed that summaries from the top automatic summarizers are judged as comparable to manual extractive summaries, and both are judged to be far less responsive than manual abstracts, As the state of the art approaches the limits of extractive summarization, it becomes even more pressing to advance abstractive summarization.",
        "However, abstractive summarization has been sidetracked by questions of what qualifies as important information, and how do we find it?",
        "The Guided Summarization task introduced at the Text Analysis Conference 2010 attempts to neutralize both of these problems by introducing topic categories and lists of aspects that a responsive summary should address.",
        "This design results in more similar human models, giving the automatic summarizers a more focused target to pursue, and also provides detailed diagnostics of summary content, which can can help build better meaning-oriented summarization systems."

        "What qualifies as important information and how do we find it?",
        "These questions have been leading research in automatic summarization since its beginnings, and we are still nowhere near a definitive answer.",
        "Worse, experiments with humans subjects suggest a definitive answer might not even exist.",
        "With all their near-perfect language understanding and world knowledge, two human summarizers will still produce two different summaries of the same text, simply because they will disagree on what's important.",
        "Fortunately, usually some of this information will overlap.",
        "This is represented by the idea behind the Pyramid evaluation framework (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004; Passonneau et al., 2005), where different levels of the pyramid represent the proportion of concepts (\"Summary Content Units\", or SCUs) mentioned by 1 to n summarizers in summaries of the same text.",
        "Usually, there are very few SCUs that are mentioned by all summarizers, a few more that are mentioned by some of them, and the greatest proportion are the SCUs that are mentioned by individual summarizers only.",
        "This variance in what should be a \"gold standard\" makes research in automatic summarization methods particularly difficult.",
        "How can we reach a goal so vague and under-defined?",
        "Using term frequency to determine important concepts in a text has proven to be very successful, largely because of its simplicity and universal applicability, but statistical methods can only provide the most basic level of performance.",
        "On the other hand, there is no real motivation to use any deeper meaning-oriented text analysis if we are not even certain what information to look for in order to produce a responsive summary.",
        "To address these concerns, the Summarization track at the 2010 Text Analysis Conference (TAC) introduced a new summarization task - Guided Summarization - in which topics are divided into narrow categories and a list of required aspects is provided for each category.",
        "This serves two purposes: first, it creates a more focused target for automatic summarizers, neutralizing human variance and pointing to concrete types of information the reader requires, and second, it provides a detailed diagnostic tool to analyze the content of automatic summaries, which can help build more meaning-oriented systems.",
        "This paper shows how these objectives were achieved in TAC 2010, looking at the similarity of human-crafted models, and then using the category and aspect information to look in depth at the differences between human and top automatic summarizers, discovering strengths and weaknesses of automatic systems and areas for improvement."

      "heading": "2. Topic-specific summarization",
      "text": [
        "The idea that different types of stories might require different approaches is not new, although the classification varies from task to task.",
        "Topic categories were present in Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2001, where topics were divided into: single-event, single-subject, biographical, multiple events of same type, and opinion.",
        "In their analysis of these results, Nenkova and Louis (2008) find that summaries of articles in what they call topic-cohesive categories (single-event, single-subject, biography) are of higher quality than those in non-cohesive categories (opinion, multiple event).",
        "In essence, categorizing topics into types is based on the assumption that stories of the same type follow a specific template and include the same kinds of facts, and this predictability might be employed to improve the summarization process, since we at least know what kinds of information are important and what to look for.",
        "This was shown, among others, by Bagga (1997), who analyzed source articles used in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) and graphed the distribution of facts in articles on air vehicle launches, terrorist attacks, joint ventures, and corporate personnel changes, finding that the same kinds of facts appeared repeatedly.",
        "A natural conclusion is that Information Extraction (IE) methods might be helpful here, and in fact, White et al.",
        "(2001) presented an IE-based summarization system for natural disasters, where they first filled an IE template with slots related to date, location, type of disaster, damage (people, physical effects), etc.",
        "Similarly, Radev and McKeown (1998) used IE combined with Natural Language Generation (NLG) in their SUMMON system.",
        "There are two ways to classify stories: according to their level of cohesiveness (to use the distinction made by Nenkova and Louis (2008)), and according to subject.",
        "The first classification could help us determine which topics would be easier for automatic summarization, but the difficulty is related purely to lexical characteristics of the text; as shown in Louis and Nenkova (2009), source document similarity in terms of word overlap is one of the predictive features of multi-document summary quality.",
        "The second classification, according to subject matter, is what enables us to utilize more meaning-oriented approaches such as IE and attempt a deeper semantic analysis of the source text, and is what we describe in this paper."

        "The new guided summarization task in 2010 was designed with the second classification in mind, in order to afford the participants a chance to explore deeper linguistic methods of text analysis.",
        "There were five topic categories: (1) Accidents and Natural Disasters, (2) Attacks (Criminal/Terrorist), (3) Health and Safety, (4) Endangered Resources, and (5) Trials and Investigations (Crim-inal/Legal/Other).",
        "In contrast to previous topic-specific summarization tasks, the Guided Summarization task also provided a list of required aspects, which described the type of information that should be included in the summary (if such information could be found in source documents).",
        "Summarizers also had the option of including any other information they deemed important to the topic.",
        "The categories and their aspects, shown in Table 1, were developed on the basis of past DUC and TAC topics and model summaries from years 2001-2009.",
        "Each topic came with 20 chronologically ordered news articles.",
        "The initial summaries were to be produced on the basis of the first 10 documents.",
        "As in TAC 2008 and 2009, the 2010 Summarization task had an update component: using the second 10 documents, summarizers were to produce an update summary under the assumption that the user had already read the first set of source documents.",
        "This means that for the update part, there were two interacting conditions, with the requirement for non-redundancy taking priority over the requirement to address all category aspects.",
        "For each topic, four model summaries were written by human assessors.",
        "All summaries were evaluated with respect to linguistic quality (Overall Readability), content (Pyramid), and general quality (Overall Responsiveness).",
        "Readability and Responsiveness were judged by human assessors on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good), while Pyramid is a score between 0 and 1 (in very rare cases, it exceeds 1, if the candidate summary contains more SCUs than the average reference summary).",
        "Since this was the first year of Guided Summarization, only about half of the 43 participating systems made some use of the provided categories and aspects, mostly using them and their synonyms as query terms.",
        "The introduction of categories, which implies template story types, and aspects, which further narrows content selection, resulted in the parallel model summaries being much more similar to each other than in previous years, as represented by the Pyra-",

        "The macro-averages for automatic summarizers, on the other hand, increase only for initial summaries, which we will discuss further in Section 3.4.",
        "The similarity effect among model summaries can be more clearly seen in Table 3, which shows the percentage of Summary Content Units (SCUs, information \"nuggets\"or simple facts) with different weights in Pyramids across the years between 2008-2010.",
        "The weight of an SCU is simply the number of model summaries in which this information unit appears.",
        "Pyramids in 2010 have greater percentage of SCUs with weight > 1, and their proportion of weight-1 SCUs is below half of all SCUs.",
        "The difference is much more pronounced for the initial summaries, since the update component is restricted by the non-redundancy requirement, resulting in more variance in content selection after the required aspects have been covered.",
        "During the Pyramid creation process, assessors extracting SCUs from model summaries were asked to mark the aspect(s) relevant to each SCU.",

        "As shown in Figure 1, while Responsiveness remains high for human summarizers across categories, which means the content is still relevant to the topic, the Pyramid scores are lower in the update component, which means the summarizers differ more in terms of what information they extract from the source documents.",

        "Initial attempts at more complex treatments of any subject often fail when faced with unrestricted, \"real world\" input.",
        "This is why almost all research in summarization remains centered around relatively simple extractive methods.",
        "Few developers try to incorporate syntactic parsing to compress summary sentences, and almost none want to venture into semantic decompositon of source text, since the complexity of these methods is the cause of potential errors.",
        "Also, the tools might not deal particularly well with different types of stories in the \"newswire\" genre.",
        "However, Genest (2009) showed the limits of purely extractive summarization: their manual, extractive summarizer (HexTac) performed much worse than human abstractors, and comparably to the top automatic summarizers in TAC 2009.",
        "But if we want to see significant progress in abstractive summarization, it's important to provide a more controlled environment for such experiments.",
        "TAC 2010 results show that, first of all, by guiding summary creation we end up with more similar human abstracts than in previous tasks (partly due to the choice of template-like categories, and partly due to the further guiding role of aspects).",

        "Figure 2: Average number of SCUs per aspect in initial and update summaries in TAC 2010.",
        "Dark grey = Pyramids, light grey = top 15 automatic summarizers.",
        "The first pair of columns for each aspects shows initial summaries, the second pair shows update summaries.",
        "ing variance due to subjective opinions among human writers, creates in effect a more concrete information model, and a single, unified information model is an easier goal to emulate than relying on vague and subjective goals like \"importance\".",
        "Out of five categories, Attacks and Accidents generated the most similar models, mostly because they required concrete, unique-answer aspects like where or when.",
        "In Health and Resources, the aspects were more subjective in nature, and the resulting variance was greater.",
        "Moreover, the Guided Task provides a very valuable and detailed diagnostic tool for system developers: by looking at the system performance within each aspect, we can find out which types of information it is better able to identify.",
        "While the top automatic summarizers managed to retrieve less than half of relevant information at the best of times, the facts they did retrieve were highly-weighted.",
        "Their better performance for certain aspects of Attacks, Accidents, and Trials could be ascribed to the fact that most of them rely on sentence position to determine important information in the source document.",
        "A comparison of covered aspects suggests that sentence position might be a better indicator for some types of information than others.",
        "Since it was the first year of the Guided Task, only some of the teams used the provided category/aspect information; as the task continues, we hope to see more participants adopting categories and aspects to guide their summarization.",
        "The predictable elements of each category invite the use of different techniques depending on the type of information sought, perhaps suggesting the use of Information Extraction methods.",
        "Some categories might be easier to process than others, but even if the information-mining approach cannot be extended to all types of stories, at worst we will end up with better summarization for event-type stories, like attacks, accidents, or trials, which together comprise a large part of reported news.",
