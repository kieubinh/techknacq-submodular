        "Information graphics (non-pictorial graphics such as bar charts, line graphs, etc.)",
        "in popular media such as Newsweek, Businessweek, or newspapers, generally have a communicative goal or intended message.",
        "For example, the graphic in Figure 1 is intended to convey a changing trend in sea levels – relatively flat from 1900 to 1930 and then rising from 1930 to 2003.",
        "Thus, using Clark's view of language, information graphics are a means of communication.",
        "Research has shown that the content of information graphics in popular media is usually not repeated in the text of the accompanying article (Car-berry et al., 2006).",
        "The captions of such graphics are also often uninformative or convey little of the graphic's high-level message (Elzer et al., 2005).",
        "This contrasts with scientific documents in which graphics are often used to visualize data, with explicit references to the graphic being used to explain their content (e.g., \"As shown in Fig.",
        "A...\").",
        "Information graphics in popular media contribute to the overall communicative goal of a multimodal document and should not be ignored.",
        "Our work is concerned with the summarization of information graphics from popular media.",
        "Such summaries have several major applications: 1) they can be integrated with the summary of a multimodal document s text, thereby producing a richer summary of the overall document's content; 2) they can be stored in a digital library along with the graphic itself and used to retrieve appropriate graphics in response to user queries; and 3) for individuals with sight impairments, they can be used along with a screen reader to convey not only the text of a document, but also the content of the document s graphics.",
        "In this paper we present our work on summarizing line graphs.",
        "This builds on our previous efforts into summarizing bar charts (Demir et al., 2008; Elzer et al., 2011); however, line graphs have different messages and communicative signals than bar charts and their continuous nature requires different processing.",

        "However, the Holy Grail of summarization work is abstractive summarization in which the document s content is understood and the important concepts are integrated into a coherent summary.",
        "For information graphics, extractive summarization might mean treating the text in the graphic (e.g., the caption) as if it were document text.",
        "One could imagine perhaps expanding this view to include selecting particular data points or segments and constructing sentences that convey them.",
        "Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, requires that the high-level content of the graphic be identified and conveyed in the summary.",
        "The goal of our work is abstractive summarization.",
        "The main issues are identifying the knowledge conveyed by a graphic, selecting the concepts that should be conveyed in a summary, and integrating them into coherent natural language sentences.",
        "As noted in the Introduction, information graphics in popular media generally have a high-level message that they are intended to convey.",
        "This message constitutes the primary communicative or discourse goal (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the graphic and captures its main contribution to the overall discourse goal of the entire document.",
        "However, the graphic also includes salient features that are important components of the graphic s content.",
        "For example, the graphic in Figure 1 is very jagged with sharp fluctuations, indicating that short-term changes have been inconsistent.",
        "Since the graphic s intended message represents its primary discourse goal, we contend that this message should form the core or focus of the graphic s summary.",
        "The salient features should be used to augment the summary of the graph and elaborate on its intended message.",
        "Thus, our methodology consists of the following steps: 1) hypothesize the graphic s primary discourse or communicative goal (i.e., its intended message), 2) identify additional propositions that are salient in the graphic, and 3) construct a natural language summary that integrates the intended message and the additional salient propositions into a coherent text.",
        "Section 3 presents our methodology for hypothesizing a line graph s intended message or discourse goal.",

        "Research has shown that human subjects have a strong tendency to use line graphs to portray trend relationships, as well as a strong tendency to describe line graphs in terms of trends (Zacks and Tversky, 1999).",
        "We analyzed a corpus of simple line graphs collected from various popular media including USA Today, Businessweek, and The (Wilmington) News Journal, and identified a set of 10 high-level message categories that capture the kinds of messages that are conveyed by a simple line graph.",
        "Table 1 defines four of them.",
        "The complete list can be found in (Wu et al., 2010b).",
        "Each of these messages requires recognizing the visual trend(s) in the depicted data.",
        "We use a support vector machine (SVM) to first segment the line graph into a sequence of visually-distinguishable trends; this sequence is then input into a Bayesian network that reasons with evidence from the graphic in order to recognize the graphic s intended message.",

        "(Our corpus of line graphs can be found at www.cis.udel.edu/~carberry/Graphs/viewallgraphs.php)",
        "A line graph can consist of many short, jagged line segments, although a viewer of the graphic abstracts from it a sequence of visually-distinguishable trends.",
        "For example, the line graph in Figure 1 consists of two trends: a relatively stable trend from 1900 to 1930 and a longer, increasing trend from 1930 to 2003.",
        "Our Graph Segmentation Module (GSM) takes a top-down approach (Keogh et al., 2001) to generalize the line graph into sequences of rising, falling, and stable segments, where a segment is a series of connected data points.",
        "The GSM starts with the entire line graph as a single segment and uses a learned model to recursively decide whether each segment should be split into two subsegments; if the decision is to split, the division is made at the point being the greatest distance from a straight line between the two end points of the original segment.",
        "This process is repeated on each subsegment until no further splits are identified.",
        "The GSM returns a sequence of straight lines representing a linear regression of the points in each subsegment, where each straight line is presumed to capture a visually-distinguishable trend in the original graphic.",
        "We used Sequential Minimal Optimization (Platt, 1999) in training an SVM to make segment splitting decisions.",
        "We chose to use an SVM because it works well with high-dimensional data and a relatively small training set, and lessens the chance of overfitting by using the maximum margin separating hyperplane which minimizes the worst-case generalization errors (Tan et al., 2005).",
        "18 attributes, falling into two categories, were used in building the data model (Wu et al., 2010a).",
        "The first category captures statistical tests computed from the sampled data points in the XML representation of the graphic; these tests estimate how different the segment is from a linear regression (i.e., a straight line).",
        "The second category of attributes captures global features of the graphic.",
        "For example, one such attribute relates the segment size to the size of the entire graphic, based on the hypothesis that segments comprising more of the total graph may be stronger candidates for splitting than segments that comprise only a small portion of the graph.",
        "Our Graph Segmentation Module was trained on a set of 649 instances that required a split/no-split decision.",
        "Using leave-one-out cross validation, in which one instance is used for testing and the other 648 instances are used for training, our model achieved an overall accuracy rate of 88.29%.",
        "Once the line graph has been converted into a sequence of visually-distinguishable trends, a Bayesian network is built that captures the possible intended messages for the graphic and the evidence for or against each message.",
        "We adopted a Bayesian network because it weighs different pieces of evidence and assigns a probability to each candidate intended message.",

        "Candidate (concrete) intended messages, having actual instantiated parameters, appear beneath the high-level message category nodes.",
