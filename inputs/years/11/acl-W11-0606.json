        "A comparison of languages around the world reveals that certain properties are far more frequent than others, which are taken to reflect linguistic universals (Greenberg, 1963; Comrie, 1981; Croft, 2002).",
        "Understanding the origins of linguistic universals is an important project for linguistics, and understanding how they relate to human cognitive processes is an important project for cognitive science.",
        "One prominent explanation for the existence of these patterns is the presence of cognitive biases that make certain properties of language more easily learned",
        "Badecker, 2007; Wilson, 2006).",
        "Under this hypothesis, certain properties are common across languages because they are more easily learned than others (a learnability bias) and are therefore more likely to be maintained when a language is passed from one generation to the next.",
        "These universals generally reflect tendencies, rather than properties that are present in each and every language (Croft, 2002).",
        "Recent work in psycholinguistics has provided support for a relationship between learnability biases and the properties that are prevalent in human languages.",
        "A number of studies have shown that certain common phonological patterns, such as vowel harmony, voicing agreement and final devoicing are, indeed, more learnable than other unattested patterns",
        "Ketrez, & Nevins, 2011).",
        "Based on these findings, it is tempting to argue that learnability biases alone might account for the prevalence of these properties in human languages.",
        "However, this argument assumes that more accurate learning of a language with a certain property is sufficient for that property to become widespread across languages and does not account for why a property might be prevalent but not universal across languages.",
        "In this paper, we examine the assumption that greater learnability is sufficient for a property to become prevalent.",
        "We formalize language transmission using a simple linear model, and then show two basic scenarios in which greater learnability for a particular language does not result in that language becoming prevalent.",
        "We first perform a mathematical analysis to show that one way this can occur is for errors in transmission to favor particular languages over others.",
        "We next use a simulation to show another scenario in which greater learnability can fail to result in a dominant pattern: when the number of alternative languages is large.",
        "We conduct two experiments with human participants to illustrate the occurrence of this second scenario in the case of a particular property of human language, vowel harmony."

        "To specify this model, we first define the set of possible languages, denoted H. Each element h G H is one possible language.",
        "Transmission occurs whena new member of the population reneines linguistic data (a set of utterances) from another member of the population and learns a language h G H. We assume transmission occurs only from one person to another person, and that each person laarns onlnoae language.",

        "all languages with a particular property in H1 and all languages without the property in H2.",
        "One way of defining a learnability bias that favors a particular property is for each language with that property to be more likely to be transmitted successfully than each language without that property.",
        "That is, for all possible pairs i G H1 and jG H2, qii > qjj.",
        "This would indicate a general learnability bias for languages in H1 over languages in H2.",
        "Using this definition of a learnability bias, we can determine whether such a bias is sufficient to establish that the property will be present in the majority of languages.",
        "That is, if H1 denotes the languages with the property of interest, we want to determine whether a learnability bias for languages in H1 implies that after many generations, the majority of the languages in the population will be in H1 and not in H2.",
        "We can determine the consequences of many instances of language transmission in this model by appealing to existing results on the equilibrium of this linear dynamical system.",
        "As mentioned above, this linear transmission model is related to two kinds of models that have been used to study language evolution: If we assume that learners are organized in a chain, this linear model is called iterated learning (Kirby, 2001); alternatively, if we assume that there are an infinite number of learners in the population, the model is called the replicator dynamics (Schuster & Sigmund, 1983).",
        "In either case, the probability that a learner will learn language h, assuming the population has reached equilibrium, is given by the solution to the eigenvector equation Qn = n, normalized such that YÂ=1 ni = 1 (for details, see Griffiths & Kalish, 2007).",
        "For languages in H1 to occur the majority of the time, it thus must be the case that EheH1 > EheH2",

        "We have that q11 > qii for all i G H2: each state in H2 has a lower self transition probability than state s1, the only state in H1.",
        "Thus, we have a learnability bias for state s1 over all states in H2.",
        "However, the eigenvector n shown in Figure 1 (c) indicates that the equilibrium of this system, which will be reached after languages are transmitted from person to person many times, favors state s3 over the other states.",
        "Overall, EhGH1 nh = 0.39 while £hGH2 nh = 0.61: most of the learners will learn a language in H2.",
        "Intuitively, this result comes from the fact that transmission failures tend to favor languages in H2.",
        "A learner who learns from someone who speaks a language i in H2 will rarely learn the language in H1, although she may learn a different language than i in H2.",
        "This pattern of transmission failures overwhelms the learnability bias that the language in H1 has over the languages in H2.",
        "Note that this pattern holds even given that q1i > qi1 for all i G H2, another common criterion for a learnability bias.",
        "This result implies that if the linear transmission model is an accurate model for understanding human language evolution, then it is not sufficient to compare how accurately languages are maintained over a single generation in order to predict what trends will emerge after many generations.",
        "Instead, one must also look at what happens when languages are not maintained accurately.",
        "The ways in which mutations occur may be as important as the relative fidelities of transmission in determining long term trends.",

        "In artificial language experiments, greater learnabil-ity is often established by comparing the accuracy of transmission for a language with the property of interest to an arbitrary language.",
        "However, in our experiment, we established such a learnability bias for vowel harmony, but this did not result in vowel harmony being maintained after many instances of transmission.",
        "This result seems to be due to the fact that numerous languages other than harmonic languages were possible, so learners tended to learn one of these many other languages.",
        "One limitation of our analysis is the use of the",
        "Figure 4: Iterated learning chain results.",
        "Dotted lines show the two-tailed 95% confidence interval for chance responding; confidence intervals differ between the two graphs because there are 40 opportunities to generalize versus 80 opportunities to choose harmonic words.",
        "Figure 5: Accuracy on harmonic versus non-harmonic words by iteration.",
        "Overall, there is no difference in accuracy.",
        "simple linear transmission model, in which each learner learns from one member of the previous generation.",
        "It is easy to imagine variants on this model that make more realistic assumptions about cultural transmission of languages.",
        "However, we suspect that these more complex models would not alter the conclusions that we have drawn here.",
        "For example, learning from multiple members of the previous generation tends to dilute the effects of learnability on the languages produced by a population (Smith, 2009; Burkett & Griffiths, 2010).",
        "Overall, the result of a more complicated relationship between learnability biases and linguistic universals is congruent with the evidence that all languages do not exhibit all properties for which learn-ability biases have been found.",
        "Indeed, in historical linguistics, the general principle is one of language divergence, rather than convergence on some universal language (e.g., Greenberg, 1971).",
        "Given this relationship, one must rethink using experimental evidence for particular learnability biases to explain linguistic tendencies.",
        "Instead, one must either estimate all of the values in the transmission matrix, or actually simulate the process of multiple transmissions in the lab to establish whether a particular property with a learnability bias is actually maintained over many generations.",
        "While this process is dependent on assuming a particular model of how transmission occurs in populations, such as the linear iterated learning paradigm we used in our experiments, it provides a way of understanding what mutations are likely to occur and of exploring the long term trends that result from particular learnability biases.",
        "As we showed for vowel harmony, long term trends may not match what one predicted based on a learnability bias.",
        "Given such a result, one must look to factors other than the learnability bias to explain why a property is common across languages.",
