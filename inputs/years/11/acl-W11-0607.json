        "A number of studies using different experimental paradigms (priming, self-paced reading, etc.)",
        "have shown that verbs (eat) activate expectations about nouns occurring as their arguments (cheese)(McRae et al., 1998), and vice versa (McRae et al., 2005).",
        "Nouns also activate expectations about other nouns occurring as co-arguments in the same event (key -door)(Hare et al., 2009).",
        "These behavioral effects support the hypothesis that in the mental lexicon verbs and their arguments are arranged into a web of mutual expectations.",
        "Verb argument expectations encoded in lexical representations are exploited by subjects to determine the plausibility of a noun as an argument of a particular verb (thematic fit, or selec-tionalpreferences in the linguistic literature), which has been proved to have important effects on human sentence processing (McRae et al., 1998).",
        "In a recent work, Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010) bring evidence suggesting a more complex view of the organization and on-line use of verb argument expectations.",
        "In fact, the expectations about the likely fillers of a given verb argument (e.g., the patient role) depend on the way another verb argument (e.g., the agent role) is filled.",
        "For instance, if the agent noun is journalist, the most likely patient for the verb check is spelling, while if the agent noun is mechanic, the most likely patient for the same verb is brakes.",
        "As a consequence, thematic fit judgments are also sensitive to the way other roles of the same verb are filled.",
        "Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010) show that this fact has clear consequences for sentence processing, and argue that subjects dynamically compute and update verb argument expectations and thematic fit during on-line sentence comprehension, by integrating various types of knowledge about events and their arguments.",
        "The aim of this paper is to present a computational model of the dynamic composition and update of verb argument expectations using Distributional Memory (DM)(Baroni and Lenci, 2010), a state-of-the-art Distributional Semantic Model (DSM).",
        "DSMs (aka vector space models) represent word meaning with vectors encoding corpus-based co-occurence statistics, under the assumption of the so-called Distributional Hypothesis (Miller and Charles, 1991; Sahlgren, 2006): Words occurring in similar contexts are also semantically similar (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Padó and Lapata, 2007; Turney and Pantel, 2010).",
        "Thematic fit judgments have already been successfully modeled with DSMs (Erk et al., 2010), but to the best of our knowledge the problem of how thematic fit is dynamically updated depending on the way other arguments are filled has not been addressed yet.",
        "The core of our proposal is that Distributional Memory can be used to represent the subject's expectations about the most likely words co-occurring in given syntactic role.",
        "We will add to the original Distributional Memory framework a model for verb argument expectation composition called ECU, Expectation Composition and Update.",
        "Specifically, we will show how the expectations of an agent-verb pair about their patient noun argument can be compositionally derived from the DM representation of the verb and the DM representation of its agent.",

        "This claim finds an empirical confirmation in the experiments reported by Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010), in which subjects are presented with sentence pairs like the following ones:",
        "(1) The journalistic checked the spellingPA of his latest report.",
        "(congruent condition) (2) The mechanic^ checked the spellingPA of his latest report.",
        "(incongruent condition)",
        "Each pair contains the same verb and patient argument, while differing for the agent argument.",
        "In the congruent condition, the patient is a preferred argument of the verb, given the agent, e.g. spelling is something which is typically checked by a journalist.",
        "In the incongruent condition, the patient is not a preferred argument of the verb, given its agent, e.g. spelling is not something that is typically checked by a mechanic, who rather checks brakes, engines, etc.",
        "Thematic fit judgments used to determine congruent and incongruent agent-verb-patient tuples were collected in an off-line norming study.",
        "Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010) report that self-paced reading times were shorter at the word directly following the patient for the congruent than the incongruent items.",
        "Similar results were obtained in an event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment, in which an N400 effect was observed immediately at the patient noun in the incongruent condition.",
        "In eye-tracking experiments, Kamide et al.",
        "(2003) also demonstrated that the thematic fit of an object depended on the other verb argument fillers.",
        "The conclusion drawn by Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010) is that verb argument expectations and thematic fit are not simply stored in the lexicon, but are rather dynamically updated during sentence comprehension, by integrating various types of knowledge.",
        "In fact, if the verb expectations about an argument role depend on the nouns filling its other arguments, the hypothesis that they are compositionally updated is highly plausible, since, \"it is difficult to envision how the potentially unbounded number of contexts that might be relevant could be anticipated and stored in the lexicon\" (Elman 2009: 21).",
        "Thematic fit judgments have been successfully modeled in distributional semantics.",
        "Erk et al.",
        "(2010) propose the Exemplar-Based Model of Selectional Preferences, in turn based on Erk (2007).",
        "The thematic fit of a noun n as an argument of a verb v is measured with the similarity in a vector space between n and a set of noun exemplars occurring in the same argument role of v. A related approach is adopted by Baroni and Lenci (2010), the main difference being that the thematic fit of n is measured by comparing its vector with a \"prototype\" vector obtaining by averaging over the vectors of the most typical arguments of v. In both cases, the distributional measure of thematic fit is shown to be highly correlated with human plausibility judgements.",
        "Their success notwithstanding, these models fall short of accounting for the dynamical and context-sensitive nature of thematic fit.",
        "In the next section, we will extend the Baroni and Lenci (2010) approach with a model for verb-argument composition, which is able to account for the argument interdependency phenomena shown by the experiments in Bicknell et al. (2010).",
        "If verb argument expectations are likely to be dynamically computed integrating knowledge of the verb with information about its fillers, modeling thematic fit with DSM requires us to address compositional representations.",
        "DSMs have mostly addressed semantic issues related to the representation of the content of single words.",
        "However, growing efforts have recently been devoted to the problem of how to build distributional semantic representations of complex expressions (e.g., phrases, sentences, etc.)",
        "by composing the distributional representations of their component lexical items (Kintsch, 2001; Clark",
        "Lapata, 2010).",
        "Different proposals to address com-positionality in DSM exist, but the most common approach is to model semantic composition as vector composition.",
        "Mitchell and Lapata (2010) systematically explore various vector composition functions (e.g., vector addition, vector product, and other more sophisticated variants thereof), which are used to build distributional vector representations for verb-noun and adjective-noun phrases.",
        "The various models for vector composition are then evaluated in a phrase similarity task.",
        "Erk and Padó (2008) address a partially different and yet crucial aspect of compositionality, i.e., the fact that when words are composed, they tend to affect each other's meanings.",
        "The meaning of run in The horse runs is in fact different from its meaning in The water runs (Kintsch, 2001).",
        "Erk and Padó (2008) claim that words are associated with various types of expectations (typical events for nouns, and typical arguments for verbs)(McRae et al., 1998; McRae et al., 2005) that influence each other when words compose, thereby altering their meaning.",
        "They model this context-sensitive com-positionality by distinguishing the lemma vector of a word w1 (i.e. its out-of-context representation), from its vector in the context of another word w2.",
        "The vector-in-context for wi is obtained by combining the lemma vector of w1 with the lemma vectors of the expectations activated by w2.",
        "For instance, the vector-in-context assigned to run in The horse runs is obtained by combining the lemma vector of run with the lemma vectors of the most typical verbs in which horse appears as a subject (e.g. gallop, trot, etc.).",
        "Like in Mitchell and Lapata (2010), various functions to build vectors in contexts are tested.",
        "Erk and Padó (2008) evaluate their model for context-sensitive vector representation to predict verb similarity in context (e.g. slump in the context of shoulder is more similar to slouch than to decline) and to rank paraphrases.",
        "Our model draws close inspiration from Erk and Padó (2008), with which it shares the importance of verb argument expectations.",
        "However, differently from them, we want to model how the combination of a verb with an argument affects its expectations about the likely fillers of its other arguments.",
        "While Erk and Padó (2008) test their model on a standard word similarity task (i.e. they measure the similarity between the vector-in-context of a verb with the vector of another \"landmark\" verb), we evaluate our model for compositionality in distributional semantics in a thematic fit task.",
        "Indeed, to the best of our knowledge this is the first time in which the issues of thematic fit and compositionality in DSMs are addressed together."

        "Distributional Memory represents corpus-extracted distributional facts as a weighted tuple structure T, a set of weighted word-link-word tuples ((w1,l,w2),a), such that w1 and w2 belong to W, a set of content words (e.g. nouns, verbs, etc.",
        "), and l belongs to L, a set of syntag-matic co-occurrence links between words in a text (e.g. syntactic dependencies, lexicalized patterns, etc.).",
        "For instance, the tuple ((book, obj,read),a) encodes the piece of distributional information that book co-occurs with read in the corpus, and obj specifies the type of syntagmatic link between these words, i.e. direct object.",
        "The score a is some function of the co-occurrence frequency of the tuple in a corpus and is used to characterize its statistical salience.",
        "Distributional Memory belongs to the family of so-called structured DSMs, which take into account the crucial role played by syntactic structures in shaping the distributional properties of words.",
        "To qualify as context of a target item, a word must be linked to it by some (interesting) lexico-syntactic relation, which is also typically used to distinguish the type of this co-occurrence (Lin, 1998; Padó and Lapata, 2007).",

        "Different semantic spaces are then generated \"on demand\" through tensor matriciza-tion, projecting the tuple tensor onto 2-way matrices, whose rows and columns represent semantic spaces to deal with different semantic tasks.",

        "Instead, the space W1W2xL contains vectors associated with word pairs, whose dimensions are links between these pairs.",
        "This space is thus suitable to address tasks involving the measurement of so-called \"relational similarity\" (Tur-ney, 2006), such as analogy detection or relation classification (cf. Baroni and Lenci 2010 for more details about the Distributional Memory spaces and tasks).",

        "For instance, if cosine( (journalist, check) ,spelling) > cosine((mechanic, check),spelling), we score a \"hit\", otherwise we score a \"fail\".",
        "Experiments to model the verb-argument compositional thematic fit have been carried out with the two ECU functions, sum and product, each tested on both datasets.",
        "Model performance has been evaluated with \"hit\" accuracy, i.e. the percentage of\"hits\" scored on each data set.",
        "As a baseline, we have simply adopted the random accuracy.",
        "The results of the ECU models are reported in table 2.",
        "We can notice that when the verb-argument expectations are compositionally updated with the product function, the model is able to significantly outperform the baseline accuracy with both data sets.",
        "Conversely, sum is never able to go beyond the baseline.",
        "This is remindful of the results reported by Erk and Padó (2008) and Mitchell and Lapata (2010), in which multiplicative vector composition achieves better performance in the (verb in context or phrase) similarity tasks than (at least simple) additive functions.",
        "In fact, the advantage of the multiplicative function is that it allows the composition process to highlight the dimensions shared by the vectors of the component words, thereby emphasizing context effects.",
        "Something similar can be argued to explain the results of the current experiments.",
        "With product the expectations of EXpa((hag,v)) are a non-linear function of the expectations about patient nouns shared by v and nag.",
        "Therefore, the objects that are likely to be checked by a mechanic depend on the things that are both typical patients of checking events and typical patients of actions performed by a mechanic.",
        "This results in a stronger thematic fit in the congruent condition than in the incongruent one.",
        "We also carried out experiments to investigate whether the choice of the parameter k (the number of nouns selected to build the \"prototype patient vector\") affects the model performance.",
        "However, we obtained no significant difference with respect to the values reported in table 2."

        "Psycholinguistic evidence has proved that verb argument thematic fit is highly context-sensitive.",
        "In fact, subjects' sensitivity to the likelihood of a noun as a verb argument strongly depends on the nouns filling other arguments of the same verb.",
        "These data hint at a dynamic process underlying verb argument expectation and thematic fit computation, resulting from the compositional integration of the verb expectations with those activated by its arguments.",
        "In this paper, we have presented ECU, a distributional semantic model for the compositional update of verb argument expectations.",
        "ECU has been applied to Distributional Memory, a state-of-the-art Distributional Semantic Model, whose core tensor of corpus-derived tuples is particularly suited to represent word expectations.",
        "ECU has been tested suc-cesfully in an experiment to measure the thematic fit between an agent-verb pair ((uag,v)) and a patient noun argument (upa) of the same verb, with the data set used in the psycholinguistic experiments reported in Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "The good results we have obtained prove that DSMs can provide interesting computational models ofthe compositional update of thematic fit.",
        "Of course, other factors besides verb-argument knowledge may also contribute to the context-sensitive nature of thematic fit.",
        "However, it is worth noticing that one of the hypotheses advanced by Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010) to explain their experimental results is indeed that subjects use their knowledge of statistical linguistic regularities.",
        "This is exactly the type of knowledge that is represented in the Distributional Memory tensor structure and is exploited by ECU.",
        "Starting from the experimental results in Bicknell et al.",
        "(2010) on sentence on-line processing, in this paper we have addressed the issue of how the agent of a verb modulates the subjects' expectations about its patients.",
        "On the other hand, there is broad evidence that the meaning of a verb is predominantly modulated by its object.",
        "This suggests that ECU should also be applied to model how the preferences about the agent argument are determined by the choice of the verb object.",
        "We leave this issue for future research.",
        "Besides being a computational model for thematic fit, we also claim that the ECU approach has a more general relevance for the issue of how to address compositionality in DSMs.",
        "In fact, let us assume that part of the semantic content of a word consists of expectations about likely co-occurring words, which in turn can be modeled with subsets of a distributional tuple tensor.",
        "We can therefore claim that (at least part of) the effect of the semantic composition of words is to update their expectations about other co-occurring words, like ECU does.",
        "We have seen here that this hypothesis finds a nice confirmation with verb-argument composition.",
        "We believe that an interesting empirical question is to investigate to what extent this hypothesis can be generalized to other cases of compositionality.",
        "In the future, we also plan to experiment with other types of expectation composition functions.",
        "Moreover we will extend the ECU model to tackle context-sensitive effects in the thematic fit with respect to other types of verb argument relations, besides agent and patient ones.",
        "In fact, Matsuki et al.",
        "(submitted) have reported that patient and instrument verb arguments show interdependency effects similar to the ones between agents and patients that we have addressed in this paper."
