        "How do listeners interpret a potentially ambiguous referring expression?",
        "To describe a particular event, object or character, often different referring expressions can be used.",
        "Some referring expressions are more specific than others.",
        "For example, a proper name such as 'Eric' is more specific than the personal pronoun 'he', which can refer to any of the male characters in a given linguistic context.",
        "Generally, pronouns are used and interpreted as referring to the most salient character or object (the topic) in the linguistic context (a.o., Ariel, 1990; Gundel, Hedberg, & Zacharski, 1993).",
        "In contrast, full noun phrases or proper names are used to introduce new characters or to refer to less salient characters.",
        "Different factors have been found to affect the saliency of characters or objects in the linguistic context (see Arnold, 1998, for a review), among others the grammatical role.",
        "The subject of the previous sentence is likely to be the current topic (Grosz, Weinstein, & Joshi, 1995).",
        "As a result, listeners will often interpret a pronoun as referring to the previous subject (a.o., McDonald & MacWhinney, 1995; Stevenson, Crawley, & Kleinman, 1994).",
        "However, for children up to the age of 7, the grammatical role seems to be a less important cue than for adults.",

        "Two types of stories were tested, stories with and without a topic shift.",

        "The stories are provided to the model word by word.",
        "During on-line sentence processing the model builds a (simplified) representation of the preceding discourse: every character in the story is represented in the declarative memory.",

        "Explaining children's and adults' performance",
        "In ACT-R, the activation of chunks reflects the chunk's history, because activation is dependent on the frequency of use (the more frequently used, the higher the activation) and the recency of the last retrieval (the more recent the last retrieval, the higher the activation).",
        "The activation of chunks decays with time, but is increased when the chunk is retrieved.",
        "In addition to this base-level activation, spreading activation can temporarily boost the activation of a chunk in a particular context, reflecting the usefulness of that chunk in that con-text.",
        "Chunks that are currently being processed spread activation to other, connected chunks in declarative memory.",
        "As the amount of spreading activation determines the ability to maintain goalrelevant information, differences in spreading activation account for individual differences in working memory capacity (Daily, Lovett, & Reder, 2001).",
        "In our model, the subject of the previous sentence spreads activation to all discourse elements associated with it.",
        "To explain the difference between children's and adults' interpretation of subject pronouns, we manipulated the amount of spreading-activation from the previous subject.",
        "If the amount of spreading activation is high, the chunk representing the subject spreads a large amount of activation and discourse elements that are associated with the subject become more activated in comparison with the other discourse elements.",
        "As a result, the model will retrieve the subject of the previous sentence as the current discourse topic.",
        "However, if the subject spreads a small amount of activation, reflecting a low WM capacity, then there will be no effect on the discourse elements associated with the subject.",
        "In that case, the effects of frequency and recency will be the main determinants of which referent is retrieved.",

        "However, we did not measure a significant interaction between WM load and type of story.",
        "Different explanations are possible for why this interaction did not reach significance, contrary to our expectations.",
        "It could be that WM load does not affect the processing of the sentence, but only affects the updating of the discourse representation with new sentence information.",
        "In that case, sentence wrap-up effects could have masked the effects of WM load.",
        "An alternative explanation is that the moving-window task is not suited to detect the effect of WM load.",
        "It is reasonable to assume that the effect of WM load on the topic shift is spread out over different regions, and is thus more difficult to detect.",
        "ERP studies provide support for this explanation, because for unexpected noun phrases readers show an ERP effect 300-600 ms after the determiner of the unexpected noun phrase (Otten & Van Berkum, 2009), which is much longer than it took participants in our experiment to read one region.",
        "The link between WM capacity and language processing is not new.",
        "For example, within the context of ACT-R, Lewis and Vasishth (2005) have explained difficulties in sentence processing, which have been attributed to WM load, by ACT-R's fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference in the retrieval of chunks.",
        "The fluctuating activation of chunks also plays a role in our account of the interpretation of pronouns in discourse.",
        "This implementation is consistent with the memory account of Foraker and McElree (2007) that characterizes the prominence of discourse elements as differences in strength of their representations in memory (in contrast with a.o.",
        "Grosz et al., 1995; Gundel et al., 1993).",
        "Our implementation is similar to the account of Reitter, Keller and Moore (2011), who use ACT-R's spreading activation mechanism to explain short-term priming of syntactical structures.",
        "In addition, to explain the difference between children's and adults' performance, we implemented the WM theory of Daily, Lovett, and Reder (2001), who manipulated the amount of spreading activation to account for individual differences in working memory capacity on digit span tasks.",
        "Our account is also in line with previously proposed computational models in different frameworks that explain the relation between WM capacity and language processing, such as CC READER (Just & Carpenter, 1992), or 4CAPS (Just & Varma, 2007).",
        "In these models, WM capacity is implemented as a limited amount of activation that is used for storage of intermediate results and for computation.",
        "The amount of activation is different for individuals.",
        "If more capacity is required for processing or storage than is available, this will result in longer processing times or retrieval errors.",
        "On the basis of this theory, Dane-man and Carpenter (1980) predicted longer reading times on discourse pronouns for readers with a low WM capacity.",
        "In contrast, MacDonald and Christiansen (2002) have argued against the limited capacity theory of Just and Carpenter: they propose instead that differences in WM capacity are differences in skill that arise from variations in exposure to the language, and biological differences.",
        "However, our data that shows that WM load can affect the interpretation of stories with a topic shift, is difficult to explain in terms of language skills.",
        "To conclude, on the basis of earlier research (Koster et al., in press) we hypothesized that limited WM capacity might cause decreased comprehension of stories with a topic shift.",
        "To investigate how WM capacity affects the comprehension of the discourse structure, we implemented a cognitive model.",
        "Our model implied that sufficient WM capacity is necessary for an adult-like interpretation of a potentially ambiguous subject pronoun.",
        "With sufficient WM capacity, information about the grammatical roles of the referents in the previous sentence determines the interpretation of the ambiguous pronoun, but readers or listeners without sufficient WM capacity rely more on the base level activation of discourse elements.",
        "To test whether adults' performance would decrease when their WM is taxed, we performed a dual-task experiment in which we manipulated the WM load.",
        "The results confirmed that with higher WM load, adults are less likely to distinguish between stories with and without a topic shift, similarly to children.",
        "Thus WM load can affect the interpretation of ambiguous subject pronouns."
