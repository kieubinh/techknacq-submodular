        "Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs",
        "Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee",
        "Conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to each other's language styles: a speaker will even adjust the number of articles and other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately preceding utterance.",
        "This striking level of coordination is thought to have arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference in status.",
        "But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to become a reflex?",
        "We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since authors create the conversations but don't receive the social benefits (rather, the imagined characters do).",
        "Indeed, we find significant coordination across many families of function words in our large movie-script corpus.",
        "We also report suggestive preliminary findings on the effects of gender and other features; e.g., surprisingly, for articles, on average, characters adapt more to females than to males."

        "\"...it is dangerous to base any sociolinguistic argumentation on the evidence of language in fictional texts only\" (Bleichenbacher (2008), crediting Mares (2000))",
        "The chameleon effect is the \"nonconscious mimicry of the postures, mannerisms, facial expressions, and other behaviors of one's interaction partners\" (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999).",
        "For example, if one conversational participant crosses their arms, their partner often unconsciously crosses their arms as well.",
        "The effect occurs for language, too, ranging from matching of acoustic features such as accent, speech rate, and pitch (Giles et al., 1991; Chartrand and van Baaren, 2009) to lexico-syntactic priming across adjacent or nearby utterances (Bock, 1986; Pickering and Garrod, 2004; Ward and Lit-man, 2007; Reitter et al., 2011).",
        "Our work focuses on adjacent-utterance coordination with respect to classes of function words.",
        "To exemplify the phenomenon, we discuss two short conversations.",
        "• First example: The following exchange from the movie \"The Getaway\" (1972) demonstrates quantifier coordination.",
        "least you were outside.",
        "Carol: It doesn't make | much | difference where you are [...]",
        "Note that \"Carol\" used a quantifier, one that is different than the one \"Doc\" employed.",
        "Also, notice that \"Carol\" could just as well have replied in a way that doesn't include a quantifier, for example, \"It doesn't really matter where you are...\".",
        "• Second example: Levelt and Kelter (1982) report an experiment involving preposition coordination.",
        "Shopkeepers who were called and asked \"At what",
        "time does your shop close?\"",
        "were significantly more likely to say \"_At five o'clock\" than \"five o'clock\".",
        "man chameleon\" uncontrollably takes on the characteristics of those around him.",
        "The term is meant to contrast with \"aping\", a word connoting intentional imitation.",
        "Related terms include adaptation, alignment, entrainment, priming, and Du Bois' dialogic syntax.",
        "Coordination of function-word class has been previously documented in several settings (Niederhof-fer and Pennebaker, 2002; Taylor and Thomas, 2008; Ireland et al., 2011; Gonzales et al., 2010), the largest-scale study being on Twitter (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011).",
        "Problem setting People don't consciously track function words (Levelt and Kelter, 1982; Segalowitz and Lane, 2004; Petten and Kutas, 1991) – it's not easy to answer the question, \"how many prepositions were there in the sentence I just said?\".",
        "Therefore, it is quite striking that humans nonetheless instantly adapt to each other's function-word rates.",
        "Indeed, there is active debate regarding what mechanisms cause nonconscious coordination (Ireland et al., 2011; Branigan et al., 2010).",
        "One line of thought is that convergence represents a social strategy whose aim is to gain the other's social approval (Giles, 2008; Street and Giles, 1982) or enhance the other's comprehension (Clark, 1996; Bortfeld and Brennan, 1997).",
        "This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that coordination is affected by a number of social factors, including relative social status (Natale, 1975; Gregory and Webster, 1996; Thakerar et al., 1982) and gender role (Bilous and Krauss, 1988; Namy et al., 2002; Ireland and Pennebaker, 2010).",
        "But an important question is whether the adaptation mechanism has become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to have transformed into a reflex not requiring any social triggering.",
        "Indeed, it has been argued that unconscious mimicry is partly innate (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999), perhaps due to evolutionary pressure to foster relationships (Lakin et al., 2003).",
        "To answer this question, we take a radical approach: we consider a setting in which the persons generating the coordinating dialog are different from those engaged in the dialog (and standing to reap the social benefits) – imagined conversations, specifically, scripted movie dialogs.",
        "Life is beautiful, but cinema is paradise A priori, it is not clear that movie conversations would exhibit convergence.",
        "Dialogs between movie characters are not truthful representations of real-life conversations.",
        "They often are \"too carefully polished, too rhythmically balanced, too self-consciously artful\" (Kozloff, 2000), due to practical and artistic constraints and scriptwriting practice (McKee, 1999).",
        "For example, mundane phenomena such as stuttering and word repetitions are generally nonexistent on the big screen.",
        "Moreover, writers have many goals to accomplish, including the need to advance the plot, reveal character, make jokes as funny as possible, and so on, all incurring a cognitive load.",
        "So, the question arises: do scripted movie dialogs, in spite of this quasi-artificiality and the aforementioned generation/engagement gap, exhibit the real-life phenomenon of stylistic convergence?",
        "When imagining dialogs, do scriptwriters (noncon-sciously) adjust the respondent's replies to echo the initiator's use of articles, prepositions, and other apparently minor aspects of lexical choice?",
        "According to our results, this is indeed the case, which has fascinating implications.",
        "First, this provides evidence that coordination, assumed to be driven by social motivations, has become so deeply embedded into our ideas of what conversations \"sound like\" that the phenomenon occurs even when the person generating the dialog is not the recipient of the social benefits.",
        "Second, movies can be seen as a controlled environment in which preconceptions about the relation between communication patterns and the social features of the participants can be studied.",
        "This gives us the opportunity to understand how people (scriptwriters) nonconsciously expect convergence to relate to factors such as gender, status and relation type.",
        "Are female characters thought to accommodate more to male characters than vice-versa?",
        "Furthermore, movie scripts constitute a corpus that is especially convenient because meta-features like gender can be more or less readily obtained.",
        "Contributions We check for convergence in a corpus of roughly 250,000 conversational exchanges from movie scripts (available at http://www.",
        "cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/movies).",
        "Specifically, we examine the set of nine families of stylistic features previously utilized by Ireland et al.",
        "(2011), and find a statistically significant convergence effect for all these families.",
        "We thereby provide evidence that language coordination is so implanted within our conception of conversational behavior that, even if such coordination is socially motivated, it is exhibited even when the person generating the language in question is not receiving any of the presumed social advantages.",
        "We also study the effects of gender, narrative importance, and hostility.",
        "Intriguingly, we find that these factors indeed \"affect\" movie characters' linguistic behavior; since the characters aren't real, and control of stylistic lexical choice is largely non-conscious, the effects of these factors can only be springing from patterns existing in the scriptwriters' minds.",
        "Our findings, by enhancing our understanding of linguistic adaptation effects in stylistic word choice and its relation to various socially relevant factors, may in the future aid in practical applications.",
        "Such an understanding would give us insight into how and what kinds of language coordination yield more satisfying interactions – convergence has been already shown to enhance communication in organizational contexts (Bourhis, 1991), psychotherapy (Fer-rara, 1991), care of the mentally disabled (Hamilton, 1991), and police-community interactions (Giles et al., 2007).",
        "Moreover, a deeper understanding can aid human-computer interaction by informing the construction of natural-language generation systems, since people are often more satisfied with encounters exhibiting appropriate linguistic convergence (Bradac et al., 1988; van Baaren et al., 2003), even when the other conversational participant is known to be a computer (Nass and Lee, 2000; Branigan et al., 2010)."
