        "During reading, the eyes move on average four times per second with substantial variation in individual fixation times, reflecting, at least in part, momentary changes in on-line language processing demands.",
        "In psycholinguistics, it is commonly assumed that derivative measures of fixation times, such as first fixation duration and gaze duration, reflect cognitive processes during reading.",
        "It is less clear, however, how the distribution of individual fixation times in reading is affected by on-line processing activities.",
        "In eye movement oriented research, models that attempt to model the distribution of individual fixation times in reading typically assume that sac-cadic movements are executed relatively randomly in time, with cognition only occasionally influencing the timing of saccades (Feng, 2006; McConkie for example, it is assumed that cognitive control can have a direct influence over the timing of sac-cades only with very long fixations, after the normal saccade has been canceled due to processing difficulty.",
        "Distributional models have often made use of the hazard function in order to analyze fixation times in reading (Feng, 2006; Feng, 2009; Yang and McConkie, 2001).",
        "The hazard function, in general terms, is a function of time representing the instantaneous risk that an event (e.g., a saccade) will occur at some specified time t given that it has not occurred prior to time t.",
        "In this paper, we model the distribution of fixation times in terms of a different but related quantity, namely the survival function, which defines the probability of being alive, i.e., the probability of the event not having occurred, at some specified time t. We use semiparametric regression for modeling the influence of linguistic and cognitive effects on the survival function, and we assess the results using survival-based time-dependent evaluation metrics.",
        "More specifically, our objectives are as follows.",
        "We first estimate the survival functions for ten different readers using the Kaplan-Meier method (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) in order to establish the general shape of the survival function for reading time data.",
        "Then, we estimate adjusted survival functions using Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) in order to examine the influence of stimulus variables on survival.",
        "Finally, we assess the adjusted survival models both with respect to the estimated effects of covariates and with respect to the predictive performance on held out data.",
        "The experiments we report in this paper are based on first fixation data (multiple refixations discarded) from the English section of the Dundee Corpus of eye movements in reading (Kennedy and Pynte, 2005).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces survival analysis and further motivates its use for modeling fixation durations in reading.",
        "Section 3 introduces and applies the Kaplan-Meier estimate, to compare the survival functions for the different readers in the corpus.",
        "Section 4 introduces the Cox proportional hazards model and section 5 outlines two methods for assessing the performance of survival models on new data.",
        "Section 6 presents the experimental evaluation of using Cox proportional hazards to model the survival function and summarize and discuss the results.",

        "Survival analysis is the study and modeling of the time it takes for events to occur.",
        "Because methods for survival analysis originally were developed for studying the lifetime distributions of humans in an epidemiological context, the prototypical event in these studies is death and the primary variable of interest thus time until death occurs.",
        "The use of survival analysis, however, reaches beyond the clinical and medical sciences and survival methods apply to any study with a naturally identifiable starting point and a well-defined event of interest as end point.",
        "In non-medical contexts, survival analysis often goes by other names, such as failure time analysis or reliability analysis in engineering applications, event history analysis in sociology, or simply duration analysis in yet other contexts.",
        "A defining characteristic of survival analysis is the ability to deal with censoring in a principled manner.",
        "Censoring is said to occur when only partial information about the survival time of an individual (human or other) is available.",
        "The most common type of censoring is referred to as right-censoring, which occurs when an individual is not subject to the event of interest during the course of the observation period.",
        "In this case, it is only known that the individual did not experience the event prior to the end of the study, but may perhaps do so at a later point in time and this piece of partial information about the censored survival time is included in the analysis.",
        "There are, however, potentially good reasons for using survival analysis even in time-to-event studies that do not necessarily involve censored data, such as when measuring the brief periods of time elapsing between a stimulus appearance and a buttonpress in response-time studies, or when measuring the time between one saccade and the next during reading using eye-tracking.",
        "Such data is usually not normally distributed and even in the absence of censoring one may take advantage of the fact that survival data is almost never assumed to be normally distributed and the methods of survival analysis are designed to reflect this.",
        "Furthermore, if the correct parametric model for the data is not known, or one is not confident enough that a given parametric model is appropriate, the Cox proportional hazards model provides a robust and widely used semiparametric regression method for time-to-event data.",
        "With respect to eye movement data, the Cox model appears appealing because, as pointed out by Feng (2006, 2009), several different types of distributions have been proposed as models of fixation times in reading at one time or another, suggesting there is indeed little agreement with respect to the correct parametric model.",
        "Survival data is commonly analyzed and modeled in terms of the survival and the hazard function.",
        "The survival function describes the probabilistic relationship between survival and time.",
        "Let T be a random variable denoting an individuals' survival time (T > 0).",
        "The survival function, S(t), defines the probability that the individual survives longer than some specified time t:",
        "The survival function is a monotonically decreasing function heading downward as t increases and has the following theoretical properties: S(0) = 1, the probability of surviving past time 0 is 1; and S(oo) = 0, eventually nobody survives and S(t) falls to zero as t tends to infinity.",
        "Notice also that if F(t) is the cumulative distribution function for T, the survival function, S(t), is 1 â€“ F(t).",
        "In the present study, we let the event of interest be the occurrence of a saccade following a fixation period, and the most reasonable starting point for our measurements, at least in practice, appears to be the beginning, or the onset, of the fixation period.",
        "We will refer to the period onset-to-saccade interchangeably as the fixation time or the survival time.",
        "Thus, in this context, the survival function S(t) simply expresses the probability that a given fixation lasts, or survives, longer than some specified time t.",
        "The hazard function, h(t), gives the instantaneous potential, per unit time, for an event to occur in some small time interval after t, given survival up to time",
        "The conditional probability in the formula for the hazard function expresses the probability that the survival time, T, will lie in the time interval between t and t + At, given that the survival time is greater than or equal to t, where At denotes an infinitesimally small interval of time.",
        "As already suggested, in this study the hazard function represents the instantaneous risk, or hazard, of a saccade occurring following a fixation at some specified time t, given that it has not yet occurred."

        "The survival function for time-to-event data can be estimated from a sample of survival times, both censored and uncensored, using the Kaplan-Meier (aka Product-Limit) method.",
        "This is a non-parametric estimate of the survival function which orders the survival times, from the shortest to the longest, and adjusts, for each of the event times, the number of cases still alive according to the number of cases that were either subject to the event or censored in the previous time period.",
        "Let dj be the number of saccades that occur at time tj, and let nj be the number of fixations for which no saccade has yet occurred at time tj.",
        "The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function S(t) is then given by:",
        "In the absence of censored observations, the KaplanMeier estimate is equivalent to the empirical distribution, and the cumulative survival probability at time tj reduces to the number of surviving fixations at time tj divided by the total number of fixations in the sample.",
        "The value of S(t) is constant between event times and the estimated function is therefore a step function that changes value only at times when one or more saccades occur.",
        "Feng (2009) estimated the hazard function for the distribution of fixation times for the readers of the Dundee corpus.",
        "Here, we give a complementary account by estimating the corresponding survival function for these readers using the Kaplan-Meier method.",
        "Figure 1 shows the survival functions for each reader plotted against time.",
        "Individual differences in the survival function emerge soon after 50 ms and at 100 ms we can spot different tendencies with respect to how fast or slow the curves decline.",
        "Overall, however, the behavior of the survival function appears similar across readers.",
        "Typically, the survival function begins with a slow decline up until about 150 ms and is then followed by a very rapid decline during the next 100 ms.",
        "Thus, we can see in figure 1 that the overall survival rates drop from about 80% to 20% in the time interval 150-250 ms.",
        "Thereafter, the function flattens again and at about 400 ms it appears to be converging between the readers.",
        "It is worth noting, however, that the reliability of the estimate decreases with time since the number of surviving fixations becomes fewer and fewer.",
        "Median survival time is the point in time when 50% of the total number of fixations has been terminated by a saccade.",
        "It is thus read off the plot as the time where the probability of survival is 0.5.",
        "Median survival time ranges from 168 ms (reader g) to 220 ms (reader b).",
        "Mean median survival time across all ten readers is 191.4 ms with a standard deviation of 14.9 ms.",

        "The Cox proportional hazards model is a semi-parametric regression model for survival data relating survival time to one or more predictors or co-variates.",
        "More precisely, the Cox model regresses the hazard function on a set of predictors, providing estimates of their effects in terms of hazard ratios.",
        "The Cox proportional hazards model has the following form:",
        "where h0 (t) is the baseline hazard function at time t, x1... xn are the set of covariates or predictor variables, and ÃŸ1... ÃŸn are the corresponding coefficients to be estimated.",
        "Thus, this model gives an expression for the hazard at time t for a particular individual with a given set of covariates.",
        "The baseline hazard, h0(t), represents the value of the hazard function when all covariates are equal to zero, and in the Cox model this baseline hazard is left unspecified and varies as a function of time.",
        "Since no assumptions are made with respect to the form or distribution of the baseline hazard, this can be regarded as the nonparametric part of the Cox proportional hazards model.",
        "However, the Cox model assumes a parametric form with respect to the effect of the predictors on the hazard.",
        "In particular, as seen in equation 4, the predictors are assumed to multiply hazard at any point in time.",
        "This is an important assumption of the Cox model referred to as the assumption of proportional hazards.",
        "It means that the hazard functions for any two individuals at any point in time should be proportional.",
        "In other words, if a certain individual has a risk of the event at some initial point in time that is twice as high as that of another individual, then, under the proportional hazards assumption the risk remains twice as high also at all later times.",
        "There are a variety of different graphical and goodness-of-fit based procedures that can be used to evaluate the proportional hazards assumption for survival data (see Kleinbaum and Klein (2005) for an overview.",

        "The parameter estimates in a fitted Cox model are commonly interpreted in terms of their hazard ratios.",
        "If bi is the value of the coefficient for predictor Xj, the exponentiated coefficient, ebi, gives the estimated hazard ratio for xi.",
        "For continuous variables, the hazard ratio refers to the risk change associated with one unit increase in xi, controlling for the effect of the other variables.",
        "A hazard ratio above one indicates a raised risk of the event occurring and the predictor is in this case thus negatively associated with survival.",
        "Correspondingly, a value below one indicates a decreased risk and the predictor is thus positively associated with survival.",

        "Intuitively, if an individual is alive at time t, the predicted survival probability should be close to 1, and otherwise close to 0.",
        "The prediction error, or Brier score, at time point t is defined as the mean squared error between the observed survival status Yj(t) for the individual i at time t, which is equal to 1 if the individual is alive at t, and 0 otherwise, and the predicted survival probability for i at time t:",
        "The lower the Brier score, the lower the prediction error.",
        "Various benchmark values for the Brier score at time t exists.",
        "The values 0.25 and 0.33, for example, correspond to a constant predicted survival probability of 50% and to a randomly predicted value between 0 and 1, respectively.",
        "Often, however, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function over the training sample is used.",
        "In this case, the benchmark prediction at time point t corresponds to the proportion of individuals surviving past t, thus ignoring all available covariate information.",
        "By tracking the prediction error over time we get the prediction error curve (Graf et al., 1999) and a summary measure of the error for the whole observation period can be obtained by integrating over time (the integrated Brier score).",
        "The concordance index (Harrell et al., 1982), or C-index, estimates the probability that a given prediction agrees, or concurs, with the observed outcome.",
        "For uncensored data, the concordance index is given by the relative frequency of concordant pairs among all pairs of individuals.",
        "A pair is said to be concordant if the individual with the shorter survival time is also predicted by the model to have the highest risk of the two.",
        "Useful reference values for the concordance index are 0.5 which indicates that the predictions are no better than chance, and 1 which indicates that the model discriminates the pairs perfectly."

        "In this paper we applied survival analysis to model fixation times in reading.",
        "In particular, we modeled the survival function of fixation time distributions using the Kaplan-Meier estimate, and the Cox proportional hazards model to adjust for cognitive and linguistic effects on survival.",
        "The adjusted survival models were assessed with respect to the effect of covariates on hazard rates, and with respect to their predictive performance using evaluation metrics that are novel in the context of eye-movement and psycholinguistic modeling.",
        "The results of the analysis suggests that: (1) structural sentence entropy influences survival, i.e., increasing structural uncertainty about the rest of the sentence decreases the risk of moving the eyes; (2) stimulus variables associated with the current fixation influence the survival of the fixation in a limited time frame, roughly between 150 and 250 ms following onset; and (3) linguistic and cognitive effects may influence the timing of saccades earlier than is sometimes assumed.",
        "Looking ahead, important topics to be investigated in the future include frailty models and competing risks survival analysis.",
        "Frailty models are survival-based regression models with random effects, designed to account for variance due to individual-level factors otherwise unaccounted for.",
        "Competing risks survival analysis apply to situations where a finite number of different types of events are possible, but only one of the events can actually occur per individual, e.g., dying from either lung cancer or stroke.",
        "In the current study we did not differentiate between different types of events following a fixation.",
        "A competing risks analysis, however, would let us differentiate between different types of saccades and study the influence of predictors on the survival function based on the type of the saccade following a fixation, e.g., whether it is a forward-directed saccade, refixation or regression.",
        "These and other issues will be addressed."
