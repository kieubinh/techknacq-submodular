        "Hence, social factors influence the way that users express themselves in microtexts and other forms of media.",
        "In addition to social influences, there are also usability and interface issues that may affect the way a user communicates using microtexts.",

        "This is accomplished by carrying out a novel empirical investigation of the lexical transformation characteristics observed within Twitter microtexts.",

        "Although our work is primarily focused on analyzing the lexical variation in language found in online social media, our analysis methodology makes strong use of techniques for normalizing 'noisy text' such as SMS-messages and Twitter messages into standard English.",
        "Normalizing text can traditionally be approached using three well-known NLP metaphors, namely that of spell-checking, machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Kobus et al., 2008).",
        "In the spell-checking approach, corrections from 'noisy' words to 'clean' words proceed on a word-by-word basis.",
        "Choudhury (2007) implements the noisy channel model (Shannon and Weaver, 1948) using a hidden Markov model to handle both graphemic and phonemic variations, and Cook and Stevenson (2009) improve on this model by adapting the channel noise according to several predefined word formations such as stylistic variation, word clipping, etc.",
        "However, spelling correction is traditionally conducted in media with relatively high percentages of well-formed text where one can perform word boundary detection and thus tokenization to a high degree of accuracy.",
        "The main drawback is the strong confidence this approach places on word boundaries (Beaufort et al., 2010), since detecting word boundaries in noisy text is not a trivial problem.",
        "In the machine translation approach (Bangalore et al., 2002; Aw et al., 2006), normalizing noisy text is considered as a translation task from a source language (the noisy text) to a target language (the cleansed text).",
        "Since noisy-and clean text typically vary wildly, it satisfies the notion of translating between two languages.",
        "However, since these transformations can be highly creative, they usually need a wide context (more than one word) to be resolved adequately.",
        "Kobus (2008) also points out that despite the fairly good results achieved with this system, such a purely phrase-based translation model cannot adequately handle the wide level of lexical creativity found in these media.",
        "Finally, the ASR approach is based on the observation that many noisy word forms in SMSes or other noisy text are based on phonetic plays of the clean word.",
        "This approach starts by converting the input message into a phone lattice, which is converted to a word lattice using a phonemegrapheme dictionary.",
        "Finally the word lattice is decoded by applying a language model to the word lattice and using a best-path algorithm to recover the most likely original word sequence.",
        "This approach has the advantage of being able to handle badly segmented word boundaries efficiently, however it prevents the next normalization steps from knowing what graphemes were in the initial sequence (Kobus et al., 2008).",
        "What fundamentally separates the noisy text cleansing task from the spell-checking problem is that most often lexical ill-formedness in these media is intentional.",
        "Han (2011) proposes that this might be in an attempt to save characters in length-constrained media (such as Twitter or SMS), for social identity (conversing in the dialect of a specific group), or due to convention of the medium.",
        "Emotional context is typically expressed with repeat characters such as 'I am sooooooo tired' or excessive punctuation.",
        "At times, however, out-of-vocabulary tokens (spelling errors) might result purely as the result of cognitive oversight.",
        "Cook and Stevenson (2009) are one of the first to explicitly analyze the types of transformations found in short message domains.",
        "They identify: 1) stylistic variation (better ^betta), 2) subsequence abbreviation (doing^dng), 3) clipping of the letter 'g' (talking^talkin), 4) clipping of 'h' (hello^ello), and 5) general syllable clipping (anyway^neway), to be the most frequent transformations.",
        "Cook and Stevenson then incorporate these transformations into their model.",
        "The idea is that such an unsupervised approach based on the linguistic properties of creative word forms has the potential to be adapted for normalization in other similar genres without the cost of developing a large training corpus.",
        "Most importantly, they find that many creative texting forms are the result of a small number of specific word formation processes.",
        "Han (2011) performs a simple analysis on the out-of-vocabulary words found in Twitter, and find that the majority of ill-formed words in Twitter can be attributed to instances where letters are missing or where there are extraneous letters, but the lexical correspondence to the target word is trivially accessible.",
        "They find that most ill-formed words are based on morphophonemic variations."

        "All of the previous work described in Section 2 either",
        "i) only focus on recovering the most likely 'standard English' form of a message, disregarding the stylistic structure of the original noisy text, or",
        "ii) considers the structure of the noisy text found in a medium as a whole, only as a first step (the means) to identify common types of noisy transformations which can subsequently be accounted for (or 'corrected') to produce normalized messages (the desired end result).",
        "However, based on the fact that language is highly contextual, we ask the question: What influence does the context in which a message is produced have on the resulting observed surface structure and style of the message?",
        "In general, since some topics are for instance more formal or informal than others, vocabulary and linguistic style often changes based on the topic that is being discussed.",
        "Moreover, in social media one can identify several other types of context.",
        "Specifically in Twitter, one might consider a user's geographical location, the client from which a user is broadcasting her message, how long she has been using the Twitter service, and so forth.",
        "The intuition is that the unconstrained nature of these media afford users the ability to invent writing conventions to suit their needs.",
        "Since users' needs depend on their circumstances, and hence their context, we hypothesize that the observed writing systems might be influenced by some elements of their context.",
        "For instance, phonemic writing systems might be related to a user's dialect which is related to a user's geographical location.",
        "Furthermore, highly compressed writing conventions (throwing away vowels, using prefixes of words, etc.)",
        "might result from the relatively high input cost associated with using unwieldy keypads on some mobile clients, etc.",
        "The present work is focused on looking at these stylistic elements of messages found in social media, by analyzing the types of stylistic variation at the lexical level, across these contextual dimensions."

        "Therefore, different surface forms of the same word, such as 'today', '2day', '2d4y', are all considered distinct terms.",
        "We then analyse the terminology over different contextual dimensions such as client and location.",

        "As noted in Section 2, text message normalization is not a trivial process.",
        "As shown by Han (2011), most transformations from in-vocabulary words to out-of-vocabulary words can be attributed to a single letter that is changed, removed, or added.",
        "Furthermore, they note that most ill-formed words are related to some morphophonemic variation.",
        "We therefore implemented a text cleanser based on the design of Contractor (2010) using preprocessing techniques discussed in (Kaufmann and Kalita, 2010).",
        "It works as follows: For each input message, we replace @-usernames with \"*USR*\" and urls with \"*URL*\".",

        "Hash tags in the middle of messages are retained, and the hash sign removed.",
        "Next we tokenize this preprocessed message using the NLTK tokenizer (Loper and Bird, 2002).",
        "As noted earlier, standard NLP tools do not perform well on noisy text out-of-the-box.",
        "Based on inspection of incorrectly tokenized output, we therefore include a post-tokenization phase where we split all tokens that include a punctuation symbol into the individual one or two alphanumeric tokens (on either side of the punctuation symbol), and the punctuation symbol.",

        "At this stage, all out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms represent the terms that we are uncertain about, and hence candidate terms for cleansing.",
        "First, for each OOV term, we enumerate each possibly ambiguous character into all its possible interpretations with the transliteration table shown in Table 1.",

        "To achieve this goal, we make use of our noisy text cleanser.",
        "For each Twitter message run through the cleanser, we record the original and cleaned version of each term.",
        "For all of the terms that the cleanser corrects, we automatically identify which (if any) of the transformation rules listed in Table 2 explain the transformation between the original and clean version of the term.",
        "We use this output to analyze the distribution of transformations observed across different user populations.",
        "We begin by analyzing the types of transformations observed across Twitter clients.",
        "Figure 1 plots the (normalized) distribution of lexical transformations observed for the Web, Twitter for Blackberry, Twitter for iPhone, and UberTwitter clients, grouped by the transformations.",
        "We also group the transformations by the individual clients in Figure 2 for more direct comparison.",
        "The results show that Web users tend to use more",
        "Client",
        "% In-Vocabulary",
        "Facebook",
        "88%",

        "contractions than Blackberry and UberTwitter users.",
        "We relate this result to the differences in typing on a virtual compared to a multi-touch keypad.",
        "It was surprising to see that iPhone users tended to use considerably more contractions than the other mobile device clients, which we relate to its word-prediction functionality.",
        "Another interesting result is the fact that Web users often drop vowels to shorten terms more than their mobile client counterparts.",
        "Instead, mobile users often use suffix-style transformations more, which is often more aggressive than the dropping vowels transformation, and possibly a result of the pervasiveness of mobile phones: Large populations of people's first interaction with technology these days are through a mobile phone, a device where strict length limits are imposed on texting, and which hence enforce habits of aggressive lexical compression, which might transfer directly to their use of PCs.",
        "Finally, we observe that mobile device users replace \"you\" with \"u\" substantially more than users of the Web client.",
        "We also performed the same analysis across time zones/locations.",
        "The results are presented in Figure 3 by transformation-type, and again grouped by location for direct comparison in Figure 4.",
        "We observe, perhaps not surprisingly, that the East Coast US, West Coast US, and Hawaii are the most similar with respect to the types of transformations that they commonly use.",
        "However, the most interesting finding here is that British users tend to utilize a noticeably different set of transformations than American users in the Pacific time zones.",
        "For example, British users are much more likely to use contractions and suffixes, but far less likely to drop the last letter of a word, drop all of the vowels in a word, use prefix-style transformations, or to repeat a given letter multiple times.",
        "In a certain sense, this suggests that British users tend to write more proper, less informal English and make use of strikingly different styles for shortening words compared to American users.",
        "This might be related to the differences in dialects between the two regions manifesting itself during a process of phonetic transliteration when composing the messages: Inhabitants of the south-west regions in the US are known for pronouncing for instance running as runnin', which manifests as dropping the last letter, and so forth.",
        "Therefore, when taken with our out-of-vocabulary analysis, our experimental evaluation shows clear evidence that different populations of users express themselves differently online and use different types of lexical transformations depending on their context.",
        "It is our hope that the outcome of this study will spark further investigation into these types of issues and ultimately lead to effective contextually-aware natural language processing and information retrieval approaches that can adapt to a wide range of user contexts.",

        "This paper investigated the writing conventions that different groups of users use to express themselves in microtexts.",
        "We analyzed characteristics of terms that are commonly found in English Twitter messages but are never seen within a large collection of LA Times news articles.",
        "The results showed that a very small number of terms account for a large proportion of the out-of-vocabulary terms.",
        "The same analysis revealed that different populations of users exhibit different propensities to use out-of-vocabulary terms.",
        "For example, it was found that British users tend to use fewer out-of-vocabulary terms compared to users within the United States.",
        "We also carried out a contextualized analysis that leveraged a state-of-the-art noisy text cleanser.",
        "By analyzing the most common types of lexical transformations, it was observed that the types of transformations used varied across Twitter clients (e.g., Web-based clients vs. mobile phone-based clients) and geographic location.",
        "This evidence supported our hypothesis that the measurable contextual indicators surrounding messages in social media play an important role in determining how messages in these media vary at the surface (lexical) level from what might be considered standard English.",
        "The outcome of our empirical evaluation and subsequent analysis suggests that human language technologies (especially natural language processing techniques that rely on well-formed inputs) are likely to be highly susceptible to failure as the result of lexical transformations across nearly all populations and contexts.",
        "However, certain simple rules can be used to clean up a large number of out-of-vocabulary tokens.",
        "Unfortunately, such rules would not be able to properly correct the long tail of the out-of-vocabulary distribution.",
        "In such cases, more sophisticated approaches, such as the noisy text cleanser used in this work, are necessary to combat the noise.",
        "Interestingly, most of the lexical transformations observed affect non-content words, which means that most information retrieval techniques will be unaffected by such transformations.",
        "As part of future work, we are generally interested in developing population and/or context-aware language processing and understanding techniques on top of microtexts.",
        "We are also interested in analyzing different user contexts, such as those based on age and gender and to empirically quantify the effect of noise on actual natural language processing and information retrieval tasks, such as part of speech tagging, parsing, summarization, etc."
