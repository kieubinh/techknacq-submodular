        "Hashtags are not case-sensitive, thus \"#basketball\" also returns \"#Basketball\", for example.",
        "Tweets with the term \"basketball\" (without the hash symbol) do not appear in a search for hashtags.",
        "As hashtags are created by the users themselves, a new social event can lead to the simultaneous emergence of several different tags, each one generated by a different user.",
        "They can either be accepted by other members of the network or not.",
        "In this manner, some propagate and thrive, while others die immediately after birth and are restricted to a few messages.",
        "Similarly, lexical innovations occur when new terms are added to the lexicon of a language, either through the creation of new words, the reuse of existing words or the loan from other languages, for example.",
        "An innovation tends to come from one speaker, who proposes it to other members of his speech community - i.e., to whom he is connected in a network of linguistic contacts and influences.",
        "Afterwards, these speakers make a cultural selection of the innovation, accepting it or rejecting it.",
        "In the context of the network theory, Figure 2 indicates two moments of a novelty's propagation process: the precise time of the innovation (left) and a later point (right), when some individuals have accepted the innovation, while others, although possibly knowing it, didn't.",
        "An innovative linguistic form can get, for some reason, some prestige, and maybe speakers begin to use it, taking it under certain circumstances and transforming it into a variation of the previously hegemonic form.",

        "The links represent follower relationship.",
        "The diffusion of innovations, be they linguistic, behavioral, technological, etc., occurs through a cascade in which the network members, consciously or not, make choices, taking into account a number of factors that determine which forms, behaviors or technologies are more advantageous to be adopted in a given moment (Easley and Kleinberg, 2010).",
        "An important question in the field of linguistics is: how can an initially rare variant spread to an entire linguistic network, or speech community (Sapir, 1921)?",
        "How does the linguistic change take out (Silva, 2006)?",
        "This change, consisting in the dissemination of less common variants to much of the network or even across the entire network, can be seen as an unexpected fact.",
        "However, it occurs.",
        "Thus, to better understand the phenomenon of language change, it seems essential to understand the propagation behavior of innovative forms.",
        "Understanding how these forms spread - how and where they are born, who are the major disseminators, which network features allow greater dissemination - is the main objective of our research group.",
        "In this work, we examine aspects of the dissemination of hashtags in Twitter, aiming at understanding the process of propagation of innovative hashtags in light of linguistic theories.",
        "The utilization of an online social network's dataset allows the review of a linguistic system in its entirety, thereby eliminating the need to work with sampling.",
        "It also allows the verification of temporal propagation, enabling a more precise understanding of the path followed by innovations in the network.",
        "Here, we seek to answer mostly two questions: (1) does the distribution of the hashtags in frequency rankings follow some pattern, as the words in the lexicon of a language?",
        "(2) Is the length of a hashtag a factor that influences to its success or failure?",
        "Our assumption is that identifying linguistic features related to the creation and usage of hashtags in Twitter may raise awareness about individuals' tagging behavior over networks, which is an interesting topic in the field of Network Sciences, Sociology and Social Psychology.",
        "Beyond that, this kind of analysis should be interesting to optimize tag recommendation systems not only on Twitter, but on many other online environments, and to increase the effectiveness of real-time streaming search algorithms.",
        "In the next section, we will discuss related works in Linguistics and in Computer Science.",

        "We ignore these users in our analysis.",
        "In total, we analyzed more than 1.7 billion tweets posted between July 2006 and August 2009.",
        "For a comprehensive description of the data collected we refer the reader to Cha et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "As, in some of our analysis, we intend to compare features of the variation of hashtags to linguistic variation, we must find interchangeable hashtags, i.e., different tags used with the same purpose, to characterize messages on the same topic.",
        "This corresponds to the basic feature of variant linguistic forms, which are used by different speakers, or at different moments, to name the same object, action etc.",
        "Aiming to find interchangeable hashtags, we collected tweets on specific topics.",
        "In this way, we could verify the existence of different hashtags used to categorize messages that could be grouped into one category.",
        "For example, hashtags like #michaeljackson #mj, #jackson, among many others, refer to the same subject and in a managed environment they would probably be condensed under only one tag.",
        "We selected three relevant topics of this period, namely: Michael Jackson (the singer's death has been widely reported in the social networks), Swine Flu (the epidemic of H1N1 was a major issue of 2009), and Music Monday (this topic is related to a very successful campaign in favor of posting tweets related to music on Mondays).",
        "Then, we built one minor base for each one of the topics: MJ (referring to Michael Jackson), SF (referring to Swine Flu) and MM (referring to Music Monday).",
        "These bases were formed by filtering tweets that: (1) included at least one hashtag and (2) included at least one of the following terms that we considered related to the topics: \"michael jackson\" (for the base MJ), \"swine flu\" or \"#swineflu\" (for the base SF), and \"#musicmonday\" (for the base MM).",
        "Consequently, in the base MJ, for example, we gathered all the tweets that included the term \"michael jackson\" and that had at least one hashtag, even if this tag had no direct relationship with the topic.",

        "A linguistic innovation can be described as any change in any existing language system (Breivik and Jahr, 1989).",
        "In linguistics, to say that there was an innovation means that there was a modification, a transformation, in any part of the language -phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics etc.",
        "This novelty is neither degeneration, nor an improvement: language changes and evolves, as a living being, in order to adapt itself to the society in which it is inserted.",
        "We use linguistic knowledge to analyze and explain phenomena related to the creation, usage and dissemination of hashtags.",
        "We see similarities between these two systems: like linguistic innovations, new hashtags are created by individuals when they feel the need to categorize their messages with a term not yet used for this purpose.",
        "This reflects the speaker's need to create a term, for example, to name an object or an action that he/she was not acquainted with in the offline world.",

        "This characteristic corresponds to the general absence of directionality of offline social networks.",
