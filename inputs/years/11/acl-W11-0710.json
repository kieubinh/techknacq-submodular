        "In this paper we use text mining and machine learning methodologies as lenses through which to understand the connection between language use and community membership in online communities.",
        "Specifically we examine an online medical support community called breastcancer.org.",
        "We present analyses of data from an active online community with the goal of uncovering the connection between language and online community membership.",
        "In particular, we will look at language changes that occur over time as people continue to participate in an online community.",
        "Consistent with the Communities of Practice theory of participation within a community (Lave and Wenger, 1991), we find increasing conformity to community norms within the first year of participation that then stabilizes as participants continue their involvement in the community.",
        "Within the Communities of Practice view, socialization into a community begins with peripheral participation, during which individuals have the opportunity to observe community norms.",
        "Lave and Wenger's theory has been applied to both online and face-to-face communities.",
        "In an online community, observing community norms begins with lurking and reading messages before an initial post.",
        "This is termed legitimate peripheral participation, and it is during this stage that potential new members observe community norms in action.",
        "With an initial post, a user embarks upon the path of centripetal participation, as they are taking steps towards core participation.",
        "Becoming a core member of a community means adopting community norms.",
        "Persistent language changes occur as an accumulation of local accommodation effects (Labov, 2010a; Labov, 2010b).",
        "The extent of the adoption reflects the commitment to community membership.",
        "Thus, as an individual progressively moves from the periphery of a community towards the core, their behavior will progressively grow towards conformity with these norms, although total conformity very rarely occurs.",
        "The quantitative analysis we present in the form of a regression model is consistent with this theoretical perspective and allows us to see what centripetal participation and core participation look like within the breastcancer.org community.",
        "We are able to test the robustness of these observations by using the extent of conformity to community norms as a predictor of how long a member has been actively participating in an online community.",
        "We will present results from this predictive analysis as part of the quantitative evidence we provide in support of this model of community participation.",
        "Patterns of local accommodation and of long time language change within communities have been extensively studied in the field of variationist sociolinguistics.",
        "However, with respect to online communities in particular, recent research has looked at accommodation (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2010) and some shorter term language changes (i.e., over a period of a few months).",
        "However, longitudinal analyses of language change spanning long time periods (i.e., more than a few months) in online communities as we present in this paper have been largely absent from the literature.",
        "Typically, long term language change in sociolinguistics requires reconstructing the past from the present using age grading techniques, since a comprehensive historical record is typically absent (Labov, 2010a; Labov, 2010b).",
        "Online communities present a unique opportunity to study long term language change from a much more comprehensive historical record of a community's development.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first review prior work on computational models of accommodation and language change.",
        "We then present a qualitative view of communication within the breastcancer.org community.",
        "We then present two quantitative analyses, one that explores language change in the aggregate, and another that tests the robustness of findings from the first analysis with a regression model that allows us to predict how long a member has been active within the community.",
        "We conclude with discussion and future work."

        "For decades, research under the heading of Social Accommodation Theory (Giles et al., 1973) has attempted to layer a social interpretation on patterns of linguistic variation.",

        "Rickford, 2001).",

        "(2000), in which we find analysis of the formation of group norms in a computermediated communication setting.",
        "Specifically, they found that small groups were formed during the process and communication norms including language usage patterns were present within those groups.",
        "Over time, conformity to these norms increased.",
        "Similarly, Cassell and Tversky (2005) looked at evolution of language patterns in an online community.",

        "When comparing consecutive weeks over a 6 week time period, they found that the language diverged.",

        "Our research differs from the research by Cas-",
        "Postmes et al.",
        "(2000) in several respects.",
        "For example, in all of this work, participants joined the community simultaneously at the inception of the community.",
        "In contrast, our community of inquiry has evolved over time, with members joining intermittently throughout the history of the community.",
        "Additionally, our analysis spans much more time, specifically 2 years of data rather than 3 or 4 months.",
        "Thus, this research addresses a different question from the way community norms are first established at the inception of a community.",
        "In contrast, what we investigate is how new users are socialized into an existing community in which norms have already been established prior to their arrival.",
        "We are not the first researchers to study our community of inquiry (Jha and Elhadad, 2010).",
        "However, prior work on data from this forum was focused on predicting the cancer stage of a patient rather than issues related to language change that we investigate."

        "For example, a large proportion of users only join to ask some medical questions, and therefore do not stay active long.",
        "In fact, we find that a lot of users (12,349) only post in the first week after their registration.",
        "The distribution of number of weeks between a user's last post and registration date follows a power law.",

        "Since community members tend to conform increasingly to community norms over time, although the target class for our predictive model is time, it is reasonable to assume that what the model really learns to predict is how long average community members have been around by the time they sound like that.",
        "In other words, one can think about its time prediction as a measure of how long it sounds like that person has been in the community.",
        "The model would therefore overpredict for members who move from the periphery to the core of a community faster than average while underpredicting for those who do so more gradually.",

        "It is widely accepted that persistent language change in individuals occurs over time as a result of the accumulation of local processes of accommodation.",
        "Although previous research has looked at accommodation within short periods of time, including recent research on social media data, persistent language change as a result of longer term involvement in an online community is still an understudied area.",

        "We have analyzed data from a large online breast cancer forum.",
        "Analyzing data of long time members, we found strong patterns indicating language changes as these members participated in the community, especially over the course of their first year of participation.",
        "We then presented a regression approach to predict how long a person has been a member of the community.",
        "Long time participants were characterized by showing more social behavior.",
        "Furthermore, they used more forum specific language, such as certain abbreviations and ways of greeting.",
        "Due to the nature of our dataset, language was also influenced by external factors such as changes in the cancer process of individuals.",
        "Although our observations are intuitive and agree with observations in previous, related literature regarding socialization in communities, it is still a question whether our observations generalize to other online communities.",
        "In our current work we have looked at changes across users and across contexts.",
        "However, it is well known that individuals adapt their language depending on local interactions.",
        "Thus, a next step would be to model the process by which local accommodation accumulates and results in long term language change."
