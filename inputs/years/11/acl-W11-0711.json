        "In this study, we focus on email formality in various social settings; that is, we want to determine whether the choice of formality in email communication is affected by factors such as the social distance and relative power between the senders and the recipients.",
        "While an early perspective of email communication held that email is a lean medium which lacks vital social cues (Daft and Lengel, 1986), other work has shown that senders of email exhibit a wide range of language and form choices which vary in different social contexts (Orlikowski and Yates, 1994).",
        "Through various theories of sociolinguistics, it is proposed that these changes take place in a predictable manner.",

        "In this study, we build two classifiers: a formality classifier that determines whether an email is formal, and a request classifier that determines whether an email contains a request.",
        "In order to train and evaluate the classifiers, 400 email messages were randomly chosen from the Enron corpus and manually labeled for formality and request.",
        "Formality is a concept which is difficult to define precisely and human judgment on whether an email is formal can be subjective.",
        "To determine how much human annotators can agree on the concept, we asked three annotators to label 100 out of the 400 emails with four labels: \"very formal\", \"somewhat formal\", \"somewhat informal\", and \"very informal\".",
        "Because formality is hard to define, we did not give annotators a concrete definition.",
        "Instead, we provided a few guidelines and asked annotators to follow the guidelines and their intuition.",
        "One of these guidelines was that the formality of an email should not necessarily be dictated by the relationship between the sender and the recipient if their relationship can be inferred from the message.",
        "Another guideline stressed that the nature of an email being business or personal should not necessarily dictate its formality.",
        "Other than these guidelines, annotators were asked to come up with their own criteria for formality while doing the annotation.",
        "Table 1 shows the agreement between each annotator pair and the average score of the three pairs.",
        "For agreement, we calculated the accuracy, which is the percentage of emails that receive the same label from the two annotators.",
        "2-way agreement means the agreement is calculated after the label very formal has been merged with somewhat formal, and very informal with somewhat informal; 4-way agreement means that the agreement is calculated with the four formality labels used by the annotators.",
        "With the 2-way distinction (formal vs. informal), we also calculate the f-score for identifying informal emails, treating one annotation as the gold standard and the other as the system output.",
        "This table shows that, although the concept of formality is intuitive, the inter-annotator agreement on formality is pretty low (especially when making the 4-way distinction).",
        "Finally, Annotator A, who had the highest agreement with other annotators, annotated the remaining 300 emails, and his annotation was treated as the gold standard for our formality classifier.",
        "In order to train and evaluate our request classifier, we asked two annotators to go over the same 400 emails and label each message as containing-request or no-request.",
        "A message is considered to contain a request if it is clear that the sender of the message expects the recipient to take some action to respond to the message.",
        "For instance, if a message includes a question such as what do you think?",
        "or a request such as please call me tomorrow, it should be labeled as containing-request as the sender expects the recipient to call the sender or answer the question.",
        "Our definition is slightly different from the definition of request used in speech acts, and it can be seen as a synonym of require-action.",
        "While some emails clearly contain requests and others clearly do not, there is some gray area in between, which results in the disagreement between the annotators.",
        "Many of the disagreed emails include sentences such as Let me know ifyou have any questions.",
        "This very commonly used expression is itself ambiguous between the meanings \"Let me know whether you have any questions\" and \"If you have any questions, please inform me of that fact\".",
        "Furthermore, this sentence often appears as a marker of politeness or an offer to clarify further, rather than a request for action.",
        "So the correct label of an email containing this expression depends on the context.",
        "For the 400 messages, the two annotators agreed on 361 messages, for an inter-annotator agreement of 90.3% and a F1-score of 87.9% for identifying emails that contain requests."

        "In this study, we explored the relation between formality and five factors: (1) personal vs. business, (2) amount of contact, (3) rank difference, (4) request, and (5) number of recipients.",
        "The experiments show that the general patterns between the rate of informality and the five factors are consistent with Brown and Levinson's model and our intuition; for instance, an email tends to be more formal if it is about business matter, it is sent to someone with a higher rank, or it contains a request.",
        "But the experiments did produce some unexpected results; for instance, the rate of informality increased slightly when the number of recipients is more than 10.",
        "There are several possible reasons for the unexpected results.",
        "One is due to the limitation of our dataset.",
        "For instance, the social interaction between two people could easily go beyond the 3.5 years covered by the Enron corpus, and people could choose other ways of communication besides email.",
        "Therefore, the Enron corpus alone may not be sufficient to capture the social distance between two people in the corpus.",
        "Another possible reason is that the errors made by our classifiers could contribute to some of the unexpected results.",
        "The third possible reason, the one that is most interesting to us, is that there are indeed some interesting phenomena which can explain away the unexpectedness of the results.",
        "For instance, an email sent to a large number of strangers (e.g., an advertisement sent to a large mailing list) may choose to use an informal and entertaining style in order to catch the recipients' attention.",
        "Therefore, a theory that intends to account for people's email behavior may need to distinguish emails sent to a large number of strangers from those sent to a small group of friends.",
        "The benefit of a study like ours is that it allows researchers to test a linguistic or social theory on a large data set in a real setting.",
        "The study can either provide supporting evidence for a theory or reveal certain discrepancies between the prediction made by the theory and the statistics in the real data, which could lead to revision or refinement of the theory.",
        "While this case study has concentrated on email communication, it would be interesting to study formality behavior in other communication media such as Facebook and Twitter.",
        "By applying our methodology to other media, it would be possible to determine whether there are other social factors that influence formality on these media.",
        "For example, it would be useful to determine whether there is a difference in formality with respect to the number of 'friends' or 'followers' that a person has.",
        "Similarly, it would be interesting to examine correlations on the basis of whether a Facebook profile is configured as 'public' or 'private' since the potential viewing audience would be reduced in the case of 'private' profiles.",
        "Since Facebook also contains profiles which are associated with both individuals and businesses, it would be interesting to compare these as we did with personal and business emails.",
        "Finally, it remains to be seen whether requests could be examined in these media but other social factors (including whether posts related to personal matters, social causes, or event promotion) could be explored to examine formality behavior.",

        "We test the theory on the Enron email corpus, and our experimental results are largely consistent with the theory and human intuition.",
        "For future work, we plan to improve the performance of our formality and request classifier by adding additional features such as the ones that look at the layout and zoning of an email (e.g., greetings and signoffs).",
        "We also plan to apply our methodology to other genres of data (e.g., blogs, Facebook, Twitter) or to test other theories.",
        "Another direction for future work is to explore what communication techniques such as formality can reveal about the culture of a particular social network.",
        "For instance, among all the positions listed in the ISI Enron employee position table, lawyers have the lowest rate of informality (7.0%), compared to other positions (e.g., 33.1% for traders).",
        "This implies that the workplace behavior of lawyers (at least with respect to emails) is very different from that of traders.",
        "It will be interesting to compare the behaviors of people from different occupations or from different social networks.",
        "Furthermore, if we could define the norm of behavior within a social group, we could then identify the outliers who might deserve special attention for various reasons.",
