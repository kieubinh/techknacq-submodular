        "The standard document representation in topic modelling is a bag of unigrams, ignoring both macro-level document structure and microlevel constituent structure.",
        "In this talk, I will discuss recent work on consolidating the microlevel document representation with multiword expressions, and present experimental results which demonstrate that linguistically-richer document representations enhance topic modelling."
