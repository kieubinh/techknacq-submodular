        "Over the past two decades or so, Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) have been identified with an increasing amount of interest in the field of Computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "The term MWE is used to refer the various types of linguistic units and expressions including idioms (kick the bucket, 'to die'), noun compounds (village community), phrasal verbs (find out, 'search') and other habitual collocations like conjunction (a* well as), institutionalized phrases (many thanks) etc.",
        "They can also be grossly defined as \"idiosyncratic interpretations that cross the word boundaries\" (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "MWE is considered as a special issue of semantics where the individual components of an expression often fail to keep their meanings intact within the actual meaning of the expression.",
        "This opaqueness in meaning may be partial or total depending on the degree of compositionality of the whole expression.",
        "In Bengali, an analogous scenario can be observed when dealing with the expressions like compound nouns (taser ghar, 'house of cards', 'fragile'), complex predicates such as conjunct verbs (anuvab kara, 'to feel') and compound verbs (uthe para, 'to arise'), idioms (matir manus, 'down to the earth'), Named Entities (NEs) (Rabindra-nath Thakur, 'Rabindranath Tagore') etc.",
        "In this paper, we analyze MWEs from the perspective of semantic interpretation.",
        "We have focused mainly on the fact that the individual meanings of the components are totally or partially diminished in order to form the actual semantics of the expression.",
        "A constellation technique has been employed to group all nouns that are somehow related to the meaning of the component of any expression in the corpus and hence to build cluster for that component.",
        "Two types of vector space based similarity techniques are applied to make a binary classification of the candidate nouns.",
        "The intuition was that more the similarity of the components of an expression, less the probability of the candidate to become a MWE.",
        "We have also shown the results using WordNet::Similarity module.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section, we review the related work on MWE and graph-clustering approach for detecting compositionality.",
        "Section 3 proposes a brief description of the semantic clustering approach.",
        "The system framework is elaborated in Section 4.",
        "Experimental results and the various observations derived from our research are discussed in Section 5.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper."
