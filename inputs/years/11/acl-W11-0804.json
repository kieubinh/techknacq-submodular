        "Techniques for handling lexical data sparsity in parsers have been important ever since the lexicalisation of parsers led to significant improvements in parser performance (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).",
        "The original treebank set of non-terminal labels is too general to give good parsing results.",
        "To overcome this problem, in lexicalised constituency parsers, non-terminals are enriched with lexical information.",
        "Lexicalisation of the grammar vastly increases the number of parameters in the model, spreading the data over more specific events.",
        "Statistics based on low frequency events are not as reliable as statistics on phenomena which occur regularly in the data; frequency counts involving words are typically sparse.",
        "Word statistics are also important in more recent unlexicalised approaches to constituency parsing such as latent variable parsing (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "The basic idea of latent variable parsing is that rather than enrich the nonterminal labels by augmenting them with words, a set of enriched labels which can encapsulate the syntactic behaviour of words is automatically learned via an EM training mechanism.",
        "Parsers need to be able to handle both low frequency words and words occurring in the test set which were unseen in the training set (unknown words).",
        "The problem of rare and unknown words is particularly significant for languages where the size of the treebank is small.",
        "Lexical sparseness is also critical when running a parser on data that is in a different domain to the domain upon which the parser was trained.",
        "As interest in parsing real world data increases, a parsers ability to adequately handle out-of-domain data is critical.",
        "In this paper we examine whether clustering words based on their named entity category can be useful for reducing lexical sparsity in parsing.",
        "Intuitively word tokens in the corpus such as, say, 'Dublin' and 'New York' should play similar syntactic roles in sentences.",
        "Likewise, it is difficult to see how different people names could have different discriminatory influences on the syntax of sentences.",
        "This paper describes experiments at replacing word tokens with special named entity tokens (person names are mapped to PERSON tokens and so on).",
        "Words in the original WSJ treebank are mapped to entity types extracted from the BBN corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) and a latent variable parser is trained and tested on the mapped corpus.",
        "Ultimately, the motivation behind grouping words together in this fashion is to make it easier for the parser to recognise regularities in the data.",
        "The structure of paper is as follows: A brief summary of related work is given in Section 2.",
        "This includes an outline of a common treatment of low frequency and rare words in constituency parsing, involving a mapping process that is similar to the named entity mappings.",
        "Section 3 presents the experiments carried out, starting with a short introduction of the named entity resource used in our experiments and a description of the types of basic entity mappings we examine.",
        "In §3.1 and §3.2 we describe the two different types of mapping technique.",
        "Results are presented in Section 4, followed by a brief discussion in Section 5 indicating possible problems and avenues worth pursuing.",
        "Finally, we conclude."

      "text": [
        "Much previous work on parsing and multiword units (MWUs) adopts the words-with-spaces approach which treats MWUs as one token (by concatenating the words together) (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Cafferkey et al., 2007; Korkontzelos and Manand-har, 2010).",
        "Alternative approaches are that of Finkel and Manning (2009) on joint parsing and named entity recognition and the work of (Wehrli et al., 2010) which uses collocation information to rank competing hypotheses in a symbolic parser.",
        "Also related is work on MWUs and grammar engineering, such as (Zhang et al., 2006; Villavicencio et al., 2007) where automatically detected MWUs are added to the lexicon of a HPSG grammar to improve coverage.",
        "Our work is most similar to the words-with-spaces approach.",
        "Our many-to-one experiments (see §3.1) in particular are similar to previous work on parsing words-with-spaces, except that we map words to entity types rather than concatenated words.",
        "Results are difficult to compare however, due to different parsing methodologies, different types of MWUs, as well as different evaluation methods.",
        "Other relevant work is the integration of named",
        "'it is true that latent variable parsers automatically induce categories for similar words, and thus might be expected to induce a category for say names of people if examples of such words occurred in similar syntactic patterns in the data.",
        "Nonetheless, the problem of data sparsity remains - it is difficult even for latent variable parsers to learn accurate patterns based on words which only occur say once in the training set.",
        "entity types in a surface realisation task by Rajku-mar et al.",
        "(2009) and the French parsing experiments of (Candito and Crabbe, 2009; Candito and Sed-dah, 2010) which involve mapping words to clusters based on morphology as well as clusters automatically induced via unsupervised learning on a large corpus.",
        "Most state-of-the-art constituency parsers (e.g.",
        "take a similar approach to rare and unknown words.",
        "At the beginning of the training process very low frequency words in the training set are mapped to special UNKNOWN tokens.",
        "In this way, some probability mass is reserved for occurrences of UNKNOWN tokens and the lexicon contains productions for such tokens (X – UNKNOWN), with associated probabilities.",
        "When faced with a word in the test set that the parser has not seen in its training set - the unknown word is mapped to the special",
        "UNKNOWN token.",
        "In syntactic parsing, rather than map all low frequency words to one generic UNKNOWN type, it is useful to have several different clusters of unknown words, grouped according to morphological and other 'surfacey' clues in the original word.",
        "For example, certain suffixes in English are strong predictors for the part-of-speech tag of the word (e.g. 'ly') and so all low frequency words ending in 'ly' are mapped to 'UNKNOWN-ly'.",
        "As well as suffix information, UNKNOWN words are commonly grouped based on information on capitalisation and hyphenation.",
        "Similar techniques for handling unknown words have been used for POS tagging (e.g. (Weischedel et al., 1993; Tseng et al., 2005)) and are used in the Charniak (Char-niak, 2000), Berkeley (Petrov et al., 2006) and Stanford (Klein and Manning, 2003) parsers, as well as in the parser used for the experiments in this paper, an in-house implementation ofthe Berkeley parser."

      "text": [
        "The BBN Entity Type Corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005) consists of sentences from the Penn WSJ corpus, manually annotated with named entities.",
        "The Entity Type corpus includes annotation for three classes of named entity: name expressions, time expressions and numeric expressions (in this paper we focus on name expressions).",
        "These are further broken down into types.",
        "Table 1 displays name expression entity types, their frequency in the training set (sections 02-21), as well as some illustrative examples from the training set data.",
        "We carried out experiments with different subsets of entity types.",
        "In one set of experiments, all name expression entities were mapped, with no restriction on the types (ALL-NAMED).",
        "We also carried out experiments on a reduced set of named entities - where only entities marked as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, or GPE and LOCATION were mapped (REDUCED).",
        "Finally, we ran experiments where only one type of named entity was mapped at a time.",
        "In all cases the words in the named entities were replaced by their entity type.",
        "In the many-to-one mapping all words in a named entity were replaced with one named entity type token.",
        "This approach is distinct from the words-with-spaces approach previously pursued in parsing where, for example, 'New York' would be replaced with 'New-York'.",
        "Instead, in our experiments 'New York' is replaced with 'GPE' (geo-political entity).",
        "In both approaches, the parser is forced to respect the multiword unit boundary (and analyses which contain constituents that cross the MWU boundary will not be considered by the parser).",
        "Intuitively, this should help parser accuracy and speed.",
        "The advantage of mapping the word tokens to their entity type rather than to a words-with-spaces token is that in addition we will be reducing data sparsity.",
        "One issue with the many-to-one mapping is that in evaluation exact comparison with a baseline result is difficult because the tokenisation of test and gold sets is different.",
        "When named entities span more than one word, we are reducing the number of words in the sentences.",
        "As parsers tend to do better on short sentences than on long sentences, this could make parsing somewhat easier.",
        "However, we found that the average number of words in a sentence before and after this mapping does not change by much.",
        "The average number of words in the development set is 23.9.",
        "When we map words to named entity tokens (ALL-NAMED), the average drops by just one word to 22.9.",
        "In the one-to-one experiments we replaced each word in named entity with a named entity type token (e.g. Ada Lovelace – pperson pperson).",
