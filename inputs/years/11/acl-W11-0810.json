        "Although Named Entity Recognition has a reported accuracy rate of more than 90%, the results show they make a significant number of mistakes.",
        "The high accuracy rates are based on inadequate methods for testing performance.",
        "By considering only the entities where both taggers agree on the classification, it is likely that we can obtain improved accuracy.",
        "But even so, there are cases where both taggers agree yet the agreement is on an incorrect tagging.",
        "The unit test for assessing NER performance is freely available to download.",
        "As with Information Retrieval test collections, we hope that this becomes one of many, and that they be adopted as a standard for evaluating performance."
