        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), independently of the approach adopted, comprehends two steps before the assignment of role labels: (a) the delimitation of argument takers and (b) the delimitation of arguments.",
        "If the argument taker is not correctly identified, the argument identification will propagate the error and SRL will fail.",
        "Argument takers are predicates, frequently represented only by a verb and occasionally by Complex Predicates (CPs), that is, \"predicates which are multi-headed: they are composed of more than one grammatical element\" (Alsina et al., 1997, p. 1), like give a try, take care, take a shower.",
        "In SRL, the verbal phrases (VPs) identified by a parser are usually used to automatically identify argument takers, but do no suffice.",
        "A lexicon of CPs, as well as the knowledge about verbal chains composition, would complete a fully automatic identification of argument takers.",
        "Consequently, the possibility of disagreement between SRL annotators would rely only on the assignment of role labels to arguments.",
        "This paper reports the investigation of such multi-word units, in order to meet the needs arisen from an SRL annotation task in a corpus of Brazilian Portuguese.",
        "To stress the importance of these CPs for SRL, consider the sentence John takes care of his business in three alternatives of annotation:",
        "The first annotation shows care of his business as a unique argument, masking the fact that this segment is constituted of a predicative noun, care, and its internal argument, ofhis business.",
        "The second annotation shows care and ofhis business as arguments of take, which is incorrect because of his business is clearly an argument of care.",
        "The third annotation is the best for SRL purposes: as a unique predicate – take care, take shares its external argu-",
        "ment with care and care shares its internal argument with take.",
        "The goal of this paper is twofold: first, we briefly describe our computer-aided corpus-based method used to build a comprehensive machine-readable dictionary of such expressions.",
        "Second and most important, we analyze these expressions and their behavior in order to shed some light on the most adequate lexical representation for further integration of our resource into an SRL annotation task.",
        "The result is a database of 773 annotated CPs, that can be used to inform SRL and other NLP applications.",
        "In this study we classify CPs into two groups: idiomatic CPs and less idiomatic CPs.",
        "Idiomatic CPs are those whose sense may not be inferred from their parts.",
        "Examples in Portuguese are fazer questâo (make a point), irembora (go away), dar o fora (get out), tomar conta (take care), dar para trâs (give up), dar de ombros (shrug), passar mal (get sick).",
        "On the other hand, we use \"less idiomatic CPs\" to refer to those CPs that vary in a continuum of different levels of compositionality, from fully compositional to semi-compositional sense, that is, at least one of their lexical components may be litterally understood and/or translated.",
        "Examples of less idiomatic CPs in Portuguese are: dar instruççâo (give instructions), fazer mencäo (make mention), tomar banho (take a shower), tirar foto (take a photo), entrar em depressäo (get depressed), ficar triste (become sad).",
        "Less idiomatic CPs headed by a predicative noun have been called in the literature \"light verb constructions\" (LVC) or \"support verb constructions\" (SVC).",
        "Although both terms have been employed as synonyms, \"light verb\" is, in fact, a semantic concept and \"support verb\" is a syntactic concept.",
        "The term \"light verb\" is attributed to Jespersen (1965) and the term \"support verb\" was already used by Gross in 1981.",
        "A light verb is the use of a poly-semous verb in a non prototypical sense or \"with a subset of their [its] full semantic features\", North (2005).",
        "On the other hand, a support verb is the verb that combines with a noun to enable it to fully predicate, given that some nouns and adjectives may evoke internal arguments, but need to be associated with a verb to evoke the external argument, that is, the subject.",
        "As the function of support verb is almost always performed by a light verb, attributes of LVCs and SVCs have been merged, making them near synonyms.",
        "Against this tendency, this study will show cases of SVCs without light verbs (trazer prejmzo = damage, lit.",
        "bring damage) and cases of LVCs without support verbs (dar certo = work well, lit.",
        "give correct).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, to date, there is no similar study regarding these complex predicates in Brazilian Portuguese, focusing on the development of a lexical resource for NLP tasks, such as SRL.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in §2 we discuss related work, in §3 we present the corpus and the details about our methodology, in §4 we present and discuss the resulting lists of candidates, in §5 we envisage further work and draw our conclusions."

        "These approaches are not adopted here because our goal is precisely to identify which are the verbs, the nouns and other lexical elements that take part in CPs.",
        "Similar motivation to study LVCs/SVCs (for SRL) is found within the scope of Framenet (Atkins et al., 2003) and Propbank (Hwang et al., 2010).",
        "These projects have taken different decisions on how to annotate such constructions.",
        "Framenet annotates the head of the construction (noun or adjective) as argument taker (or frame evoker) and the light verb separately; Propbank, on its turn, first annotates separately light verbs and the predicative nouns (as ARG-PRX) and then merges them, annotating the whole construction as an argument taker.",

        "In the following sections, we comment the results of our analysis of each of the patterns.",
        "The pattern V + N is very productive, as every complement of a transitive verb not introduced by preposition takes this form.",
        "For this reason, we restricted the pattern, adding a preposition after the noun with the aim of capturing only nouns that have their own complements.",
        "We identified 335 complex predicates, including both idiomatic and less idiomatic ones.",
        "For example, bater papo (shoot the breeze, lit.",

        "take conscience) and tirar proveito (take advantage) are less idiomatic, because their sense is more compositional.",

        "Sometimes, causative verbs, like causar (cause) and provocar (provoke) give origin to constructions paraphrasable by a single verb.",

        "Moreover, the large set of verbs involved in the analyzed CPs, summarized in Figure 4, shows that any study based on a closed set of light verbs will be limited, as it cannot capture common exceptions and non-prototypical constructions."

        "This study revealed a large number of CPs and provided us insights into how to capture them with more precision.",
        "Our approach proved to be very useful to identify verbal MWEs, notably with POS tag patterns that have not been explored by other studies (patterns not used to identify LVCs/SVCs).",
        "However, due to the onus of manual annotation, we assume an arbitrary threshold of 10 occurrences that removes potentially interesting candidates.",
        "Our hypothesis is that, in a machine-readable dictionary, as well as in traditional lexicography, rare entries are more useful than common ones, and we would like to explore two alternatives to address this issue.",
        "First, it would be straightforward to apply more sophisticated filtering techniques like lexical association measures to our candidates.",
        "Second, we strongly believe that our patterns are sensitive to corpus genre, because the CPs identified are typical of colloquial register.",
        "Therefore, the same patterns should be applied on a corpus of spoken Brazilian Portuguese, as well as other written genres like web-crawled corpora.",
        "Due to its size and availability, the latter would also allow us to obtain better frequency estimators.",
        "We underline, however, that we should not underestimate the value of our original corpus, as it contains a large amount of unexplored material.",
        "We observed that only the context can tell us whether a given verb is being used as a full verb or as a light and/or support verb.",
        "As a consequence, it is not possible to build a comprehensive lexicon of light and support verbs, because there are full verbs that function as light and/or support verbs in specific constructions, like correr (run) in correr risco (run risk).",
        "As we discarded a considerable number of infrequent lexical items, it is possible that other unusual verbs participate in similar CPs which have not been identified by our study.",
        "For the moment, it is difficult to assess a quantitative measure for the quality and usefulness of our resource, as no similar work exists for Portuguese.",
        "Moreover, the lexical resource presented here is not complete.",
        "Productive patterns, the ones involving nouns, must be further explored to enlarge the aimed lexicon.",
        "A standard resource for English like DANTE, for example, contains 497 support verb constructions involving a fixed set of 5 support verbs, and was evaluated extrinsically with regard to its contribution in complementing the FrameNet data (Atkins, 2010).",
        "Likewise, we intend to evaluate our resource in the context of SRL annotation, to measure its contribution in automatic argument taker identification.",
        "The selected CPs will be employed in an SRL project and, as soon as we receive feedback from this experience, we will be able to report how many CPs have been annotated as argument takers, which will represent an improvement in relation to the present heuristic based only on parsed VPs.",
        "Our final goal is to build a broad-coverage lexicon of CPs in Brazilian Portuguese that may contribute to different NLP applications, in addition to SRL.",
        "We believe that computer-assisted language learning systems and other Portuguese as second language learning material may take great profit from it.",
        "Analysis systems like automatic textual entailment may use the relationship between CPs and paraphrases to infer equivalences between propositions.",
        "Computational language generation systems may also want to choose the most natural verbal construction to use when generating texts in Portuguese.",
        "Finally, we believe that, in the future, it will be possible to enhance our resource by adding more languages and by linking the entries in each language, thus developing a valuable resource for automatic machine translation."
