        "Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are commonly defined as \"recurrent combinations of words that co-occur more often than expected by chance and that correspond to arbitrary word usages\" (Smadja, 1993, 143).",
        "Their importance in the field of natural language processing (NLP) is undeniable.",
        "Although composed of several words, these sequences are nonetheless considered as simple units with regard to part-of-speech at the lexical as well as syntactic levels.",
        "Their identification is therefore essential to the efficiency of applications such as parsing (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004), machine translation (Ren et al., 2009), information extraction, or information retrieval (Vechtomova, 2005).",
        "In these systems, the principle of syntactic or semantic/informational unit is particularly important.",
        "Although the identification and extraction of MWEs now deliver satisfactory results (Evert and Krenn, 2001; Pearce, 2002), their integration into a broader applicative context remains problematic (Sag et al., 2001).",
        "The explanations for this situation are twofold.",
        "1.",
        "The most effective extraction methods resort to statistical association measures based on the frequency of lexical structures.",
        "They, therefore, require a critical amount of data and cannot function properly from a simple phrase or even from a short text.",
        "2.",
        "Since the syntactic and lexical variability of MWEs may be high, lexical resources learned from a corpus cannot take it into account.",
        "The coverage of these resources is indeed too limited when applied to a new text.",
        "To address these two limitations, this article describes how an n-gram frequency database can be used to compute association measures (AMs) efficiently, even for small texts.",
        "The specificity of this new technique is that AMs are computed on-the-fly, freeing it from the coverage limitation that afflicts more simple techniques based on a dictionary.",
        "We start off focussing on our extraction method, and more particularly on the process via which a candidate structure is statistically validated (Section 2).",
        "This presentation principally aims to identify the precise needs of a frequency database reference, both in terms of the interrogation process and in the type of information to be kept in the database.",
        "Then, we will address various issues of storage and query performance raised by the design of the frequency database (Section 3).",
        "Finally, Section 4 reports the results of our experiments and Section 5 concludes and open up future perspectives."

        "Our extraction procedure is comparable to those developed by Smadja (1993) and Daille (1995).",
        "They use a linguistic filter upstream of the statistical estimation.",
        "Unlike purely statistical techniques, this solution provides less coverage but greater accuracy.",
        "It also allows us to assign a unique morpho-syntactic category to each extracted unit (as well as a description of its internal structure), which facilitates its integration into a more complex procedure.",
        "Concretely, we first tagged the texts to clear any lexical ambiguities .",
        "We then identified all MWE candidates in the tagged text with the help of a library of transducers (or syntactic patterns).",
        "Finally, the list of candidates was submitted to the statistical validation module which assigns an AM to each of these.",
        "In this study, we consider four basic types of nominal structures : adjective-noun (AN), noun-adjective (NA), noun-preposition-noun (NprepN), and noun-noun (NN), which are likely to undergo three types of variations : modification (mainly adverbial insertion and / or adjectival), coordination, and juxtaposition (e.g. NprepNprepN, NprepNN, etc).",
        "This enables us to identify a wide variety of sequences that are labelled by xml tags which specify :",
        "- the lexical heads of the various components ; - the adjectival and prepositional dependencies ;",
        "- any possible coordination.",
        "This information can be exploited later to carry out the syntactic decomposition of the extracted structures and also to limit the statistical validation to the content words of each structure.",
        "1.",
        "The tagging is done with the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).",
        "2.",
        "To apply our transducers to the tagged text, we use Unitex (Paumier, 2003).",
        "The output of the process is a file containing only the recognized sequences.",
        "3.",
        "As we work in the field of indexation, we limit our extraction to nominal terms.",
        "Association measures are conventionally used to automatically determine whether an extracted phrase is an MWE or not.",
        "They are mathematical functions that aim to capture the degree of cohesion or association between the constituents.",
        "The most frequently used measures are the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993), the mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990) or the f (Church and Gale, 1991), although up to 82 measures have been considered by Pecina and Schlesinger (2006).",
        "In this paper, we did not aim to compare AMs, but simply to select some effective ones in order to evaluate the relevance of a reference for MWE extraction.",
        "However, association measures present two main shortcomings that were troublesome for us : they are designed for bigrams, although longer MWEs are quite frequent in any corpus , and they require the definition of a threshold above which an extracted phrase is considered as an MWE.",
        "The first aspect is very limiting when dealing with real data where longer units are common.",
        "The second may be dealt with some experimental process to obtain the optimal value for a given dataset, but is prone to generalization problems.",
        "In the next two sections, we present the strategies we have used to overcome these two limitations.",
        "A common way to go beyond the bigram limitation is to compute the AMs at the bigram level and then use the results as input for the computation of higher order AMs (Seretan et al., 2003).",
        "However, our preliminary experimentations have yielded unsatisfactory results for this technique when it is applied to all words and not to heads only.",
        "This is probably a side effect of high frequency bigrams such as preposition-determiner (prep det) in French.",
        "Another strategy explored by Silva and Lopes (1999) is the fair dispersion point normalization.",
        "For a given n-gram, which has n – 1 dispersion points that define n – 1 \"pseudo-bigrams\", they compute the arithmetic mean of the probabilities of the various combinations rather than attempting to pick up the right point.",

        "4.",
        "In our test corpus (see Section 4), 2044 MWEs out of 3714 are longer than the bigrams.",
        "authors to generalize various conventional measures beyond the bigram level.",
        "Among these, we selected the fair log-likelihood ratio as the second AM for our experiments (see Equation 1), given that the classic log-likelihood ratio has been found to be one of the best measures (Dunning, 1993; Evert and",
        "Krenn, 2001).",
        "and N is the number of n-grams in the corpus.",
        "Silva and Lopes (1999) also suggested an AM of their own : the Symmetrical Conditional Probability, which corresponds to P(w1|w2)P(w2|w1) for a bigram.",
        "They defined the fair dispersion point normalization to extend it to larger n-grams, as shown in Equation 2.",
        "where w1 • • • wn is the n-gram considered and Avpis defined as follows :",
        "Finally, we considered a last AM : the Mutual Expectation (Dias et al., 1999) (see Equation 4).",
        "Its specificity lies in its ability to take into account noncontiguous MWEs such as \"to take_decision\" or \"a number of\", which can also be realized using the heads (see above).",
        "where FPE is defined as follows :",
        "It should be noted that the expression w1 • • • w>i ••• wn, where the indicates an omitted term, represents all the n (n-1)-grams the candidate MWE comprises.",
        "FPE is then able to estimate the \"glue\" between all the constituents separated by a gap, but this nevertheless requires a more complex string matching process.",
        "To summarize, we have selected the three following association measures for n-grams : the fair log-likelihood ratio, SCPf, and ME.",
        "Their efficiency is further discussed in Section 4.",
        "The second problem that arises when one wants to locate all the MWEs in a given text is the classification criterion.",
        "For the log-likelihood ratio, which follows a chi-square distribution once it is transformed as – 2 * logl, a first solution is to base the decision on the p-value.",
        "However, significance tests become highly unreliable for large corpora, since the high frequencies produce high scores for the chi-square and all phenomena then appear significant (Kilgarriff, 2005).",
        "A second technique commonly used in the MWE literature is to select a threshold for the AM above which an analyzed phrase is considered as an MWE.",
        "Again, this threshold depends on the size of the corpus used and cannot be fixed once and for all for a specific AM.",
        "It must be obtained empirically for each application of an MWE extractor to a new text or to a new domain.",
        "In order not to resort to a threshold, (Silva et al., 1999) suggested the LocalMax algorithm that selects MWEs whose AMs are higher than those of their neighborhood.",
        "In other words, a given unit is classified as an MWE if g(w1 • •• wn), the associative function, is a local maximum.",
        "In our case, since the notion of reference implies a large corpus and high frequencies, we rejected the first of these three approaches.",
        "We experimented with the second and third and show in Section 5 how the use of a reference could partially solve the threshold issues."

        "This approach requires a manual validation of the features when inserting them into the dictionary.",
        "Watrin (2007) considers a simpler technique that consists in identifying, for each type of structure, all the possible insertion points and specifying the lexical and syntactic nature of possible modifiers.",
        "In this case, each MWE takes the form of a regular expression formalizing all possible variations from the canonical form.",
        "Both solutions enable to consider more MWEs but fail to express all possible variations.",

        "(2006).",
        "Moreover, they limit lexical variations to a finite set of canonical structures that have been encountered and are therefore unable to recognize new candidates.",
        "The notion of reference which we define in this article aims to overcome these two limitations.",
        "Rather than providing a list of MWEs that are precomputed on a corpus, we suggest storing the information needed to calculate various AMs within a database.",
        "Hence, we no longer restrict MWEs to a finite set of lexical entries but allow the on-the-fly computation of AMs for any MWE candidate, whatever the size of the input text.",
        "From a computational point of view, this idea involves the compression of a large number of lexical structures of order N as well as their absolute frequency.",
        "Moreover, the calculation of the various AMs considered in this study also requires the frequencies of all structures of order n, strictly lower than N (0 < n < N).",
        "The second type of information can however be inferred from the frequency of the structures of order N, provided the storage and questioning system is efficient enough for real-time applications.",
        "The need for efficiency also applies to queries related to the ME measure or the LocalMax algorithm that partly involve the use of wildcards.",
        "This type of search tool can be efficiently implemented with a PATRICIA tree (Morrison, 1968).",
        "This data structure enables the compression of n-grams that share a common prefix and of the nodes that have only one child.",
        "The latter compression is even more effective as most of the n-grams have a unique suffix (Sekine, 2008).",
        "Beyond the compression that this structure allows, it also guarantees a very fast access to data insofar as a query is a simple tree traversal that can be done in constant time.",
        "In order to further optimize the final data structure, we store the vocabulary in a table and associate an integer as a unique identifier for every word.",
        "In this way, we avoid the word repetition (whose size in memory far exceeds that of an integer) in the tree.",
        "Moreover, this technique also enables to speed up the query mechanism, since the keys are smaller.",
        "We derived two different implementations of this structure.",
        "The first stores the data directly in memory.",
        "While it enables easy access to data, the number of n-grams that can be stored is limited by the capacity of the RAM.",
        "Therefore, in order to take a huge number of n-grams into account, we also implemented a \"disk\" version of the tree.",
        "Finally, in order to treat wildcard queries needed by the ME and the LocalMax, we enhanced our structure with a set of indexes to improve access to each word, whatever its depth within the tree.",
        "Obviously, this mechanism might not be robust enough for a system multiplying the number of wildcards, but it is perfectly suited to the needs of an MWEs extraction process.",
        "Once the computational aspects of reference building have been dealt with, a corpus from which to populate the database needs to be selected.",
        "This aspect raises two issues : the size and the nature of the corpus used.",
        "Dunning (1993) has demonstrated that the size ofthe corpus from which MWEs are extracted matters.",
