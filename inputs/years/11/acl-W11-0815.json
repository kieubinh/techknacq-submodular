        "One of the motivations of this work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction.",
        "The term \"multiword expression\" has been used to describe a large set of distinct constructions, for instance support verbs, noun compounds, institutionalized phrases and so on.",
        "Calzolari et al.",
        "(2002) defines MWEs as a sequence of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis.",
        "The nature of MWEs can be quite heterogeneous and each of the different classes has specific characteristics, posing a challenge to the implementation of mechanisms that provide unified treatment for them.",
        "For instance, even if a standard system capable of identifying boundaries between words, i.e.",
        "a tokenizer, may nevertheless be incapable of recognizing a sequence of words as an MWEs and treating them as a single unit if necessary (e.g. to kick the bucket meaning to die).",
        "For an NLP application to be effective, it requires mechanisms that are able to identify MWEs, handle them and make use of them in a meaningful way (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin et al., 2003).",
        "It is estimated that the number of MWEs in the lexicon of a native speaker of a language has the same order of magnitude as the number of single words (Jackendoff, 1997).",
        "However, these ratios are probably underestimated when considering domain-specific language, in which the specialized vocabulary and terminology are composed mostly by MWEs.",
        "In this paper, we perform an application-oriented evaluation of the inclusion of MWE treatment into an Information Retrieval (IR) system.",
        "IR systems aim to provide users with quick access to data they are interested (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).",
        "Although language processing is not vital to modern IR systems, it may be convenient (Sparck Jones, 1997) and in this scenario, NLP techniques may contribute in the selection of MWEs for indexing as single units in the IR system.",
        "The selection of appropriate indexing terms is a key factor for the quality of IR systems.",
        "In an ideal system, the index terms should correspond to the concepts found in the documents.",
        "If indexing is performed only with the atomic terms, there may be a loss of semantic content of the documents.",
        "For example, if the query was pop star meaning celebrity, and the terms were indexed individually, the relevant documents may not be retrieved and the system would return instead irrelevant documents about celestial bodies or carbonated drinks.",
        "In order to investigate the effects of indexing of MWEs for IR, the results of queries are analyzed using IR quality metrics.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we discuss briefly MWEs and some of the challenges they represent.",
        "This is followed in section 3 by a discussion of the materials and methods employed in this paper, and in section 4 of the evaluation performed.",
        "We finish with some conclusions and future work."

        "The concept of Multiword Expression has been widely viewed as a sequence of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis (Cal-zolari et al., 2002), or as Idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces) (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "One of the great challenges of NLP is the identification of such expressions, \"hidden\" in texts of various genres.",
        "The difficulties encountered for identifying Multiword Expressions arise for reasons like:",
        "• the difficulty to find the boundaries of a multiword, because the number of component words may vary, or they may not always occur in a canonical sequence (e.g. rock the boat, rock the seemingly intransigent boat and the bourgeois boat was rocked);",
        "• even some of the core components of an MWE may present some variation (e.g. throw NP to the lions/wolves/dogs/?birds/?butterflies);",
        "• in a multilingual perspective, MWEs of a source language are often not equivalent to their word-by-word translation in the target language (e.g. guarda-chuva in Portuguese as umbrella in English and not as ?store rain).",
        "The automatic discovery of specific types of MWEs has attracted the attention of many researchers in NLP over the past years.",
        "With the recent increase in efficiency and accuracy of techniques for preprocessing texts, such as tagging and parsing, these can become an aid in improving the performance of MWE detection techniques.",
        "In terms of practical MWE identification systems, a well known approach is that of Smadja (1993), who uses a set of techniques based on statistical methods, calculated from word frequencies, to identify MWEs in corpora.",
        "This approach is implemented in a lexicographic tool called Xtract.",
        "More recently there has been the release of the mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010) for the automatic extraction of MWEs from monolingual corpora, that both generates and validates MWE candidates.",
        "As generation is based on surface forms, for the validation, a series of criteria for removing noise are provided, including some (language independent) association measures such as mutual information, dice coefficient and maximum likelihood.",
        "Several other researchers have proposed a number of computational techniques that deal with the discovery of MWEs: Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002) for verb-particle constructions, Pearce (2002) and Evert and Krenn (2005) for collocations, Nicholson and Baldwin (2006) for compound nouns and many others.",
        "For our experiments, we used some standard statistical measures such as mutual information, point-wise mutual information, chi-square, permutation entropy (Zhang et al., 2006), dice coefficient, and t-test to extract MWEs from a collection of documents (i.e. we consider the collection of documents indexed by the IR system as our corpus)."

        "Together, they contain over 160,000 news articles (Table 1) and each news article is considered as a document.",
        "The collection of documents, as well as the query topics and the list of relevance judgments (which will be discussed afterwards), were prepared in the context of the CLEF 2008 (Cross Language Evaluation Forum), for the task entitled Robust-WSD (Acosta et al., 2008).",
        "This task aimed to explore the contribution of the disambiguation of words to bilingual or monolingual IR.",
        "The task was to assess the validity of word-sense disambiguation for IR.",
        "Thus, the documents in the corpus have been annotated by a disambiguation system.",
        "The structure of a document contains information about the identifier of a term in a document (TERM ID), the lemma of a term (LEMA) and also its morphosyntactic tag (POS).",
        "In addition, it contains the form in which the term appeared in the text (WF) and information of the term in the WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998) as SYNSET SCORE and CODE, both not used for the experiment.",
        "An example of the representation of a term in the document is shown in Figure 1.",
        "In this paper, we extracted the terms located in the LEMA attribute, in other words, in their canonical form (e.g. letter bomb for letter bombs).",
        "The use of lemmas and not the words (e.g. write for wrote, written, etc.)",
        "to the formation of the corpus, avoids linguistic variations that can affect the results of the experiments.",
        "As a results, our documents were formed only by lemmas and the next step is the indexing of documents using an IR system.",
        "For this task we used a tool called Zettair (Zettair, 2008), which is a compact textual search engine that can be used both for the indexing and for querying text collections.",
        "Porter's Stemmer (Porter, 1997) as implemented in Zettair was also used.",
        "Stemming can provide further conflation of related terms.",
        "For example, bomb and bombing were not merged in the lemmatized texts but after stemming they are conflated to a single representation.",

        "For each query topic, the 1,000 top scoring documents were selected.",

        "Each bigram present in a predefined dictionary and occurring in a document is treated as a single term, for indexing and retrieval purposes.",

        "In order to make the experiment feasible, we used only bigrams formed by compound nouns, in other words, when the POS of both words was NN (Noun).",
        "Thus, with bigrams consisting of sequences of NN as a preprocessing step to eliminate noise that could affect the experiment, the number of bigrams with MWE candidates was reduced to 308,871.",
        "The next step was the selection of bigrams that had the highest frequency in the text, so we chose candidates occurring at least ten times in the whole corpus.",

        "In order do decide if one run is indeed superior to another, instead of using the absolute MAP value, we chose to calculate a margin of 5%.",
        "The intuition behind this is that in IR, a difference of less than 5% between the results being compared is not considered significant (Buckley and Voorhees, 2000).",
        "To be considered as gain the difference between the values resulting from two different indices for the same query topic should be greater than 5%.",
        "Differences of less than 5% are considered ties.",

        "In the case of BCN, the gain is almost 20% of cases and the WCN, the difference between gain and loss is less than 2%.",
        "Finally, this first experiment guided us toward a deeper evaluation of the query topics that have MWEs, because there is a possibility that the MWE insertions in documents can decrease the accuracy of the system on topics that have no MWE.",

        "These values are shown in Table 6.",
        "As shown in Table 6 we verified that the GS index obtained the best result compared to others.",
        "This was somewhat expected since the MWEs in that dictionary are considered \"real\" MWEs.",
        "After GS, best results were obtained from the manual indices M1 and M2.",
        "The index that we consider as containing the lowest confident MWEs (WCN), obtained better results than Decision Trees, Nominal Compounds and Best Nominal Compounds, in this order.",
        "One possible reason for this to happen is that the number of MWEs inserted is higher than in the other indices.",
        "Compared with the BL, all indices with MWE insertion have improved more than degraded the results, in quantitative terms.",
        "Our largest gain was with the index GS, where 55.56% of the topics have improved, but the same index showed the highest percentage of loss, 22.22%.",
        "Analyzing the WCN, we can identify that this index has the lowest gain compared to all other indices: 32.14%, although having also the lowest loss.",
        "But, 60.71 % ofthe topics modified had no significant differences compared to the Baseline.",
        "Thus, we can conclude that the WCN index is the one that modifies the least the result of a query.",
        "The indices CN and BCN had a similar result, and knowing that a dictionary used to create BCN is a subset of the dictionary CN, we can conclude that the gain values, choosing the best MWE candidates, does not affect the accuracy, which only improves subtly.",
        "But the computational cost for the insertion of these MWEs in the corpus was reduced by half.",

        "This work consists in investigating the impact of Multiword Expressions on applications, focusing on compound nouns in Information Retrieval systems, and whether a more adequate treatment for these expressions can bring possible improvements in the indexing these expressions.",
        "MWEs are found in all genres of texts and their appropriate use is being targeted for study, both in linguistics and computing, due to the different characteristic variations of this type of expression, which ends up causing problems for the success of computational methods that aim their processing.",
        "In this work we aimed at achieving a better understanding of several important points associated with the use of Multiword Expressions in IR systems.",
        "In general, the MWEs insertion improves the results of retrieval for relevant documents, because the indexing of specific terms makes it easier to retrieve specific documents related to these terms.",
        "Nevertheless, the use of these expressions made the results worse in some c]ases, because some topics require a semantic analysis to return relevant documents.",
        "Some of these documents are related to the query, but do not satisfy all criteria in the query topic.",
        "We conclude also that the quality of MWEs used directly influenced the results.",
        "For future work, we would like to use other MWE types and not just compound nouns as used in this work.",
        "Other methods of extraction and a further study in Named Entities are good themes to complement this subject.",
        "A variation of corpora, different from newspaper articles, because each domain has a specific terminology, can also be an interesting subject for further evaluation.",
