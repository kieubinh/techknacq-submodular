        "Wide usage of the web brings some requirements to make this data more beneficial for people.",
        "Understanding text from a foreign language or accessing relevant ones among millions of documents has become crucially important.",
        "However, due to the large size of data, it is very difficult for human to maintain these tasks without rapid computer processing.",
        "Automatic text summarization, information extraction and text categorization are all important NLP areas, which aim to help humans benefit from computer systems to perform these tasks.",
        "The process of obtaining robust computer systems capable of handling these tasks involves supporting machines with semantic knowledge.",
        "The type of necessary knowledge depends on the target system.",
        "Nevertheless, the information of what kinds of relations exist between the words can be very useful for many purposes especially for NLP applications.",

        "Obtaining a semantic network for Turkish language is the goal of this study.",
        "Since this study is an initial step of developing a semantic network in Turkish, basic relationship of hyponymy and synonymy are primarily handled.",
        "For this purpose, the investigation of dictionary definitions and the morphological richness of Turkish language are utilized.",
        "Different types of relationships are shown in Table 1.",
        "Since these relationships are very basic, they are likely to be used in various kinds of NLP tasks.",
        "Various patterns are extracted from dictionary by using both syntax and string features of the definitions.",
        "Each definition represents particular sense of a word, so they can be considered as different words.",
        "For more accurate semantic analysis, the connection between words should be established between appropriate senses of the words.",
        "To be more concrete, an example can be given on the semantically ambiguous word as; yüz 'face' or 'hundred'.",

        "In fact, both the number and types of the possible relationships are not clearly identified in this area.",
        "However, there are some widely accepted basic relationships, which can be considered as the backbone of semantic networks.",

        "WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998) and ConceptNet(Havasi et al., 2007) are based on this set of specific relationships such as hyponymy, synonymy, meronymy etc.",
        "These are the most basic but also the most informative ones among the common relation types.",
        "Some manual work has been performed at the beginning for constructing this kind of semantic networks, including but not limited with Wordnet.",
        "Nowadays, however, semi or fully automatic systems capable of performing these processes are worked on.",
        "Different methods have been used from collecting online data to corpus analysis and from defining syntactical rules to string patterns.",

        "There are various methods under the subject of string or structural patterns that represent specific semantic relations.",
        "Barriere(1997) investigates some syntactical rules in her study and matches the dictionary definitions to these rules for figuring out the relations.",
        "Also, in some languages in which prepositions are used frequently, some relations can be extracted depending on the prepositions, like in the study of Celli and Nessim (2009).",

        "It searches the noun pairs through the corpus to extract some row patterns.",
        "The patterns are ranked by a ranking algorithm in order to determine the most qualified patterns for the further steps.",
        "Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) is also concerned in finding patterns to represent relations.",
        "It starts with a few reliable seed of relations and iteratively learns the surface patterns in a given corpus.",

        "• Morphological features of Turkish",
        "• Extracted patterns",
        "• Morphological analysis and disambiguation",
        "• Word sense disambiguation",
        "• Stop word removal",
        "• Results",
        "Using a dictionary can ease the process of extracting semantic relations in a language in many aspects.",
        "First of all, every word occurs in the dictionary at least once, hence the probability of missing a word decreases.",
        "Secondly, it consists of definitions of the words, which are relatively informative.",
        "Lastly, the sentences in a dictionary are generally simple and similar to each other.",
        "Therefore, they generally follow a set of syntactic patterns.",
        "This enables to perform easy detection of relations.",
        "For all the reasons listed above, a dictionary of Turkish Language Association (TLA) is used in this study.",
        "There are 63110 words and 88268 senses in this dictionary.",
        "This concludes that nearly 25000 of the words are ambiguous.",
        "In Table 2, the distributions of these words among the most frequent parts of speech are given.",
        "The first step is investigating the dictionary definitions manually in order to explore some patterns which are likely to keep a particular semantic relation inside.",
        "The patterns should be general enough for obtaining a reasonable recall.",
        "In addition, they should be specific enough not to cause low precision.",
        "After a rough analysis, the dictionary is scanned for some row patterns to evaluate the results in terms of both accuracy and comprehensiveness.",
        "According to the results, either patterns are reorganized or some additional features are determined to be used for increasing the number of matches and decreasing the error rate.",
        "Different kinds of features in the dictionary definitions and the words being explained are used.",
        "Morphological structures, noun clauses, clue words and the order of the words in the sentence are the examples of these features.",
        "Turkish is an agglutinative language which results in a rich but rather complex morphological structure.",
        "Thus, the words do keep a very important part of the sense.",
        "They can be converted from one part of speech into another by adding derivational suffixes.",
        "For example, from the verb gelmek 'to come' the adjective gelen 'the one who comes' can be derived.",
        "This feature of Turkish constructs the most important effect of increasing the number of matches between patterns and definitions.",
        "In addition, indefinite noun phrases are detected with the help of morphological analysis and lots of relations are extracted as a result.",
        "These are only a few examples of where morphology is used when extracting the relations.",
        "Some clue words in the definitions are also searched for.",
        "In dictionaries, some similar words are explained by using the same words and they can represent some specific relations.",
        "To be more concrete, the adjectives that represent the opposite of another adjective can be considered.",
        "These types of words are usually defined by using the words olmayan 'not' and karçiti 'opposite of.",
        "For example, in the definition of the word fantasik 'fantastic' there exists the phrase gerçek olmayan 'not real'.",
        "An antonymy relation can be established between the word fantastic 'fantastic' and gerçek 'real' as a result.",
        "For some other types of relations, different words are detected and handled.",
        "For example, for member-of relation, sinifindan 'from the class of ; for is-a relation, türü 'type of are selected.",

        "Additionally, noun clauses, which are defined in the dictionary, are investigated.",
        "Most of the time a noun phrase represents an 'is-a' relation.",
        "The word balik 'fish' and kiliç baligi 'sword fish' are both in the dictionary and kiliç baligi 'sword fish' is a noun phrase that has balik 'fish' in it.",
        "It is obvious that there is a connection between the words kiliç baligi 'sword fish' and balik 'fish'.",
        "Various patterns are obtained by using at least one of the above features.",
        "The obtained patterns for each type of relation are shown in Table 3.",
        "When analyzing the table, the representatives to be considered are as follows: X and Y are used for representing the words being connected to each other, punc represents one of the specified punctuations like comma or full stop, w* represents zero or more sequential words, w*no_punctrepresents zero or more sequential words without any punctuation inside, wx is a word which keeps a specific part of speech x, depending on the pattern.",
        "The extracted relations for the provided word definitions are not limited with those mentioned in the table.",
        "If possible, two or more relations can be extracted from a single definition.",
        "For instance, besides the 'member-of relation between çakal 'jackal' and etoburlar 'carnivora', a 'kind-of relation is extracted also for çakal 'jackal' with hayvan 'animal', since the definition matches with the fourth pattern of 'kind-of' relation.",
        "Although only the relation between pinhan 'latent' and sakli 'hidden' is given, another synonymy relation is also obtained from this pattern between pinhan 'latent' and gizli 'ulterior'.",

        "The morphological ambiguity is handled with two different methods.",
        "Firstly, as a preprocessing step, some suffixes are determined, which cannot occur in the dictionary, such as time suffixes.",
        "The analyses are pruned from those results that include one or more of these suffixes.",
        "Secondly, according to the pattern requirements, the convenient result is selected as the correct one.",
        "For example, if a word is required to have a particular chain of suffixes, the first result providing this necessity is selected.",
        "If there is no assumption, the first result is selected by default.",
        "The relations are established between the exact senses of the words in order to obtain a reliable network.",
        "Therefore, word sense disambiguation should also be performed.",
        "One of the words is not ambiguous, since one of its particular senses (definition) is already being handled for most of the relations.",
        "On the other hand, for the purpose of determining the correct sense of the remaining word, simplified Lesk algorithm is used(Lesk, 1986).",
        "Simplified Lesk algorithm benefits from the similarity measurements between each sense of the ambiguous word and the concept.",
        "The algorithm is given in Figure 2 and the details are provided in the http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le sk_algorithm.",
        "In order to obtain more accurate results, stemming and stop word removal is applied for both relation extraction and word sense disambiguation.",
        "A connection can be established only if both of the words are not stop words.",
        "Stop words are dictionary specific and obtained by counting the occurrences of word stems in the dictionary.",
        "Not all frequent stems are assumed to be stop words but the useless ones among the all stems whose occurrences are above an upper limit are ignored.",
        "There are 22 stop words specified, including için 'for', baçka 'another' and en 'the most'.",
        "The system was evaluated by manual calculation of the accuracy.",
        "Equal number of samples is chosen randomly from each pattern.",
        "Two types of accuracy were obtained, which are with and without consideration of correct sense assignment.",
        "The obtained results are given in Table 4.",

        "In addition, to remove erroneous sense determination, word sense disambiguation method can be improved.",

        "As an alternative, the words can be first tagged with concrete or abstract labels automatically.",
        "This information can limit the types of connections a word can contribute.",
        "For example, an abstract word cannot connect to another word with a part-whole relation.",
        "For this task, a preprocessing step should be applied to classify the words as concrete or abstract.",
        "In addition, with the purpose of improving the network, some other resources will be benefitted from.",
        "The existing patterns will be applied to Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org/) entries, by selecting only the definitions of the concepts.",
        "An advantage of this process is that it can be re-performed periodically to keep the network up-to-date and dynamic.",
        "Also, the number of relation types will be increased.",
        "Currently, only the nouns, noun phrases consisting from two words, adjectives and verbs are handled.",
        "Also, only the relationships within the same type of words are extracted that is, a noun can be connected only to another noun, not an adjective or a verb.",
        "Finer grained relationships can establish connections among different parts of speech."
