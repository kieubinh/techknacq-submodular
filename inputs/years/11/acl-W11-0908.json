      "text": [
        "In natural language, lexically unexpressed linguistic items are very frequent and indirectly weaken any attempt at computing the meaning of a text or discourse.",
        "However, the need to address semantic interpretation is strongly felt in current advanced NLP tasks, in particular, the issue of transforming a text or discourse into a set of explicitly interconnected predicate-argument/adjunct structures (hence PAS).",
        "The aim of this task would be to unambiguously identify events and participants and their association to spatiotemporal locations.",
        "However, in order to do that, symbolic and statistical approaches should be based on the output representation of a deep parser, which is currently almost never the case.",
        "Current NLP technologies usually address the surface level linguistic information with good approximation in dependency or constituency structures, but miss implicit entities (IEs) altogether.",
        "The difficulties to deal with lexically unexpressed items or implicit entities are related on the one hand to recall problems, i.e. the problem of deciding whether an item is implicit or not, and on the other hand to precision problems, i.e. if an implicit entity is accessible to the reader from the discourse or its context, an appropriate antecedent has to be found.",
        "However, a system able to derive the presence of IEs may be a determining factor in improving performance of QA systems and, in general, in Informations Retrieval and Extraction systems.",
        "The current computational scene has witnessed an increased interest in the creation and use of semantically annotated computational lexica and their associated annotated corpora, like PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and NomBank (Meyers, 2007), where the proposed annotation scheme has been applied in real contexts.",
        "In all these cases, what has been addressed is a basic semantic issue, i.e. labeling PAS associated to semantic predicates like adjectives, verbs and nouns.",
        "However, what these corpora have not made available is information related to IEs.",
        "For example, in the case of eventive deverbal nominals, information about the subject/object of the nominal predicate is often implicit and has to be understood from the previous discourse or text, e.g. \"the development of a prototype [ – implicit subject]\".",
        "As reported by Gerber and Chai (2010), introducing implicit arguments to nominal predicates in NomBank would increase the resource coverage of 65%.",
        "Other IEs can be found in agentless passive constructions ( e.g.\"Our little problem will soon be solved 0 [ – unexpressed Agent or as unexpressed arguments such as addressee with verbs of commitment, for example \"I can promise 0 that one ofyou will be troubled [ – unexpressed Addressee]\" and \"I dare swear 0 that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net [ – unexpressed Addressee]\".",
        "In this paper we discuss the issues related to the identification of implicit entities in text, focussing in particular on omissions of core arguments of predicates.",
        "We investigate the topic from the perspective proposed by (Fillmore, 1986) and base our observations on null instantiated arguments annotated for the SemEval 2010 Task 10, 'Linking Events and Their Participants in Discourse' (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010).",
        "The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we detail the task of identifying null instantiated arguments from a theoretical perspective and describe related work.",
        "In Section 3 we briefly introduce the SemEval task 10 for identifying implicit arguments in text, while in Section 4 we detail our proposal for NI identification and binding.",
        "In Section 5 we give a thorough description of the types of null instantiations annotated in the SemEval data set and we explain the behavior of our algorithm w.r.t.",
        "such cases.",
        "We also compare our results with the output of the systems participating to the SemEval task.",

        "unrealized arguments.",
        "We focus on Fillmore's theory because his approach represents the backbone of the FrameNet project, which in turn inspired the Se-mEval task we will describe below.",
        "Fillmore (1986) shows that in English and many other languages some verbs allow null complements and some others don't.",
        "The latter require that, when they appear in a sentence, all core semantic roles related to the predicate are expressed.",
        "For example, sentences like \"Mary locked **\" or \"John guaranteed **\" are not grammatically well-formed, because they both require two mandatory linguistically inherent participants.",
        "Fillmore tries to explain why semantic roles can sometimes be left unspoken and what constraints help the interpreter recover the missing roles.",
        "He introduces different factors that can influence the licensing of null complements.",
        "These can be lexically-based, (semantically close predicates like 'promise' and 'guarantee' can license the omission of the theme argument in different cases), motivated by the interpretation ofthe predicate (\"I was eating 0\" licenses a null object because it has an existential interpretation) and depending on the context (see for example the use of impress in an episodic context like \"She impressed the audience\", where the null complement is not allowed, compared to \"She impresses 0 every time\" in habitual interpretation; examples from Ruppenhofer and Michaelis ( 009)).",
        "The fact that Fillmore explains the phenomenon of omissible arguments with a lexically-based approach implies that from his perspective neither a purely pragmatic nor a purely semantic approach can account for the behavior of omissible arguments.",
        "For example, he argues that some verbs, such as to lock will never license a null complement, no matter in which pragmatic context they are used.",
        "Besides, there are synonymous verbs which behave differently as regards null complementation, which Fillmore sees as evidence against a purely semantic explanation of implicit arguments.",
        "Another relevant distinction drawn in Fillmore (1986) is the typology of omitted arguments, which depends on the type of licensor and on the interpretation of the null complement.",
        "Fillmore claims that with some verbs the missing complement can be retrieved from the context, i.e. it is possible to find a referent previously mentioned in the text / discourse and bearing a definite, precise meaning.",
        "These cases are labeled as definite null complements or instantiations (DNI) and are lexically specific in that they apply only to some predicates.",
        "We report an example of DNI in (1), taken from the SemEval task 10 data set (see Section 3).",
        "The predicate 'waiting' has an omitted object, which we understand from the discourse context to refer to ' I '.",
        "(1) I saw him rejoin his guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting 0 to tell them what I had seen.",
        "DNIs can also occur with nominal predicates, as reported in ( ), where the person having a thought, the baronet, is mentioned in the preceding sentence:",
        "( ) Stapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and distrait.",
        "Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.",
        "In contrast to DNIs, Fillmore claims that with some verbs and in some interpretations, a core argument can be omitted without having a referent expressing the meaning of the null argument.",
        "The identity of the missing argument can be left unknown or indefinite.",
        "These cases are labeled as indefinite null complements or instantiations (INI) and are constructionally licensed in that they apply to any predicate in a particular grammatical construction.",
        "See for example the following cases, where the omission of the agent is licensed by the passive construction:",
        "(3) One of them was suddenly shut off 0.",
        "(4) I am reckoned fleet of foot 0.",
        "Cases of INI were annotated by the organizers of the SemEval task 10 also with nominal predicates, as shown in the example below, where the perceiver of the odour is left unspecified:",
        "(5) Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour 0 of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour.",
        "Few attempts have been done so far to automatically deal with the recovery of implicit information in text.",
        "One of the earliest systems for identifying extra-sentential arguments is PUNDIT by Palmer et al.",
        "(1986).",
        "This Prolog-based system comprises a syntactic component for parsing, a semantic component, which decomposes predicates into component meanings and fills their semantic roles with syntactic constituents based on a domain-specific model, and a reference resolution component, which is called both for explicit constituents and for obligatory implicit constituents.",
        "The reference resolution process is based on a focus list with all potential pronominal referents identified by the semantic component.",
        "The approach, however, has not been evaluated on a data set, so we cannot directly compare its performance with other approaches.",
        "Furthermore, it is strongly domain-dependent.",
        "In a case study, Burchardt et al.",
        "( 005) propose to identify implicit arguments exploiting contextual relations from deep-parsing and lexico-semantic frame relations encoded in FrameNet.",
        "In particular, they suggest converting a text into a network of lexico-semantic predicate-argument relations connected through frame-to-frame relations and recurrent anaphoric linking patterns.",
        "However, the authors do not implement and evaluate this approach.",
        "Most recently, Gerber and Chai ( 010) have presented a supervised classification model for the recovery of implicit arguments of nominal predicates in NomBank.",
        "The model features are quite different from those usually considered in standard SRL tasks and include among others information from VerbNet classes, pointwise mutual information between semantic arguments, collocation and frequency information about the predicates, information about parent nodes and siblings of the predicates and discourse information.",
        "The authors show the feasibility of their approach, which however relies on a selected group of nominal predicates with a large number of annotated instances.",
        "The first attempt to evaluate implicit argument identification over a common test set and considering different kinds of predicates was made by Rup-penhofer et al.",
        "( 010).",
        "Further details are given in the following section.",
        "The SemEval-2010 task for linking events and their participants in discourse (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) introduced a new issue w.r.t.",
        "the SemEval-2007 task 'Frame Semantic Structure Extraction' (Baker et al., 2007), in that it focused on linking local semantic argument structures across sentence boundaries.",
        "Specifically, the task included first the identification of frames and frame elements in a text following the FrameNet paradigm (Baker et al., 1998), then the identification of locally uninstantiated roles (NIs).",
        "If these roles are indefinite (INI), they have to be marked as such and no antecedent has to be found.",
        "On the contrary, if they are definite (DNI), their coreferents have to be found in the wider discourse context.",
        "The challenge comprised two tasks, namely the full task (semantic role recognition and labeling + NI linking) and the NIs only task, i.e. the identification of null instantiations and their referents given a test set with gold standard local semantic argument structure.",
        "In this work, we focus on the latter task.",
        "The data provided to the participants included a training and a test set.",
        "The training data comprised 438 sentences from Arthur Conan Doyle's novel 'The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge', manually annotated with frame and INI/DNI information.",
        "The test set included 2 chapters of the Sherlock Holmes story 'The Hound of Baskervilles' with a total of 525 sentences, provided with gold standard frame information.",
        "The participants had to i) assess if a local argument is implicit; ii) decide whether it is an INI or a DNI and iii) in the second case, find the antecedent of the implicit argument.",
        "We report in Table 1 some statistics about the provided data sets from Ruppenhofer et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Note that overt FEs are the explicit frame elements annotated in the data set.",
        "Although 26 teams downloaded the data sets, there were only two submissions, probably depending on the intrinsic difficulties of the task (see discussion in Section 5).",
        "The best performing system (Chen et al., 2010) is based on a supervised learning approach using, among others, distributional semantic similarity between the heads of candidate referents and role fillers in the training data, but its performance is strongly affected by data sparseness.",
        "Indeed, only 438 sentences with annotated NIs were made available in the training set, which is clearly insufficient to capture such a multifaceted phenomenon with a supervised approach.",
        "The second system participating in the task (Tonelli and Delmonte, 2010) was an adaptation of an existing LFG-based system for deep semantic analysis (Delmonte, 2009), whose output was mapped to FrameNet-style annotation.",
        "In this case, the major challenge was to cope with the classification of some NI phenomena which are very much dependent on frame specific information, and can hardly be generalized in the LFG framework.",
        "4 A linguistically motivated proposal for NI identification and binding",
        "In this section, we describe our proposal for dealing with INI/DNI identification and evaluate our output against SemEval gold standard data.",
        "As discussed in the previous section, existing systems dealing with this task suffer on the one hand from a lack of training data and on the other hand from the dependence of the task on frame annotation, which makes it difficult to adapt existing unsupervised approaches.",
        "We show that, given this state of the art, better results can be achieved in the task by simply developing an algorithm that reflects as much as possible the linguistic motivations behind NI identification in the FrameNet paradigm.",

        "Since the coreness status of the arguments is encoded in FrameNet, we limit our search for an NI only if a core frame element is not overtly expressed in the text.",
        "Incorporated FEs Although all lexical units belonging to the same frame in the FrameNet database are characterized by the same set of core FEs, a further distinction should be introduced when dealing with NIs identification.",

        "For other verbs in the same frame, such as 'glance.v' or 'listen.v', the coreness status of Body .part seems to be more questionable, because the perceiving organ is already implied by the verb meaning.",
        "For this reason, we argue that if Body-part is not expressed with 'glance.v' or 'listen.v', it is not a case of null instantiation.",
        "Such FEs are defined as incorporated in the lexical unit and are encoded as such in FrameNet.",
        "Excludes and Includes relation In FrameNet, some information about the relationship between certain FEs is encoded.",

        "An example of Excludes is the relationship between the FE Entity J / Entity J2 and Entities, because if Entity J and Entity J2 are both present in a sentence, then Entities cannot be co-present.",
        "Conversely, Entity J and Entity J2 stand in a Requires relationship, because the first cannot occur without the second.",

        "INI/DNI preference Ruppenhofer and Michaelis (2009) suggest that omissible arguments in particular frames tend to be always interpreted as definite or indefinite.",
        "For example, they report that in a sample from the British National Corpus, the interpretation for a null instantiated Goal argument is definite in 97.5% of the observed cases.",
        "We take this feature into account by considering the frequency of an implicit argument being annotated as definite/indefinite in the training set.",
        "The algorithm incorporating all this linguistic information is detailed in the following subsection.",
        "In a preliminary step, we collect for each frame the list of arguments being annotated as DNI/INI with the corresponding frequency in the training set.",
        "For example, in the Calendricjjnit frame, the Whole argument has been annotated 11 times as INI and 5 times as DNI.",
        "Some implicit frame elements occur only as INI or DNI, for example Goal, which is annotated 14 times as DNI and never as INI in the Arriving frame.",
        "This frequency list (FreqList) is collected in order to decide if candidate null instantiations have to be classified as DNI or INI.",
        "We consider each sentence in the test data provided with FrameNet annotation, and for each predicate p annotated with a set of overt frame elements FEs, we run the first module for DNI/INI identification.",
        "The steps followed are reported in Algorithm 1.",
        "We first check if the annotated FEs contain all core frame elements C listed in FrameNet for p. If the two sets are identical, we conclude that no core frame element can be implicit and we return an empty set both for DNI and INI.",
        "For example, in the test sentence (6), the Body .movement frame appears in the sentence with its two core frame elements, i.e. Bodyjpart and Agent.",
        "Therefore, no implicit argument can be postulated.",
        "(6) Finally [she]Agent opened Body-Movement [her eyes]fiody_part again.",
        "If the core FEs in C are not all overtly expressed in FEs, we run two routines to check if the missing FEs CandNIs are likely to be null instantiated elements.",
        "First, we discard all candidate NIs that appear as incorporated FEs for the given p. Second, we discard as well candidate NIs if they are excluded by the overtly annotated FEs.",
        "The last steps of the algorithm are devoted to deciding if the candidate null instantiation is definite or indefinite.",

        "In this paper, we have described the phenomenon of null instantiated arguments according to the FrameNet paradigm and we have proposed a strategy for identifying implicit arguments and finding their antecedents, if any, using a linguistically-motivated approach.",
        "We have evaluated our system using the test set developed for the SemEval task 10 and we have discussed some problems in our approach affecting its performance.",
        "Besides, we have also pointed out some issues related to the task definition and to the general phenomenon of null instantiated arguments that make the identification task challenging from a computational point of view.",
        "We have shed some light on the syntactic, semantic and discourse information that we believe are necessary to successfully handle the task.",
        "In the future, we plan to improve on our binding approach by making our model more flexible.",
        "More specifically, we currently treat DNI referents occurring before and after the sentence containing the predicate as equally probable.",
        "Instead, we should penalize less those preceding the predicate because they are more frequent in the training set.",
        "For this reason, the number of observations for the candidate head and the distance should be represented as different weighted features.",
        "Another direction to explore is to extend the training set to the whole FrameNet resource and not just to the SemEval data set.",
        "However, our approach based on the observations of lexical fillers is very much domain-dependent, and a larger training set may introduce too much variability in the heads.",
        "An approach exploiting some kind of generalization, for example by linking the fillers to WordNet synsets as proposed by (Gerber and Chai, 2010), may be more appropriate."
