        "Figure 1: A pair of sentences that require long distance reordering (dashed line) and discontinuous translation (thick line) (DG).",
        "Although the state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) paradigm is phrase-based SMT (PBSMT), many researchers have attempted to utilize syntax in SMT to overcome the weaknesses of PBSMT.",
        "An emerging paradigm alternative to PBSMT is syntax-based SMT, which embeds the source and/or target syntax in its translation model (TM).",
        "Utilizing syntax in TM has two advantages over PBSMT.",
        "The first advantage is that syntax eases global reordering between the source and the target language.",
        "Figure 1 shows that we need global reordering in a complex real situation, where a verbal phrase requires a long distance movement.",
        "PBSMT often fails to handle global reordering, for example, from subject-verb-object (SVO) to SOV transformation where V should be moved far away from the original position in",

        "C denotes consistent, O overlapped, D discontinuous, and N null.",
        "the source language.",
        "This is because of the two distance-based constraints in PBSMT: the distortion model cost and the distortion size limit.",
        "For the distortion model cost, PBSMT sets zero cost to the monotone translation and penalizes the distorted translations as the distortion grows larger.",
        "For the distortion size limit, a phrase can only be moved from its original position within a limit.",
        "Therefore, PBSMT fails to handle long distance reordering.",
        "Syntax-based SMT manages global reordering as structural transformation.",
        "Because reordering occurs at the substructure level such as constituents or treelets in syntax-based SMT, the transformation ofthe substructure eventually yields the reordering of the whole sentence.",
        "The second advantage of using syntax in TM is that syntax guides us to discontinuous translation patterns.",
        "Because PBSMT regards only a continuous sequence of words as a translation pattern, it often fails to utilize many useful discontinuous translation patterns.",
        "For example, two discontinuous source words correspond to a target word in Figure 1.",
        "In our inspection of the training corpus, a continuous word sequence often corresponds to a set of discontinuous words in the target language, or vice versa (Table 1).",
        "Discontinuous translation patterns frequently appear in many languages (Sogaard and Kuhn, 2009).",

        "Figure 2: The maximum branching factor (BF) and depth factor (DF) in a dependency tree in our corpus archical structure.",
        "For example, the two discontinuous source words have a head-dependent relation (Figure 3).",
        "Especially with the dependency tree, we can easily identify patterns that have non-projectivity (Na et al., 2010).",
        "However, syntax-based patterns such as constituents or treelets do not sufficiently cover various useful patterns, even if we have the correct syntactic analysis (Chiang, 2010).",
        "For this reason, many researchers have proposed supplementary patterns such as an intra/inter constituent or sequence of treelets (Galley et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008).",
        "Unlike PSG, DG does not include nonterminal symbols, which represent constituent information.",
        "This makes DG simpler than PSG.",
        "For instance, it directly associates syntatic role with the structure, but introduces a difficulty in syntax-based SMT.",
        "The branching factor of a dependency tree becomes larger when a head word dominates many dependents.",
        "We observe that the maximum branching factor of an automatically parsed dependency tree ranges widely, while most trees have depth under a certain degree (Figure 2).",
        "This indicates that we have a horizontally flat dependency tree structure.",
        "The translation patterns extracted from the flat dependency tree are also likely to be flat.",
        "Unfortunately, the flat patterns are less applicable at the decoding stage.",
        "When one of the modifiers does not match, for instance, we fail to apply the translation pattern.",
        "Therefore, we need a more generally applicable representation for syntax-based SMT using DG.",
        "We propose a novel representation ofDG that regards a set of words as a unit of the dependency relations, similar to (Ding, 2006; Wu et al., 2009; Na et al., 2010).",
        "Unlike their work, we consider many alternatives without predefined units, and construct a packed forest of the multi-word units (MWUs) from a dependency tree.",
        "For brevity, we denote the forest based on MWUs as an MWU-forest.",
        "Because all possible alternatives are exponentially many, we give an efficient algorithm that enumerates the k-best alternatives in section 3.",
        "As an application, we extract translation patterns in form of a source MWU-forest to the target string in order to broaden the coverage of the extracted patterns for syntax-based SMT in section 4.",
        "We also report empirical results related to the usefulness of the extracted pattern in section 5.",
        "The experimental results show that the MWU-forest representation gives more applicable translation patterns than the original word-based tree."
