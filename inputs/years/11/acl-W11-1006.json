        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the NLP task that consists in assigning a correct sense to an ambiguous word in a given context.",
        "Traditionally, WSD relies on a predefined monolingual sense-inventory such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and WSD modules are trained on corpora, which are manually tagged with senses from these inventories.",
        "A number of issues arise with these monolingual supervised approaches to WSD.",
        "First of all, there is a lack of large sense-inventories and sense-tagged corpora for languages other than English.",
        "Furthermore, sense inventories such as WordNet contain very finegrained sense distinctions that make the sense disambiguation task very challenging (even for human annotators), whereas very detailed sense distinctions are often irrelevant for practical applications.",
        "In addition to this, there is a growing feeling in the community that WSD should be used and evaluated in real application such as Machine Translation (MT) or Information Retrieval (IR) (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006).",
        "An important line of research consists in the development of dedicated WSD modules for MT.",
        "Instead of assigning a sense label from a monolingual sense-inventory to the ambiguous words, the WSD system has to predict a correct translation for the ambiguous word in a given context.",
        "In (Vick-rey et al., 2005), the problem was defined as a word translation task.",
        "The translation choices of ambiguous words are gathered from a parallel corpus by means of word alignment.",
        "The authors reported improvements on two simplified translation tasks: word translation and blank filling.",
        "The evaluation was done on an English-French parallel corpus but is confronted with the important limitation of having only one valid translation (the aligned translation in the parallel corpus) as a gold standard translation.",
        "Cabezas and Resnik (2005) tried to improve an SMT system by adding additional translations to the phrase table, but were confronted with tuning problems of this dedicated WSD feature.",
        "Specia (2006) used an inductive logic programming-based WSD system which was tested on seven ambiguous verbs in English-Portuguese translation.",
        "The latter systems already present promising results for the use of WSD in MT, but really significant improvements in terms of general machine translation quality were for the first time obtained by Carpuat and Wu (2007) and Chan et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Both papers describe the integration of a dedicated WSD module in a Chinese-English statistical machine translation framework and report statistically significant improvements in terms of standard MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Stroppa et al.",
        "(2007) take a completely different approach to perform some sort of implicit Word Sense Disambiguation in MT.",
        "They introduce context-information features that exploit source similarity, in addition to target similarity that is modeled by the language model, in an SMT framework.",
        "For the estimation of these features that are very similar to the typical WSD local context features (left and right context words, Part-of-Speech of the focus phrase and context words), they use a memory-based classification framework.",
        "The work we present in this paper is different from previous research in two aspects.",
        "Firstly, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art SMT systems and a dedicated WSD system on the translation of ambiguous words.",
        "The comparison is done against a manually constructed gold-standard for two language pairs, viz. English-French and English-Dutch.",
        "Although it is crucial to measure the general translation quality after integrating a dedicated WSD module in the SMT system, we think it is equally interesting to conduct a dedicated evaluation of the translation quality on ambiguous nouns.",
        "Standard SMT evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Pap-ineni et al., 2002) or edit-distance metrics (e.g. Word Error Rate) measure the global overlap of the translation with a reference, and are thus not very sensitive to WSD errors.",
        "The mistranslation of an ambiguous word might be a subtle change compared to the reference sentence, but it often drastically affects the global understanding of the sentence.",
        "Secondly, we explore the potential benefits of a real multilingual approach to WSD.",
        "The idea to use translations from parallel corpora to distinguish between word senses is based on the hypothesis that different meanings of a polysemous word are often lexicalized across languages (Resnik and Yarowsky, 2000).",
        "Many WSD studies have incorporated this cross-lingual evidence idea and have successfully applied bilingual WSD classifiers (Gale and Church, 1993; Ng et al., 2003; Diab and Resnik, 2002) or systems that use a combination of existing WordNets with multilingual evidence (Tufis, et al., 2004).",
        "Our WSD system is different in the sense that it is independent from a predefined sense-inventory (it only uses the parallel corpus at hand) and that it is truly multilingual as it incorporates information from four other languages (French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and German depending on the target language of the classifier).",
        "Although our classifiers are still very preliminary in terms of the feature set and parameters that are used, we obtain interesting results on our test sample of ambiguous nouns.",
        "We therefore believe our system can have a real added value for SMT, as it can easily be trained for different language pairs on exactly the same corpus which is used to train the SMT system, which should make the integration a lot easier.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the two machine translation systems we evaluated, while section 3 describes the feature construction and learning algorithm of our multilingual WSD system.",
        "Section 4 gives an overview of the experimental setup and results.",
        "We finally draw conclusions and present some future research in Section 5."

        "For our experiments, we analyzed the behavior of two phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems on the translation of ambiguous nouns.",
        "SMT generates translations on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of sentence-aligned parallel text corpora.",
        "Phrase-based SMT is considered as the dominant paradigm in MT research today.",
        "It combines a phrase translation model (which is based on the noisy channel model) and a phrase-based decoder in order to find the most probable translation e of a foreign sentence f (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Usually the Bayes rule is used to reformulate this translation probability:",
        "This allows for a language model p(e) that guarantees the fluency and grammatical correctness of the translation, and a separate translation model p(f \\e) that focusses on the quality of the translation.",
        "Training of both the language model (on monolingual data) as well as the translation model (on bilingual text corpora) requires large amounts of text data.",
        "Research has pointed out that adding more training data, both for the translation as for the language models, results in better translation quality, (Callison-Burch et al., 2009).",
        "Therefore it is important to notice that our comparison of the two SMT systems is somewhat unfair, as we compared the Moses research system (that was trained on the Eu-roparl corpus) with the Google commercial system that is trained on a much larger data set.",
        "It remains an interesting exercise though, as we consider the commercial system as the upper bound of how far current SMT can get in case it has unlimited access to text corpora and computational resources.",
        "The first statistical machine translation system we used is the off-the-shelf Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "As the Moses system is open-source, well documented, supported by a very lively users forum and reaches state-of-the-art performance, it has quickly been adopted by the community and highly stimulated development in the SMT field.",
        "It also features factored translation models, which enable the integration of linguistic and other information at the word level.",
        "This makes Moses a good candidate to experiment with for example a dedicated WSD module, that requires more enhanced linguistic information (such as lemmas and Part-of-Speech tags).",
        "We trained Moses for English-French and English-Dutch on a large subsection of the Europarl corpus (See Section 3 for more information on the corpus), and performed some standard cleaning.",
        "Table 1 lists the number of aligned sentences after cleaning the bilingual corpus, and the number of uni-, bi-and tri-grams that are comprised by the language model.",
        "In order to gain insights in the upper bounds for current SMT, we also analyzed the output of the Google Translate API for our set of ambiguous nouns.",
        "Google Translate currently supports 57 languages.",
        "As both the amount of parallel and monolingual training data as well as the computer power are crucial for statistical MT, Google (that disposes of large computing clusters and a network of data centers for Web search) has very valuable assets at its disposal for this task.",
        "We can only speculate about the amount of resources that Google uses to train its translation engine.",
        "Part of the training data comes from transcripts of United Nations meetings (in six official languages) and those of the European Parliament (Europarl corpus).",

        "We extract the same set of local context features from both the English training and test instances.",
        "All English sentences were preprocessed by means of a memory-based shallow parser (MBSP) (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005) that performs tokeniza-tion, Part-of-Speech tagging and text chunking.",

        "• local context features related to a window of three words preceding and following the focus word containing for each of these words their full form, lemma, Part-of-Speech and chunk information",
        "These local context features are to be considered as a basic feature set.",
        "The Senseval evaluation exercises have shown that feeding additional information sources to the classifier results in better system performance (Agirre and Martinez, 2004).",

        "lemma information on the surrounding content words and semantic analysis (e.g. Singular Value Decomposition (Gliozzo et al., 2005)) in order to detect latent correlations between terms.",
        "In addition to the commonly deployed local context features, we also extracted a set of binary bag-of-words features from the aligned translations that are not the target language of the classifier (e.g. for the French classifier, we extract bag-of-words features from the Italian, Spanish, Dutch and German aligned translations).",
        "We preprocessed all aligned translations by means of the Treetagger tool (Schmid, 1994) that outputs Part-of-Speech and lemma information.",
        "Per ambiguous focus word, a list of all content words (nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs) that occurred in the aligned translations of the English sentences containing this word, was extracted.",
        "This resulted in one binary feature per selected content word per language.",
        "For the construction of the translation features for the training set, we used the Europarl aligned translations.",
        "As we do not dispose of similar aligned translations for our test instances (where we only have the English test sentences at our disposal), we had to adopt a different strategy.",
        "We decided to use the Google Translate API to automatically generate translations for all English test instances in the five target languages.",

        "The test instances were selected from the JRC-ACQUIS Multilingual Parallel Corpus and BNC.",
        "There were in total 50 test instances for each of the twenty ambiguous words in the sample.",
        "To label the test data, native speakers assigned three valid translations from the predefined clusters of Europarl translations to each test instance.",
        "A more detailed description of the construction of the data set can be found in (Lefever and Hoste, 2010a).",
        "As evaluation metric, we used a straightforward accuracy measure that divides the number of correct answers by the total amount of test instances.",
        "As a baseline, we selected the most frequent lemmatized translation that resulted from the automated word alignment (GIZA++).",

        "The output of the two statistical machine translation systems, however, is a translation of the full English input sentence.",
        "Therefore we manually selected the translation of the ambiguous focus word from the full translation, and made sure the translation was put in its base form (masculine singular form for nouns and adjectives, infinitive form for verbs).",
        "Table 2 lists the accuracy figures for the baseline, two flavors of the ParaSense system (with and without correction of the word alignment output), Moses and Google for English-French and English-Dutch.",
        "A first conclusion is that all systems beat the most frequent sense baseline.",
        "As expected, the Google system (where there was no limitation on the training data) achieves the best results, but for French the considerable difference in training size only leads to modest performance gains compared to the ParaSense System.",
        "Another interesting observation is that the ParaSense system that uses manually verified translation labels hardly beats the system that uses automatically generated class labels.",
        "This is promising as it makes the manual interventions on the data superfluous and leads to a fully automatic system development process.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the accuracy figures for French for all three systems (for the ParaSense system we used the flavor that incorporates the non-validated translation labels) on all individual test words.",
        "The three curves follow a similar pattern, except for some words where Moses (mood, scene, side) or both Moses and ParaSense (figure) perform worse.",
        "As the curves show, some words (e.g. coach, figure, match, range) are particularly hard to disambiguate, while others obtain very high scores (e.g. letter, mission, soil).",
        "The almost perfect scores for the latter can be explained by the fact that these words all have a very generic translation in French (respectively lettre, mission, sol) that can be used for all senses of the word, although there might be more suited translations for each of the senses depending on the context.",
        "As the manual annotators could pick three good translations for each test instance, the most generic translation often figures between the gold standard translations.",
        "The low scores for some other words can often be explained through the relationship with the number of training instances (corresponding to the frequency of the word in the training corpus) and the ambiguity (number of translations) per word.",

        "Our WSD system incorporates both monolingual local context features and bag-of-words features that are built from aligned translations in four additional languages.",
        "The best results are obtained by Google, the SMT system that",
        "Table 4: Accuracy figures for French and Dutch for a varying number of translation features including the other four languages viz. Italian (It), Spanish (Es), German",
        "is built with no constraints on data size or computational resources.",
        "Although there is still a lot of room for improvement on the feature base and optimization of the WSD classifiers, our results show that the ParaSense system outperforms Moses that is built with the same training corpus.",
        "We also noticed large differences among the test words, often related to the number of training instances and the number of translations the classifier (or decoder) has to choose from.",
        "Additional experiments with the ParaSense system incorporating a number of varying translations features allow us to confirm the validity of our hypothesis.",
        "The classifiers that use the multilingual bag-of-words features clearly outperform the classifier that only uses local context features.",
        "In future work, we want to expand our feature set and apply a genetic algorithm to perform joint feature selection, parameter optimization and instance selection.",
        "In addition, we will apply semantic analysis tools (such as SVD or LSA) on our multilingual bag-of-words sets in order to detect latent semantic topics in the multilingual feature base.",
        "Finally, we want to evaluate to which extent the integration of our WSD output helps the decoder to pick the correct translation in a real SMT framework.",
