        "Hierarchical Phrase-based Machine Translation, proposed by Chiang (Chiang, 2007), uses a general non-terminal label X but does not use linguistic information from the source or the target language.",
        "There have been efforts to include linguistic information into machine translation.",
        "Liu et al. (2006) experimented with tree-to-string translation models that utilize source side parse trees, and later improved the method by using the Packed Forest data structure to reduce the impact of parsing errors (Liu and Huang, 2010).",
        "The string-to-tree (Galley et al., 2006) and tree-to-tree (Chiang, 2010) methods have also been the subject of experimentation, as well as other formalisms such as Dependency Trees (Shen et al., 2008).",
        "One problem that arises by using full syntactic labels is that they require an exact match of the constituents in extracted phrases, so it faces the risk of losing coverage of the rules.",
        "SAMT (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) and Tree Sequence Alignment (Zhang et al., 2008) are proposed to amend this problem by allowing non-constituent phrases to be extracted.",
        "The reported results show that while utilizing linguistic information helps, the coverage is more important (Chiang, 2010).",
        "When dealing with formalisms such as semantic role labeling, the coverage problem is also critical.",
        "In this paper we follow Chiang's observation and use SRL labels to augment the extraction of SCFG rules.",
        "I.e., the formalism provides additional information and more rules instead of restrictions that remove existing rules.",
        "This preserves the coverage of rules.",
        "Recently there has been increased attention to use semantic information in machine translation.",
        "Liu and Gildea (2008; 2010) proposed using Semantic Role Labels (SRL) in their tree-to-string machine translation system and demonstrated improvement over conventional tree-to-string methods.",

        "The second will extract phrases that contain information of SRL structures.",
        "The predicate and arguments that the phrase covers will be represented in the LHS non-terminal tags.",
        "After that, we obtain rules from the initial phrases in the same way as the Hiero extraction algorithm, which replaces nesting phrases with their corresponding non-terminals.",
        "By applying this scheme, we will obtain rules that contain SRL information, without sacrificing the coverage of rules.",
        "In this paper, we call such rules SRL-aware SCFG rules.",

        "Proposed by Chiang (2005), the Hierarchical Phrase-based Machine Translation model (commonly known as the Hiero model) has achieved results comparable, if not superior, to conventional Phrase-based approaches.",
        "The basic idea is to treat the translation as a synchronous parsing problem.",
        "Using the source side terminals as input, the decoder tries to build a parse tree and synchronously generate target side terminals.",
        "The rules that generates such synchronous parse trees are in the following form:",
        "where X1 and X2 are non-terminals, and the subscripts represents the correspondence between the non-terminals.",
        "In Chiang's Hiero model all nonterminals will have the same tag, i.e. X.",
        "The formalism, known as Synchronous Context-Free Grammar (SCFG) does not require the non-terminals to have a unique tag name.",
        "Instead, they may have tags with syntactic or semantic meanings, such as NP or VP.",
        "The task of semantic role labeling is to label the semantic relationships between predicates and arguments.",
        "This relationship can be treated as a dependency structure called \"Predicate-Argument Structure\" (PA structure for short).",
        "Figure 1 depicts examples of multiple PA structures in a sentence.",
        "The lines indicate the span of the predicates and arguments of each PA structure, and the tags attached to these lines show their role labels.",
        "Despite the similarity between PA structure and dependency trees, SRL offers a structure that posses better granularity.",
        "Instead of trying to analyze all links between words in the sentences, PA structure only deals with the relationships between verbs and constituents that are arguments of the predicates.",
        "This information is useful in preserving the meaning of the sentence during the translation process.",
        "However, using semantic role representation in machine translation has its own set of problems.",
        "First, we face the coverage problem.",
        "Some sentences might not have semantic structure at all, if, for instance they consist of single noun phrases or contain only rare predicates that are not covered by the semantic role labeler.",
        "Moreover, the PA structures are not guaranteed to cover the whole sentence.",
        "This is especially true when two or more predicates are presented in a coordinated structure.",
        "In this case, the arguments of other predicates will not be covered in the PA structure of the predicate.",
        "The second problem is that the SRL labels are only on the constituents of predicate and arguments.",
        "There is no analysis conducted inside the augments.",
        "That is different from syntactic parsing or dependency parsing, which both provide a complete tree from the sentence to every individual word.",
        "As we can see in Figure 1, words such as \"Second\" and \"and\" are not covered.",
        "Inside the NPs such as \"a flood prevention system\", SRL will not provide more information.",
        "Therefore it is hard to build a self-contained formalization based only on SRL labels.",
        "Most work on SRL labels is built upon or assisted by other formalisms.",
        "For instance, Liu and Gildea (2010) integrated SRL label into a tree-to-string translation system.",
        "Wu and Fung (2009) used SRL labels for reordering the n-best output of phrase-based translation systems.",
        "Similarly, in our work we also adopt the methodology of using SRL information to assist existing formalism.",
        "The difference of our method from Wu and Fung is that we embed the SRL information directly into the decode, instead of doing two-pass decoding.",
        "Also, our method is different from Liu and Gildea (2010) that we utilize target side SRL information instead of the source side.",
        "As we will see in section 3, we define a mapping function from the SRL structures that a phrase covers to a non-terminal tag before extracting the SCFG rules.",
        "The tags will restrict the derivation of the target side parse tree to accept only SRL structures we have seen in the training corpus.",
        "The mapping from SRL structures to non-terminal tags can be defined according to the SRL annotation set.",
        "In this paper we adopt the PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) annotation set of semantic labels, because the annotation set is relatively simple and easy to parse.",
        "The small set of argument tags also makes the number of LHS non-terminal tags small, which alleviates the problem of data scarcity.",
        "However the methodology of this paper is not limited to Prop-Bank tags.",
        "By defining appropriate mapping, it is also possible to use other annotation sets, such as",

        "Together with the glue rules that commonly used in Hiero decoder, i.e. S – (S Xi, S Xi) and S – (Xi, Xi), the conversion rules ensures that whenever SRL-aware SCFG rules are used in parsing, the output parse tree contains only complete SRL structures.",
