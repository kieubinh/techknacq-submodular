        "Researchers have used supervised and semi-supervised approaches (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Mintz et al., 2009; Jiang, 2009), and explored rich features (Kambhatla, 2004), kernel design (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Qian et al., 2008) and inference algorithms (Chan and Roth, 2011), to detect predefined relations between NEs.",
        "In this work, we explore if and how the latent semantics of the text can help in detecting entity relations.",
        "For this, we adapt the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach to solve the ERD task.",
        "Specifically, we present a ERD system based on Maximum Entropy Discriminant Latent Dirichlet Allocation (MEDLDA).",
        "MEDLDA (Zhu et al., 2009), is an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) that combines capability of capturing latent semantics with the discriminative capabilities of SVM.",

        "However, they have trouble discovering marginal classes and easily employing rich feature sets, both of which are important for ERD.",
        "We overcome the first drawback by employing a MEDLDA framework, which integrates maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and maximum margin estimation (MME).",
        "Specifically, it is a combination of sLDA and support vector machines (SVMs).",
        "Further, in order to employ rich and heterogeneous features we introduce a separate exponential family distribution for each feature, similar to (Shan et al., 2009), into our MEDLDA model.",
        "We formulate the relation detection task within the topic model framework as follows.",
        "Pairs of NE mentions and the text between them is considered as mini-document.",
        "Each mini-document has a relation type (analogous to the response variable in the supervised topic model).",

        "The supervised topic model discovers a latent topic representation of the mini-documents and a response parameter distribution.",
        "The topic representation is discovered with observed response variables during training.",
        "During testing, the topic distribution of each mini-document can form a prediction of the relation types.",

        "MEDLDA is an extension of LDA proposed by Zhu, Ahmed and Xing (2009).",
        "LDA is itself unsupervised and the results are often hard to interpret.",
        "However, with the addition of supervised information (such as response variables), the resulting topic models have much better predictive power for classification and regression.",
        "In our work, we use relation annotations from the ACE (ACE, 2000 2005) corpus to provide the supervision.",
        "NE pairs within a sentence, and the text between them are considered as a mini-document.",
        "Each mini-document is assumed to be composed of a set of topics.",
        "The topic model trained with these mini-documents given their relation type label can generate topics biased toward relation types.",
        "Thus, the trained topic model will have good predictive power on relation types.",
        "We first describe the MEDLDA model from (Zhu et al., 2009) and then describe how we adapt it for relation detection using mixed membership extensions.",
        "The MEDLDA model described in (Zhu et al., 2009) is illustrated in Figure 1.",

        "Like common LDAs, MEDLDA uses independence assumption for a finite set of random variables z1,zn which are independent and identically distributed, conditioned on the parameter 0.",
        "Like sLDA, MEDLDA is a supervised model.",
        "A response variable Y connected to each document is added for incorporating supervised side information.",

        "The joint learning is done in two stages, unsupervised topic discovery and multi-class classification (we refer the reader to (Zhu et al., 2009) for details).",
        "During training, EM algorithms are utilized to infer the posterior distribution of the hidden variables d, z and r\\.",
        "In testing, the trained models are used to predict relation types y.",
        "Although the MEDLDA model described above can be applied to the relation detection and classification task, a few modifications are necessary before it can be effective in predicting relation types.",

        "This is because LDA is designed to handle data points with homogeneous features such as words.",
        "But for relation detection, like many other NLP tasks, it is important to have the flexibility of incorporating part-of-speech tags, named entities, grammatical dependencies and other linguistic features.",
        "We overcome this limitation by introducing a separate exponential family distribution for each feature similar to (Shan detection model is really a mixed-member Bayesian network.",

        "Figure 5 reveals that MEDLDA's best performance for these relation types are obtained using PlusCOMP features.",
        "Similarly SVM obtains the best Fmeasure for GEN-AFF and PHYS relations and Figure 3 shows that SVM achieves its best performance for these categories using PlusCOMP.",

        "This is not surprising, as the features we use are focused on determining true relation types and NO-REL is a mixture of all cases (and features) where relations do not exist.",
        "Further analysis of the figures reveal that even though there is a general trend towards better performance with addition of more informative features, not all systems show consistent improvements across all relation types with the addition of composite features.",

        "For example, in Figure 3, we see that the SVM with PlusCOMP features is outperformed by SVM with PlusSYN for",

        "The gains from features are also inconsistent in the case of LLDA (Figure 4).",
        "While the LLDA system with PlusSYN features always improves over the one using BOW, the performance drops considerably when using PlusCOMP features for ART and GEN-AFF.",
        "On the other hand, MEDLDA (see Figure 5) shows more consistent improvement for all relation types with the addition of more complex features.",
        "Also, the gains are more substantial.",

        "The sampling is not only on the (mini) document level, but also on the word level or on the syntactic or semantic level.",
        "Our model focuses on addressing the underlying semantics more directly than typical kernel-based methods.",
        "Chan and Roth (2011) employ constraints using an integer linear programming (ILP) framework.",
        "Using this, they apply rich linguistic and knowledge-based constraints based on coreference annotations, a hierarchy of relations, syntacto-semantic structure, and knowledge from Wikipedia.",
        "In our work, we focus on capturing the latent semantics of the text between the NEs.",
        "A variety of features have been explored for ERD in previous research (Zhou et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2008; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Miller et al., 2000).",
        "Syntactic features such as POS tags and dependency path between entities; semantic features such as Word-Net relations, semantic parse trees and types of NEs; and structural features such as which entity came first in the sentence have been found useful for ERD.",
        "We too observe the utility of informative features for this task.",
        "However, exploration of the feature space is not the main focus of this work.",
        "Rather, our focus is on whether the models are capable of incorporating rich features.",
        "A fuller exploration of rich heterogeneous features is the focus of our future work.",
        "A closely related task is that of relation mining and discovery, where unsupervised, semi-supervised approaches have been effectively employed (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Mintz et al., 2009; Jiang, 2009).",

        "(2004) use clustering and entity type information, while Mintz et al.",

        "Our ERD task is different from these as we focus on classifying the relation types into predefined relation types in the ACE05 corpus.",
        "Topic models have been applied previously for a number of NLP tasks (e.g. (Lin et al., 2006; Titov and McDonald, 2008).",
        "LDAs have also been employed to reduce feature dimensions in relation detection systems (Hachey, 2006).",
