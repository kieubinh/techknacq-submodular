        "A lexical resource is usually based on semantic judgements about lexical elements (a human judgement performed by a lexicographer, or a machine-based judgement in the case of automatically built resources).",
        "Often, two independently built resources that describe the same linguistic reality only show a weak agreement even when based on human judgements under the same protocol (Murray and Green, 2004).",
        "Many of such resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or Wiktionary (Zesch et al., 2008; Sajous et al., 2010) can be modelled as graphs.",
        "A graph encodes a binary relation on a set V of vertices.",
        "A graph G = (V, E) is therefore defined by a finite, non empty set of n = |V| vertices and by a set E ç V x V of m = |E | couples of vertices (edges).",
        "In the linguistic field, vertices can be various elements of the lexicon: lemmas, word senses, syntactic frames... and edges can describe various relations: synonymy, hyperonymy, translation, cooccurrence... Edges between two vertices can be seen as judgements that decide whether the considered relation applies to this pair.",
        "For example, in a synonymy graph, an edge exists between two words if they were judged to be synonyms by the lexicographer who was compiling the dictionary.",
        "So, different graphs that model dictionaries of synonyms are built according to the judgements of various \"judges\".",
        "We first illustrate, in section 2, how various standard synonymy resources of English and French share common structural properties: they all are Hierarchical Small Worlds (HSW).",
        "However, we then show that the synonymy judgements they describe seem to disagree: the Kappa (Cohen, 1960) between the edges of any two such resources remains surprisingly low.",
        "In the third section, we analyse this apparent disagreement and in section 4, we address it by proposing an alternative view of the networks, based on random walks.",
        "This more global view enables us to assess if disagreeing synonymy networks nevertheless concord at a more global level, because they model the same linguistic reality.",
        "Beyond the usual Kappa agreement measure, which is based on the local comparison of two category judgements (a pair is or is not a pair of synonyms), we can show that synonymy judgements do not essentially diverge on the lexical semantic structure that emerges from them.",
        "In the fifth section, we conclude by outlining possible applications and perspectives of this work."

        "In order to study the similarities and variations of lexical resources, let us study a sample of graphs that model several standard synonymy resources.",

        "We also study synonymy relations extracted from the Princeton Word Net (PWN) and from the English Wiktionary (Wik).",
        "The PWN synonymy network was built according to the following rule: an edge is drawn between any two words that belong to the same synset.",
        "The Wik-tionary synonymy network was extracted from Wik-tionary dumps by methods exposed in (Sajous et al., 2010).",
        "Each of these resources is split by parts of speech (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives) resulting in three different synonymy graphs, designated, for example for the Robert dictionary, as follows: RobN, Roby, Rob a .",
        "Most lexical networks, as most field networks, are Hierarchical Small World (HSW) Networks that share similar properties (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Newman, 2003; Gaume et al., 2010; Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005).",
        "They exhibit a low density (not many edges), short paths (the average number of edges L on the shortest path between two vertices is low), a high clustering rate C (locally densely connected subgraphs can be found whereas the whole graph is globally sparse in edges), and the distribution of their degrees follows a power law.",
        "All graphs in our sample exhibit the HSW properties.",
        "For example, Table 1 shows the pedigrees of synonymy graphs of verbs(for space reasons we only show results for verbs, results are similar for the two other parts of speech).",
        "In this table, n and m are the number of vertices and edges, (k) is the average degree of vertices, and A is the coefficient of the power law that fits the distribution of degrees, with a correlation coefficient v. n1ccand L1cc are the number of vertices and the average path length measured on the largest connected component.",
        "Even if n and ( k) vary across dictionaries, L1cc is always small, C is always higher than for equivalent random graphs (Newman, 2003) and the distribution of degrees remains close to a power law with a good correlation coefficient.",

        "When comparing two lexical resources built by lexicographers, one can be surprised to find such a level of disagreement on synonymy relations.",
        "This divergence in judgements can be explained by editorial policies and choices (regarding, for example printed size constraints, targeted audiences...).",
        "Furthermore, lexicographers also have their subjectivity.",
        "Since synonymy is more a continuous gradient than a discrete choice (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002), an alternative limited to synonym/not synonym leaves ample room for subjective interpretation.",
        "However, these justifications do not account for such discrepancies between resources describing the semantic relations of words of the same language.",
        "Therefore, we expect that, if two words are deemed not synonyms in one resource G1 , but synonyms in another G2, they will nevertheless share many neighbours in G1 and G2.",
        "In other words they will belong to the same dense zones.",
        "Consequently the dense zones (or clusters) found in G1 will be similar to those found in G2.",
        "Random walks are an efficient way to reveal these dense zones (Gaume et al., 2010).",
        "So, to evaluate the hypothesis, let us begin by studying the similarity of random walks on various synonymy networks.",
        "If G _ (V, E) is a reflexive and undirected graph, let us define dG(u) _ |{v G V/(u,v) G E}| the degree of vertex u in graph G, and let us imagine a walker wandering on the graph G:",
        "• At a time t G N, the walker is on one vertex",
        "• At time t + 1 , the walker can reach any neighbouring vertex of u, with uniform probability.",
        "This process is called a simple random walk (Bol-lobas, 2002).",
        "It can be defined by a Markov chain on V with a n x n transition matrix [G] :",

        "The probability PG (u-wv) of a walker starting on vertex u to reach a vertex v after t steps is:",
        "One can then prove (Gaume, 2004), with the Perron-Frobenius theorem (Stewart, 1994), that if G is connected (i.e. there is always at least one path between any two vertices), reflexive and undirected, then Vu, v G V:",
        "It means that when t tends to infinity, the probability of being on a vertex v at time t does not depend on the starting vertex but only on the degree of v. In the following we will refer to this limit as nG(v).",
        "The dynamics of the convergence of random walks towards the limit (Eq.",
        "(5)) is heavily dependent on the starting node.",
        "Indeed, the trajectory of the random walker is completely governed by the topology of the graph: after t steps, any vertex v located at a distance of t links or less can be reached.",
        "The probability of this event depends on the number of paths between u and v, and on the structure of the graph around the intermediary vertices along those paths.",
        "The more interconnections between the vertices, the higher the probability of reaching v from u.",
        "For example, if we take G1 _ RobV and G2 _ Larv, and choose the three vertices u _ éplucher (peel), r _ dépecer (tear apart) and s _ sonner (ring), which are such that:",

        "Second, random walks and confluence measures seem an appropriate technique to detect and compare the dense zones of various synonymy graphs.",
        "This theoretical work validates the random walk/confluence approach as a potentially valid tool for detecting semantic similarities.",
        "This opens many perspectives for applications.",
        "For example, it can be used to enrich resources as was done for the Wisigoth project (Sajous et al., 2010).",
        "It may also help to merge, or aggregate, resources.",
        "If we apply the conciliation process to two graphs G1 and G2, obtaining two accommodating graphs G1+G2) _ (V', E+)) and G2+Gi) _ (V', E+)) then the graph G _ (V',E'' _ (E+ n E+ )) could be a merged resource.",

        "This new aggregation method would need to be validated by comparing the quality of the merged resource to the results of the union or intersection.",

        "It would be worthwhile to investigate the effect of the length of the walks on the agreement of the accommodating graphs.",
        "• Another line of research would be to alter the conciliation ability of graphs, by increasing or decreasing the criterion for strong confluence.",
        "One can for example introduce a k parameter in the definition of C1 (resp.",
        "C2), in Equation 6:",
        "• The conciliation process seems unbalanced insofar as graphs only accept to add edges.",

        "• The conciliation process could also be generalised to graphs that have different vertices, such as two synonymy networks of different languages.",

        "One approach to compare two synonymy graphs of two different languages would be to draw edges between vertices that are translations of each other.",
