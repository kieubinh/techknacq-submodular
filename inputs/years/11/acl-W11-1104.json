        "aWe consider graph-based approaches to WSI, which typically construct a graph from word occurrences or collocations.",
        "The core problem is how to identify sense-specific information within the graph in order to perform sense induction.",
        "Current approaches have used clustering (Dorow and Wid-dows, 2003; Klapaftis and Manandhar, 2008) or statistical graph models (Klapaftis and Manandhar, 2010) to identify sense-specific subgraphs.",
        "We reinterpret the challenge of identifying sense-specific information in a co-occurrence graph as one of community detection, where a community is defined as a group of connected nodes that are more connected to each other than to the rest of the graph (Fortunato, 2010).",
        "Within the co-occurrence graph, we hypothesize that communities identify sense-specific contexts for each of the terms.",
        "Community detection identifies groups of contextual cues that constrain each of the words in a community to a single sense.",
        "To test our hypothesis, we require a community detection algorithm with two key properties: (1) a word may belong to multiple, overlapping communities, which is necessary for discovering multiple senses, and (2) the community detection may be hierarchically tuned, which corresponds to sense granularity.",
        "Therefore, we adapt a recent, state of the art approach, Link Clustering (Ahn et al., 2010).",
        "Our initial study suggests that community detection offers competitive performance and sense quality."

        "A co-occurrence graph is fundamental to our approach; terms are represented as nodes and an edge between two nodes indicates the terms' cooccurrence, with a weight proportional to frequency.",
        "While prior work has focused on clustering the nodes to induce senses, using Link Clustering (Ahn et al., 2010), we cluster the edges, which is equivalent to grouping the word collocations to identify sense-specific contexts.",
        "We summarize our approach as four steps: (1) selecting the contextual cues, (2) building a co-occurrence graph, (3) performing community detection on the graph, and (4) sense labeling new contexts using the discovered communities.",
        "Context Refinement Representing the cooccurrence graph for all terms in a context is prohibitively expensive.",
        "Moreover, often only a subset of the terms in a context constrain the sense of an ambiguous word.",
        "Therefore, we refine a word's context to include only a subset ofthe terms present.",
        "Following previous work (Veronis, 2004), we select only nouns in the context.",
        "Early experiments indicated that including infrequent terms in the co-occurrence graph yielded poor performance, which we attribute to having too few connecting edges to identify meaningful community structure.",
        "Therefore, we include only those nouns occurring in the most frequent 5000 tokens, which are likely to be representative the largest communities in which a term takes part.",
        "Last, we include all the nouns and verbs used in the SemEval 2010 WSI Task (Manandhar et al., 2010), which are used in our evaluation.",
        "The selected context terms are then stemmed using the Porter stemmer.",
        "Building the Co-occurrence Graph The graph is iteratively constructed by adding edges between the terms from a context.",
        "For each pairwise combination of terms, an edge is added and its weight is increased by 1.",
        "This step effectively embeds a clique if it did not exist before, connecting all of the context's words within the graph.",
        "Once all contexts have been seen, the graph is then pruned to remove all edges with weight below a threshold t = 25.",
        "This step removes edges form infrequent collocations, which may not contribute sufficient graph structure for community detection, and as a practical consideration, greatly speeds up the community detection process.",
        "However, we note that parameter was largely unoptimized and future work may see a benefit from accounting for edge weight.",
        "Community Detection Within the co-occurrence graph, communities may have partial overlap.",
        "For example, Figure 1 illustrates a part of the local graph for \"mouse.\"",
        "Two clear senses emerge from the neighbors: one for the input device and another for the animal.",
        "However, the terms that correspond to one sense also co-occur with terms corresponding to the other sense, e.g., \"information,\" which hinders finding communities directly from disconnected components in the local neighborhood.",

        "First, the edges are clustered using an unweighted similarity function based on the neighbors of two edges, eitj and ei>k: sim(ei}j, ei>k) = ^ß^, where ui denotes the node i and its neighbors.",
        "This similarity reflects the percentage of terms that co-occur in common with the term for nodes j and k, independent of the terms that co-occur with the shared term for i.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the similarity for the edges connecting \"mouse\" with \"user\" and \"software,\" |, measures the overlap in the neighbors of \"user\" and \"software\" independent of the neighbors for \"mouse,\" such as \"cell\" and \"size.\"",
        "Using this similarity function, the edges are ag-glomeratively clustered into a dendrogram.",
        "We use the single-link criteria which iteratively merges the two clusters connected by the edge pair with the highest similarity.",
        "The dendrogram may then be cut at different levels to reveal different cluster granularities; cuts near the bottom of the dendrogram create a larger number of small groups of collocations, whereas cuts near the top create fewer, larger groups of collocations.",
        "To select the specific partitioning of the dendrogram into clusters, we select the solution that maximizes the partition density, which Ahn where M is the number of edges in the graph, c denotes a specific cluster, and uc and mc are the number of nodes and edges in cluster c, respectively.",
        "The final set of communities is derived from these partitions: a node is a member of each community in which one of its edges occurs.",
        "Last, we remove all communities of size 3 and below, which we interpret as having too few semantic constraints to reliably disambiguate each of its terms.",

        "This suggests that at a specific community granularity, additional communities enable the WSI mapping process to make better sense distinctions between contexts.",
        "However, we note that V-Measure begins to drop as the average community membership increases in solutions after Sv, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "We suspect that as the agglomerative merge process continues, communities representing different senses become merged, leading to a loss of purity.",
        "The lower performance of Spd and the impact of community memberships raises the important question of how to best select the communities.",
        "While co-occurrence graphs have been shown to exhibit small-world network patterns (Veronis, 2004), optimizing for the general criterion of partition density that has performed well on such networks does not result in communities that map well to sense-specific contexts.",
        "We believe that this behavior is due to impact of the sense inventory; selecting a community solution purely based on the graph's structure may not capture the correct sense distinctions, either having communities with too few members to distinguish between senses or too many members, which conflates senses.",
        "However, a promising future direction is to examine whether the there exist features of the graph structure that would allow for recognizing the specific community solutions that correspond directly to different sense granularities without the need for an external evaluation metric."
