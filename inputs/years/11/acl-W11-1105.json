        "In the present proposal, knowledge about semantic relatedness is embodied into a document network, whose nodes are intended to represent concepts, while the links between nodes stand for various relations between concepts.",
        "The nodes of the network correspond to articles from the Wikipedia hypertext encyclopedia, and are derived as follows.",
        "The network was built from Wikipedia, using the WEX dataset (Metaweb Technologies, 2010).",
        "All articles from the following categories were removed, as they do not correspond to proper concepts: Talk, File, Image, Template, Category, Portal, and List.",
        "Moreover, disambiguation pages and articles shorter than 100 non-stopwords were filtered out as well.",
        "Out of 4,327,482 articles in WEX, 1,264,611 articles were kept, forming the nodes of our network.",
        "The first type of links in our document network are the hyperlinks between articles, because, in principle, each link between two articles indicates some form of relatedness between them.",
        "There are more than 35 million such links in our network.",
        "The second type of links is derived from the similarity of lexical content between articles.",
        "This is computed using cosine similarity between the lexical vectors corresponding to the articles' texts, after stopword removal and stemming.",
        "Then, links are created by connecting every article to the 10 articles that are most similar to it, each link receiving a weight which is the normalized lexical similarity score.",
        "The number 10 was chosen to ensure computational tractability, and is in the same range as the average number of hyperlinks per node (30).",
        "Computing semantic relatedness between two texts requires: (1) to estimate relatedness between two sets of nodes in the network, as described in Sections 3 and 4; and (2) to project each text onto a set of nodes, as we briefly explain here.",
        "The projection of a text onto the network is found by computing the text's lexical similarity with all articles, again using cosine distance over stemmed words, without stopwords.",
        "The text is mapped to the 10 closest articles, resulting in a probability distribution over the 10 corresponding nodes.",
        "Again, this value was chosen to be similar to the number ofhyperlinks and content links per node, and to keep computation tractable.",
        "In fact, the numerous Wikipedia articles are scattered in the space of words, therefore tuning these values does not seem to bring crucial changes.",
        "3 Computing Relatedness in the Network Using Visiting Probability (VP)",
        "We have previously defined a random walk model (Yazdani and Popescu-Belis, 2010) to compute relatedness of sets of nodes as the visiting probability ( VP) of a random walker from one set to another one, and we will review the model in this section.",
        "In the next section, we will explain how the model was extended for application to document clustering.",
        "Let S = [si\\l < i < n} be the set of n nodes in the graph.",
        "Any two nodes si and Sj can be connected by one or more directed and weighted links, which can be of L different types (L = 2 in our case: hyperlinks and lexical similarity links).",
        "Links between nodes can thus be represented by L matrices Ai (1 < l < L) of size n x n, where Ai(i,j) is the weight of the link of type l between si and Sj.",
        "The transition matrix Cl gives the probability of a direct transition between nodes si and sj, using only links of type l. This matrix can be built from the Ai matrix as follows:",
        "In the random walk process using all link types (1 < l < L), let the weight wi denote the importance of link type l. Then, the overall transition matrix C giving the transition probability Ci;j between nodes si and Sj is : C = i=i wiCi.",
        "One of the main parameters in this computation is the relative weight of the two types of links (lexical similarity and hyperlinks) in the random walk over the network.",
        "The settings for the experiments on document clustering (0.6 vs. 0.4) are explained in Section 5.1 below.",
        "Let us consider a probability distribution r over nodes, corresponding to the projection of a text fragment onto the network of articles (Section 2).",
        "Given a new node sj in the network, our model first estimates the probability of visiting sj for the first time when a random walker starts from r in the graph.",
        "The model considers the state St of the random walker (its position node) and provides a procedure which, executed until termination, yields the value of VP.",
        "Namely, the initial state is chosen at random with probability P(S0 = si\\r) = ri (where the riare the components of r).",
        "Then, from state St_i, either St_i = sj and the procedure is finished, or the next node is chosen using the transition matrix C. Moreover, it is also possible to 'fail' the walk with a small probability, called 'absorption probability', which makes longer paths less probable.",
        "The VP of sj starting from the distribution r, as computed here, is different from the probability assigned to sj after running Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala, 2003) with a teleport vector equal to r. In the computation of VP, the loops starting from sj and ending to the same sj do not have any effect on the final score, unlike for PPR, for which such loops boost the probability of sj.",
        "If some pages have this type of loops (typically, very \"popular\" pages), then after using PPR they will have high probability although they might not be very close to the teleport vector r.",
        "The VP of sj is also different from the hitting time to sj, defined as the average number of steps a random walker would take to visit sj for the first time in the graph starting from r. Hitting time is more sensitive to long paths in comparison to VP, a fact that might introduce more noise.The performance of these three algorithms in computing semantic similarity has been compared in (Yazdani and Popescu-Belis, 2010).",
        "Generalizing now to the computation of VP from a weighted set of nodes r1 (a probability distribution) to another set r2, the model first constructs a virtual node representing r2 in the network, named by convention sR, and then connects all nodes si to sR according to their weights in r2.",
        "The transition matrix for the random walk is updated accordingly.",
        "To compute relatedness of two texts projected onto the network as r1 and r2, the VP of r1 given r2 is averaged with the converse probability, of r2given r1 - a larger probability indicating closer semantic relatedness.",
        "The computation of VP can be done iteratively and can be truncated after a number of steps, as the importance of longer paths grows smaller due to the absorption probability, leading thus to a T-truncated visiting probability noted VPT.",
        "Besides making computation more tractable, truncation reduces the effect of longer paths, which seem to be less reliable indicators of relatedness.",
        "We have computed an upper bound on the truncation error, which helps to control and minimize the number of steps actually computed in a random walk.",
        "To compute the upper bound of the truncation error we compute the probability ofreturning neither success (reaching sj) nor failure (absorption) in first t steps, which can be computed as Y^i=j at(fC't)i.",
        "This is in fact the probability mass at time t at all nodes except sj, the targeted node.",
        "C' is the transition matrix that gives the probability of a transition between two nodes, modified to include the virtual node sR in the network, and 1 – a is the absorption probability.",
        "If pt(success) denotes the probability of success (reaching sj) considering paths of length at most t, and £t the error made by truncating after step t, then we have:",
        "So, if pt(success) is used as an approximation for p(success) then an upper bound for this approximation error et is the right term of the above inequality."

        "Indeed, it is not tractable to individually compute the average VP between any two texts in the set of documents to be clustered, because the numbers of pairs is very large - e.g., 20,000 documents in the experiments in Section 5.",
        "Instead, we propose two solutions for computing, respectively, VP to a set of nodes (from all documents in the network), and respectively VP from a set of nodes to all documents.",
        "To compute the T-truncated visiting probability (noted VPT) from all nodes in the network to a node sR at the same time, the following recursive procedure is defined.",
        "Here, T is the number of steps before truncation, and sR is a virtual node representing a probability distribution r from a text.",
        "The procedure is based on the definition of VP between nodes in Section 3 and uses the transition matrix C that gives the probability of a transition between two nodes, modified to include the virtual node sR in the network.",

        "The initialization of the procedure is done using",
        "VPT(sr,sr) = 1 and VP(si,sR) = 0 for any i = R.",
        "To compute the truncated VP from r to all nodes in the network, the total computation time using the definition of VPT from Section 3 is O(ETN), where N is the number of nodes in the network, because VPT must be computed for each node separately.",
        "For a large data set, this is not tractable.",
        "The proposed solution is based on a sampling method over the random walks to approximate VPT.",

        "VPT(?,sj) = (Em atjm )/M.",
        "As a result, the estimate ofVPT can be computed in O(MT) steps, where M is the number of sample paths.",
        "Moreover, it is possible to compute a bound on the error of the estimation, \\ VPT – VPT \\, depending on the number of sample paths M. It can be shown that the error is lower than e, with a probability larger than 1 – ö, on condition that the number of sample paths is greater than a \\n(2/ö)/2e.",
        "To prove this bound, we use inspiration from a proof by Sarkar et al.",
        "(2008).",
