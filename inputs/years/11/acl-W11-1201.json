        "Machine translation began in 1947 with an influential memo by Warren Weaver.",
        "In that memo, Weaver noted that human code-breakers could transform ciphers into natural language (e.g., into Turkish)",
        "• without access to parallel ciphertext/plaintext data, and",
        "• without knowing the plaintext language's syntax and semantics.",
        "Simple word-and letter-statistics seemed to be enough for the task.",
        "Weaver then predicted that such statistical methods could also solve a tougher problem, namely language translation.",
        "This raises the question: can sufficient translation knowledge be derived from comparable (non-parallel) data?",
        "In this talk, I will discuss initial work in treating foreign language as a code for English, where we assume the code to involve both word substitutions and word transpositions.",
        "In doing so, I will quantitatively estimate the value of non-parallel data, versus parallel data, in terms of end-to-end accuracy of trained translation systems.",
        "Because we still know very little about solving word-based codes, I will also describe successful techniques and lessons from the realm of letter-based ciphers, where the nonparallel resources are (1) enciphered text, and (2) unrelated plaintext.",
        "As an example, I will describe how we decoded the Copiale cipher with limited \"computer-like\" knowledge of the plaintext language.",
        "The talk will wrap up with challenges in exploiting comparable data at all levels: letters, words, phrases, syntax, and semantics."
