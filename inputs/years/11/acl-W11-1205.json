        "Bilingual lexicons are important resources of many applications of natural language processing such as cross-language information retrieval or machine translation.",
        "These lexicons are traditionally extracted from bilingual corpora.",
        "In this area, the main work involves parallel corpora, i.e. a corpus that contains source texts and their translations.",
        "From sentence-to-sentence aligned corpora, symbolic (Carl and Langlais, 2002), statistical (Daille et al., 1994), or hybrid techniques (Gaussier and Lange, 1995) are used for word and expression alignments.",
        "However, despite good results in the compilation of bilingual lexicons, parallel corpora are rather scarce resources, especially for technical domains and for language pairs not involving English.",
        "For instance, current resources ofparallel corpora are built from the proceedings of international institutions such as the European Union (11 languages) or the United Nations (6 languages), bilingual countries such as Canada (English and French languages), or bilingual regions such as Hong Kong (Chinese and English languages).",
        "For these reasons, research in bilingual lexicon extraction is focused on another kind of bilingual corpora.",
        "These corpora, known as comparable corpora, are comprised of texts sharing common features such as domain, genre, register, sampling period, etc.",
        "without having a source text-target text relationship.",
        "Although the building of comparable corpora is easier than the building of parallel corpora, the results obtained thus far on comparable corpora are contrasted.",
        "For instance, good results are obtained from large corpora – several million words – for which the accuracy of the proposed translation is between 76% (Fung, 1998) and 89% (Rapp, 1999) for the first 20 candidates.",
        "(Cao and Li, 2002) have achieved 91% accuracy for the top three candidates using the Web as a comparable corpus.",
        "But for technical domains, for which large corpora are not available, the results obtained, even though encouraging, are not completely satisfactory yet.",
        "For instance, (Dejean et al., 2002) obtained a precision of 44% and 57% for the first 10 and 20 candidates in a 100,000-word medical corpus, and 35% and 42% in a multi-domain 8 million-word corpus.",
        "For French/English single words, (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) using a medical corpus of 1.2 million words, obtained a precision of about 50% and 60% for the top 10 and top 20 candidates.",
        "(Morin et al., 2007) obtained a precision of 51% and 60% for the top 10 and 20 candidates in a 1.5 million-word French-Japanese diabetes corpus.",
        "The above work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora relies on the assumption that words which have the same meaning in different languages tend to appear in the same lexical contexts (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999).",
        "Based on this assumption, a standard approach consists of building context vectors for each word of the source and target languages.",
        "The candidate translations for a particular word are obtained by comparing the translated source context vector with all target context vectors.",
        "In this approach, the translation of the words of the source context vectors depends on the coverage of the bilingual dictionary vis-a-vis the corpus.",
        "This aspect can be a potential problem if too few corpus words are found in the bilingual dictionary (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2003; Dejean et al., 2002).",
        "In this article, we want to show how this problem can be partially circumvented by combining a general bilingual dictionary with a specialized bilingual dictionary based on a parallel corpus extracted through mining of the comparable corpus.",
        "In the same way that recent works in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) mines comparable corpora to discover parallel sentences (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Yang and Li, 2003; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009, among others), this work contributes to the bridging of the gap between comparable and parallel corpora by offering a framework for bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpus with the help of parallel corpus-based pairs of terms.",
        "The remainder of this article is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we first present the method for bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora enhanced with parallel corpora and the associated system architecture.",
        "We then quantify and analyse in Section 3 the performance improvement of our method on a medical comparable corpora when used to extract specialized bilingual lexicon.",
        "Finally, in Section 4, we discuss the present study and present our conclusions."

      "text": [
        "The overall architecture of the system for lexical alignment is shown in Figure 1 and comprises parallel corpus-and comparable corpus-based alignments.",
        "Starting from a comparable corpus harvested from the web, we first propose to extract parallel sentences based on the structural characteristics of the documents harvested.",
        "These parallel sentences are then used to build a bilingual lexicon through a tool dedicated to bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "Finally, this bilingual lexicon is used to perform the comparable corpus-based alignment.",
        "For a word to be translated, the output of the system is a ranked list of candidate translations.",
        "Parallel sentence extraction from comparable corpora has been studied by a number of researchers",
        "Resnik and Smith, 2003; Yang and Li, 2003; Fung and Cheung, 2004; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009, among others) and several systems have been developed such as BITS (Bilingual Internet Test Search) (Ma and Liberman, 1999), PTMiner (Parallel Text Miner) (Chen and Nie, 2000), and STRAND (Structural Translation",
        "Recognition for Acquiring Natural Data) (Resnik and Smith, 2003).",
        "Their work relies on the observation that a collection of texts in different languages composed independently and based on sharing common features such as content, domain, genre, register, sampling period, etc.",
        "contains probably some sentences with a source text-target text relationship.",
        "Based on this observation, dynamic programming (Yang and Li, 2003), similarity measures such as Cosine (Fung and Cheung, 2004) or word and translation error ratios (Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009), or maximum entropy classifier (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) are used for discovering parallel sentences.",
        "Although our purpose is similar to these works, the amount of data required by these techniques makes them ineffective when applied to specialized comparable corpora used to discover parallel sentences.",
        "In addition, the focus of this paper is not to propose a new technique for this task but to study how parallel sentences extracted from a comparable corpus can improve the quality of the candidate translations.",
        "For theses reasons, we propose to make use of structural characteristics of the documents comprising the comparable corpus to extract auto-",
        "Figure 1 : Overview of the system for lexical alignment matically parallel sentences.",
        "In fact, specialized comparable corpora are generally constructed via the consultation of specialized Web portals.",
        "For instance, (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) use CISMeF for building the French part of their comparable corpora and CliniWeb for the English part, and (Dejean and Gaussier, 2002) use documents extracted from MEDLINE to build a German/English comparable corpus.",
        "Consequently, the documents collected through these portals are often scientific papers.",
        "Moreover, when the language of these papers is not the English, the paper usually comprises an abstract, keywords and title in the native language and their translations in the English language.",
        "These characteristics of scientific paper is useful for the efficient extraction of parallel sentences or word translations from the documents forming a specialized comparable corpus for which one part will inevitably be in English.",
        "In this study, the documents comprising the French/English specialized comparable corpus were taken from the medical domain within the subdomain of 'breast cancer'.",
        "These documents have been automatically selected from the Elsevier website among the articles published between 2001 and 2008 for which the title or the keywords of the articles contain the multi-word term 'cancer du sein' in French and 'breast cancer' in English.",
        "We thus collected 130 documents in French and 118 in English and about 530,000 words for each language.",
        "Since the 130 French documents previously collected are scientific papers, each document contains a French abstract which is accompanied by its English translation.",
        "We exploit this structural characteristic ofthe French documents in order to build a small specialized parallel corpus directly correlated to the subdomain of 'breast cancer' involved in the comparable corpus.",
        "We use the Uplug collection of tools for alignment (Tiedemann, 2003) to extract translations from our specialized parallel corpus.",
        "The output of such a tool is a list of aligned parts of sentences, that has to be post-process and filtered in our case.",
        "We clean the alignment with a simple yet efficient method in order to obtain only word translations.",
        "We associate every source word from a source sequence with every target word from the target sequence.",
        "As an example, uplug efficiently aligns the English word breast cancer with the French word cancer du sein (the data are described in Section 3.1).",
        "We obtain the following lexical alignment:",
        "With more occurrences of the French word cancer, we are able to align it with the English words {breast, cancer, cancer, cancer, the, of, breast, cancer}.",
        "We can then filter such a list by counting the translation candidates.",
        "In the previous example, we obtain: cancer (fr) – breast/2, the /1, of/1, cancer/4.",
        "The English word cancer is here the best match for the French word cancer.",
        "In many cases, only one alignment is obtained.",
        "For example, there is only one occurrence of the French word chromosome, aligned with the English word chromosome.",
        "In order to filter translation candidates, we keep 1:1 candidates if their frequencies are comparable in the original corpus.",
        "We keep the most frequent translation candidates (in the previous example, cancer) if their frequencies in the corpus are also comparable.",
        "This in-corpus frequency constraint is useful for discarding candidates that appear in many alignments (such as functional words).",
        "The criterion for frequency acceptability is:",
        "with f 1 and f2 the frequency of words to be aligned in the parallel corpus.",
        "By this way, we build a French/English specialized bilingual lexicon from the parallel corpus.",
        "This lexicon, called breast cancer dictionary (BC dictionary) in the remainder of this article, is composed of 549 French/English single words.",
        "The comparable corpus-based alignment relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts.",
        "Based on this observation, the alignment method, known as the standard approach, builds context vectors in the source and the target languages where each vector element represents a word which occurs within the window of the word to be translated (for instance a seven-word window approximates syntactic dependencies).",
        "In order to emphasize significant words in the context vector and to reduce word-frequency effects, the context vectors are normalized according to association measures.",
        "Then, the translation is obtained by comparing the source context vector to each translation candidate vector after having translated each element of the source vector with a general dictionary.",
        "The implementation of this approach can be carried out by applying the four following steps (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999):",
        "1.",
        "We collect all the lexical units in the context of each lexical unit i and count their occurrence frequency in a window of n words around i.",
        "For each lexical unit i of the source and the target languages, we obtain a context vector v which gathers the set of co-occurrence units j associated with the number of times that j and i occur together occ(i,j).",
        "In order to identify specific words in the lexical context and to reduce word-frequency effects, we normalize context vectors using an association score such as Mutual Information (MI) or Log-likelihood, as shown in equations 1 and 2 and in Table 1 (where N = a + b + c + d).",
        "2.",
        "Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the lexical units of the source context vector.",
        "If the bilingual dictionary provides several translations for a lexical unit, we consider all of them but weight the different translations according to their frequency in the target language.",
        "3.",
        "For a lexical unit to be translated, we compute the similarity between the translated context vector and all target vectors through vector distance measures such as Cosine or Weighted",
        "Jaccard (WJ) (see equations 3 and 4 where assocj stands for \"association score\").",
        "4.",
        "The candidate translations of a lexical unit are the target lexical units ranked following the similarity score.",
        "The documents comprising the French/English specialized comparable corpus have been normalised through the following linguistic preprocessing steps: tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, and lem-matisation.",
        "Next, the function words were removed and the words occurring less than twice in the French and the English parts were discarded.",
        "Finally, the comparable corpus comprised about 7,400 distinct words in French and 8,200 in English.",
        "In this study, we used four types of bilingual dictionary: i) the Wiktionary free-content multilingual dictionary, ii) the ELRA-M0033 professional French/English bilingual dictionary, iii) the MeSHmetha-thesaurus, and iv) the BC dictionary (see Section 2.2).",
        "Table 2 shows the main features ofthe dictionaries, namely: the number ofdistinctFrench single words in the dictionary (# SWs dico.",
        "), the number of distinct French single words in the dictionary after projection on the French part of the comparable corpus (# SWs corpus), and the number of translations per entry in the dictionary (# TPE).",
