        "Nearly every description of comparable corpora begins with the EAGLES (Expert Advisory Group on Language Engineering Standards) definition:",
        "\"A comparable corpus is one which selects similar texts in more than one language or variety.",
        "The possibilities of a comparable corpus are to compare different languages or varieties in similar circumstances of communication, but avoiding the inevitable distortion introduced by the translations of a parallel corpus.\"",
        "(Maia, 2003), which also became nearly standard during the recent years, emphasizes the fact that comparable monolingual corpora usually provide us with much better linguistic quality and representativeness than translated parallel corpora.",
        "The other advantages over the parallel corpora, i.e. amount and availability, are obvious.",
        "Nowadays, the most popular usage of comparable corpora is improving machine translation, more precisely, compensating the lack of parallel training data.",
        "The articles (Munteanu et al., 2004), (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) and (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006) are introducing algorithms for extracting parallel sentences and sub-sententional fragments from comparable corpora and using the automatically extracted parallel data for improving statistical machine translation algorithms performance.",
        "Present day most popular comparable corpora come either from the newswire resources (AFP, Reuters, Xinhua), leading to data sets like LDC English, Chinese and Arabic Gigaword, or from Wikipedia.",
        "Mining Wikipedia became very popular in the recent years.",
        "For example, (Tomas et al., 2008) is exploring both parallel and comparable potential of Wikipedia, (Filatova, 2009) examines multilingual aspects of a selected subset of Wikipedia and (Gamallo and Lopez, 2010) describes converting Wikipedia into \"CorpusPedia\"."

        "Just to avoid confusion: In this article, we focus only on fora or boards, i.e. standalone discussion sites on a stated topic.",
        "We are not talking about comments accompanying news articles or blog posts.",
        "The internet discussion fora cover, in surprisingly big amounts of data and for many languages, the most unbelievable topics (real examples from the authors' country).",
        "People, who eat only uncooked (\"raw\") food.",
        "People, who eat only cooked food.",
        "Mothers with young children, women trying to conceive, communities of people absolutely avoiding sex.",
        "Fans of Volvo, BMW, Maserati, Trabant cars.",
        "Probably also in your country mothers like to talk about their children and men like to compare their engine's horse power.",
        "Everyone who has any specific interest or hobby and is friendly with the web, probably knows at least one discussion forum focused on his/her favourite topic, inhabited by intelligent, friendly debaters producing interesting, on-topic content.",
        "These types of fora often have very active administrators, who clean the discussions from off-topics, vulgarities, move the discussion threads into correct thematic categories etc.",
        "The administrators' \"tidying up\" effort can be even regarded as a kind of annotation.",
        "The rapidly growing amount of web discussion fora was until now linguistically exploited only in a strictly monolingual manner.",
        "To the best of our (and Google Scholar) knowledge, nobody has published any work regarding the possibility of using internet discussion fora as a multilingual source of data for linguistic or machine translation purposes.",
        "A typical forum is divided into thematic categories (larger fora split into boards and boards into categories).",
        "Every category usually contains from tens to thousands of separate discussions.",
        "A discussion consists of messages (posts) and sometimes its content is further arranged using threads.",
        "A discussion should be placed in appropriate category and messages in the discussion should hold onto the discussion topic, otherwise the administrator removes the inappropriate messages or even the whole discussion.",
        "Fora usually have an entire off-topic category where their members can talk about anything \"out-of-domain\".",
        "To avoid spam, usually only registered members can contribute.",
        "Some fora keep their memberlist visible to the public, some do not."

      "heading": "3. Why comparable fora?",
      "text": [
        "Besides their amount and availability, comparable fora have a few other advantages over other types of comparable corpora.",
        "They contain \"spontaneous writing\" - an original, previously unpublished content, which is almost certainly not a translation of other language original.",
        "This is obviously not the case of parallel corpora, and we cannot be sure even for other popular comparable corpora.",
        "A journalist may be inspired by a news agency report or by another media source, and a Wikipedia author must also reconcile his claims with existing resources, which more or less affects his writing style.",
        "The other advantage is easier domain classification, or more effective pre-selection before running an automatic parallel sentences alignment.",
        "A generic newspaper article is provided only with a title, language and release date.",
        "A Wikipedia entry has a title, history and is classified into a thematic category.",
        "Fora messages have both dates, titles and category classifications and they are available in much larger amounts than Wikipedia entries and are covering more thematic domains than news articles."

        "As a topic of our case study, we have chosen an event which occurs to most of the people at least once in their life - a wedding.",
        "We looked over five language mutations of the same forum operated by Asmira Company - Fi-nalstitch.co.uk (EN), Braupunkt.de (DE), Faire-lanoce.fr (FR), Mojasvadba.sk (SK), Beremese.cz (CZ); and two other fora, Brides.com/forums (EN2) and Organisation-mariage.net (FR2), which seem to be larger and more popular in the target countries.",
        "We have manually examined fora sizes and possibilities of their alignment on the category level.",
        "Tables 1 and 2 summarize the total number ofdis-cussions and messages contained in selected categories, shared by most of the fora.",
        "For the Asmira fora, we omitted the discussions accessible both from CZ and SK sites.",
        "If we assume average length of a message to be about 60 words (see below), the proposed sites give us a few millions of words of multilingual comparable corpora in each category (focussed on very restricted topic, such as wedding clothes, or hairdressing & make-up) even for \"non-mainstream\" languages, such as Czech or Slovak.",
        "In order to learn more about the amount and textual quality of the data, we have downloaded all the content of the five Asmira fora, extracted their messages into five monolingual corpora and measured some basic characteristics of the texts.",
        "The downloading and extracting task needed about 20 minutes ofcod-ing and a few days of waiting for the result (we did not want to overload the fora webservers).",
        "In graphs 1, 2 and 3, we present normalized sentence length distributions for particular fora.",
        "For English and Czech, we added for comparison sentence length distributions of reference corpora of comparable sizes, i.e.",
        "The Penn Treebank, training set (Marcus et al., 1994), for English and The Czech National Corpus, SYN2005 (CNC, 2005), for Czech.",
        "The category distinction may be still too coarse for potential alignment.",
        "The site FR2 has a joint category for Beauty and Wedding clothing, and on the contrary, it has separate categories for Wedding and Reception.",
        "Therefore, we tried to examine the fora on a deeper level.",
        "In table 4, we present some examples of discussions on the same topic.",
        "As you can guess, fully automatic alignment of the discussion titles will not be an easy task.",
        "On the other side, every machine translation specialist must shiver with pleasure when seeing some of the discussion titles to be almost translations of each other, and it would be a sin to leave these data unexploited.",
