        "We have previously proposed a community dataset of annotated text spanning a very large number of languages, with consistent annotation and format that enables automatic cross-linguistic processing on an unprecedented scale (Abney and Bird, 2010).",
        "Here we set out the data model in detail, and invite members of the computational linguistics community to begin work on the first version of the dataset.",
        "The targeted annotation generalizes over three widely-used kinds of data: (1) simple bitexts, that is, tokenized texts and their translations, which are widely used for training machine translation systems; (2) interlinear glossed text (IGT), which adds lemmas, morphological features and parts ofspeech, and is the de facto standard in the documentary linguistics literature; and (3) dependency parses, which add a head pointer and relation name for each word, and are gaining popularity as representations of syntactic structure.",
        "We do not expect all texts to have equal richness of annotation; rather, these are the degrees of annotation we wish to explicitly accommodate.",
        "Keeping the annotation lightweight is a primary desideratum.",
        "We strive for inclusion of as many languages as possible.",
        "We are especially interested in languages outside of the group of 30 or so for which there already exist non-trivial electronic resources.",
        "Optimistically, we aim for a universal corpus, in the sense of one that covers a widely representative set of the world's languages and supports inquiry into universal linguistics and development of language technologies with universal applicability.",
        "We emphasize, however, that even if completely successful, it will be a universal corpus and not the universal corpus.",
        "The term \"universal\" should emphatically not be understood in the sense of encompassing all language annotation efforts.",
        "We are not proposing a standard or a philosophy of language documentation, but rather a design for one particular resource.",
        "Though the goals with regard to language coverage are unusually ambitious, for the sake of achievability we keep the targeted annotation as simple as possible.",
        "The result is intended to be a single, coherent dataset that is very broad in language coverage, but very thin in complexity of annotation.",
        "Finally, the development of the corpus is an unfunded, all-volunteer effort.",
        "It will only come about if it wins community buy-in, in the spirit of collaborative efforts like Project Gutenberg.",
        "We formulate it as a cooperation among data providers and hosting services to provide data in a manner that creates a single, seamless dataset from the user perspective.",
        "This paper is a first draft of a \"cooperative agreement\" that could achieve that goal."

        "In documentary linguistics, a distinction is made between language documentation, whose concern is the collection of primary documentation such as speech recordings and indigenous written works, and language description, whose concern is the annotation and organization of the primary material (Himmelmann, 1998).",
        "We make a similar distinction between media files and annotation, where \"annotation\" is understood broadly to include all processing steps that make the linguistic contents more explicit, including plain text rendering, sentence segmentation, and alignment of translations.",
        "The Corpus consists of annotated documents, in the sense of primary documents with accompanying annotation.",
        "There are many efforts at collecting documentation for a broad range of languages; what makes this Corpus distinct is its focus on annotation.",
        "Accordingly, we assume that media files and annotation are handled separately.",
        "For media, the Language Commons collection in the Internet Archive is a recently-established repository for redistributable language data that we view as the primary host.",
        "For the annotation database, a primary data host remains to be established, but we have identified some options.",
        "For example, Amazon Web Services and the Talis Connected Commons have free hosting services for public data sets.",
        "In order to keep the barriers to participation as low as possible, we have made our target for annotation as simple as possible.",
        "The data model is summarized in Figure 1.",
        "We distinguish between aligned texts (or parallel texts) and analyzed texts (comparable texts).",
        "Semantically, the entire collection of aligned texts constitutes a matrix whose columns are languages and whose rows are texts.",
        "We limit attention to three levels of granularity: document, sentence, and word.",
        "Each cell is occupied by a string, the typical length of the string varying with the granularity.",
        "We expect the matrix to be quite sparse: most cells are empty.",
        "The collection of analyzed texts consists, semantically, of one table per language.",
        "The rows represent words and the columns are properties of the words.",
        "The words may either be tokens in a sentence analysis, as suggested by the examples, or types representing dictionary information.",
        "The tables are comparable, in the sense that they have a common format and are conducive to language-independent processing, but they are not parallel: the i-th word in the German table has nothing to do with the i-th word in the Spanish table.",
        "The tables in Figure 1 constitute the bulk of the data model.",
        "In addition, we assume some auxiliary information (not depicted) that is primarily organizational.",
        "It includes an association between documents and sentences, the location of documents and sentences within media files (if applicable), a grouping of table rows into \"files,\" and a grouping of files into \"works.\"",
        "Metadata such as revision information is attached to files and works.",
        "We return below to the characterization of this auxiliary information.",
        "In contrast to current standard practice, we wish to emphasize the status of aligned and analyzed text as annotation of primary documents represented by media files such as speech recordings or page images, and we wish to maintain explicit connections between annotations and primary documents.",
        "We do not insist that the underlying media files be available in all cases, but we hope to identify them when possible.",
        "However, we focus on storage of the annotation; we assume that media files are in a separate store, and referenced by external URIs.",

        "Each file contains information corresponding to some slice of a table, and the structure of the table is encoded in the file format.",
        "On the other hand, web services are often implemented as databases, making an implementation of the abstract model as a database desirable.",
        "A file-based implementation is most familiar, and most existing resources are available as file collections.",
        "However, even when different existing resources have similar semantics, such as different parallel text collections, there is considerable variety in the organization and representation of the information.",
        "In order to work with multiple such sources, a substantial amount of housekeeping is required.",
        "One can view our proposed filestore as a normalized form that removes the diversity that only gets in the way of efficient cross-language processing.",
        "Indeed, our proposed format for analyzed text hews intentionally close to the format used in the CoNLL dependency-parsing shared tasks, which provided a normal form into which data from multiple treebanks was mapped (Buchholz et al., 2006).",
        "When an existing resource is included in the Corpus, we assume that it remains externally available in its original form, but a copy is imported into the Corpus filestore in which every file has been preprocessed into one of a set of simple file formats implementing the model of Figure 1, following a consistent scheme for filenames, with utf8 character encoding, and capturing any available alignment information in an auxiliary table.",
        "Distribution of the Corpus via physical media or download simply involves copying the filestore.",
        "The filestore is organized around material provided by individual data providers, or \"authors,\" and maintains the identity of a data provider's contribution as a distinct intellectual \"work.\"",
        "Works provide an appropriate unit to which to attach edition and rights metadata.",
        "In addition to the filestore, the texts and alignments are imported into a collection of database tables that can be queried efficiently.",

        "We have proposed a normalized filestore model that integrates with current practice on the supply side, where corpora are freestanding works in a variety of formats and multiple editions.",
        "We have also devised a normalized database model which encompasses the desired range of linguistic objects, alignments, and annotations.",
        "Finally, we have argued that this model scales, and enables a view of the Universal Corpus as a vast matrix of aligned and analyzed texts spanning the world's languages, a radical departure from existing resource creation efforts in language documentation and machine translation.",
        "We invite participation by the community in elaborating the design, implementing the storage model, and populating it with data.",
        "Furthermore, we seek collaboration in using such data as the basis for large-scale cross-linguistic analysis and modeling, and in facilitating the creation of easily accessible language resources for the world's languages."
