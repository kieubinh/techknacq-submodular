        "Such systems are vital to bridge the gap between information available and languages known to the user.",
        "Considerable amount of research has been done on building such systems but most of them rely heavily on the language resources and tools developed.",
        "With a constant increase in the number of languages around the world with their content on the web, CLIA systems are in need.",
        "Language independent approach is particularly useful for languages that fall into the category of under-resourced (African, few Asian languages), that doesn't have sufficient resources.",
        "In our approach towards language-independent CLIA system, we have developed context aware query translation using Wikipedia.",
        "Due to voluntary contribution of millions of users, Wikipedia gathers very significant amount of updated knowledge and provides a structured way to access it.",

        "The statistics in the Figure 1 show that it has rich multilingual content and is growing independent of the presence of English counter part.",
        "With its structurally rich content, it provides an ideal platform to perform cross lingual research.",
        "We harness Wikipedia and its structure to replace the language specific resources required for CLIA.",
        "Our work is different from existing approaches in terms of",
        "• No language resource has been used at any stage of query translation.",
        "• Wikipedia structure has been fully utilized for achieving CLIA between English and Hindi, unlike the existing approaches, especially for query formation.",
        "We have constructed a bilingual dictionary using cross lingual links present across the articles of same topic in different languages.",
        "As each word in the dictionary can have several translations based on various attributes like context, sense etc, we need a mechanism to identify the target word accurately based on the context of the query.",
        "To identify the context of a query, \"Content Words\", that are built for each Wikipedia article, are used.",
        "\"Content Words\" of the article are similar to the tags of the article, that reflects the context of the article in a more detailed way.",
        "In this paper, we detail our approach in forming this \"Content Words\" and using them to form the query.",
        "Since our approach is language-independent and context-aware, we used a metric proposed by (Bharadwaj and Varma, 2011) to evaluate along with a dicationary-based metric.",
        "The system is built between languages English and Hindi.",
        "Hindi is selected as target language because of the availability of resources for evaluation.",

        "We discuss the related work of the two stages are involved in our system of language-independent context aware query translation,",
        "• Resource building/ collection (Dictionaries in our case)",
        "• Query formation",
        "Dictionary building can be broadly classified into two approaches, manual and automatic.",
        "At initial stages, various projects like (Breen, 2004) try to build dictionaries manually, taking lot of time and effort.",
        "Though manual approaches perform well, they lag behind when recent vocabulary is considered.",
        "To reduce the effort involved, automatic extraction of dictionaries has been envisioned.",
        "The approach followed by (Kay and Roscheisen, 1999) and (Brown et al., 1990) were towards statistical machine translation, that can also be applied to dictionary building.",
        "The major requirement for using statistical methods is the availability of bilingual parallel corpora, that again is limited for under-resourced languages.",
        "Factors like sentence structure, grammatical differences, availability of language resources and the amount of parallel corpus available further hamper the recall and coverage of the dictionaries extracted.",
        "After parallel corpora, attempts have been made to construct bilingual dictionaries using various types of corpora like comparable corpus (Sadat et al., 2003) and noisy parallel corpus (Fung and McKeown, 1997).",
        "Though there exist various approaches, most of them make use of the language resources.",
        "Wikipedia has also been used to mine dictionaries.",
        "(Tyers and Pienaar, 2008), (Erdmann et al., 2008), (Erdmann et al., 2009) have built bilingual dictionaries using Wikipedia and language resources.",
        "We have mined our dictionaries similarly considering the cross lingual links present.",
        "Our approach to dictionary building is detailed in section 3.",
        "Wikipedia has been used for CLIA at various stages including query formation.",
        "Most recently, Wikipedia structure has been exploited in (Gaillard et al., 2010) for query translation and disambiguation.",
        "In (Schonhofen et al., 2008), Wikipedia has been exploited at all the stages of building a CLIA system.",
        "We tread the same path of (Schonhofen et al., 2008) in harnessing Wikipedia for dictionary building and query formation.",
        "Similar to them we extract concept words for each Wikipedia article and use them to disambiguate and form the query.",
        "For evaluation purposes, we adapted evaluation measures based on Wikipedia and existing dictionaries (Bharadwaj and Varma, 2011).",
        "The authors have proposed a classification based technique, using Wikipedia article and the inter-language links present between them to classify the sentences as parallel or non-parallel based on the context of the sentences rather than at the syntactic level.",
        "We adopt a similar classification based technique and build feature vectors for classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM ) for evaluation."

        "The motivation for considering the other structural information of the Wikipedia article is to increase vocabulary of the dictionary both in terms of the number of words and categories of words.",
        "Titles, Infobox and Categories of the article consider only named entities that are used in the language.",
        "To increase the coverage of the dictionary and also to include other categories of words (like negations, quantifiers etc), abstract of the article is considered.",
        "Also the Inter language links between the articles are assumed to be bidirectional even if they are unidirectional.",

        "\"Content Words\" are formed from each of these structural aspects.",

        "\"Content Words\" for the Hindi articles are also formed similarly.",
        "The formation of \"Content Words\" is similar to tagging but is not a stricly tagging mechanism as we have no constraint on the number of tags.",
        "Category alone can help to get the context but considering in-links, out-links, subsections will increase the depth of context words and will reduce the information lost by tagging the words.",
        "Query formation of our system depends on the context words built.",
        "For an English query (qE) that contains the words wE (i: 0 to n),",
        "• Build WH of size m, that contains the words returned by the dictionary for each of the words.",
        "• For all words in (qE), extract all the articles ak(k: 0 to n) with wE as one of its context word.",
        "• Form the corresponding Hindi set of articles Ah",
        "using the cross lingual link, if present in the English article set constructed in the above step.",
        "• For each Hindi word wH (j : 0 to m), add it to Hindi query ( qH) if at least one of the articles ai (with wH as its context word) is present in",
        "Ah.",
        "This approach helps to identify the context of the query as each query is represented by a set of articles instead of query words, that forms the concepts that the query can be interpreted to limited to Wikipedia domain.",
