        "Demonstrating that distributional semantics is a semantic model of natural language is a real research challenge in natural language processing.",
        "Frege's principle of compositionality (Frege, 1884), naturally taken into account in logic-based semantic models of natural language (Montague, 1974), is hardly effectively included in distributional semantics models.",
        "These models should compositionally derive distributional vectors for sentences and phrases from the distributional vectors of the composing words.",
        "Besides vector averaging (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Foltz et al., 1998), that can model distributional meaning of sentences, recent distributional compositional models focus on finding distributional vectors of word pairs (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Guevara, 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Zanzotto et al., 2010).",
        "Scaling up these 2-word sequence models to the sentence level is not trivial as syntactic structure of sentences plays a very important role.",
        "Understanding the relation between the structure and the meaning is needed for building distributional compositional models for sentences.",
        "Research in Distributed Representations (DR) (Hinton et al., 1986) proposed models and methods for encoding data structures in vectors, matrices, or high-order tensors.",
        "Distributed Representations are oriented to preserve the structural information in the final representation.",
        "For this purpose, DR models generally use random and possibly orthogonal vectors for words and structural elements (Plate, 1994).",
        "As distributional semantics vectors are unlikely to be orthogonal, syntactic structure of sentences may be easily lost in the final vector combination.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the interaction between distributed structure and distributional meaning by proposing a model to encode syntactic trees in distributed structures and by exploiting this model in kernel machines (Vapnik, 1995) to determine the similarity between syntactic trees.",
        "We propose a pure distributed tree (DT) and a distributional distributed tree (DDT).",
        "In line with the distributed representation theory, DTs use random vectors for representing words whereas DDTs use distributional vectors for words.",
        "Our interest is in understanding if the introduction of distributional semantic information in an inherently syntactic based model, such as distributed representations, leads to better performances in semantic aware tasks.",
        "DTs and DDTs are exploited for defining distributed tree kernels (DTKs) and distributional distributed tree kernels (DDTKs).",
        "We study the interaction between structure and meaning in two ways: 1) by comparing DTKs and DDTKs with the classical tree similarity functions, i.e., the tree kernels TK (Collins and Duffy, 2002); 2) by comparing the accuracy of DTKs and DDTKs in a semantic task such as recognizing textual entailment (RTE).",
        "Results show that DTKs correlate with TKs and perform in RTE better than DDTKs.",
        "This indicates that including distributional vectors in distributed structures should be performed in a more complex fashion."

        "Vectors of basic elements (words, or concepts) can be randomly generated (e.g. (Anderson, 1973; Murdock, 1983)) or, instead, they may represent their attributes and can be manually built (e.g. (McRae et al., 1997; Andrews et al., 2009)).",
        "Vectors, matrices, or tensors for structures are compositionally derived using vectors for basic elements.",
        "Good compositionally obtained vectors for structures are explicit and immediately accessible: information stored in a distributed representation should be easily accessible with simple operations (Plate, 1994).",
        "Circular convolution in Holographic Reduced Representations (HRRs) (Plate, 1994) is designed to satisfy the immediate accessibility property.",
        "It supports two operations for producing and accessing the compact representations: the circular convolution and the correlation.",
        "Given that component vectors are obtained randomly (as in (Anderson, 1973; Murdock, 1983)), correlation is the inverse of composition.",

        "An appropriate size for the LSA reduction was deemed to be 250.",
        "Thus, in the experiments we used 250 dimensions both for distributional and random vectors, to allow a correct comparison between DTK and DDTK models.",
