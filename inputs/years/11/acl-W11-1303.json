        "Mutual information (Shannon and Weaver, 1949) is a measure of mutual dependence between two random variables.",
        "The measure - and more specifically its instantiation for specific outcomes called point-wise mutual information (PMI) - has proven to be a useful association measure in numerous natural language processing applications.",
        "Since its introduction into the NLP community (Church and Hanks, 1990), it has been used in order to tackle or improve upon several NLP problems, including collocation extraction (ibid.)",
        "and word space models (Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "In its original form, it is restricted to the analysis of two-way co-occurrences.",
        "NLP problems, however, need not be restricted to two-way co-occurrences; often, a particular problem can be more naturally tackled when formulated as a multi-way problem.",
        "Notably, the framework of tensor decomposition, that has recently permeated into the NLP community (Turney, 2007; Ba-roni and Lenci, 2010; Giesbrecht, 2010; Van de Cruys, 2010), analyzes language issues as multi-way co-occurrences.",
        "Up till now, little attention has been devoted to the weighting of such multi-way cooccurrences (which, for the research cited above, results either in using no weighting at all, or in applying an ad-hoc weighting solution without any theoretical underpinnings).",
        "In this paper, we explore two possible generalizations of pointwise mutual information for multi-way co-occurrences from a theoretical point of view.",
        "In section 2, we discuss some relevant related work, mainly in the field of information theory.",
        "In section 3 the two generalizations of PMI are laid out in more detail, based on their global multivariate counterparts.",
        "Section 4 then discusses some applications in the light of NLP, while section 5 concludes and hints at some directions for future research."

        "In this paper, we presented two multivariate generalizations of mutual information, as well as their instantiated counterparts specific interaction information and specific correlation, that are useful for weighting multi-way co-occurrences in NLP tasks.",
        "The main goal of this paper is to show that there is not just one straightforward generalization of point-wise mutual information for the multivariate case, and NLP researchers that want to exploit multi-way co-occurrences in an information-theoretic framework should take this fact into account.",
        "Moreover, we have applied the two different measures to the extraction of subject verb object triples, and demonstrated that the results may differ significantly.",
        "It goes without saying that these are just exploratory and rudimentary observations; more research into the exact nature of both generalizations and their repercussions for NLP - as well as a proper quantitative evaluation - are imperative.",
        "This brings us to some avenues for future work.",
        "More research needs to be carried with regard to the exact nature of the dependencies that both measures capture.",
        "Preliminary results show that they extract different information, but it is not clear what the exact nature of that information is.",
        "Secondly, we want to carry out a proper quantitative evaluation on different multi-way co-occurrence (factorization) tasks, in order to indicate which measure works best, and which measure might be more suitable for a particular task."
