        "Any NLP system that does semantic processing relies on the assumption of semantic compositionality: the meaning of a phrase is determined by the meanings of its parts and their combination.",
        "However, this assumption does not hold for lexicalized phrases such as idiomatic expressions, which causes troubles not only for semantic, but also for syntactic processing (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "In particular, while distributional methods in semantics have proved to be very efficient in tackling a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, e.g., document retrieval, clustering and classification, question answering, query expansion, word similarity, synonym extraction, relation extraction, textual advertisement matching in search engines, etc.",
        "(see Turney and Pantel (2010) for a detailed overview), they are still strongly limited by being inherently word-based.",
        "While dictionaries and other lexical resources contain multiword entries, these are expensive to obtain and not available for all languages to a sufficient extent.",
        "Furthermore, the definition of a multiword varies across resources, and non-compositional phrases are often merely a subclass of multiword units.",
        "This shared task addressed researchers that are interested in extracting non-compositional phrases from large corpora by applying distributional models that assign a graded compositionality score to a phrase, as well as researchers interested in expressing compositional meaning with such models.",
        "The score denotes the extent to which the composition-ality assumption holds for a given expression.",
        "The latter can be used, for example, to decide whether the phrase should be treated as a single unit in applications.",
        "We emphasized that the focus is on automatically acquiring semantic compositionality and explicitly did not invite approaches that employ prefabricated lists of non-compositional phrases.",
        "It is often the case that compositionality of a phrase depends on the context.",
        "Though we have used a sentence context in the process of constructing the gold standard, we have decided not to provide it with the dataset: we have asked for a single compositionality score per phrase.",
        "In an application, this could play the role of a compositional-ity prior that could, e.g., be stored in a dictionary.",
        "There is a long-living tradition within the research community working on multiword units (MWUs) to automatically classify MWUs into either compositional or non-compositional ones.",
        "However, it has been often noted that compositionality comes in degrees, and a binary classification is not valid enough in many cases (Bannard et al., 2003; Katz and Gies-brecht, 2006).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this has been the first attempt to offer a dataset and a shared task that allows to explicitly evaluate the models of graded compositionality."

      "heading": "2. Shared Task Description",
      "text": [
        "For the shared task, we aimed to get composition-ality scores for phrases frequently occurring in corpora.",
        "Since distributional models need large corpora to perform reliable statistics, and these statistics are more reliable for frequent items, we chose to restrict the candidate set to the most frequent phrases from the freely available WaCky web corpora (Baroni et al., 2009).",
        "Those are currently downloadable for English, French, German and Italian.",
        "They have already been automatically sentence-split, tokenized, part-of-speech (POS) tagged and lemmatized, which reduces the load on both organizers and participants that decide to make use of these corpora.",
        "Further, WaCky corpora provide a good starting point for experimenting with distributional models due to their size, ranging between 1-2 billion tokens, and extensive efforts to make these corpora as clean as possible.",
        "There is a wide range of subsentential units that can function as a non-compositional construction.",
        "These units do not have to be realized continuously in the surface realization and can consist of an arbitrary number of lexical items.",
        "While it would be interesting to examine unrestricted forms of multiwords and compositional phrases, we decided to restrict candidate selection to certain grammatical constructions to make the task more tangible.",
        "Specifically, we use word pairs in the following relations:",
        "• ADJJNN: Adjective modifying a noun, e.g. \"red herring\" or \"blue skies\"",
        "• V_SUBJ: Noun in subject position and verb, e..g. \"flies fly\" or \"people transfer (sth.)\"",
        "• V_OBJ: Noun in object position and verb, e.g. \"lose keys\", \"play song\"",
        "While it is possible to extract the relations fairly accurately from parsed English text, there is - to our knowledge - no reliable, freely available method that can tell verb-subjects from verb-objects for German.",
        "Thus, we employed a three-step selection procedure for producing a set of candidate phrases per grammatical relation and language that involved heavy manual intervention.",
        "1.",
        "Extract candidates using (possibly overgenerating) patterns over part-of-speech sequences and sort by frequency",
        "2.",
        "Manually select plausible candidates for the target grammatical relation in order of decreasing frequency",
        "3.",
        "Balance the candidate set to select enough non-compositional phrases",
        "For English, we used the following POS patterns: ADJJNN: \"JJ* NN*\"; VSUBJ: \"NN* VV*\"; V_OBJ: \"VV* DT|CD NN*\" and \"VV* NN*\".",
        "The star * denotes continuation of tag labels: e.g. VV* matches all tags starting with \"VV\", such as VV, VVD, VVG, VVN, VVP and VVZ.",
        "For German, we used \"ADJ* NN*\" for ADJJNN.",
        "For relations involving nouns and verbs, we extracted all noun-verb pairs in a window of 4 tokens and manually filtered by relation on the aggregated frequency list.",
        "Frequencies were computed on the lemma forms.",
        "This introduces a bias on the possible constructions that realize the target relations, especially for the verb-noun pairs.",
        "Further, the selection procedure is biased by the intuition of the person that performs the selection.",
        "We only admitted what we thought were clear-cut cases (only nouns that are typically found in subject respectively object position) to the candidate set at this stage.",
        "Since non-compositional phrases are much less in numbers than compositional phrases, we tried to somewhat balance this in the third step in the selection.",
        "If the candidates would have been randomly selected, an overwhelming number ofcompositional phrases would have rendered the task very hard to evaluate, since a baseline system predicting high compositionality in all cases would have achieved a very high score.",
        "We argue that since we are especially interested in non-compositional phrases in this competition, it is valid to bias the dataset in this way.",
        "After we collected a candidate list, we randomly selected seven sentences per candidate from the corpus.",
        "Through manual filtering, we checked whether the target word pair was in fact found in the target relation in these sentences.",
        "Further we removed incomplete and too long sentences, so that we ended up with five sentences per target phrase.",
        "Some candidate phrases that only occurred in very fixed contexts (e.g. disclaimers) or did not have enough well-formed sentences were removed in this step.",
        "The sample usages of target phrases now had to be annotated for compositionality.",
        "We employed the crowdsourcing service Amazon Turk for realizing these annotations.",
        "The advantage of crowdsourc-ing is its scalability through the large numbers of workers that are ready to perform small tasks for pay.",
        "The disadvantage is that tasks usually cannot be very complex, since quality issues (scammers) have to be addressed either with test items or redundancy or both - mechanisms that only work for types of tasks where there is clearly a correct answer.",
        "Previous experiences in constructing linguistic annotations with Amazon Turk (Biemann and Ny-gaard, 2010) made us stick to the following two-step procedure that more or less ensured the quality of annotation by hand-picking workers:",
        "1.",
        "Gather high quality workers: In an open task for a small data sample with unquestionable decisions, we collected annotations from a large number of workers.",
        "Workers were asked to provide reasons for their decisions.",
        "Workers that performed well, gave reasons that demonstrated their understanding of the task and completed a significant amount of the examples were invited for a closed task.",
        "Net pay was 2 US cents for completing a HIT.",
        "2.",
        "Get annotations for the real task: In the closed task, only invited workers were admitted and redundancy was reduced to four workers per HIT.",
        "Net pay was 3 US cents for completing a HIT.",
        "Figure 2 shows a sample HIT (human intelligence task) for English on Amazon turk, including instructions.",
        "Workers were asked to enter a judgment from 0-10 about the literacy of the highlighted target phrase in the respective context.",
        "For the German data, we used an equivalent task definition in German.",
        "All five contexts per target phrase were scored by four workers each.",
        "A few items were identified as problematic by the workers (e.g. missing highlighting, too little context), and one worker was excluded during the English experiment for starting to deliberately scam.",
        "For this worker, all judgments were removed and not repeated.",
        "Thus, the standard number of judgments per target phrase was 20, with some targets receiving less judgments because of these problems.",
        "The minimum number of judgments per target phrase was 12: four HITs with three judgments each.",
        "From this, we computed a score by averaging over all judgments per phrase and multiplying the overall score by 10 to get scores in the range of 0-100.",
        "This score cannot help in discriminating moderately compositional phrases like \"V_OBJ: make decision\" from phrases that are dependent on the context like \"V_OBJ: wait minute\" which had two HITs for the idiomatic use of \"wait a minute!\"",
        "and three HITs with literally minutes to spend idling.",
        "As each HIT was annotated by a possibly different set of workers, it is not possible to compute inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Eyeballing the scores revealed that some workers generally tend to give higher respectively lower scores than others.",
        "Overall, workers agreed more for clearly compositional or clearly non-compositional HITs.",
        "We believe that using this comparatively high number of judgments per target, averaged over several contexts, should give us fairly reliable judgments, as worker biases should cancel out each other.",

        "The opportunity to evaluate language-independent models for languages other than English was unfortunately not taken up by most participants.",
        "The teams applied a variety of approaches that can be classified into lexical association measures and word space models of various flavors.",
        "From the evaluation, it is hard to decide what method is currently more suited for the task of automatic acquisition of compositionality, with a slight favor for approaches based on word space model.",
        "A takeaway message is that a pure corpus-based acquisition of graded compositionality is a hard task.",
        "While some approaches clearly outperform baselines, further advances are needed for automatic systems to be able to reproduce semantic composition-ality."
