        "In the field of computational semantics, to represent the meaning of a compound word, two mechanisms are commonly used.",
        "One is based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) and the other is on the principle of semantic compositionality (Partee, 1995, p. 313).",
        "The distributional hypothesis (DH) states that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "Using this hypothesis, distributional models like the Word-space model (WSM, Sahlgren, 2006) represent a target word's meaning as a context vector (location in space).",
        "The similarity between two meanings is the closeness (proximity) between the vectors.",
        "The context vector of a target word is built from its distributional behaviour observed in a corpus.",
        "Similarly, the context vector of a compound word can be built by treating the compound as a single word.",
        "We refer to such a vector as a DH-based vector.",
        "The other mechanism is based on the principle of semantic compositionality (PSC) which states that the meaning of a compound word is a function of, and only of, the meaning of its parts and the way in which the parts are combined.",
        "If the meaning of a part is represented in a WSM using the distributional hypothesis, then the principle can be applied to compose the distributional behaviour of a compound word from its parts without actually using the corpus instances of the compound.",
        "We refer to this as a PSC-based vector.",
        "So a PSC-based is composed of component DH-based vectors.",
        "Both of these two mechanisms are capable of determining the meaning vector of a compound word.",
        "For a given compound, if a DH-based vector and a PSC-based vector of the compound are projected into an identical space, one would expect the vectors to occupy the same location i.e. both the vectors should be nearly the same.",
        "However the principle of semantic compositionality does not hold for non-compositional compounds, which is actually what the existing WSMs of compositionality detection exploit (Giesbrecht, 2009; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001).",
        "The DH-based and PSC-based vectors are expected to have high similarity when a compound is compositional and low similarity for non-compositional compounds.",
        "Most methods in WSM (Turney and Pantel, 2010) represent a word as a single context vector built from merging all its corpus instances.",
        "Such a representation is called the prototype-based modelling (Murphy, 2002).",
        "These prototype-based vectors do not distinguish the instances according to the senses of a target word.",
        "Since most compounds are less ambiguous than single words, there is less need for distinguishing instances in a DH-based prototype vector of a compound and we do not address that here but leave ambiguity of compounds for future work.",
        "However the constituent words of the compound are more ambiguous.",
        "When DH-based vectors of the constituent words are used for composing the PSC-based vector of the compound, the resulting vector may contain instances, and therefore contexts, that are not relevant for the given compound.",
        "These noisy contexts effect the similarity between the PSC-based vector and the DH-based vector of the compound.",
        "Basing compositionality judgements on a such a noisy similarity value is no longer reliable.",
        "In this paper, we address this problem of polysemy of constituent words of a compound using an exemplar-based modelling (Smith and Medin, 1981).",
        "In exemplar-based modelling of WSM (Erk and Pado, 2010), each word is represented by all its corpus instances (exemplars) without merging them into a single vector.",
        "Depending upon the purpose, only relevant exemplars of the target word are activated and then these are merged to form a refined prototype-vector which is less-noisy compared to the original prototype-vector.",
        "Exemplar-based models are more powerful than prototype-based ones because they retain specific instance information.",
        "We have evaluated our models on the validation data released in the shared task (Biemann and Gies-brecht, 2011).",
        "Based on the validation results, we have chosen three systems for public evaluation and participated in the shared task (Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011)."

        "Firstly, given a compound w\\ w2, we build its DH-based prototype vector VW1W2 from all its exemplars EW1W2.",
        "Secondly, we remove irrelevant exemplars in EW1and EW2 of constituent words and build the refined prototype vectors Vwr and Vwr of the constituent words w\\ and w2 respectively.",
        "These refined vectors are used to compose the PSC-based vectors of the compound.",
        "Related work to ours is (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010) where exemplars of a word are first clustered and then prototype vectors are built.",
        "This work does not relate to compositionality but to measuring semantic similarity of single words.",
        "As such, their clusters are not influenced by other words whereas in our approach for detecting composition-ality, the other constituent word plays a major role.",
        "We use the compositionality functions, simple addition and simple multiplication to build V«[+wj and V«[ xiuj respectively.",
        "Based on the similarities sim(VWlW2, Vwr ), sim(VWlW2 , Vw; ), sim(VWiW2, Vwi+w2) and sim( VwiW2, Vwi x W ) , wedecide if the compound is compositional or non-compositional.",
        "These steps are described in a little more detail below.",
        "We aim to remove irrelevant exemplars of one constituent word with the help of the other constituent word's distributional behaviour.",
        "For example, let us take the compound traffic light.",
        "Light occurs in many contexts such as quantum theory, optics, lamps and spiritual theory.",
        "In ukWaC, light has 316,126 instances.",
        "Not all these exemplars are relevant to compose the PSC-based vector of traffic light.",
        "These irrelevant exemplars increases the semantic differences between traffic light and light and thus increase the differences between Vraffic©lightand Vraffic light.",
        "sim(Might, Vraffic light) is found to be 0.27.",
        "Our intuition and motivation for exemplar removal is that it is beneficiary to choose only the exemplars of light which share similar contexts of traffic since traffic light should have contexts similar to both traffic and light if it is compositional.",
        "We rank each exemplar of light based on common co-occurrences of traffic and also words which are distributionally similar to traffic.",
        "Co-occurrences of traffic are the context words which frequently occur with traffic, e.g. car, road etc.",
        "Using these, the exemplar from a sentence such as \"Cameras capture cars running red lights ...\" will be ranked higher than one which does not have contexts related to traffic.",
        "The distributionally similar words to traffic are the words (like synonyms, antonyms) which are similar to traffic in that they occur in similar contexts, e.g. transport, flow etc.",
        "Using these distri-butionally similar words helps reduce the impact of data sparseness and helps prioritise contexts of traffic which are semantically related.",

        "This similarity is observed to be greatest using just 2286 (less than 1%) of the total exemplars of light.",
        "After exemplar removal, sim(Vlightr, Vtraffic light) increased to 0.47 from the initial value of 0.27.",
        "Though n is chosen by maximising similarity, which is not desirable for non-compositional compounds, the lack of similarity will give the strongest possible indication that a compound is not compositional.",

        "These weights differ from compound to compound.",
