        "They boil down the QG from paragraphs task into first identifying the sentences in the paragraph with general, medium and specific scopes and then generating the corresponding questions from these sentences using semantic roles of predicates.",

        "So in this work, instead of identifying discourse relations and generating questions using them, we explore the usefulness of discourse connectives for QG.",
        "We do this by analyzing the senses of the connectives that help in QG and propose a system that makes use of this analysis to generate questions of the type why, when, give an example and yes/no.",
