        "Narrative exercises (also called word problems or story problems) are mathematical exercises embedded in a story or text.",
        "They are commonly used as test items, to assess or train a student's understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.",
        "When solving a narrative exercise, the student is required to derive the underlying mathematical question from the story and to calculate the correct answer to this mathematical problem.",
        "This paper presents Genpex, a system for generating narrative exercises expressing probability problems.",
        "Genpex was created in the context of an international project on item generation for testing student competencies in solving probability problems.",
        "Automatic item generation is an effective way of constructing many items with controlled difficulties, based on a set of predefined task parameters (Enright et al., 2002; Deane and Sheehan, 2003; Arendasy et al., 2006; Holling et al., 2009).",
        "The goal of our item generation project is to develop a model to support optimal problem and test construction.",
        "A large collection of narrative exercises is needed to test the developed models in field trials.",
        "All of these narrative exercises should be different, but the properties that define the difficulty of the exercise should be known.",
        "Genpex was designed to enable easy creation of new exercises meeting these requirements.",
        "Figure 1 shows a narrative probability exercise generated by Genpex.",
        "The text of the exercise is in German, because the target group of our project are German high school students.",
        "The texts produced by Genpex are based on a set of example narrative exercises that were created earlier within the project (Zeuch, In preparation).",
        "A property that sets Genpex apart from other narrative exercise generation systems is that it was specifically designed to support variation in the generated exercises.",
        "Unlike other systems, it not only changes the context of the narrative exercise (e.g., instead of bikes, the example exercise could also have been about hotel rooms with different properties) but it also varies the way the texts are formulated.",

        "Figure 2 presents the probability problem underlying the narrative exercise of Figure 1.",
        "It specifies the context, the total number of entities (numEntities), and the distribution of (combinations of) attribute values over the entities.",
        "Number information may be suppressed so as not to give the answer away; this is done by inserting a question mark in the place of the number (e.g., colour[green] = ?).",
        "Explicitly listing such 'hidden' information in the probability problem ensures that all possible values of each attribute are mentioned in the text of the exercise.",
        "A basic assumption in creating the probability problems is that all entities have exactly one value for each attribute.",
        "For example, all bikes must have some colour, and they cannot have two colours at the same time.",
        "In addition to the number statements, the probability problem also lists which pairs of attributes are dependent on each other.",
        "In the example, these are type and price.",
        "This means that if we look at the subset of bikes of a specific type, the probability that one of these bikes has a certain price is not the same as when we look at the entire collection of bikes (and vice versa).",
        "If a pair of attributes is not specified as being dependent, it is independent.",
        "Q delineates the question part of the probability problem; we refer to the other parts (except Context) as 'statements'.",
        "All questions require the calculation of a probability.",
        "A question of the form Q: P(A) asks for the probability of event A, which can be described as \"Someone randomly draws one entity out of a (sub)set of entities and this entity has property A\".",
        "For example, the question could be to calculate the probability that a bike is black if we randomly pick one bike from the set of all bikes.",
        "We equate the probability of event A with the relative frequency of the set A of objects that satisfy property A, computed as |A|/|U|, where U is the set of all entities (that is, |U| = numEntities).",
        "In general, the set we draw from is the entire set of entities, but this set can be limited by a conditional statement: the event A|B can be described as \"Someone randomly draws one entity with property A from a subset of entities that have property B\".",
        "In this case, the",
        "Context: bikes numEntities: 100 dependentAttributes: price & type Q: P( – (type[mountainbike] A colour[green])) Q: P(price[<500] V type[sportsbike])",
        "probability P(A|B) is computed as | AnB|/|B|.",
        "All events involve a single draw of exactly one entity.",
        "Probability problems such as the one in Figure 2 are automatically created by Genpex; the only thing the user has to do is to select one or more question types (defining the difficulty of the exercise) and a context for the exercise.",
        "All available question types are of the form P(A) or P(A| B), where A (but not B) can be a complex event, i.e., involving a conjunction or disjunction of properties.",
        "For example, Q: P(A A B) asks for the probability that an entity has both property A and property B.",
        "Moreover, parts of a question can be negated.",
        "Currently, Genpex can handle 25 different question types.",
        "Some restrictions we put on the available questions are the following.",
        "Each question involves at most two different attributes, to avoid complex dependencies.",
        "There are no recursive questions (e.g., double negations) and no conditional questions about independent attributes.",
        "Finally, we exclude questions that are likely to result in ambiguous language.",
        "For example, if we try to express the question Q: P( – (colour[white]) A type[sportsbike]) in English, it will be something like \"What is the probability that a bike is not white and a road bike?\".",
        "Due to scope ambiguity of the negation, this sentence may be misinterpreted as \"What is the probability that a bike is not white and also not a road bike?\".",
        "The same ambiguity is found in the German sentence expressing this question.",
        "Excluding these types of questions does not simplify the task for Genpex; the excluded questions are not more difficult to generate than the included ones.",
        "The main reason to exclude certain question types was to avoid creating exercises that might be unclear to the reader.",
        "In addition to selecting one or more question types as input for Genpex, the user also selects a context for the exercise.",
        "As a resource, Genpex uses a repository of context files with information concerning the entities that the exercise should be about ('bikes' in our example) and the properties they may have.",
        "Each attribute in the context file is linked to a lexical lemma for the word that expresses its relation to the entity (e.g., bikes are of a certain colour or type but have a certain price).",
        "Similarly, for each attribute, a list of possible attribute values and the words expressing them is provided.",
        "For example, the type attribute in the bikes context can have the values 'mountainbike', 'sportsbike', 'hollandbike' and 'seniorbike', respectively associated with the words \"Mountainbike\" (mountain bike), \"Rennrad\" (road bike), \"Hollandrad\" (Dutch bike) and \"Seniorenrad\" (senior bike).",
        "Other NLG-related information in the context files is discussed in Section 3.",
        "The context file also specifies world knowledge such as the range of numEntities (a context about rooms in a hotel will involve fewer entities than a context about books in a bookshop) and possible dependencies between attributes (in the bikes context, price is more likely to be dependent on type than on colour).",
        "Taking the selected question type(s) and context as input, Genpex automatically constructs a probability problem.",
        "This involves selecting a number of attributes and values, depending on the question or questions that need to be answered, and creating a correct and complete world: an internal representation of the situation in which all entities are fully defined (all their properties are known), and there are no inconsistencies.",
        "A part of this world is reflected in the statements of the probability problem.",
        "Currently, all statements provide information that is",
        "valent version of the same question: Q: P(type[sportsbike] A – (colour[white])).",
        "Because the generated questions follow the order of the attributes in the question specification, this version can be expressed without ambiguity as \"What is the probability that a bike is a road bike and not white?\"",
        "required to solve the exercise; redundant information is not included.",
        "If the user manually edits the generated probability problem, Genpex reconstructs the world, and tries to solve the exercise using the information in the edited problem.",
        "The user is warned in case of inconsistencies or missing information.",
        "A warning is also issued if the edited problem contains properties for which no lexical information is available.",

        "In German, adjectivication may cause the inflection of the adjective to change, because it gets a different grammatical role: when used as a modifier its inflection reflects the gender and case of the noun it modifies.",

        "Ellipsis.",
        "This is the removal of duplicate words from sentences, which typically applies to aggregated sentences (Harbusch and Kempen, 2009).",
        "Genpex can apply different types of ellipsis, such as Gapping and Conjunction Reduction.",
        "Gapping is the removal of all except the first verb in an aggregated sentence.",
        "An example from Figure 1 is the sentence \"70 Fahrrader sind billiger als 500 Euro und 30 Fahrrader teurer als 500 Euro\" (70 bicycles are less expensive than 500 Euros and 30 bicycles more expensive than 500 Euros), where the verb \"sind\" (are) has been deleted from the second clause.",
        "(Forward) Conjunction Reduction deletes the subject of subsequent clauses if it is identical to the subject of the first clause.",
        "The following sentence is an example: \"40 Fahrrader sind Mountainbikes und 50 sind Rennrader\" (40 bicycles are mountain bikes and 50 are road bikes).",
        "It is possible to combine Gapping and Conjunction Reduction, e.g., \"40 Fahrrader sind Mountainbikes und 50 Rennrader\" (40 bicycles are mountain bikes and 50 road bikes).",
        "Ellipsis is also possible in sentences with marked word order.",
        "For example, \"Grün sind 30 Fahrrader und weiß sind 40 Fahrrader\"(Green are 30 bicycles and white are 40 bicycles) could be reduced to \"Grün sind 30 Fahrrader und weiß sind 40\" (Green are 30 bicycles and white are 40).",
        "However, in this sentence, the verb cannot be removed from the last clause.",
        "Genpex currently allows aggregated sentences in which some of the clauses have marked word order.",
        "In these cases, ellipsis is not applied, because it will most likely result in grammatically incorrect sentences.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"30 Fahrrader sind grün und Weiß sind 40 Fahrrader\" (30 bicycles are green and white are 40 bicycles) the system will not apply ellipsis.",
        "For every sentence in the document plan, the system will check which of the variation techniques described above can be applied to it, by analyzing the structure of the sentence tree.",
        "If a technique is in principle applicable, the probability of it being actually applied depends on information in the context file, and on parameters set by the user through the GUI of Genpex.",
        "For every attribute in the context file, the author of the file can prevent Genpex from applying a specific technique by giving it a probability of 0, if it is never suitable in the case of this specific attribute.",
        "For example, applying marked word order to a sentence expressing the 'type' attribute in the bikes context would lead to odd sentences such as \"Mountainbikes sind 40 Fahrrader\" (Mountain-bikes are 40 bicycles).",
        "Though grammatically correct, such sentences would be hard to interpret and therefore are best avoided.",
        "During generation, the user can directly influence the probability that certain variations are applied through sliders in the GUI; see Figure 5.",
        "The probability holds for every sentence that satisfies the structural requirements of the variation technique in question, unless the technique is excluded based on the information in the context file, as explained above.",
        "After having set the variation probabilities, the user can click 'Update Text' to see the effect.",

        "students are future work, but we did carry out some preliminary, qualitative evaluations with a few native speakers of German (including one item generation expert) to test the grammaticality and understandability of the generated exercises.",
        "This revealed some small mistakes that have since been corrected, but also a few bigger problems with some of the variation techniques and other NLG aspects.",
        "One of the things noted by the native speakers was that applying ellipsis sometimes leads to slightly unnatural sentences.",
        "The preferred type and degree of ellipsis is different for each type of sentence, but this is not taken into account by Genpex.",
        "As a consequence, the system frequently applies too much or too little ellipsis to the generated sentences, with less than ideal (though not ungrammatical) results.",
        "The existence of such preferred formulations is in line with the results of Cahill and Forst (2010), who carried out an experiment in which native speakers of",
        "German evaluated a number of alternative realisations of the same sentence.",
        "Their subjects accepted some variation in word order, but showed a clear preference for some of the alternatives.",
        "Some of the generated question sentences also sounded a bit forced to the native speakers.",
        "For example, the question template for joint probabilities (AAB) uses the formal phrasing \"sowohl... als auch\" (both ... and), whereas a simple \"und\" (and) would be the more natural choice for most questions.",
        "However, in some question contexts, in particular those involving negations, using the simpler formulation might lead to the kind of scope ambiguities mentioned in Section 2.",
        "Therefore, the choice was made to use \"sowohl... als auch\" in all cases, even in those where it is not strictly necessary.",
        "Similarly, questions asking for a conditional probability were found to be somewhat difficult to understand.",
        "For these questions, readability might be improved by using two sentences to express them, along the lines of \"Consider the set of bicycles that are not mountain bikes.",
        "What is the probability that one of those bicycles is either black or white?\"",
        "as an alternative to the more complex formulation given in Figure 4.",
        "The comments by the native speakers suggest that in some cases, Genpex goes too far in its \"one size fits all\" approach, and that we should try to add more flexibility to the NLG component, allowing it to make finer distinctions in the application of variation techniques to specific sentences and of question templates to specific question types."

        "The texts currently being generated by Genpex are grammatical, but our native speakers reported that some sentences had to be studied carefully before it was possible to get the information needed to solve the problem.",
        "No actual misinterpretations occurred, but the increased reading time (as compared to more preferred formulations) may still increase the difficulty of the exercise.",
        "A thorough investigation into the effect of textual variations on item difficulty is therefore necessary.",
        "Genpex supports this type of research by enabling the systematic application of different variations, while logging all textual operations that have been applied and saving them together with the generated text.",
        "The underlying probability problem is saved together with the text as well, so all factors that certainly or potentially influence item difficulty are known.",
        "This makes it relatively easy to test the influence of those factors on the difficulty of the exercise, for example by carrying out the kind of statistical and cognitive analysis advocated by Graf et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "The effect of the main parameters of the probability problems in Genpex (i.e., the type of question being asked) was already statistically analyzed by Holling et al.",
        "(2009) and Zeuch (In preparation).",
        "They used automatically generated items similar to the exercises generated by Genpex, except that their exercises did not have variations in wording apart from context-related ones.",
        "Also, the exercises used by Holling et al.",
        "(2009) mentioned probabilities instead of counts in the statements.",
        "Once we know more about the effects of the textual variations, Genpex can be of great value to test developers, given that there exists a great need for large amounts of learning and assessment materials with a controlled level of difficulty (Enright et al., 2002; Fairon and Williamson, 2002; Deane and Sheehan, 2003; Arendasy et al., 2006; Holling et al., and testing of the system is a one-time investment, which we expect will pay off afterward when large amounts of test items can be created with little effort.",
        "In particular, we think Genpex can be very useful in combination with Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT).",
        "The system could be used for on-the-fly generation of new items for each individual student, adapted to that student's skill level estimated from his or her previous answers.",
        "Because every student gets custom exercises, the risk of frequently used items becoming known among students is reduced, thus increasing test security.",
        "In principle, given that the factors influencing item difficulty are known, generating difficult items is not more complicated than generating easy ones.",
        "However, as illustrated in Section 2, combining multiple difficulty factors such as negation and joint probability may lead to textual formulations that are ambiguous or hard to understand, and which - if not successfully prevented in advance - may need to be filtered out or corrected by hand.",
        "For that reason, Genpex seems most suitable for the generation of exercises up to a moderate level of complexity.",
        "Still, even if the need for hand-crafting will not be completely eliminated, reducing it to complex items that require particularly careful wording already represents a big gain in efficiency."
