        "Learning to speak a second language is an important objective for many people.",
        "Assessing progress in oral proficiency is often expensive and time-consuming.",
        "The development of automated systems promises to significantly lower costs and increase accessibility.",
        "Elicited imitation (EI) has been used for nearly half a century to measure abnormal language development (Fujiki and Brinton, 1987) and the performance of second language learners (Chaudron et al., 2005; Vinther, 2002).",
        "As a method for assessing oral proficiency it consists of a person listening to a test item, typically a full sentence, and then doing their best to repeat it back correctly.",
        "This method is also referred to as sentence repetition, or more simply as repeats.",
        "One motivation for using EI, as opposed to some other form of test, is that it is relatively inexpensive to administer.",
        "An EI test can be effectively scored by non-experts in a relatively short amount of time.",
        "It is also well suited for automated scoring (Graham et al., 2008), since correct responses are predictable.",
        "The language skills directly measured by an EI test are those involved in repeating back what one has just heard.",
        "In order to directly measure a broader set of language skills, other tests must be used.",
        "One of these is the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI).",
        "The OPI is face-to-face interview conducted to assess language proficiency.",
        "The interview tests different types of relevant skills and lasts for about 30 minutes.",
        "Additionally, a validated OPI requires a second review of a recording created during the initial interview with arbitration if necessary.",
        "This process is expensive ( $150 U.S.) and time-consuming with a turnaround of several weeks before finalized results are received.",
        "A fully automated OPI test does not seem to be practical.",
        "This is especially the case when the interpersonal aspects of a face-to-face interview are considered.",
        "There have been several efforts to automatically score the type of speech which might be spoken by an OPI test-taker, spontaneous non-native speech (Zechner and Xi, 2008).",
        "It has been shown that current automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, used to transcribe such speech, have error rates which make it challenging to use transcripts for testing purposes.",
        "The argument has been made that although EI does not directly measure communicative skills, such as the ability to converse with another person, it can be used to infer such skills (Henning, 1983).",
        "Part of the theory behind EI is that people typically are not able to memorize the sounds of an utterance the length of a full sentence.",
        "Rather, people build a mental model of the meaning of an utterance, and are then able to remember the model.",
        "People who cannot understand the utterance are not able to build a mental model, and are therefore unable to remember or repeat the utterance.",
        "If it is true that EI can be used to infer more general speech communication abilities, even if only to a limited extent, then EI may be useful for predicting test scores which are designed to directly measure that ability.",

        "It is evident that EI is used in these systems, as part of a greater whole.",
        "The argument is made that although the skills directly tested are limited, the scores produced may be useful for inferring more general language abilities.",
        "It is shown that automated scores correlate well with scores from conventional tests, such as the OPI.",
        "One aspect which may not be as clear is the role that EI plays as compared to other methods used in the automated test.",
        "We are interested in the use of a fully automated EI test as a means to predict more general ability in spoken language communication.",
        "Since the OPI test is specifically designed to measure such general ability we use it as a gold standard, in spite of the fact that we do not expect it to be a perfect measure.",
        "We are interested in learning the extent to which OPI scores can be predicted using an EI test.",
        "We are also interested in learning how to design an automated system such that prediction of OPI scores is most effective.",
        "We evaluate system performance based on how highly correlated OPI score predictions are with actual OPI scores.",
        "Several design decisions must be made in the development of such a system.",
        "One, is which method to use for converting spoken responses to OPI score predictions.",
        "Another, is the choice of sentences, or EI test items, to be repeated.",
        "We address both of these issues.",
        "There are at least two approaches to scoring spoken responses.",
        "One, is to score based on transcriptions, generated by a speech recognizer.",
        "Another, is to score based on acoustic measures alone, such as pronunciation and fluency (Cincarek et al., 2009).",
        "The primary difference between these two approaches is what is assumed about the textual content of a spoken response.",
        "Acoustic measures are based on the assumption that the textual content of each spoken response is known.",

        "One of these decisions is to base prediction primarily on acoustic measures, rather than on transcription.",
        "The other of these decisions is the choice of sentences, or EI test items, to be repeated.",
        "It is shown that both of these design decisions can greatly impact performance.",
        "It is also shown that the effectiveness of individual test items can be predicted.",
        "We quantify the effectiveness of individual test items using item MSE.",
        "It may be possible to use item MSE to learn more about the characteristics of effective EI test items.",
        "Developing more effective test items may lead to improved prediction of OPI test scores.",
        "In this paper, we do not attempt to address how linguistic factors (such as sentence length, syntactic complexity, lexical difficulty, and morphology) affect test item effectiveness for OPI prediction.",
        "However, others have discussed similar questions (Tomita et al., 2009; Christensen et al., 2010).",
        "It may be possible that a test-taker could learn strategies for doing well on an EI test, without developing more general speech communication skills.",
        "If test-takers were able to learn such strategies, it may affect the usefulness of EI tests.",
        "Bernstein et al.",
        "(2010) suggest that, as yet, no conclusive evidence has been presented on this issue, and that automated test providers welcome such research.",
        "It is possible that other automated systems are found to be more effective as a means for testing speech communication skills, or as a means for predicting OPI scores.",
        "We expect this to be the case.",
        "The purpose of this research is not to design the best possible system.",
        "Rather, it is to improve understanding of how such a system might be designed.",
        "It is shown that an EI test can be used as a key component of such a system.",
        "Strong correlation between actual and predicted OPI scores is achieved without using any other language testing method."
