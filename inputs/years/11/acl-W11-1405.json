        "Spontaneous speech utterances are organized in a structured way and generated dynamically with optional disfluencies.",
        "In second language acquisition (SLA) research, information related to the structure of utterances and profile of disfluencies has been widely used to monitor speakers' language development processes (Iwashita, 2006).",
        "However, structural events in human conversations have not been actively used in the automated speech assessment research.",
        "For example, most research that used Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology to automatically score speaking proficiency (Neumeyer et al., 2000; Zechner et al., 2007) focused on word-level cues for fluency and accuracy.",
        "In the last decade, a large amount of research (Go-toh and Renals, 2000; Shriberg et al., 2000; Liu, 2004; Ostendorf et al., 2008) has been conducted on structural event detection (i.e., sentence and dis-fluency structure).",
        "This research has resulted in better models for structural event detection.",
        "The detected structural events have been found to help many of the following natural language processing (NLP) tasks: speech parsing, information retrieval, machine translation, and extractive speech summarization (Ostendorf et al., 2008).",
        "Because structural event information: (1) is important for understanding/processing speech, (2) has been successfully used in monitoring language development, which will be summarized in Section 2, (3) has received limited attention in automated speech assessment, and (4) has been actively investigated in the speech research domain in the past decade, it is worthwhile investigating the utility of using structural event detection on automated speech assessment.",
        "Because of the fairly low word accuracy currently achieved when recognizing spontaneous non-native speech of mixed proficiency levels and native language backgrounds, this study will focus on the transcribed words rather than speech recognition outputs.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews previous research; Section 3 reports on the data used in the paper, including the collection, scoring, transcription, and annotation processes; Section 4 discusses the methods we utilized for structural event detection; Section 5 describes the experiments of structural event detection; Section 6 described the features derived from the event sequence for assessing speech and evaluation results on these features; Section 7 discusses the findings of our research and plans for future directions."

        "In the SLA and child language development research fields, language development is measured according to fluency, accuracy, and complexity (Iwashita, 2006).",
        "Structural events are used to derive the features measuring syntactic complexity.",
        "For example, typical metrics for measuring syntactic complexity include: length of production units (e.g., T-units, clauses, verb phrases, and sentences), amount of embedding, subordination and coordination, range of structural types, and structural sophistication.",
        "Iwashita (2006) investigated several measures of syntactic complexity on data generated by learners of Japanese.",
        "The author reported that some measurements (e.g., T-unit length, the number of clauses per T-unit, and the number of independent clauses per T-unit) were good at predicting learners' proficiency levels.",
        "In addition, speech disfluencies are used to measure language development.",
        "For example, Lennon (1990) used a dozen features related to speed, pauses, and several disfluency markers, such as filled pauses per T-unit, to measure the improvement of English proficiency for four German-speaking women during a six-month study in England.",
        "He found a significant change in filled pauses per T-unit during the study process.",
        "These two types of features derived from structural events were combined in other previous studies.",
        "For example, Mizera (2006) used fluency factors related to speed, voiced smoothness (frequency of repetitions or self-corrections), pauses, syntactic complexity (mean length of T-units), and accuracy, to measure speaking proficiency on 20 non-native English speakers.",
        "In this experiment, disfluency-related factors, such as the total number of voiced disfluencies, correlated strongly with the fluency score (r = â€“ 0.45); however, the syntactic complexity factor only showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.310).",
        "There have been previous efforts in using NLP technology to automatically calculate syntactic complexity metrics on learners' writing data.",
        "For example, Lu (2009) and Sagae et al.",
        "(2005) used parsing to get structural information on written texts; however, such efforts have not been undertaken in assessing speech data.",
        "Chen et al.",
        "(2010) annotated structural events (such as clause structure and disfluencies) on English language learners' speech transcriptions and extracted features based on the structural event profile.",
        "They found that the features derived from structural event profile show promising correlation to human holistic scores.",
        "Berstein et al.",
        "(2010) also computed the features related to sentence lengths and the counts of syntactic entities.",
        "They found the extracted features were highly correlated to holistic scores measuring test-takers' language proficiency in both English and Spanish.",
        "In the speech research domain, a large amount of research has been conducted to detect structural events in speech transcriptions and recognized words using lexical and prosodic cues.",
        "Using a language model (LM) trained on words combined with the events of interest is a popular technique for using textual information for structural event detection.",
        "For example, Heeman and Allen (1999) developed a LM including part of speech (POS) tags, discourse markers (e.g., right, anyway), speech repairs, and intonational phrases.",
        "In this way, structural information (e.g., speech repairs), could be predicted using a traditional speech recognition approach.",
        "Prosodic information has been widely used to further improve textual models.",
        "For example, a simple prosodic feature, pause duration between words, was used in Gotoh and Renals (2000) to detect sentence boundaries.",
        "It was found that the pause duration model alone was better than using an LM alone, and the combination of the two models further improved the performance.",
        "More advanced prosody models were used in other research on sentence boundary and speech repair detections (Shriberg et al., 2000; Shriberg and Stolcke, 2004).",
        "A general framework was built combining textual and prosodic cues to detect various kinds of structural events in speech, including sentence boundaries, disfluencies, topic boundaries, dialog acts, emotion, etc.",
        "Shriberg and Stolcke (2004) extracted prosodic features such as pause, phone duration, rhyme duration, and F0 features.",
        "Using all of these features, a decision tree was built to detect possible structural events.",
        "An LM augmented with structural event tokens was also used to detect structural events based on textual cues.",
        "Finally, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was used to combine estimations from the textual model (an augmented LM with structural events) and prosodic model (decision-tree based on prosodic features).",
        "Research on structural event detection has been strongly affected by the DARPA EARS program (EARS, 2002).",
        "As in Shriberg et al.",
        "(2000), the structural event detection (e.g., sentence units (SUs) and speech repairs) investigated in EARS was a classification task utilizing both prosodic and textual knowledge sources.",
        "New approaches for combining the two knowledge sources, including maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and conditional random fields (CRFs), were studied to address the weaknesses of the generative HMM approach (Liu et al., 2004).",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2005) concluded that \"adding textual information, building a more robust prosodic model, using conditional modeling approaches (Maxent and CRF), and system combination all yield performance gains.\""

        "), and (3) disfluencies.",
        "Disfluencies can further be sub-classified into several groups: silent pauses, filled pauses (e.g., uh and um), false starts, repetitions, and repairs.",
        "The repetitions and repairs were denoted as \"edit disfluency\", which were comprised of a reparandum, an optional editing term, and a correction.",
