        "Given a document, the gap-fill questions are generated from it in three stages: sentence selection, key selection and distractor selection.",
        "Sentence selection involves identifying informative sentences in the document which can be used to generate a gap-fill question.",
        "These sentences are then processed in the key selection stage to identify the key on which to ask the question.",
        "In the final stage, the distrac-tors for the selected key are identified from the given chapter by searching for words with the same context as that of the key.",
        "In each stage, the system identifies a set of candidates (i.e. all sentences in the document in stage I, words in the previously selected sentence in stage II and words in the chapter in stage III) and extracts a set of features relevant to the task.",
        "Weighted sum of extracted features (see equation 1) is used to score these candidates, with the weights for the features in each of the three steps assigned heuristically.",
        "A small development data has been used to tune the feature weights.",
        "In equation 1, / denotes the feature and wj denotes the weight of the feature /j.",
        "The overall architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1.",
        "In earlier approaches to generating gap-fill questions (for English language learning), the keys in a text were gathered first (or given as input in some cases) and all the sentences containing the key were used to generate the question.",
        "In domains where language learning is not the aim, a gap-fill question needs an informative sentence and not just any sentence with the desired key present in it.",
        "For this reason, in our work, sentence selection is performed before key selection.",
        "A good GFS should be (1) informative and (2) gap-fill question-generatable.",
        "An informative sentence in a document is one which has relevant knowledge that is useful in the context of the document.",
        "A sentence is gap-fill question-generatable if there is sufficient context within the sentence to predict the key when it is blanked out.",
        "An informative sentence might not have enough context to generate a question from and vice versa.",
        "The sentence selection module goes through all the sentences in the documents and extracts a set of features from each of them.",
        "These features are defined in such a way that the two criterion defined above are accounted for.",
        "Table 1 gives a summary of the features used.",
        "First sentence: /(sj) is a binary feature to check whether the sentence sj is the first sentence of the document or not.",
        "Upon analysing the documents in the textbook, it was observed that the first sentence in the document usually provides a summary of the document.",
