        "One-on-one tutoring has been shown to be a very effective form of instruction compared to other educational settings.",
        "Much research on discovering why this is the case has focused on the analysis of the interaction between tutor and students (Fox, 1993; Graesser et al., 1995; Lepper et al., 1997; Chi et al., 2001).",
        "In the last fifteen years, many such analyses have been approached from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) perspective, with the goal of building interfaces that allow students to naturally interact with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) (Moore et al., 2004; Cade et al., 2008; Chi et al., 2010).",
        "There have been two main types of approaches to the analysis of tutoring dialogues.",
        "The first kind of approach compares groups of subjects interacting with different tutors (Graesser et al., 2004; Van-Lehn et al., 2007), in some instances contrasting the number of occurrences of relevant features between the groups (Evens and Michael, 2006; Chi et al., 2010).",
        "However, as we already argued in (Ohlsson et al., 2007), this code-and-count methodology only focuses on what a certain type of tutor (assumed to be better according to certain criteria) does differently from another tutor, rather than on strategies that may be effective independently from their frequencies of usage by different types of tutor.",
        "Indeed we had followed this same methodology in previous work (Di Eugenio et al., 2006), but a key turning point for our work was to discover that our expert and novice tutors were equally effective (please see below).",
        "The other kind of approach uses linear regression analysis to find correlations between dialogue features and learning gains (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2006; Di Eugenio et al., 2009).",
        "Whereas linear regression is broadly used to analyze experimental data, only few analyses of tutorial data or tutoring experiments use it.",
        "In this paper, we follow Litman and Forbes-Riley (2006) in correlating sequences ofDialogue Acts (DAs) with learning gains.",
        "We extend that work in that our bigram and trigram DAs are not limited to tutor-student DA bigrams -Litman and Forbes-Riley (2006) only considers bi-grams where one DA comes from the tutor's turn and one from the student's turn, in either order.",
        "Importantly, we further relax constraints on how these sequences are built, in particular, we are able to model DA sequences that include gaps.",
        "This allows us to discount the noise resulting from intervening DAs that do not contribute to the effectiveness of the specific sequence.",
        "For example, if we want to explore sequences in which the tutor first provides some knowledge to solve the problem (DPI) and then knowledge about the problem (DDI) (DPI and DDI will be explained later), an exchange such as the one in Figure 1 should be taken into account (JAC and later LOW are the tutors, students are indicated with a numeric code, such as 113 in Figure 1).",
        "However, if we just use adjacent utterances, the ok from the student (113) interrupts the sequence, and we could not take this example into account.",
        "By allowing gaps in our sequences, we test a large number of linear regression models, some of which result in significant models that can be used as guidelines to design an ITS.",
        "Specifically, these guidelines will be used for further improvement of iList, an ITS that provides feedback on linked list problems and that we have developed over the last few years.",
        "Five different versions of iList have been evaluated with 220 users (Fossati et al., 2009; Fossati et al., 2010).",
        "iList is available at http://www.digitaltutor.net, and has been used by more than 550 additional users at 15 different institutions.",
        "JAC: so we would set k equal to e and then delete.",
        "[DPI] 113: ok.",
        "JAC: so we've inserted this whole list in here.",
        "[DDI] 113: yeah.",

        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the CS-Tutoring corpus, including data collection, transcription, and annotation.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce our methodology that combines multiple linear regression with n-grams of DAs that allow for gaps.",
        "We discuss our experiments and results in Section 4."

        "Each student only participated in one session, and was randomly assigned to one of two tutors: LOW, an experienced Computer Science professor, with more than 30 years of teaching experience; or JAC, a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science, with only one semester of previous tutoring experience.",
        "In the end 30 students interacted with LOW and 24 with",
        "JAC.",
        "Students took a pretest right before the tutoring session, and an identical post-test immediately after.",
        "The test had two problems on Lists, two problems on Stacks, and four problems on Trees.",
        "Each problem was graded out of 5 points, for a possible maximum score of 10 points each for Lists and Stacks, and 20 points for Trees.",
        "Pre and post-test scores for each topic were later normalized to the [0.. 1] interval, and learning gains were computed.",
        "Table 1 includes information on session length.",
        "Note that for each topic, the number of sessions is lower than 54.",
        "The tutor was free to tutor on what he felt was more appropriate, after he was given an informal assessment of the student's performance on the pretest (tutors were not shown pretests to avoid that they'd tutor to the pretest only).",
        "Hence, not every student was tutored on every topic.",
        "Each tutoring session was videotaped.",
        "The camera was pointing at the sheets of paper on which tutors and students were writing during the session.",

Pretest score is always included since the effect of previous knowledge on learning is well established, and confirmed in our data (see all Models 1 in Table 4); indeed multiple linear regression allows us to factor out the effect of previous knowledge on learning, by quantifying the predictive power of features that are added beyond pretest score.",

        "Note that some of the bigrams in (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2006) could be considered to have gaps, since they pair one student move (say SI) with each tutor move contained in the next tutor turn (eg, in our Figure 6 they would derive two bigrams [SI, FB], and [SI, Prompt]).",
