        "Automatic grammar checking and correction has been used extensively in several applications.",
        "One such application is in word processors where the user is notified of a potential ungrammatical sentence.",
        "This feature makes it easier for the users to detect and correct ungrammatical sentences.",
        "Automatic grammar checking can also be beneficial in language learning where students are given suggestions on potential grammatical errors (Lee and Seneff, 2006).",
        "Another application of grammar checking is in improving a parser's performance for ungrammatical sentences.",
        "Since most parsers are trained on written data consisting mostly of grammatical sentences, the parsers face issues when parsing ungrammatical sentences.",
        "Automatic detection and correction of these ungrammatical sentences would improve the parser's performance by detecting the ungrammatical sentences and performing a second parse on the corrected sentences (Caines and Buttery, 2010).",
        "From an education perspective, measuring language skills has been extensively explored.",
        "There are systems in place that automatically detect and correct errors for second language learners (Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003; Leacock et al., 2010).",
        "One method used in measuring language development is the analysis of transcripts of child language speech.",
        "Child language transcripts are samples of a child's utterances during a specified period of time.",
        "Educators and speech language pathologists use these samples to measure language development.",
        "In particular, speech language pathologists score these transcripts for grammatical measures of complexity amidst other measures.",
        "Since manual analysis of transcripts is time consuming, many of these grammatical complexity measures require the speech language pathologists to look for just a few examples.",
        "The Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn) (Scarborough, 1990) is one such measure of morphological and syntactic structure developed for measuring language samples of preschool children.",
        "The advantage of measures such as IPSyn is that they give a single score that can be used to holistically measure language development.",
        "However, they focus on grammatical constructs that the child uses correctly and do not take into account the number and type of grammatical errors that are made by the child.",
        "Educators wishing to measure language development and competence in a child will benefit from having access to the grammatical errors made by a child.",
        "Analysis of these grammatical errors will enable educators and speech language pathologists to identify shortcomings in the child's language and recommend intervention techniques customized to the child.",
        "Since manual identification of grammatical errors is both cumbersome and time consuming, a tool that automatically does grammar checking would be of great use to clinicians.",
        "Additionally, we see several uses of automatic grammar detection.",
        "For example, we can use the statistics of grammatical errors as features in building classifiers that predict language impairment.",
        "Furthermore, we could also use the statistics of these grammatical errors to come up with a measure of language development that takes into account both grammatical competence and grammatical deficiencies.",
        "In this paper, we use existing NLP techniques to automatically detect grammatical errors from child language transcripts.",
        "Since children with Language Impairment (LI) have a greater problem with correct usage of verbs compared to Typically Developing (TD) children (Rice et al., 1995), we focus mainly on verb related errors.",
        "We compare rule based systems to statistical systems and investigate the use of different features.",
        "We found the statistical systems performed better than the rule based systems for most error categories."

        "While there has been considerable work (Sagae et al., 2007) done on annotating child language transcripts for grammatical relations, as far as we know, there has been no work done on automatic grammar checking of child language transcripts.",
        "Most of the existing work in automatic grammar checking has been done on written text.",
        "Spoken language on the other hand, presents challenges such as dis-fluencies and false restarts which are not present in written text.",
        "We believe that the specific research challenges that are encountered in detecting and correcting child language transcripts warrant a more detailed examination.",
        "Caines and Buttery (2010) focused on identifying sentences with the missing auxiliary verb in the progressive aspect constructions.",
        "They used logistic regression to predict the presence of zero auxiliary occurrence in the spoken British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "An example of a zero auxiliary construction is \"You talking to me?\".",
        "They first identified constructions with the progressive aspect and annotated the constructions for the following features: subject person, subject case, perfect aspect, presence of negation and use of pronouns.",
        "Their model identified zero auxiliary constructions with 96.9% accuracy.",
        "They also demonstrated how their model can be integrated into existing parsing tools, thereby increasing the number of successful parses for zero auxiliary constructions by 30%.",
        "Lee and Seneff (2008) described a system for verb error correction using template matching on parse trees in two ways.",
        "Their work focused on correcting the error types related to subject-verb agreement, auxiliary agreement and complementation.",
        "They considered the irregularities in parse trees caused by verb error forms and used n-gram counts to filter proposed corrections.",
        "They used the AQUAINT Corpus of English News Text to detect the irregularities in the parse trees caused by verb error forms.",
        "They reported an accuracy of 98.93% for verb errors related to subject-verb agreement, and 98.94% for verb errors related to auxiliary agreement and complementation.",
        "Bowden and Fox (2002) developed a system to detect and explain errors made by non-native English speakers.",
        "They used classification and pattern matching rules instead of thorough parsing.",
        "Their system searched for the verb-related errors and noun-related errors one by one in one sentence by narrowing down the classification of errors.",
        "Lee and Seneff (2006) developed a system to automatically correct grammatical errors related to articles, verbs, prepositions and nouns.",
        "Leacock et al.",
        "(2010) discuss automated grammatical error detection for English language learners.",
        "They focus on errors that language learners find most difficult - constructions that contain prepositions, articles, and collocations.",
        "They discuss the existing systems in place for automated grammatical error detection and correction for these and other classes of errors in a number of languages.",
        "Additionally, they touch on error annotations and system evaluation for grammatical error detection.",
        "For the purpose of our experiments, we used the Paradise dataset (Paradise et al., 2005).",
        "This dataset contains 677 transcripts corresponding to 677 children aged six that were collected in the course of a study of the relationship of otitis media and child development.",
        "The only household language spoken by these children was English.",
        "The transcripts in the Paradise set consist of conversations between a child and his/her caretaker.",
        "We retained only the child's utterances and removed all other utterances.",
        "The Paradise dataset (considering only the child's utterances) contains a total of 108,711 utterances, 394,290 words, and an average Mean Length of Utterance of 3.64.",
        "Gabani (2009) used scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn, 1965), total percentage phonemes repeated correctly on a nonword repetition task and mean length of utterance in morphemes to label these transcripts for language impairment.",
        "A transcript was labeled as having been produced by a child with LI if the child scored 1.5 or more standard deviations below the mean of the entire sample on at least two of the three tests.",
        "Of the 677 transcripts, 623 were labeled as TD and 54 as LI.",
        "We manually annotated each utterance in the transcripts for 10 different types of errors.",
        "Table 1 gives the different types of errors we considered along with examples.",
        "We focused on these 10 different types of errors since children with LI have problems with the usage of verbs in particular.",
        "The list of errors we arrived at was based on the errors we observed in the transcripts.",
        "Since an utterance could have more than one error, we annotated each utterance in the transcript for all the errors present in the utterance.",
        "While annotating the utterances, we observed that there were utterances that could correspond to multiple types of error.",
        "For example, consider the following sentence: \"She go to school\".",
        "The error in this sentence could be an error of a missing auxiliary and a wrong verb form in which case the correct sentence would be \"She is going to school\"; or it could be a missing modal, in which case the correct form would be \"She will go to school\"; or it could just be a subject-verb disagreement in which case \"She goes to school\" would be the correct form.",
        "Therefore, although we know that the utterance definitely has an error, it is not always possible to assign a single error.",
        "We also observed several utterances had both a missing subject and a missing auxiliary verb error.",
        "For example, instead of saying \"I am going to play\", some children say \"Going to play\", which misses both the subject and auxiliary verb.",
        "In this case, the utterance was annotated as having two errors: missing subject and missing auxiliary.",
        "Finally, single word utterances were labeled as being correct.",
        "Table 2 gives the distribution of the errors in the corpus and percentage of TD and LI population that made the error at least once in the entire transcript.",
        "As we can see from Table 2, 36.67% of the errors in the corpus are due to missing copulae.",
        "Wrong verb usage was the next most common error contributing to 14.59% of the errors in the corpus.",
        "We observed that there was a higher percentage of children with LI that made errors on all error categories except for errors related to missing article and missing subject.",
        "We observed that on average, the transcripts belonging to children with LI had fewer utterances as compared to transcripts belonging to TD children.",
