        "Concept mapping is a common pedagogical exercise in which students generate a graphical model of some domain.",
        "Our method automatically extracts knowledge representations from a textbook and uses them to generate concept maps.",
        "The purpose of the study is to generate and evaluate these concept maps according to their accuracy, completeness, and pedagogy.",
        "1 Introduction Concept mapping is an increasingly common educational activity, particularly in K-12 settings.",
        "Concept maps are graphical knowledge representations that represent a concept, question or process (Novak and Canas, 2006).",
        "A recent meta-analysis of 55 studies involving over five thousand participants found the students creating concept maps had increased learning gains (d = .82) and students studying concept maps had increased learning gains ( d = .37 ) (Nesbit and Adesope, 2006).",
        "In comparison, novice tutoring across many studies have had more modest learning gains ( d = .40 ) (Cohen et al., 1982) - comparable to studying concept maps but not to creating them.",
        "For difficult topics, or for students new to concept mapping, some researchers propose so-called expert skeleton concept maps (Novak and Canas, 2006).",
        "These are partially specified concept maps that may have some existing structure and then a \"word bank\" of concepts, properties, and relations that can be used to fill in the rest of the map.",
        "This approach is consistent with concept maps as instructional scaffolds for student learning (O'Donnell et al., 2002).",
        "As students increase in ability, they can move from expert skeleton concept maps to self-generated maps.",
        "Because concept maps are essentially knowledge representations based in words, analysis and synthesis of concept maps are theoretically amenable to knowledge-rich computational linguistic techniques.",

        "Section 3 presents a general technique for extracting concept maps from textbooks and generating graphical depictions of these as student exercises.",
        "Section 4 describes a comparative evaluation of maps extracted by the model to gold-standard human generated concept maps.",

      "text": [
        "There are many different kinds of concept maps, and each variation imposes different computational demands.",
        "One prominent perspective comes from the AI literature in formal reasoning, as an extension of work done a century ago by Pierce on existential graphs (Sowa, 2007; Sowa, 2009).",
        "In this formulation (which is now an ISO standard), so-called con ceptual graphs are interchangeable with predicate calculus.",
        "Of particular importance to the current discussion is grain size, that is the level of granularity given to nodes and relationships.",
        "In these conceptual graphs, grain size is very small, such that each argument, e.g. John, is connected to other arguments, e.g. Mary, through an arbitrary predicate, e.g. John loves Mary.",
        "Aside from the tight correspondence to logic, grain size turns out to be a relevant differentiator amongst conceptualizations of conceptual graphs amongst different fields, and one that leads to important design decisions when extracting graphs from a text.",
        "Another prominent perspective comes from the psychology literature (Graesser and Clark, 1985), with some emphasis on modeling question asking and answering (Graesser and Franklin, 1990; Gordon et al., 1993).",
        "In this formulation of conceptual graphs, nodes themselves can be propositions, e.g. \"a girl wants to play with a doll,\" and relations are (as much as possible) limited to a generic set of propositions for a given domain.",
        "For example, one such categorization consists of 21 relations including is-a, has-property, has-consequence, reason, implies, outcome, and means (Gordon et al., 1993).",
        "A particular advantage of limiting relations to these categories is that the categories can then be set into correspondence with certain question types, e.g. definitional, causal consequent, procedural, for both the purposes of answering questions (Graesser and Franklin, 1990) as well as generating them (Gordon et al., 1993).",
        "Finally, concept maps are widely used in science education (Fisher et al., 2000; Mintzes et al., 2005) for both enhancing student learning and assessment.",
        "Even in this community, there are several formulations of concept maps.",
        "One such widely known map is a hierarchical map (Novak and Canas, 2006; Novak, 1990), in which a core concept/question at the root of the map drives the elaboration of the map to more and more specific details.",
        "In hierarchical maps, nodes are not propositions, and the edges linking nodes are not restricted (Novak and Canas, 2006).",
        "Alternative formulations to hierarchical maps include cluster maps, MindMaps, computergenerated associative networks, and concept-circle diagrams, amongst others (Fisher et al., 2000).",
        "^ – has-part I – ^ – has-property – Ç) arthropod abdomen posterior",
        "Of particular interest is the SemNet formulation, which is characterized by a central concept (which has been determined as highly relevant in the domain) linked to other concepts using a relatively prescribed set of relations (Fisher, 2010).",
        "End nodes can be arbitrary, and cannot themselves be linked to unless they are another core concept in the domain.",
        "Interestingly, in the field of biology, 50% of all links are is-a, part-of, or has-property (Fisher et al., 2000), which suggests that generic relations may be able to account for a large percentage of links in any domain, with only some customization to be performed for specific domains.",
        "An example SemNet triple (start node/relation/end node) is \"prophase includes process chromosomes become visible.\"",
        "Several thousand of such triples are available online for biology, illustrating the viability of this representational scheme for biology (Fisher, 2010)."

        "Our approach for extracting concept maps from a biology textbook follows the general SemNet formulation with some elements of the conceptual graphs of Graesser and Clark (1985).",
        "There are two primary reasons for adopting this formulation, rather than the others described in Section 2.",
        "By using a highly comparable formulation to the original SemNets, one can compare generated graphs with several thousand, expert-generated triples that are freely available.",
        "Second, by making just a few modifications to the SemNet formalism, we can create a formalism that is more closely aligned with question answering/question generation, which we believe is a fruitful avenue for future research.",
        "Our concept map representation has two significant structural elements.",
        "The first is key terms, shown as black nodes in Figure 1.",
        "These are terms in our domain that are pedagogically significant.",
        "Only key terms can be the start of a triple, e.g. abdomen is-a part.",
        "End nodes can contain key terms, other words, or complete propositions.",
        "This structural element is aligned with SemNets.",
        "The second central aspect of our representation is labeled edges, shown as boxes in Figure 1.",
        "As noted by (Fisher et al., 2000), a small set of edges can account for a large percentage of relationships in a domain.",
        "Thus this second structural element aligns better with psychological conceptual graphs (Gordon et al., 1993; Graesser and Clark, 1985), but remains consistent with the spirit of the SemNet representation.",
        "The next sections outline the techniques and models used for defining key terms and edges, followed by our method of graph extraction.",
        "General purpose key term extraction procedures are the subject of current research (Medelyan et al., 2009), but they are less relevant in a pedagogical context where key terms are often already provided in learning materials.",
        "For example, both glossaries (Navigli and Velardi, 2008), and textbook indices (Larranaga et al., 2004) have previously been used as resources in constructing domain models and ontologies.",
        "To develop our key terms, we used the glossary and index from a textbook in the domain of biology (Miller and Levine, 2002) as well as the keywords given in a test-prep study guide (Cypress Curriculum Services, 2008).",
        "Thus we can skip the keyword extraction step of previous work on concept map extraction (Valerio and Leake, 2008; Zouaq and Nkambou, 2009) and the various errors associated with that process.",
        "Since edge relations used in conceptual graphs often depict abstract, domain-independent relationships (Graesser and Clark, 1985; Gordon et al., 1993), it might be inferred that these types of relationships, e.g. is-a, has-part, has-property, are exhaustive.",
        "While such abstract relationships may be able to cover a sizable percentage of all relationships previous work suggests new content can drive new additions to that set (Fisher et al., 2000).",
        "In order to verify the completeness of our edge relations, we undertook an analysis of concept maps from biology.",
        "Over a few hours, we manually clustered 4371 biology triples available on the Internet that span the two topics of molecules & cells and population biology.",
        "Although these two topics represent a small subset of biology topics, we hypothesize that as the extremes of levels of description in biology, their relations will be representative of the levels between them.",
        "Consistent with previous reported concept map research in biology (Fisher et al., 2000), our cluster analysis revealed that 50% of all relations were either is-a, has-part, or has-property.",
        "Overall, 252 relation types clustered into 20 relations shown in Table 1.",
        "The reduction from 252 relation types to 20 clusters generally lost little information because the original set of relations included many specific subclass relationships, e.g. part-of had the subclasses composed of, has organelle, organelle of, component in, subcellular structure of, has subcellular structure.",
        "In most cases subclassing of this kind is recoverable from information distributed across nodes.",
        "For example, if we know that golgi body is-a organelle and we know that eukaryotic cell has-part golgi body, then the original relation golgi body organelle of eukaryotic cell is implied.",
        "Additional edge relations were added based on the psychology literature (Graesser and Clark, 1985; Gordon et al., 1993) as well as adjunct information gleaned from the parser described in the next section, raising the total number of edge relations to 30.",
        "As indicated by Table 1 a great deal of overlap exists between the clustered edge relations and those in the psychological literature.",
        "However, neither goal-oriented relationships nor logical relationships (and/or) were included as these did not seem appropriate for the domain (a cell divides because it must, not because it \"wants to\").",
        "We also removed general relations that overlapped with more specific ones, e.g. temporal is replaced by before, during, after.",
        "We hypothesize that the edge relation scheme in Table 1 would be portable to other domains, but some additional tuning would be necessary to capture fine-grained, domain specific relationships.",
        "According to the representational scheme defined above, triples always begin with a key term that is connected by a relation to either another key term or a propositional phrase.",
        "In other words, each key term is the center of a radial graph.",
        "Triples beginning and ending with key terms bridge these radial graphs.",
        "The automatic extraction process follows this representational scheme.",
        "Additionally, the following process was developed using a biology glossary and biology study guide as a development data set, so training and testing data were kept separate in this study.",
        "We processed a high school biology text (Miller and Levine, 2002), using its index and glossary as sources of key terms as described above, using the LTH SRL parser.",
        "The LTH SRL parser is a semantic role labeling parser that outputs a dependency parse annotated with PropBank and NomBank predicate/argument structures (Johansson and Nugues, 2008; Meyers et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "For each word token in a parse, the parser returns information about the word token's part of speech, lemma, head, and relation to the head.",
        "Moreover, it uses PropBank and NomBank to identify predicates in the parse, either verbal predicates (Prop-Bank) or nominal predicates (NomBank), and their associated arguments.",
        "A slightly abbreviated example parse corresponding to the concept map in Figure 1 is shown in Table 2.",
        "In Table 2 the root of the sentence is \"is,\" whose head is token 0 (the implied root token) and whose dependents are \"abdomen\" and \"part,\" the subject and predicate, respectively.",
        "Predicate \"part.01,\" being a noun, refers to the Nombank predicate \"part\" roleset 1.",
        "This predicate has a single argument of type A1, i.e. theme, which is the phrase dominated by \"of,\" i.e. \"of an arthopod's body.\"",
        "Predicate \"body.03\" refers to Nombank predicate \"body\" roleset 3 and also has a single argument of type A1, \"arthopod,\" dominating the phrase \"an arthopod's.\"",
        "Potentially each of these semantic predicates represents a relation, e.g. has-part, and the syntactic information in the parse also suggests relations, e.g. ABDOMEN is-a.",
        "The LTH parser also marks adjunct arguments.",
        "For example, consider the sentence \"During electron transport, H+ ions build up in the intermembrane space, making it positively charged.\"",
        "There are four adjuncts in this sentence: \"During electron transport\" is a temporal adjunct, \"in the intermembrane space\" is a locative adjunct, \"making it positively charged\" is an adverbial adjunct, and \"positively\" is a manner adjunct.",
        "The abundance of these adjuncts led to the pragmatic decision to include them as edge relation indicators in Table 1.",

        "However, since the inter-rater reliability for this scale was relatively low, the mean for accuracy requires closer analysis.",
        "Inspection of the individual means for each judge revealed that judge A had the same mean accuracy for both human and computer generated maps, (M = 1.73), while judge B rated the human maps higher (M = 1.2) and the computer generated maps lower (M = 2).",

        "An inspection of the number of triples in the human maps compared to the computer generated maps reveals that there are approximately 3.5 times as many triples in the human maps as the computer generated maps.",
        "To further explore this relationship, a linear regression was conducted using the log of number of triples in each graph to predict the mean pedagogy score for that graph.",

        "First, the computer generated maps are on average \"mostly accurate.\"",
        "Secondly, the computer generated maps fare less well for coverage and pedagogy, but these two scale are highly correlated, suggesting that judges are using a criterion largely based on completeness when scoring maps.",
        "The strength of the log number of triples in a graph as a predictor of pedagogy likewise indicates that increasing the number of triples in each graph, which would require access to a larger sample of texts on these topics, would increase the pedagogical ratings for the computer generated maps.",

        "In this paper we have presented a methodology for creating expert skeleton concept maps from textbooks.",
        "Our comparative analysis using human generated concept maps as a gold standard suggests that our maps are mostly accurate and are appropriate for use as expert skeleton concept maps.",
        "Ideally student concept maps that extend these skeleton maps would be automatically scored and feedback given as is already done in intelligent tutoring systems like Betty's Brain and CIRCSIM Tu-tor(Biswas et al., 2005; Evens et al., 2001).",
        "Both of these systems use expert-generated maps as gold standards by which to evaluate student maps.",
        "Therefore automatic scoring of our expert skeleton concept maps would require a more complete map in the background.",
        "In future work we will examine increasing the number of knowledge sources to see if this will increase the pedagogical value of the concept maps and allow for automatic scoring.",
        "However, increasing the knowledge sources will also likely lead to an increase not only in total information but also in redundant information.",
        "Thus extending this work to include more knowledge sources will likely require incorporating techniques from the summarization and entailment literatures to remove redundant information."
