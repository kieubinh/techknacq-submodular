        "The task of automatically determining the readability of texts has a long and rich tradition.",
        "This has not only resulted in a large number of readability formulas (Flesch, 1948; Brouwer, 1963; Dale and Chall, 1948; Gunning, 1952; McLaughlin, 1969), but also to the more recent tendency of using insights from NLP for automatic readability prediction (Schwann and Ostendorf, 2005; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008).",
        "Potential applications include the selection of reading material for language learners, automatic essay scoring, the selection of online text material for automatic summarization, etc.",
        "One of the well-known bottlenecks in data-driven NLP research is the lack of sufficiently large data sets for which annotators provided labels with sufficient agreement.",
        "Also readability research is faced with the crucial obstacle that very few corpora of generic texts exist of which reliable readability information is available (Tanaka-Ishii et al., 2010).",
        "When constructing such a corpus, the inherent subjectivity of the concept of readability cannot be ignored.",
        "The ease with which a given reader can correctly identify the message conveyed in a text is, among other things, inextricably related to the reader's background knowledge of the subject at hand (McNamara et al., 1993).",
        "The construction of a corpus, which can serve as a gold standard against which new scoring or ranking systems can be tested, thus requires a multifaceted approach taking into account both the properties of the text under evaluation and those of the readers.",
        "In recent years, a tendency seems to have arisen to also explicitly address this subjective aspect of readability.",
        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008), for example, base their readability prediction method exclusively on the extent to which readers found a text to be \"well-written\" and Kate et al.",
        "(2010) take the assessments supplied by a number of experts as their gold standard, and test their readability prediction method as well as assessments by novices against these expert opinions.",
        "In this paper, we report on two methodologies to construct a corpus of readability assessments, which can serve as a gold standard against which new scoring or ranking systems can be tested.",
        "Both methodologies were used for collecting readability assessments of Dutch and English texts.",
        "Since these data collection experiments for English only recently started, the focus in this paper will be on",
        "Dutch.",
        "By collecting multiple assessments per text, the goal was to level out the reader's background knowledge and attitude.",
        "We will both report on a data collection experiment designed for language experts and a simple crowdsourcing experiment.",
        "We will introduce inter-annotator agreement and calculate K scores in different settings.",
        "We will show that from the two readability assessment applications, two very similar data sets are obtained, with calculations of Pearson correlations of at least 87 %, and conclude that the simple crowdsourcing results are a viable alternative to the assessments resulting from expert labelings.",
        "In section 2, we describe the data from language experts and how those data can be converted to relative assessments.",
        "Section 3 outlines a simpler crow-sourcing application and its correspondences with the experts.",
        "Finally, in section 4, we draw conclusions and give a short summary of future work."

        "Since readability prediction was initially primarily designed to identify reading material suited to the reading competence of a given individual, most of the existing data sets are drawn from textbooks and other sources intended for different compentence levels (Francois, 2009; Heilman et al., 2008).",
        "For Dutch, for example, the only large-scale experimental readability research (Staphorsius and Krom, 1985; Staphorsius, 1994) is limited to texts for elementary school children.",
        "For English, the situation is similar as for Dutch, viz. a predominant focus on educational corpora.",
        "Recently, an evaluation was designed by LDC in the framework of the DARPA Machine Reading Program (Kate et al., 2010).",
        "For this purpose a more general corpus was assembled which was not tailored to a specific audience, genre or domain.",
        "Unfortunately, the data are not available for further use.",
        "Our research focus is similar and we report on the collection of readability assessments for a corpus of Dutch text, which will be used for training and evaluating a readability prediction system.",
        "In order to acquire useful data for the construction of a gold standard, we implemented the Expert Readers application intended for language experts.",
        "The texts for the application were chosen from the Lassy corpus (van Noord, 2009), which is syntactically annotated, and which is currently being enhanced with several layers of semantic annotations (Schuurman et al., 2009).",
        "These annotations will allow us in the future to determine the impact of various semantic, syntactic and pragmatic factors on text readability.",
        "The small subcorpus consists of 105 texts of between about 100 and 200 words.",
        "Most of the texts are extracted from a larger context, but all are meaningful by themselves.",
        "All texts are in Dutch and most of them originate from Wikipedia or newspapers.",
        "Further, the corpus contains parts of domain-specific and official documents, manuals, patient information leaflets and others.",
        "The texts in the subcorpus have no readability levels assigned, but they are carefully selected in order to obtain texts with a multitude of readability levels.",
        "Because of the lack of a prior readability assessment, the selection was purely based on careful, yet intuitive judgment.",
        "The Expert Readers application is designed to collect readability assessments from language experts.",
        "They can express their opinion by ranking texts on a scale of 0 (easy) to 100 (difficult), which allows them to compare the texts with each other while at the same time assigning absolute scores.",
        "These fine-grained assessments committed by experts are grouped into submission batches, holding a number of texts which have been ranked and to which a score has been assigned.",
        "For each submitted text, we know who sent it when, with which score and along with which other texts in the same submission batch.",
        "The experts can also make use of a so-called frame of reference, in which texts are kept available over different submission batches.",
        "The same text can occur only once per batch, but can be presented again to the same expert in other batches.",
        "Apart from the readability scores and the rankings in the batches, the experts can also enter comments on what makes each text more or less readable.",
        "That allows for qualitative analysis.",
        "We did not ask more detailed questions about certain aspects of readability, because we wanted to avoid influencing the text properties experts pay attention to.",
        "Neither did we inform the experts in any way how they should judge readability.",
        "Any presumption about which features are important readability indicators was thus avoided.",
        "Our main interest is to design a system that is robust enough to model readability as generally as possible.",
        "In the context of our experiments, we regard people as language experts if they are native readers professionally involved with the Dutch language.",
        "Our current pool of active experts consists of 34 teachers, writers and linguists, who have contributed a total of 1862 text scores over 108 submission batches.",
        "The experts were all volunteers and were not paid for their work.",
        "Their instructions consisted of an explanation of how the application works on paper and an instruction movie of a couple of minutes.",
        "The sizes of the submission batches range from 5 to all available texts.",
        "Batches with less than 5 texts were omitted from the data.",
        "The Expert Readers application provided a rich, but highly fine-grained output.",
        "At first sight, a straightforward and intuitive way to work with the Expert Readers data would be to use, for example, the mean readability score assigned to each text.",
        "Pitler and Nenkova (2008) and Kate et al.",
        "(2010), for example, average out results collected from different readers.",
        "However, problems with this approach immediately arise.",
        "Results from Anderson and Davison (1986), for example, show for their data set that if the data on which readability formulas are based, were not aggregated on the school grade level but considered at the individual level, their predictive power would drop from around 80% to an estimated 10%.",
        "We observed a similar tendency in the results of the expert readers application: Figure 1 illustrates that different experts employ different standards to assign readability scores to texts.",
        "Being given the",
        "Figure 1: Different scoring strategies for a subset of experts, showing all text scores aggregated across batches choice to label texts with marks between 0 and 100, some annotators decided to use a more coarsegrained labeling strategy (e.g. by using multiples of 10 or 20), whereas others used a fine-grained scoring (all marks between 0 and 100).",
        "Furthermore, some people seem to be reluctant to assign either high or low scores, or both, while some others use the full range of possible scores.",
        "Moreover, the experts delivered their data in several batches.",
        "The texts presented in each submission batch were selected randomly, which implies that the annotator could have been confronted with predominantly less readable or predominantly more readable texts, which may have affected his scoring.",
        "Furthermore, since each text being added to a batch makes it increasingly difficult for an annotator to position this text to the already scored texts, we can assume that the greater the number of texts in a batch, the more effort the annotator did to position each text correctly in the batch.",
        "We decided to only take into account submission batches in which at least 5 texts were compared to each other.",
        "Figure 2 clearly shows the variability in the scores assigned to the texts.",
        "There is by no means a notion of a single statistical distribution that allows for a useful interpretation of the means of the scores.",
        "Since it is far from trivial to use the absolute scores assigned by the experts, we transformed their assessments to a relative scale.",

        "By redesigning readability assessment as a crowd-sourcing application, we hypothesize that no background in linguistics is required to judge the readability of a given text.",

        "The plots for both data sets look very similar, but there is less variability for the Expert Readers data.",

        "Given that many readability prediction methods (e.g. (Flesch, 1948; Staphorsius, 1994)) were developed before it became commonplace, it is not surprising that inter-annotator agreement played no great part in the development of those readability formulas.",

        "Readability application on the Expert Readers data set, leads to the boundary values displayed as dashed lines in Figure 4.",
        "28 % of the text pairs in both applications are thus labeled as equally readable, while 18 % of the pairs are labeled with much difference in difficulty.",
        "Those partitions correspond with boundary values of 0.016 and 0.29 for S, respectively.",
        "We used K as proposed by Carletta (1996) as a measure for the agreement between annotators.",
        "K is given by the following formula:",
        "in which P(A) is the probability that two annotators make the same decision and P(E) is the probability that the same decision is made coincidently.",
        "For P(A), we take into account the number of times two annotators agree about a text pair and the number of times they disagree.",
        "The trivial case, when there is total agreement, simply because a text pair is annotated only once, was not taken into account for the calculation of the kappa statistic.",
        "P(E) is empirically estimated in the standard way.",
        "We calculate K in 5 different settings.",
        "In the standard setting, each of the five possible assessments for a text in a text pair is regarded as a separate class, without ordering of the classes.",
        "In a second calculation of inter-annotator agreement, we considered a click on an adjacent button for the same text pair as agreement.",
        "By doing so, we took into account that the choice between \"easier\" and \"much easier\" and between \"more difficult\" \"much more difficult\" , respectively, is less straightforward than the distinction between \"easier\" and \"more difficult\".",
        "Furthermore, the boundary between \"both equally difficult\" and \"somewhat easier/more difficult\" could also be considered less transparent.",
        "In a third calculation, named merged, the classes \"easier\" and \"much easier\" on one hand, and \"more difficult\" and \"much more difficult\" on the other hand are merged, resulting in three different classes.",
        "Finally, we examine two cases in which a part of the text pairs are omitted, viz. no same and much difference.",
        "In both cases, a binary classification is performed.",
        "P(E) now equals 0.5 for both classes, because there are two possible outcomes, with equal probability.",
        "For no same, the button in the middle was discarded.",
        "The \"easier\" and \"much easier\" classes were merged, as well as the \"more difficult\" and \"much more difficult\" classes.",
        "In the much difference setting, only the texts labeled as much easier or much more difficult were taken into account.",
        "The results of all these calculations are shown in Table 1.",
        "The second column indicates a range of a number of text pairs, which determines how many times a text pair must have been labeled in order to be taken into account for the calculation of K. The results are variable, depending on how K was calculated.",
        "For the Expert Readers, we consistently observe higher K values when more labelings are required per text pair.",
        "One possibility to get an idea of how similar the two data sets are is by calculating correlation metrics, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient.",
        "In order to calculate that, a numerical value acquired from both data sets must be attached to each text.",
        "For each text, we attached two values per data set, viz. the proportions of times the text was assessed either as easier or as more difficult than any other text.",
        "The correlations between the 4 resulting values per text are shown in Table 2.",
        "From those results, it is clear that the data sets are very similar.",
        "There are different viable alternatives to construct a gold standard from the data sets.",
        "The type of gold standard that is needed depends on the learning task to be performed.",
        "For regression, for example, the",
        "Table 2: Pearson correlations between 4 different metrics calculated based on the assessments by experts or the crowd.",
        "The metrics are the proportions of times a text is assessed either as easier or as more difficult than any other text.",
        "most suitable gold standard consists of an assignment of a readability score to each individual text.",
        "Those readability scores can for example be the proportion of times each text was assessed as easier than any other text.",
        "Other possibilities to assign scores can also lead to a gold standard for regression.",
        "Binary classification is an example of a different learning task, for which the data set doesn't need to be transformed.",
        "For two texts, a binary classifier attempts to determine which is the easiest and which the most difficult one.",
        "Further research will focus on how the data sets resulting from both annotation strategies can be transformed into gold standards."

        "We have implemented two web applications to collect assessments about the readability of texts in a selected corpus: an application intended for language experts and a crowdsourcing tool.",
        "Although both English and Dutch are targeted, we focused on the results that were obtained for Dutch.",
        "In order to compare the resulting readability assessments, we viewed the data as text pairs, for which a relative assessment is given.",
        "A comparison of both data sets revealed that they are very similar, a similarity which was numerically confirmed by an analysis with Pearson's correlation coefficient.",
        "Finally, we gave examples of how gold standards for different learning tasks canbe constructed from the data sets.",
        "We introduced the problem of inter-annotator agreement into the field of readability prediction and calculated inter-annotator agreement for both data sets in five different ways.",
        "We show that for the text pairs which were assessed > 10 times, higher K scores are obtained in each of the different settings, which strengthens our confidence that readability can be learned from our data sets.",
        "We conclude that both data sets are valuable and that crowdsourcing is a viable alternative to readability assessments by language experts.",
        "Future work includes a further extension and analysis of the data sets.",
        "Further analysis could also reveal the ideal way to extract a gold standard from the data sets.",
        "We will also continue to investigate the impact of different linguistic features on automatic readability prediction (van Oosten et al., 2010)."
