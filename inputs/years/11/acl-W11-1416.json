        "Dyslexia is a specific disability which prevents students from reading at a level commensurate with their general intelligence.",
        "It is also the most common learning disability, affecting as many as 15 (NICHD, 2011) or 20% of the population (Shaywitz, 2003).",
        "We have recently started a new Intelligent Tutoring System project to address dyslexia.",
        "The Raft tutor (Repeated Reading Adaptive Fluency Tutor) is intended to improve reading fluency among students with dyslexia.",
        "An important part of the Raft tutor will be its story assembly engine TASA (Text And Story Assembler), which will generate the text to be read.",
        "In this paper, we will discuss how the special characteristics of dyslexia influenced the design of TASA, and describe the prototype system.",
        "Research has shown that phonological processing is the core deficit in dyslexia, but one which can be addressed by intensive training in phonemic awareness and phonics (e.g. (Torgesen et al., 2001)).",
        "Because dyslexic readers have difficulty distinguishing individual phonemes within a word, they also have great difficulty learning the relationships between written letter patterns and the sounds they make.",
        "These decoding patterns, which are often absorbed intuitively by normal readers, must be explicitly taught to dyslexic readers.",
        "For example, the words \"tramped\" and \"padded\" both end in \"ed,\" but are pronounced differently.",
        "In \"tramped\" \"ed\" makes a \"t\" sound (the \"ed_t\" pattern), while in \"padded\" it makes an \"ed\" sound (the \"ed_ed\" pattern).",
        "A dyslexic reader must receive explicit training on hundreds of decoding patterns such as these.",
        "In addition, to improve fluency a dyslexic reader must practice these patterns extensively, in large amounts of connected text.",
        "Unfortunately, this practice is difficult to obtain.",
        "\"Decodable texts\" which use a constrained vocabulary are available (e.g. (Bloomfield et al., 1998)), however, professional dyslexia tutors report that these booklets often do not meet the individual vocabulary needs of their students.",
        "In addition, students with dyslexia typically hate to read (Shaywitz, 2003), and do little to acquire the necessary practice in connected text.",
        "This analysis suggests that a successful fluency tutor should address two sets of issues.",
        "It should address vocabulary issues to ensure that the student gets practice on appropriate decoding patterns.",
        "It also should address motivational issues, to entice students to read more text.",
        "As described below, TASA addresses the vocabulary issue by using templates whose slots allow for lexical individualization.",
        "It aims to improve motivation by generating a variable plot line, and allowing students to make plot choices that affect the unfolding story.",
        "There are several reasons to expect that allowing dyslexic students to interactively shape plot events will improve their motivation.",
        "For example the popular \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books (e.g. (Montgomery, 1982)), allow their readers to choose paths in a branching narrative.",
        "Also, \"Interactive Fiction\" type text adventures (Montfort, 2003) which allow the reader to control the protagonist, enjoy continuing popularity.",
        "Furthermore, a study with the REAP ESL vocabulary tutor suggests that presenting more interesting stories can improve learning (Heilman et al., 2010).",
        "Authoring a branching narrative entirely by hand, however, is an unattractive option.",
        "Even a small story could require authoring hundreds of plot branches.",
        "Reducing this burden would allow authoring the large volume of text needed by our readers.",
        "The dyslexia tutoring domain therefore suggests three design goals for our story generation engine.",
        "1.",
        "Lexical Individualization: It should allow us to fine tune lexical content to feature the decoding patterns required by each student.",
        "2.",
        "Interactivity: It should allow student plot choices to influence the story being read.",
        "3.",
        "Tractable Authoring: It should help reduce the burden of authoring multiple story branches."

      "text": [
        "As described above, the dyslexia domain requires detailed control over lexical content in our reading, and our approach to motivational issues involves interactive text.",
        "Both of these considerations argue against the use of pre-existing texts as are used, for example, in the Listen (Mostow, 2011) or REAP (Brown and Eskenazi, 2004) systems.",
        "Instead, we investigate generating our own stories.",
        "The literature on story analysis and generation can be usefully divided into approaches which model the structure of the story itself, versus approaches which model some of the processes involved in story creation.",
        "The latter often simulate the author (e.g. (Dehn, 1981), the reader (Bailey, 1999), or the story world (Meehan, 1976).",
        "They also typically require large amounts of real-world knowledge to generate even simple stories.",
        "Given our need to produce a large amount of practice text, this approach seems untenable.",
        "Instead, we take the first mentioned approach of modeling story structure.",
        "To do this, we will require a formalism which will allow us to represent, manipulate and recombine pre-written stories.",
        "Early work in story grammars used elegant hierarchical tree structures to analyze plot structure.",
        "(see (Graesser et al., 1991) for an overview of this work).",
        "In general, these structures seem underspecified for generating stories.",
        "We turn instead to the causal network theory of Trabasso and van den Broek (1985).",
        "This formalism does not enforce strict hierarchies, but represents text as a sequence of nodes.",
        "The nodes represent categories such as \"Setting,\" \"Goal,\" \"Event,\" \"Reaction\" or \"Outcome,\" and are connected in sequence by temporal and causal links.",
        "This formalism provides guidelines about legal node sequences.",
        "It also enforces several constraints on the type of text we can represent.",
        "For example, the text base must be generated in strict temporal and causal order, we cannot represent flashbacks or other types of transformed narrative.",
        "Also, each node generates text, we cannot represent events which do not appear in the textbase."

        "After many setbacks the protagonist becomes accomplished at this endeavor, then at the climax uses his/her new strength/skill to save the parent from certain doom.",
        "Our prototype story was developed to instantiate these themes each in several ways.",
        "For example, the initial source of inspiration comes in two options.",
        "The first source will be found in a springhouse at the rear of the protagonist's new home.",
        "The alternate source is found in a locked room of the main house.",
        "There are also several options for the resulting endeavor and several options for the final climax.",
        "Pursuant to our goal of presenting an interactive text, most of these plot variations will be determined at runtime by reader choice.",
        "For example, toward the beginning of the story, the protagonist is found in his/her new bedroom, with a goal to explore the unfamiliar house.",
        "Here the reader chooses what to investigate, with the next plot fork being determined by whether the \"spring-house\" or the \"locked door\" is chosen.",
        "This story is written in text form, then deconstructed into a causal network in the following way.",
        "An analyst examines the initial story text, and divides it into chunks.",
        "Following the Trabasso framework described in Section 2, each chunk is required to be temporally and causally subsequent to the previous chunk, and to depict elements such as a \"setting,\" \"event,\" \"goal,\" \"attempt\" \"reaction\" or \"outcome.\"",
        "The story chunk described above, for example, is labeled as a goal node.",

        "The TA S A system includes three types of facts: user-model, story-world, and lexicon facts.",
        "User-model facts include details about the student's age and gender, as well as about targeted decoding patterns for that individual student.",

        "The story state is much less detailed than is required for the story generation systems described in Section 2, and simply includes information about the location, goals and mood of characters, and the locations and status of certain objects, as seems necessary to prevent rules from appending text in inappropriate places.",
        "It prevents, for example, text about unlocking a door from being appended when the door is open.",
        "Facts belonging to the same world state are co-indexed (with the \"worldHist\" variable shown in Figure 1), so that when a rule modifies the world state, the entire set of world facts can be reasserted into memory with an updated index.",

        "In addition, we hope to show each example word in several sentence contexts, which brings the number of expected sentence templates well into the thousands.",
        "As mentioned above, each node from the story analysis is instantiated as one or more rules in this expert system.",
        "If a rule matches a story-world state and fires, it appends text to the story so far.",

        "The then portions of these rules contain templates which are used to generate text.",
        "Each template includes slots which are to be filled by appropriate words from the lexicon.",
        "Because one template typically does not exhaust all the ways to express the rule's intended message, the analyst typically writes several forms of the rule, which increases the range of potential word use.",
        "Given this structure of rules and facts, the production rule paradigm is appealing for its ability to meet all three of our design goals: plot variety, lexical individualization, and tractable authoring.",
        "By modularizing chunks of text and associating them with appropriate story-world conditions (in their ifparts), we can make a system able to generate plot forks by matching two potential child nodes to the previous story node.",
        "We can achieve lexical individualization by writing rules which match not only story world facts, but also student model facts about targeted decoding patterns.",
        "Authoring burden is reduced by the ability of existing rules to add text in new situations.",
