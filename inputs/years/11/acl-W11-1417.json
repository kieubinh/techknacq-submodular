        "Motivation is widely believed to be an important factor in learning, and many studies have found relationships between motivation and educational outcomes.",
        "For example Pintrich and DeGroot (1990) found that students' motivational state was a significant predictor of classroom performance.",
        "In addition, pedagogically significant behaviors such as dictionary lookup in the REAP (Brown and Eskenazi, 2004) vocabulary tutor have been shown to be positively correlated with motivation assessments (DelaRosa and Eskenazi, 2011).",
        "Also, in a separate study with the REAP tutor, attempts to manipulate reading motivation by presenting more interesting stories were shown to improve vocabulary learning (Heilman et al., 2010).",
        "In addition to influencing learning outcomes, motivational state may also affect which interventions will be effective during tutoring.",
        "For example, Ward and Litman (2011) have shown that motivation can significantly affect which students benefit from a reflective reading following interactive tutoring with a the Itspoke (Litman and Silliman, 2004) tutor.",
        "An accurate way to measure student motivation during tutoring could therefore be valuable to Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) researchers.",
        "Several self-report instruments have been developed which measure various aspects of motivation (e.g. (Pintrich and DeGroot, 1990; McKenna and Kear, 1990)).",
        "However, these instruments are too intrusive to be administered during tutoring, for fear of fatally disrupting learning.",
        "We would prefer a non-intrusive measure which would allow an ITS to detect when student motivation is decreasing so as to launch a motivational intervention.",
        "Similarly, the ITS should be able to detect when motivation is increasing again, to determine if the intervention worked.",
        "As mentioned above, such a measure might also allow an ITS to determine when it would be effective to use certain instructional tactics.",
        "In this work we investigate cohesion as a non-intrusive measure of motivation for natural language dialog based ITS.",
        "As defined more precisely below, our measure of cohesion quantifies lexical and semantic similarity between tutor and student dialog utterances.",
        "We hypothesize that this measure of lexical similarity may be related to motivation in part because other measures of dialog similarity have been shown to be related to task success.",
        "For example, there is evidence that perceived similarity between a student's own speech rate and that of a recorded task request increases the student's feelings of immediacy, which are in turn linked to greater compliance with the request to perform a task (Buller and Aune, 1992).",
        "In addition, Ward and Litman (2006; 2008) investigated a measure of lexical similarity between the tutor and student partners in a tutoring dialog which was shown to be correlated with task success in several corpora of tutorial dialogs.",
        "Measures of cohesion have also been used in a variety of NLP tasks such as measuring text readability (e.g. (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008)), measuring stylistic differences in text (Mccarthy et al., 2006), and for topic segmentation in tutorial dialog (Olney and",
        "Cai, 2005).",
        "Given the previously mentioned results relating motivation to educational task success, these links between task success and cohesion lead us to hypothesize a direct correlation between motivation and cohesion when using the Itspoke tutor.",
        "We will first briefly describe the Itspoke tutor, and the corpus of tutoring dialogs used in this study.",
        "We will then describe the instrument we used to measure motivation both before and immediately after tutoring, then we will describe the algorithm used to measure cohesion in the tutoring dialogs.",
        "Finally, we show results of correlations between the measure of motivation and the measure of cohesion.",
        "We will find that the change in motivation is significantly correlated with dialog cohesion."

        "The Itspoke tutor presents a problem in qualitative physics, and asks the student an initial question.",
        "The student answers the question, and the dialog continues until all points have been covered to the tutor's satisfaction.",
        "The corpus used in the current work was collected in a previous study (Ward and Litman, 2011), using novice subjects who had never taken a college physics course.",

        "They then engaged Itspoke in five tutoring dialogs as described above.",

        "We have brought forward evidence that cohesion in tutorial dialog, as measured in this paper, is correlated with changes in student motivation.",

        "As discussed in Section 1, other researchers have investigated various types of cohesion, and their relationship to things such as task success and learning.",
        "In addition, work has been done investigating the role of motivation in learning.",
        "However, we believe ours is the first work relating dialog cohesion directly to user motivation.",
        "The presence of a correlation between cohesion and motivation leaves open the possibility that more motivated students are experiencing greater task success in the tutor, and so generating more cohesive dialogs.",
        "Note, however, that the very nonsignificant correlation between pre-dialog motivation and dialog cohesion argues against this possibility.",
        "Instead, it seems that some process is both creating dialog cohesion and improving student motivation.",
        "The lack of significance in the postdialog/motivation correlation may be due to data sparsity.",
        "In future work, we hope to investigate other dialog features which may be even better predictors of student motivation.",
        "As mentioned in Section 1, we became interested in dialog similarity metrics partly because of their association with task success.",
        "These kinds of associations between task success and dialog have also been shown for dialog entrainment.",
        "In this discussion we will use the term \"entrain-ment\" for the phenomenon in which conversational partners' speech features become more similar to each other at many levels, including word choice, over the course of a dialog.",
        "As mentioned above, we use the term \"cohesion\" for overall similarity of word choice between speakers in a dialog, perhaps resulting from entrainment.",
        "Users appear to entrain strongly with dialog systems.",
        "For example, Brennan (1996) has found that users are likely to adopt the terms used by a WOZ dialog system, and that this tendency is at least as strong as with human dialog partners.",

        "Similarly, Ward and Lit-man (2007) found that lexical and acoustic-prosodic entrainment are correlated with task success in the Itspoke dialog system.",
        "Interestingly, in that work entrainment was more strongly correlated with task success than a measure of dialog cohesion similar to the one used in the current paper.",
        "This raises the question of whether such a measure of dialog entrainment might also be a better predictor of motivation than the current measure of cohesion.",
        "We hope in future work to further investigate this possibility.",
        "Finally, because we are interested in predicting motivation during tutoring, our dialog metrics may be improved by making them sensitive to the educational domain.",
        "For example, exploratory work with our tutor has suggested that a measure of cohesion which only counts cohesive ties between physics terms is better correlated with certain measures of learning than a measure which counts non-physics terms.",
