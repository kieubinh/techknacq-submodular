        "We developed a method that filters out non-scorable (NS) responses as a supplementary module to an automated speech proficiency assessment system.",
        "In this study, the method was developed for a telephony-based assessment of English proficiency for non-native speakers.",
        "The examinees' responses were collected from several different environmental conditions, and many of the utterances contain background noise from diverse sources.",
        "In addition to the presence of noise, many responses have other suboptimal characteristics.",
        "For example, some responses contain uncooperative behavior from the speakers, such as non-English speech, whispered speech, and non-responses.",
        "These types of responses make it difficult to provide a valid assessment of a speaker's English proficiency.",
        "Therefore, in order to address the diverse types of causes for these problematic responses, we used a two step approach: first, these problematic responses were filtered out by a \"filtering model,\" and only the remaining responses were scored using the automated scoring model.",
        "The overall architecture of our method, including the automated speech proficiency scoring system, is as follows: for a given spoken response, the system performs speech recognition, yielding a word hypothesis and time stamps.",
        "In addition to word recognition, the system computes pitch and power to generate prosodic features; the system calculates descriptive statistics such as the mean and standard deviation of pitch and power at both the word level and response level.",
        "Given the word hypotheses and pitch/power features, it derives features for automated proficiency scoring.",
        "Next, the non-ASR based features are calculated separately using signal processing techniques.",
        "Finally, given both sets of features, the filtering model identifies NS responses.",
        "This paper will proceed as follows: we will review previous studies (Section 2), present the data (Section 3), and then describe the structure of the filtering model (Section 4).",
        "Next, the results will be presented (Section 5), followed by a discussion (Section 6), and we will conclude with a summary of the importance of the findings (Section 7)."

        "Higgins et al.",
        "(2011) developed a \"filtering model\" that is conceptually similar to the one in this paper.",
        "The model was trained and tested on a corpus containing responses from non-native speakers to an English proficiency assessment.",
        "This system used a regression model based on four features which were originally designed for automated speech proficiency scoring: the number of distinct words in the speech recognition output, the average speech recognizer confidence score, the average power of the speech signal, and the mean absolute deviation of the speech signal power.",
        "This model was able to identify responses which were also identified as NS responses by human raters with an approximately 98% accuracy when a false positive rate (the proportion of responses without technical difficulties that were incorrectly flagged as problematic) was lower than 1%.",
        "Although there are few other studies which are directly related to the task of filtering out non-scorable responses in the domain of automated speech proficiency assessment, several signal processing studies are related to this work.",
        "Traditionally, the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) has been used to detect speech with a large amount of background noise.",
        "This method measures the ratio between the total energy of the speech signal and the total energy of the noise; if the SNR is low, then the speech contains loud background noise.",
        "A low SNR results in lower intelligibility and increases the difficulty for both human and automated scoring.",
        "Furthermore, spectral characteristics can be also applied to detect speech with loud background noise, since noise has different spectral characteristics than speech (noise tends to have no or few peaks in the spectral domain).",
        "If a response contains loud background noise, then the spectral characteristics of the speech may be obscured by noise and it may have similar characteristics with the noise.",
        "These differences in spectral characteristics have been used in audio information retrieval Lu and Hankinson (1998).",
        "Secondly, responses without valid speech can be identified using Voice Activity Detection (VAD).",
        "VAD is a technique which distinguishes human speech from non-speech.",
        "When speech is clean, VAD can be calculated by simply computing the zero-crossing rate which signals the existence of cyclic waves such as vowels.",
        "However, if the response also contains loud background noises, more sophisticated methods are required.",
        "In order to remove the influence of noise, Chang and Kim (2003), Chang et al.",
        "(2006), Shin et al.",
        "(2005) and Sohn et al.",
        "(1999) estimated the characteristics of the noise spectrum and the distribution of noise, and compensated for them when speech is identified.",
        "The performance of these systems is heavily-influenced by the accuracy of estimating characteristics of the background noise.",
        "In this study, we used a set of ASR based features and non-ASR based features.",
        "ASR based features were similar to the ones used by Zechner et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "In addition to the features based on ASR hypotheses, the ASR based feature set contained basic pitch and power related features since the ASR system in this study also produced pitch and power measurements in order to generate prosodic features.",
        "The non-ASR based features were comprised of four groups of features based on signal processing techniques such as SNR, VAD, and pitch and power.",
        "Features related to pitch and power were included in both the ASR based features and the non-ASR based features.",
        "Since the non-ASR based features were originally implemented as an independent module from the ASR-based system (it was implemented for the case where the appropriate recognizer is unavailable), there is some degree of overlap between the two feature sets.",
        "The data for this experiment were drawn from a prototype of a telephony-based English language assessment.",
        "Non-native speakers of English each responded to 40 test items designed to evaluate their level of English proficiency.",
        "The test was composed of items that elicited both spontaneous speech (hereafter SS) and recited speech (hereafter RS).",
        "In this study, 8 items (four SS and four RS) were used for each speaker.",
        "Participants used either a cell phone or a land line to complete the assessment, and the participants were compensated for their time.",
        "The motivation level of the participants was thus lower than in the case of an actual high stakes assessment, where a participant's performance could have a substantial impact on their future.",
        "In addition, the data collection procedure was less controlled than in an operational testing environment; for example, some recordings exhibited higher levels of ambient noise than others.",
        "These two facts led to the quality of some of the responses being lower than would be expected in an operational assessment.",
        "The data for this study were collected from participants in two countries: India and China.",
        "For India, 4900 responses from 638 speakers were collected.",
        "For China, 5565 responses from 702 speakers were collected (some of the participants did not provide responses to all 8 test items).",
        "Each response is approximately 45 sec in duration.",
        "After the data was collected, all of the responses were given scores on a three-point scale by trained raters.",
        "The raters also labeled responses as \"non-scorable\" (NS), when appropriate.",
        "NS responses are ones that could not be given a score according to the rubrics of the three-point scale.",
        "These were due to either a technical difficulty obscuring the content of the response or an inappropriate response from the participant.",
        "The proportion of NS responses differs markedly between the two countries.",
        "852 of the responses in the India data set (17% of the total) were labeled as NS, compared to 1548 responses (28%) in the China data set.",
        "Table 1 provides the different types of NS responses that were annotated by the raters, along with the relative frequency of each NS category compared to the others.",
        "Excluding the category \"Other\", background noise, non-responses, and unrelated topic were the most frequent types of NS response for both data sets.",
        "However, the relative proportions of each type differed somewhat between the two countries.",
        "For example, the most frequent NS type in India was background noise; 33% ofNS responses were ofthis type, 1.7 times higher than in China.",
        "The proportion of unrelated topic responses was",
        "Table1: Differenttypes ofNS responses andtheirrelative frequency, in % of all NS for each country (ranked by frequency of occurrence in India) also high in both countries, but it was much higher in the China data set: it was 19% in the responses from India and 40% for China (more than twice as high as in India).",
        "All responses which were not directly related to the prompt fell into this category.",
        "For SS items, the majority included responses about a different topic.",
        "For RS items, responses in which the speakers read different prompts were classified into this category.",
        "The responses were divided into training and testing for NS response detection.",
        "Due to the significant difference in the proportion of NS responses and relative frequencies of NS types in the two data sets, filtering models were trained separately for each country.",
        "In addition, since the proportions of NS responses and the available features varied according to the item type, training and testing data were further classified by item types.",
        "The proportions of NS responses and the sizes of the partitions, along with the percent of NS responses in each item type, are shown in Table 2.",

        "In this study, two different sets of features were used in the model training process; ASR-based features and non-ASR based features.",
        "For each item-type, an item-type-speciic iltering model was developed using these two sets of features.",
        "For this feature set, we used the features from an automated speech proiciency scoring system.",
        "This scoring system used an ASR engine containing word-internal triphone acoustic models and item-type-speciic language models.",
        "Separate acoustic models were trained for the data sets from the two countries.",
        "The acoustic training data for the two models consisted of 45.5 hours of speech from India and 123.1 hours of speech from China.",
        "In addition, separate language models were trained for the SS and RS items for each country; for the RS items, the language models also incorporated the texts of the prompts.",
        "A total of 61 features were available.",
        "Among these features, many features were conceptually similar but based on different normalization methods.",
        "These features showed a strong intercorrela-tion.",
        "For this study, 30 features were selected and classiied into four groups according to their characteristics: basic features, fluency features, ASR-conidence features, and Word Error Rate (WER) features.",
        "The basic features are related to power and pitch, and they capture the overall distribution of pitch and power values in a speaker's response using mean and variance calculations.",
        "These features are relevant since NS responses may have an abnormal distribution in energy.",
        "For instance, non-responses contain very low energy.",
        "In order to detect these abnormalities in speech signal, pitch and power related features were calculated.",
        "The fluency features measure the length of a response in terms of duration and number of words.",
        "In addition, this group contains features related to speaking rate and silences, such as mean duration and number of silence.",
        "In particular, these features are effective in identifying Non-responses which contain zero or only a few words.",
        "The ASR-conidence group contains features predicting the performance of the speech recognizer.",
        "Low speech recognition accuracy may be indicated by low conidence scores.",
        "Finally, the WER group provides features estimating the similarity between the prompts and the recognition output.",
        "In addition to the conventional word error rate (WER), term error rate (TER) was also implemented for the iltering model.",
        "TER is a metric commonly used in spoken information retrieval, and it only accounts for errors in content words.",
        "This measure may be more effective in identifying NS responses than conventional WER; for instance, the overlap in function words between off-topic responses and prompts can be correctly ignored.",
        "TER was calculated according to the following formula:",
        "UlJ (Wc) X Cref (Wc) - ChyP(Wc) otherwise",
        "E Cref (Wc)",

        "Three features were implemented using this voiced interval information: the number of voiced intervals, ratio of voiced intervals in the entire response, and the total duration of voiced intervals.",
        "In addition, the number of syllables was estimated based on the flow of energy.",
        "The energy of the syllable tends to reach its peak in the nucleus and the dip in the boundaries.",
        "By counting the number of such fluctuations in energy measurements, the number of syllables can be estimated.",

        "For each response, both ASR features and non-ASR features were calculated.",
        "In contrast to non-ASR features, which were available for all responses, ASR features (except the Basic group) were unavailable for some responses, namely, responses for which the ASR system did not generate any word hypotheses because no tokens received scores above the rejection threshold.",

        "Table 9 also shows that the RS models performed worse in the Different Country condition (compared to the Same Country condition) than the SS models.",
        "This difference is likely due to the difference in the number of NS responses among the RS data in the two countries (as shown in Table 2).",

        "The magnitude of this improvement was greater in SS items than RS items; in particular, it was greatest among the SS items in the India data set.",
        "This difference may be due to the different distributions of the NS types among the data sets.",

      "heading": "7. Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "In this study, iltering models were implemented as a supplementary module to an automated proiciency scoring system.",
        "Due to the difference in the available features and proportion of NS responses, itemtype speciic models were trained.",
        "The item-types heavily influenced the overall characteristics of the iltering models.",
        "First, the proportion of NS responses was signiicantly different according to item-type; it was much higher in spontaneous speech items than recited speechitems.",
        "Secondly, the word error rate feature group was only available for recited speech.",
        "Although the word error rate feature group contained three features, they improved the performance of the iltering model sig-niicantly.",
        "ASR feature based models outperformed non-ASR feature based models, but non-ASR based features may be useful for new tests.",
        "Finally, experiments demonstrated that the country-speciic models using the ASR-based features are relatively robust to responses from a different country.",
        "This result suggests that this approach can generalize well to speakers from different countries.",
        "In this study, large numbers of features (42 for RS items and 39 for SS items) were used in the model training, but some features were conceptually similar and not all of them were signiicantly important; the logistic regression analsysis using traning data showed that there was no signiicant improvement after selecting 5 features for RS items and 13 features for SS items.",
        "Use of non-significant features in the model training may result in the overitting problems.",
        "In future research, the features will be classiied into subgroups based on their conceptual similarities; groups of features with high intercorre-lations will be reduced to include only the best performing feature in each group.",
        "Thus, based on careful pre-selection procedures, only high performing features will be selected, and the model will be retrained.",
        "In addition, many different types of NS responses were lumped into one big category (NS); this may increase the confusion between scorable and non-scorable responses and decrease the model's performance.",
        "Some of NS types have very different characteristics compared to other NS types and this fact caused critical differences in the feature values.",
        "For instance, non-responses contained zero or close to zero words, whereas non-English responses and off-topic responses typically had a word count similar to scorable responses.",
        "This difference may reduce the effectiveness of this feature.",
        "In order to avoid this type of problem, we will classify NS types into small numbers of subgroups and build a seperate model for each subgroup.",
