        "How do language learners make word choices as they compose text in a language in which they are not fluent?",
        "Anyone who has attempted to learn a foreign language can attest to spending a great deal of time leafing through the pages of a bilingual dictionary.",
        "However, dictionaries, especially those without a wealth of example sentences or accompanying word sense information, can often lead even the most scrupulous of language learners in the wrong direction.",
        "Consider an example: the English noun \"head\" has several senses, e.g. the physical head and the head of an organization.",
        "However, the Japanese atama can only mean the physical head or mind, and likewise shuchou, meaning \"chief,\" can only map to the second sense of head.",
        "A native English speaker and Japanese learner faced with the choice of these two words and no additional explanation of which Japanese word corresponds to which sense is liable to make a mistake on the flip of a coin.",
        "One could of course conceive of more subtle examples where the semantics of a set of choices are not so blatantly orthogonal.",
        "\"Complete\" and \"entire\" are synonyms, but they are not necessarily interchangeable.",
        "\"Complete stranger\" is a common two-word phrase, but \"entire stranger\" sounds completely strange, if not entirely ungrammatical, to the native English speaker, who will correct \"entire\" to \"complete\" in a surprisingly automatic fashion.",
        "Thus, correct word choice in non-native language production is essential not only to the preservation of intended meaning, but also to fluent expression of the correct meaning.",
        "The development of software to correct ESL text is valuable for both learning and communication.",
        "A language learner provided instant grammaticality feedback during self-study is less likely to fall into patterns of misuse, and the comprehension difficulties one may encounter when corresponding with non-native speakers would be ameliorated by an automated system to improve text fluency.",
        "Additionally, since machine-translated text is often ungrammatical, automated grammar correction algorithms can be deployed as part of a machine translation system to improve the quality of output.",
        "We propose that word choice production errors on the part of the language learner can be modeled as follows.",
        "Given an observed word and an undirected bipartite graph with nodes representing words in one of two languages, i.e. English and the sentence author's native tongue, and edges between words in each language and their dictionary translation in the other (see Figure 1 for an example), there exists some function / i – > [0,1] that defines the parameters of a random walk along graph edges, conditioned on the source word.",
        "By composing this graph with a language model prior such as an n-gram model or probabilistic context-free grammar, we can \"correct\" an observed sentence by inferring the most likely unobserved sentence from which it originated.",
        "More concretely, given that we know /, we can compute argmaxu,/p(w/|w, /, 6), where w is the observed sentence, 6 is the language model, and w' is the \"corrected,\" unobserved sentence.",
        "Under this view, some w' drawn from the distribution 6 is subjected to some noise process /, which perturbs the sentence author's intended meaning and outputs w. We perform this computation in the standard way from the statistical machine translation (SMT) literature (Brown et al., 1993), namely by using Bayes' theorem to write",
        "Since the denominator of the RH S is independent of w', we can rewrite our argmax as",
        "We have now decomposed our original equation into two manageable parts, a prior belief about the grammaticality of an unobserved sentence w', which we can compute using a language model 6 learned separately using standard supervised techniques (in particular, n-gram estimation), and the probability of the observed sentence w given w', /, and 6.",
        "Together, these constitute a noisy channel model from information theory (Shannon, 1948).",
        "All that remains is to learn an appropriate /, for which we will employ unsupervised methods, namely expectation maximization.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we will discuss related work.",
        "In Section 3, we will present the implementation, methodology and results of two experiments with different /.",
        "In Section 4, we will discuss our experimental results, and we will conclude in Section 5."

        "They then score this lattice using a trigram model and PCFG.",
        "While this method has many advantages, it does not take into account the full context of the original sentence.",
        "Kok and Brockett (2010) use random walks over bi-and multilingual graphs generated by aligning English sentences with translations in 10 other European languages to learn paraphrases, which they then evaluate in the context of the original sentence.",
        "While their approach shares many high-level similarities with ours, both their task, paraphrasing correct sentences, and the details of their methodology are divergent from the present work.",
        "Désilets and Hermet (2009) employ round-trip machine translation from LI to L2 and back again to correct second language learner text by keeping track of the word alignments between translations.",
        "They operate on a very similar hypothesis to that of this work, namely that language learners make overly-literal translations when the produce text in their second language.",

        "We present the results of two experiments with different random walk parametrizations.",
        "We begin by describing our dataset, then proceed to an overview of our model and experimental procedures, and finally detail the experiments themselves.",
        "We use the dataset of Park and Levy (2011), a collection of approximately 25,000 essays comprised of 478,350 sentences scraped from web postings made by Korean ESL students studying for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).",
        "Of these, we randomly select 10,000 sentences for training, 504 as a development set, and 1017 held out for final model evaluation.",
        "Our English-Korean dictionary is scraped from http://endic2 0 09.naver.com, a widely-used and trusted online dictionary source in South Korea.",
        "We are unfortunately unaware of any freely available, downloadable English-Korean dictionary databases.",
        "The bulk of our experimental methodology and machinery is borrowed from Park and Levy (2011), so we will summarize that portion of it only briefly here.",
        "At a high level, there are three major components to the model of a sentence: a language prior, a noise model, and an observed sentence.",
        "Each of these is implemented as a wFST and composed together into a single transducer whose accepting paths represent all possibilities of transducing from an (unobserved) input sentence to the (observed) output sentence, with the path weight being associated probability.",
        "See Figure 2 for an example.",
        "For our language model, we use a Kneser-Ney smoothed trigram model learned from a version of the British National Corpus modified to use Americanized spellings (Chen and Goodman, 1996; Burnard, 1995).",
        "The implementation of an n-gram model as a wFST requires that each state represent a context, and so one must necessarily instantiate arcs for all words in the alphabet from each state.",
        "In order to reduce model size and minimize memory usage, it is standard practice to remove relatively uninformative higher-order n-grams from the model, but under the wFST regime one cannot, for example, remove some trigrams from a bigram context without removing all of them.",
        "Instead, we retain only the 1,000 most informative bigram contexts, as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between each bigram context and its unigram counterpart.",
        "This is in contrast to standard cutoff models, which remove n-grams occurring less than some cutoff number of times in the corpus.",
        "The structure of the noise wFST differs for each noise model; for our model of word-choice error, we can use a single initial/final state with arcs labeled with unobserved words as input, observed words as output, and a weight denned by the function / that governs the parameters of a random walk across our dictionary graph (again, see Figure 2 for an example).",

        "However, due to the size of the dictionary graph, such a model would be computationally prohibitive.",
        "Moreover, we must handle the non-trivial peculiars of arbitrary lookups in a roughly lem-matized dictionary and preservation of word forms through random walks, which we discuss now.",
        "'The maximum degree of the dictionary graph is 515, meaning that the upper bound on the number of paths in a random walk of length 2 is 515 = 265, 225!",
        "Among its various capabilities, the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995) provides interfaces for mapping arbitrary English words to their lemmas, querying for lemma syntactic (sub)classes, and discovering the morphological inflectional features of arbitrary words.",
        "We use these capabilities in conjunction with unigram frequencies from our language model and a standard stop word filter to build abridged sets of random walk candidates as in Algorithm 1.",
        "Algorithm 1 Build an abridged set of random walk candidates C for an observed word w s.t.",

        "Sentences are simply identity transducers, i.e. wFSTs with n + 1 states for a sentence of length n and a single arc between each state 0 < i < n and state i +1 labeled with input and output token i from the sentence and weight 1.",
        "For training, we hold language model parameters constant and use expectation maximization (Dempster et al., 1977) to learn noise model parameters as follows.",
        "We replace language model input symbols and sentence model output symbols with the empty symbol e and use the V-expectation semiring of Eisner (2002) to annotate noise model arcs with initial parameter values.",
        "This is our M-step.",
        "Then, we compose the language, noise, and sentence models, which produces a transducer with only e-labeled arcs, and use e-removal to move expectation information into a single state from which we can easily read off expected noise model parameter counts thanks to the V-expectation semiring's bookkeeping (Eisner, 2002; Mohri, 2001).",
        "We repeat this process over a batch of training sentences and add the results together to yield a final vector of expected counts.",
        "This is our E-step.",
        "Finally, we normalize the expected parameter counts to recompute our parameters and rebuild the noise model in a repetition of the M-step.",
        "This process goes back and forth from E-to M-step until the parameters converge within some threshold.",
        "The decoding or inference process is performed in a similar fashion, the main difference being that we use the negative log Viterbi semiring for computing shortest paths instead of the V-expectation semiring.",
        "We first build a new noise model for each sentence using the parameter values learned during training.",
        "Then, the language, noise, and sentence models (sans e substitutions) are composed together, and the shortest path is computed.",
        "All wFST manipulation is performed using Open-FST (Allauzen et al., 2007), an open source weighted finite-state transducer library written in C++.",
        "Additionally, we use the V-expectation semiring code of Dreyer et al.",

        "The most probable unobserved sentence w' from which the observed sentence w was generated under our model, argmax^/ p(w'\\9)p(w\\w', /, 6), can be read off from the input of the transducer produced during the decoding process.",
        "In order to evaluate its quality versus the observed ESL sentence, we use the METEOR and BLEU evaluation metrics for machine translation (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007; Pap-ineni et al., 2002).",
        "This evaluation is performed using a set of human-corrected sentences gathered via Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online service where workers are paid to perform a short task, and further filtered for correctness by an undergraduate research assistant.",
        "8 workers were assigned to correct each sentence from the development and evaluation sets described in Section 3.1, and so after filtering we had 8 or fewer unique corrected versions per sentence available for evaluation.",
        "We note that the use of METEOR and BLEU is justified inasmuch as the process of grammar correction is translation from an ungrammatical \"language\" to a grammatical one (Park and Levy, 2011).",
        "However, it is far from perfect, as we shall see shortly.",
        "While human evaluation is far too costly to attempt at every step during development, it is very worthwhile to examine our corrections through a human eye for final evaluation, especially given the somewhat tenuous suitability of METEOR and BLEU for our evaluation task.",
        "In order to facilitate this, we designed a simple task, again using Amazon Mechanical Turk, where native English speakers are presented with side-by-side ESL and corrected sentences and asked to choose which is more correct.",
        "Workers are instructed to \"judge whether the corrected sentence improves the grammaticality and/or fluency of the ESL sentence without changing the ESL sentence's basic meaning.\"",
        "They are then presented with two questions per sentence pair:",
        "1.",
        "Question: \"Between the two sentences listed above, which is more correct?\"",
        "Answer choices: \"ESL sentence is more correct,\" \"Corrected sentence is more correct,\" \"Both are equally correct,\" and, \"The sentences are identical.\"",
        "2.",
        "Question: \"Is the meaning of the corrected sentence significantly different from that of the ESL sentence?\"",
        "Answer choices: \"Yes, the two sentences do not mean the same thing,\" and, \"No, the two sentences have roughly the same meaning.\"",
        "Each task is 10 sentences long, 3 of which are identical filler sentences.",
        "When a worker mislabels more than one sentence as identical in any single task, the results for that task are thrown out and resubmitted for another worker to complete.",
        "We additionally require that each sentence pair be judged by 5 unique, U.S.-based workers.",
        "Motivation and Noise Model For our first experiment, we assume that the probability of arriving at some word w' / w after a random walk of length 2 from an observed word w is uniform across all w. This is perhaps not the most plausible model, but it serves as a baseline by which we can evaluate more complex models.",
        "More concretely, we use a single parameter A modeling the probability of walking two steps along the dictionary graph from an observed English word w to its Korean definition(s), and then back to some other English word w' / w. Since we treat unobserved words as transducer input and observed words as output, A is normalized by \\{w\\w / w'}\\, i.e. the number of edges with different input and output per input word, and p(w\\w) = 1 – A such that Y,wP(w\\w') = 1.",
        "Initialization and Other Settings We train two variations on the same model, setting m from Algorithm 1, i.e. the maximum number of allowed random walk candidates per word, to 5 and 10.",
        "We initialize A to 0.01 for each.",
        "Results We find that both variations converge after roughly 10 iterations.",

        "We interpret the parameter value disparity between the two model variations as follows.",
        "The larger the number of random walk candidates available for each observed word, the more likely that at least one of the candidates has a high probability in the sentence context, so it makes sense that the 10 candidate variation would yield a higher value for A.",
        "Moreover, recalling that A is normalized by the number of observed words \\{w\\w / w'} \\ reachable from each unobserved candidate word w', it is reasonable that a higher value of A would need to be learned in order to distribute enough probability mass to candidates that are highly probable in the sentence context.",

        "None of this is to say that the models suffer only from an unfortunate difference in correction bias relative to the workers, or even that the models make good corrections a majority of the time.",
        "In fact, they make a range of false-positive corrections as well.",
        "These seem to fall into three major categories: slight preferences for similar words that don't fit in the overall context of the sentence or change its meaning in an undesired way, e.g. changing \"roommate\" to \"lodger\" in you and your roommate must devide [sic] the housework, strong preferences for very common words in the local context that render the corrected sentence ungrammatical, e.g. changing \"compose\" to \"take\" in first, during childhood years, we compose our personality, and misinterpretations of ambiguous parts of speech that cause nouns to be replaced with verbs, etc., e.g. changing \"circumstance\" to \"go\" in... that help you look abound your circumstance and find out... .",
        "Many of these issues can be blamed at least partially on the myopia of the language model, which, for example, vastly prefers \"go and find\" to \"circumstance and find.\"",
        "However, they can also be attributed to the motivational intuition for Experiment 2, which states that we should avoid replacing observed words with common alternatives.",
        "While Table 3 does demonstrate that the models in Experiment 2 learn this preference to a degree for the highest frequency bucket, the proceeding buckets do not exhibit a smooth upwards slope analogous to the function being approximated.",
        "Indeed, the words in bucket 2 are preferred an order of magnitude more than those in bucket 1.",
        "This can be traced to the truncation policy of Algorithm 1, which selects only the highest frequency words from an oversized set of random walk candidates.",
        "While it is unclear how to intelligently select a good candidate set of manageable size, a policy that butts heads with our intuition about which words we should be correcting is clearly not the right one.",
        "The differences between the models themselves are somewhat more difficult to interpret.",
        "The 5 and 10 candidate variations of Experiment 1 and those of Experiment 2 correct 103, 108, 115, and 130 sentences out of 1017, respectively, and at least one model differs from the others on 123 of those sentences (they all agree on 42 sentences).",
        "These disagreements are of all types: sometimes only a single model corrects or vice versa, sometimes two models are pitted against the other two, and occasionally all four will choose a different word, but none of these inconsistencies seem to follow any sort of pattern, e.g. the two five candidate models agreeing more often than the other two or the like.",
        "Interestingly, however, the models tend to be in agreement on the sentences that they correct the most effectively.",
        "We explore this more concretely in Table 4, in which we manually judge the quality of sentence corrections versus the agreement between models.",
        "Specifically, we judge a set of sentence corrections as Good if all of the corrections made between models improve sentence grammaticality, Harmless if the corrections do not significantly improve or reduce grammaticality, and Bad if at least one of the corrections is either ungrammatical or changes the sentence meaning.",
        "We note that Bad corrections for the most part do not take grammatical sentences and make them ungrammatical, only perturb them in some other erroneous fashion.",
        "Clearly, there is a strong correlation between corrected sentence quality and model agreement.",
        "We conclude from this observation that the models are all learning to correct the most unambiguously incorrect sentences in a consistent way, but where some deal of ambiguity remains, they are subject to random differences inherent in each's construction.",
        "To round out our evaluation of correction quality, we presented the corrected sentences from all 4 model variations to human workers for judgment using the task detailed in Section 3.2.7.",
        "The results",
        "Table 4: Manual judgments of model-corrected sentence quality between experiments.",
        "If all models are in agreement, a sentence is marked as Same, and Different otherwise.",
        "We judge a set of sentence corrections as Good if all of the corrections made between models improve sentence grammaticality, Harmless if the corrections do not significantly improve or reduce grammaticality, and Bad if at least one of the corrections is either ungrammatical or changes the sentence meaning.",
        "Only corrected sentences are listed.",
        "of this effort are detailed in Figure 3.",
        "The workers are perhaps a bit more generous with their judgments than we are, but overall, they tend towards the same results that we do in our manual evaluation.",
        "Aside from the conclusions already presented, the worker judgments do expose one interesting finding: When the corrected sentence is judged to be at least as grammatical as the ESL sentence, it also tends to preserve the ESL sentence's meaning.",
        "However, when the ESL sentence is judged more correct, the meaning preservation trend is reversed.",
        "This observation leads us to believe that incorporating some measure of semantic distance into our random walk function / might prove effective."

        "Our random walk model itself could also be improved by incorporating observed word frequency information or some notion of semantic difference between observed and unobserved words, or by learning separate parameters for different word classes.",
        "Somewhat counter-intuitively, a structured reduction of dictionary richness could also yield better results by limiting the breadth of random walk candidates.",
        "Finally, a more intelligent heuristic for truncating large sets of random walk candidates would likely foster improvement."
