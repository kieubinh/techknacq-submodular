        "Within linguistics the management of research data has become of increasing interest.",
        "This is partially due to the growing number of linguists that feel committed to the documentation and preservation of endangered and minority languages (Rice, 1994).",
        "Modern approaches to Language Description and Documentation are not possible without the technology that allows the creation, retrieval and storage of diverse data types.",
        "A field whose main aim is to provide a comprehensive record of language constructions and rules (Himmelmann, 1998) is crucially dependent on software that supports the effort.",
        "Talking to the language documentation community Bird (2009) lists as some of the immediate tasks that linguists need help with; interlinearization of text, validation issues and, what he calls, the handling of uncertain data.",
        "In fact, computers always have played an important role in linguistic research.",
        "Starting out as machines that were able to increase the efficiency of text and data management, they have become tools that allow linguists to pursue research in ways that were not previously possible.",
        "Given an increased interest in work with naturally occurring language, a new generation of search engines for online corpora have appeared with more features that facilitate a linguistic analysis (Biemann et al., 2004).",
        "The creation of annotated corpora from private data collections, is however, still mainly seen as a task that is only relevant to smaller groups of linguists and anthropologists engaged in Field Work.",
        "Shoe-box/Toolbox is probably the oldest software especially designed for this user group.Together with the Fieldwork Language Explorer (FLEx), also developed by SIL, and ELAN which helps with multimedia annotation, this group of applications is probably the best known set of linguistic tools specialised in supporting Field Linguists.",
        "A central task for linguistic field workers is the interlinearization of text which is needed for the systematisation of handwritten notes and transcripts of audio material.",
        "The other central concern of linguists working with small and endangered languages is the creation of lexica.",
        "FLEx therefore integrates a lexicon (a word component), and a grammar (a text interlinearization component).",
        "The system that is described here, assists with the creation of interlinear glosses.",
        "However, the focus is on data exchange and data excavation.",
        "Data from the Humanities, including linguistic data, is time-consuming to produce.",
        "However, in spite of the effort, this data is often not particularly reusable.",
        "Standardly it exists exclusively as an example in a publication.",
        "Glosses tend to be elementary and relative to a specific research question.",
        "Some grammatical properties are annotated but others that are essential for the understanding of the examples in isolation might have been left out, or are only mentioned in the surrounding text.",
        "Source information is rarely provided.",
        "The tool presented in this paper tries to facilitate the idea of creating reusable data gathered from standard linguistic practices, including collections reflecting the researcher's intuition and her linguistic competence, as well as data derived from directed linguistic interviews and discussions with other linguists or native speakers resulting in sentence collection derived from handwritten notes or transcripts of recordings.",
        "Different from natural language processing tools and on a par with other linguistic tools our target user group is \"non-technologically oriented linguists\" (Schmidt, 2010) who tend to work with small, noisy data collections."

        "Our tool consists of a relational database combined with a tabular text editor for the manual creation of text annotations wrapped into a wiki which serves as a general entrance port and collaboration tool.",
        "The system is loaded in a browser.",
        "The customised wiki serves as an access point to the database.",
        "Using standard wiki functionality we direct the user to the database via New text, My texts, and Text-or Phrase search.",
        "My texts displays the user's repository of annotations called 'Texts'.",
        "The notion of Text does not only refer to coherent texts, but to any collection of individual phrases.",
        "My texts, the user's private space, is divided into two sections: Own texts and Shared texts.",
        "This reflects the graded access design of the system.",
        "Users administer their own data in their private space, but they can also make use of other users' shared data.",
        "In addition texts can be shared within groups of users.",
        "Interlinear Glosses can be loaded to the systems wiki where they can be displayed publically or printed out as part of a customized wiki page.",
        "As an additional feature the exported data automatically updates when the natural language database changes.",
        "Comparing the present tool with other linguistic tools without a RDBMS in the background, it seems that the latter tools falter when it comes to data queries.",
        "Although both the present system and FLEx share some features, technically they are quite distinct.",
        "FLEx is a single-user desktop system with a well designed integration of interlinear glossing and dictionary creation facilities (Rogers, 2010), while the present system is an online application for the creation of interlinear glosses specialised in the exchange of interlinear glosses.",
        "The system not only 'moves data around' easily, its Interlinear Glosser, described in the following section, makes also data creation easier.",
        "The system tries to utilise the effect of collaboration between individual users and linguistic resource integration to support the further standardisation of linguistic data.",
        "Our tag sets for word and morpheme glossing are rooted in the Leipzig Glossing Rules, but have been extended and connected to ontological grammatical information.",
        "In addition we offer sentence level annotations.",
        "Glossing rules are conventional standards and one way to spread them is (a) to make already existing standards easily accessible at the point where they are actively used and (b) to connect the people engaged in e-Research to create a community.",
        "Glossing standards as part of linguistic research must be pre defined, yet remain negotiable.",
        "Scientific data in the Humanities is mainly used for qualitative analysis and has an inbuilt factor of uncertainty, that is, linguists compare, contrast and analyse data where where uncertainty about the relation between actual occurring formatives and grammatical concepts is part of the research process and needs to be accommodated also by annotation tools and when it comes to standardisation.",
        "After having imported a text into the Editor which is easily accessed from the site's navigation bar (New text), the text is run through a simple, but efficient sentence splitter.",
        "The user can then select via mouse click one of the phrases and in such a way enter into the annotation mode.",
        "The editor's interface is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The system is designed for annotation in a multilingual setting.",
        "The user starts annotating by choosing the language for the text that she has loaded to the system from an integrated ISO-language list.",
        "Many languages of Africa are known under different names and it therefore is useful to find a direct link to the web version of Ethnologue, a SIL International resource.",
        "Ethnologue can for example help with identifying alternative language names and offers useful pointers to SIL publications.",
        "The present system distinguishes between different levels of annotation.",
        "Free translational glosses, standard for all interlinear glosses, and what we call construction descriptions are sentence level annotations; so is Global Tagging.",

        "Meta data information is not entered using the Interlinear Glosser but the systems wiki where it is stored relative to texts.",
        "The texts can then fully or partially be loaded to the Interlinear Glosser.",
        "Using the wiki's Corpus namespace the user can import texts up to an individual size of 3500 words.",
        "We use an expandable Metadata template to prompt to user for the standard bibliographic information, as well as information about Text type, Annotator and Contributor.",
        "At present the corpus texts and the annotated data needs to be linked manually.",
        "Word- and morpheme level annotation represents the centre piece of the annotation interface which appears as a simple table.",
        "Information is ordered horizontally and vertically, so that words and morphs are aligned vertically with their Baseform, Meaning, Gloss and Part of speech information.",
        "From the annotation table the user can chose one of the words and mark it as Head adding some basic syntactic information.",
        "Annotation can be partial and the idea is that free class morphemes are annotated for meaning while closed class items receive a gloss.",
        "Morphs may be accompanied by null to many glosses leading to enumerations of gloss symbols when necessary.",
        "Each phrase has a unique identifier.",
        "This means that a data token can be shared freely online.",

        "Although to annotate manually is time consuming, it is the re-usability of the data that pays off.",
        "The ease with which already existing data can be exported from the system in order to be integrated into publications is one way to make this point.",
        "In addition to export to Text Editors the system allows also from the graphical user interface the export of XML.",
        "The Akan sentence √†ky√©rew rihom√¢ no , meaning 'he has written the letter' (see Figure 1) is given as an XML structure in Figure 4.",
        "Notice that Construction descriptions and Glob√†l t√†gs are exported together with the word-and morpheme annotations.",
        "Used for machine to machine communication, the XML rendering of interlinear glossses has interested the linguistic community (see for example (Bow et al., 2003)) as a means to find a generalised model for interlinear text.",
        "Data queries operate on phrases, which means that the result of a query is a phrase level representation.",
        "Each line (or block) of the search result represents an individual sentence.",
        "Lists of sentences, as the result of a search, are more easily evaluated by human observers than lines of concordances.",
        "Search results come as either lines of sentences which allow a first quick scan of the data or as blocks of interlinear glosses.",
        "This latter search output gives the linguist access to the sentence internal annotations.",
        "Using general browser functionality search results can easily be scanned.",
        "The system allows for complex searches from the graphical interface where word or morpheme queries can relatively freely be combined with a search for specific glosses or combinations of glosses.",
        "Search for portmanteau morphemes as well as for word-level co-occurrences of glosses is facilitated by allowing the user to determine the scope of gloss-co-occurrence which can either be the morph, the word or the phrase level.",
        "Queries are used to establish inter-annotator consistency, as well as to which degree an annotator is consistent in her annotations.",
        "For example, a search of 1154 Runyankore-Rukiga sentences, annotated by three different native-speakers in the context of different linguistic projects, shows that the annotators disagree on the meaning of the morpheme -ire.",
        "It is mainly annotated as PERF(ective) Aspect, but also as PAST, ANT(erior) and STAT(ive).",
        "However, when the same morpheme occurs in a negative context ire is in 51 out of the 53 negative sentences annotated as expressing the perfective Aspect.",

        "Interesting data trends can be noticed by looking at the annotations made by annotators independently working on the same language.",

        "Other data tendencies indicative of annotator behaviour as much as of data properties can be observed too.",
        "Looking at Tense or Aspect within the same dataset shows that Akan which is a predominantly Aspect marking language (Boadi, 2008) (Osam, 2003) is by all four annotators mostly annotated for Aspect, with few tags for present tense.",
        "Between the Aspect tags we find HAB (habitual), as well as PRF and COMPL.",
        "The two latter glosses, referring to the perfective and the completive Aspect, where 'completive Aspect' means according to Bybee \"to do something thoroughly and to completion\", might have been used to refer to a completed event.",
        "In the nominal domain it is the frequent use of the DEF gloss, as opposed to the very few uses of the gloss INDEF, that highlights that Akan marks definiteness but not indefiniteness.",
        "Interesting is that deixis is hardly marked although the definite marker in Akan has been claimed to have a deictic interpretation (Appiah Amfo, 2007).",
        "The success of real-time data sharing depends on the trust that data consumers have in the data quality.",
        "All public data can be traced back to the annotator through the system's Text search.",
