        "The research project Semantics of History is concerned with the development of a historical ontology and a lexicon that will be used in a new type of information retrieval system.",
        "In historical texts the reality changes over time (Ide & Woolner, 2007).",
        "Furthermore, historical realities can be seen differently depending on the subjective view of the writer.",
        "In the design of our search system, we will take into consideration the change of reality and the diverse attitudes of writers towards historical events so that they both can be used for the purpose of historical information retrieval.",
        "In the first phase of the project we researched how descriptions of historical events are realized in different types of text and what the implications are for historical information retrieval.",
        "Different historical perspectives of writers correspond with genre distinctions and correlate with variation in language use.",
        "Texts, written shortly after an event happened, use more specific and uniquely occurring event descriptions than texts describing the same events but written from a longer time perspective.",
        "Statistical analysis performed within the first phase of the project confirmed this hypothesis.",
        "To capture differences between event representations and to identify relations between historical events, we defined a historical event model which consists of 4 slots: a location slot, time, participant and an action slot (see also Van Hage et al. 2011 for the formal SEM model).",
        "After arriving at an understanding of how to model historical events, we moved on to actually extracting events from text.",
        "In this paper we report on our approach into historical event extraction from textual data about the Srebrenica Massacre from July 1995.",
        "There are two problems that had to be tackled for the purpose of this task: 1) extraction of event actions with their participants, locations and time markers and 2) filtering of events lacking historical value from all events extracted by the system.",
        "We believe that event actions and their participants, locations and time markers can be extracted based on some syntactic clues, PoS, lemma and combinatory information together with semantic class definition and exclusion by means of Wordnet.",
        "Historical filtering can be performed through semantic classification of event actions.",
        "We tested this hypothesis within the KYOTO framework."

        "Within the project a semantic search system for historical texts was created using a common ontology with semantically annotated cultural objects (Ahonen and Hyv'onen, 2009).",
        "Related content is being linked through semantic annotation of historical texts based on ontology labels which presupposes that only high level historical events from text were annotated.",
        "The Pearl Harbor project aimed at facilitating enhanced search and retrieval from a set of documents from the FDRL library by utilizing a series of multiple temporally contextualized snapshot ontologies determined by the occurrence of key historical events (Ide & Woolner, 2007).",
        "We did not manage to find evaluation results for any of the two projects.",
        "Traditional approaches to event extraction that do report evaluation results use models that severely restrict the relations.",

        "(2008) 74% precision for violent events and disasters.",
        "Our approach models more events in a text and events of a broader scope, more comparable to Wunderwald (2011), who extracts participants and roles from news in general, reporting 5060% precision.",
        "Wunderwald uses a machine-learning approach, while our method is knowledge-based.",

        "To be able to handle proper names we used a named entity recognition module.",
        "By means of NER we added dates and geographical names to KAF so that we could further use them for the extraction of time markers and locations.",
        "In the future, we will look into compound splitting and we are also going to add the missing historical senses to the Wordnet database.",
        "After identifying historical WN-synsets, we automatically determined the most informative hypernyms of the seed terms per historical label.",
        "Based on the chosen hypernyms (and their hypo-nyms), we manually selected a number of semantic classes to be able to identify event locations, time markers, participants and historical actions in historical texts.",
        "We defined six semantic classes denoting: human participants, time periods, moments in time, places, historical and motion actions.",
        "Furthermore we specified six more action classes to filter out non historical and potential events: actions indicating modality, polarity, intention, subjectivity, cognitive (also rarely of historical importance) and contentless actions.",
        "Next, we derived a table that assigns one of the ontological classes to every synset in Wordnet on the basis of the relations to the labeled hypernyms.",

        "The system reached an overall recall of 49% and a precision of 57%.",

        "Currently the system is not prepared to handle any other events than the conflict related ones.",

        "We extracted time expressions with the highest precision of 65% and also the highest recall of 76%.",
        "The lower recall and precision measures reached for the extraction of participants and especially locations can be explained by the type shift of the semantic class of locations used for referral to event participants.",
