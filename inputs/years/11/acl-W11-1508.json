        "Many off-the-shelf Human Language Technology (HLT) pipelines are now freely available (examples include LingPipe, OpenNLP, GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), TextPro (Pianta et al., 2008)), and although they support a variety of document formats as input, actual processing (mostly) takes no advantage of structural information, i.e. structural information is not used, or stripped off during preprocessing.",
        "Such processing can be considered safe, e.g. in case of news wire snippets, when processing does not need to be aware of sentence or paragraph boundaries, or of text being part of a table or a figure caption.",

        "• even for parts of a document that still can be considered as containing basically text – e.g., titles – knowing that we are dealing with what we will call here non-paragraph text can be useful to achieve good - or improve - performance as e.g., the syntactic conventions used in those type of document elements may be different - e.g., the syntax of NPs in titles can be pretty different from that in other sections of text.",

        "Documents have at least two types of structure.",
        "The term geometrical, or layout, structure, refers to the structuring of a document according to its visual appearance, its graphical representation (pages, columns, etc).",
        "The logical structure (Luong et al., 2011) refers instead to the content's organization to fulfill an intended overall communicative purpose (title, author list, chapter, section, bibliography, etc).",
        "Both of these structures can be represented as trees; however, these two tree structures may not be mutually compatible (i.e. representable within a single tree structure with non-overlapping structural elements): e.g. a single page may contain the end of one section and the beginning of the next, or a paragraph may just span part of a page or column.",
        "In this paper we will be exclusively concerned with logical structure.",
        "Early on the separation of presentation and content, i.e. of layout and logical structure, was promoted by the early adopters of computers within the typesetting community; well-known, still widely used, systems include the LATEXmeta-package for electronic typesetting.",
        "The importance of separating document logical structure from document content for electronic document processing and for the document creators lead to the ISO 8613-1:1989(E) specification where logical structure is defined as the result of dividing and subdividing the content of a document into increasingly smaller parts, on the basis of the human-perceptible meaning of the content, for example, into chapters, sections, subsections, and paragraphs.",
        "The influential ISO 8879:1986 Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) specification fostered document format definitions like the Open Document Architecture (ODA) and interchange format, CCITT T.411-T.424 / ISO 8613.",
        "Even though the latter format never gained widespread support, its technological ideas influenced many of today's formats, like HTML and CSS as well as, the Extensible Markup Language (XML), today's successor of SGML.",
        "Today, the ISO 26300:2006 Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF), and the ISO 29500:2008 Office Open XML (OOXML) format are the important XML-based document file formats.",
        "For the work on digital libraries the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI),most notably, developed guidelines specifying encoding methods for machine-readable texts.",
        "They have been widely used, e.g. by libraries, museums, and publishers.",
        "The most common logical elements in such proposals – chapters, sections, paragraphs, footnotes, etc. – can all be found in HTML, LTeX, or any other modern text processor.",
        "It should be pointed out however that many modern types of documents found on the Web do not fit this pattern: e.g. blog posts with comments, and the structure of reply threads and inner-linkings to other comments cannot be captured; or much of wikipedia's nonparagraph text.",
        "(For an in depth comparison and discussion of logical formats, and formal characterizations thereof we suggest (Power et al., 2003; Summers, 1998).)",
        "Two families of methods have been developed to extract document structure.",
        "Older systems tend to follow the template-matching paradigm.",
        "In this approach the assignment of the categories to parts of the string is done by matching a sequence of hand crafted templates against the input string S. An instance of this kind of systems is DeLos (Derivation of Logical Structure) (Niyogi and Srihari, 1995) which uses control rules, strategy rules and knowledge rules to derive the logical document structure from a scanned image of the document.",
        "A more elaborate procedure for the same task is employed by Ishitani (Ishitani, 1999).",
        "He uses rules to classify the text lines derived from scanned document image and then employs a set of heuristics to assign the classified lines to logical document components.",
        "The template based approach is also used by the ParaTools, a set of Perl modules for parsing reference strings (Jewell, 2000).",
        "The drawback of the template based approaches is that they are usually not portable to new domains and are not flexible enough to accommodate errors.",
        "Domain adaptation requires the devising of new rules many of them from scratch.",
        "Further the scanned documents or the text content extracted from PDF have errors which are not easily dealt with by template based systems.",
        "Newer systems use supervised machine learning techniques which are much more flexible but require training data.",
        "Extracting document structure is an instance of (hierarchical) sequence labeling, a well known problem which naturally arises in diverse fields like speech recognition, digital signal processing or bioinformatics.",
        "Two kinds of machine learning techniques are most commonly used for this problem: Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF).",
        "A system for parsing reference strings based on HMMs was developed in (Hetzner, 2008) for the California Digital Library.",
        "The system implements a first order HMM where the set of states of the model are represented by the categories in C; the alphabet is hand built and tailored for the task and the probabilities in the probability matrix are derived empirically.",
        "The system obtains an average F1 measure of 93 for the Cora dataset.",
        "A better performance for sequence labeling is obtained if CRF replaces the traditional HMM.",
        "The reason for this is that CRF systems better tolerate errors and they have good performance even when richer features are not available.",
        "A system which uses CRF and a series of post-processing rules for both document logical structure identification and reference string parsing is ParsCit (Councill et al., 2008).",
        "ParsCit comprises three sub-modules: Sect-Label and ParseHead for document logical structure identification and ParsCit for reference string parsing.",
        "The system is built on top of the well known CRF++ package.",
        "The linguistic surface level, i.e. the linear order of words, sentences, and paragraphs, and the hierarchical, tree-like, logical structure also lends itself to parsing-like methods for the structure analysis.",
        "However, the complexity of fostering, maintaining, and augmenting document structure grammars is challenging, and the notorious uncertainty of the input demands for the whole set of stochastic techniques the field has to offer - this comes at a high computing price; cf. e.g.,(Lee et al., 2003; Mao et al., 2003).",
        "It is therefore not surprising that high-throughput internet sites like CiteSeerX use a flat text classifier (Day et al., 2007)."

        "Our first example of application in which document structure preservation is essential are digital libraries (Witten et al., 2003).",
        "In a digital library setting, HLT techniques can be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from indexing the documents in the library for search to classifying them to automatically extracting metadata.",
        "It is therefore becoming more and more common for HLT techniques to be incorporated in document management platforms and used to support a librarian when he / she enters a new document in the library.",
        "Clearly, it would be beneficial if such a pipeline could identify the logical structure of the documents being entered, and preserve it: this information could be used by the document management platform to, for instance, suggest the librarian the most important keywords, find the text to be indexed or even summarized, and produce citations lists, possibly to be compared with the digital library's list of citations to decide whether to add them.",
        "We are in the process of developing a Portal for Research in the Humanities (Portale Ricerca Umanistica-PRU).",
        "This digital library will eventually include research articles about the Trentino region from Archeology, History, and History of Art.",
        "So far, the pipeline to be discussed next has been used to include in the library texts from the Italian archeology journal Preistoria Alpina.",
        "One of our goals was to develop a pipeline that could be used whenever a librarian uploads an article in this digital library, to identify title, authors, abstract, keywords, content, and bibliographic references from the article.",
        "The implemented portal already incorporates information extraction techniques that are used to identify in the 'content' part of the output of the pipeline temporal expressions, locations, and entities such as archeological sites, cultures, and artifacts.",
        "This information is used to allow spatial, temporal, and entity-based access to articles.",
        "We are in the process of enriching the portal so that title and author information are also used to automatically produce a bibliographical card for the article that will be entered in the PRU Library Catalog, and bibliographical references are processed in order to link the article to related articles and to the catalog as well.",
        "The next step will be to modify the pipeline (in particular, to modify the Named Entity Recognition component) to include in the library articles from other areas of research in the Humanities, starting with History.",
        "There are also plans to make it possible for authors themselves to insert their research articles and books in the Portal, as done e.g., in the Semantics Archive..",
        "We believe the functionalities offered by this portal are or will become pretty standard in digital libraries, and therefore that the proposals discussed in this paper could find an application beyond the use in our Portal.",
        "We will also see below that a document structure-sensitive pipeline can find other applications.",
        "4 Turning an Existing Pipeline into One that Extracts and Preserves Document Structure",
        "Most freely available HLT pipelines simply eliminate markup during the initial phases of processing in order to eliminate parts of the document structure that cannot be easily processed by their modules (e.g., bibliographic references), but this is not appropriate for the Portal described in the previous section, where different parts of the output of the pipeline need to be processed in different ways.",
        "On the other end, it was not really feasible to develop a completely new pipeline from scratch.",
        "The approach we pursued in this work was to take an existing pipeline and turn it into one which extracts and outputs document structure.",
        "In this Section we discuss the approach we followed.",
        "In the next Section we discuss the first pipeline we developed according to this approach; then we discuss how the approach was adopted for other purposes, as well.",
        "Incorporating a document structure extractor in a pipeline requires the solution of two basic problems: where to insert the module, and how to pass on document structure information.",
        "Concerning the first issue, we decided to insert the document structure parser after tokenization but before sentence processing.",
        "In regards to the second issue, there are at present three main formats for exchanging information between elements of an HLT pipeline:",
        "• inline, where each module inserts information in a predefined fashion into the file received as input;",
        "• tabular format as done in CONLL, where tokens occupy the first column and each new layer of information is annotated in a separate new column, using the so-called IOB format to represent bracketing (Ramshaw and Marcus,",
        "• standoff format, where new layers of information are stored in separate files.",
        "The two main formats used by modern HLT pipelines are tabular format, and inline or standoff XML format.",
        "Even though we will illustrate the problem of preserving document structure in a pipeline of the former type the PRU pipeline itself supports tabular format and inline XML (TEI compliant).",
        "The solution we adopted, illustrated in Figure 1, involves using sentence headers to preserve document structure information.",
        "In most pipelines using a tabular interchange information, the output of a module consists of a number of sentences each of which consists of",
        "• a header: a series of lines with a hash character # at the beginning;",

        "In their survey on opinion mining and sentiment analysis Pang and Lee (2008) report that logical structure can be used to utilize the relationships between different units of content, in order to achieve a more accurate labeling; e.g. the relationships between discourse participants in discussions on controversial topics when responding are more likely to be antagonistic than to be reinforcing, or the way of quoting-a user can refer to another post by quoting part of it or by addressing the other user by name or user ID-in posts on political debates hints at the perceived opposite end of the political spectrum of the quoted user.",
        "We are in the process of creating an annotated corpus of blogs; the pipeline discussed in this paper was easily adapted to pre-process this type of data as well.",
        "In the IR literature it has often been observed that certain parts of document structure contain information that is particularly useful for document retrieval.",
        "For instance, Kruschwitz (2003) automatically builds domain models - simple trees of related terms - from documents marked up in HTML to assist users during search tasks by performing automatic query refinements, and improves users' experience for browsing the document collection.",
        "He uses term counts in different markup contexts like nonparagraph text and running text, and markups like bold, italic, underline to identify concepts and the corresponding shallow trees.",
        "However, this domain-independent method is suited for all types of data with logical structure annotation and similar data sources can be found in many places, e.g. corporate intranets, electronic archives, etc.",
