        "Crowdsourcing permits us to use a bank of anonymous workers with unknown skill levels to perform complex tasks given a simple breakdown of these tasks with user interface design that hides the full task complexity.",
        "Use of these techniques is growing in the areas of computational linguistics and information retrieval, particularly since these fields now rely on the collection of large datasets for use in machine learning.",
        "Considering the variety of applications, a variety of datasets is needed, but trained, known workers are an expense in principle that must be furnished for each one.",
        "Consequently, crowd-sourcing offers a way to collect this data cheaply and quickly (Snow et al., 2008; Sayeed et al., 2010a).",
        "We applied crowdsourcing to perform the finegrained annotation of a domain-specific corpus.",
        "Our user interface design and our annotator quality control process allows these anonymous workers to perform a highly subjective task in a manner that correlates their collective understanding of the task to our own expert judgements about it.",
        "The path to success provides some illustration of the pitfalls inherent in opinion annotation.",
        "Our task is: domain and application-specific sentiment classification at the sub-sentence level – at the word level.",
        "For our purposes, we define opinion mining (sometimes known as sentiment analysis) to be the retrieval of a triple {source, target, opinion} (Sayeed et al., 2010b; Pang and Lee, 2008; Kim and Hovy, 2006) in which the source is the entity that originated the opinionated language, the target is a mention of the entity or concept that is the opinion's topic, and the opinion is a value (possibly a structure) that reflects some kind of emotional orientation expressed by the source towards the target.",
        "In much of the recent literature on automatic opinion mining, opinion is at best a gradient between positive and negative or a binary classification thereof; further complexity affects the reliability of machine-learning techniques (Koppel and Schler, 2006).",
        "We call opinion mining \"fine-grained\" when we are attempting to retrieve potentially many different { source, target, opinion} triples per document.",
        "This is particularly challenging when there are multiple triples even at a sentence level.",
        "Our work is part of a larger collaboration with social scientists to study the diffusion of information technology (IT) innovations through society by identifying opinion leaders and IT-relevant opinionated language (Rogers, 2003).",
        "A key hypothesis is that the language used by opinion leaders causes groups of others to encourage the spread of the given IT concept in the market.",
        "Since the goal of our exercise is to ascertain the correlation between the source's behaviour and that of others, then it may be more appropriate to look at opinion analysis with the view that what we are attempting to discover are the views of an aggregate reader who may otherwise have an interest in the IT concept in question.",
        "We thus define an expression of opinion in the following manner:",
        "A expresses opinion about B if an interested third party C's actions towards B may be affected by A s textually recorded actions, in a context where actions have positive or negative weight.",
        "This perspective runs counter to a widespread view (Ruppenhofer et al., 2008) which has assumed a treatment of opinionated language as an observation of a latent \"private state\" held by the source.",
        "This definition reflects the relationship of sentiment and opinion with the study of social impact and market prediction.",
        "We return to the question of how to define opinion in section 6.2.",
        "Paid crowdsourcing is a relatively new trend in computational linguistics.",
        "Work exists at the paragraph and document level, and it exists for the Twitter and blog genres (Hsueh et al., 2009).",
        "A key problem in crowdsourcing sentiment analysis is the matter of quality control.",
        "A crowdsourced opinion mining task is an attempt to use untrained annotators over a task that is inherently very subjective.",
        "It is doubly difficult for specialized domains, since crowdsourcing platforms have no way of directly recruiting domain experts.",
        "Hsueh et al.",
        "(2009) present results in quality control over snippets of political blog posts in a task classifying them by sentiment and political alignment.",
        "They find that they can use a measurement of annotator noise to eliminate low-quality annotations at this coarse level by reweighting snippet ambiguity scores with noise scores.",
        "We demonstrate that we can use a similar annotator quality measure alone to eliminate low-quality annotations on a much finer-grained task.",
        "We have a downstream application for this annotation task which involves acquiring patterns in the distribution of opinion-bearing words and targets using machine learning (ML) techniques.",
        "In particular, we want to acquire the syntactic relationships between opinion-bearing words and within-sentence targets.",
        "Supervised ML techniques require gold standard data annotated in advance.",
        "The Multi-Perspective Question-Answering (MPQA) newswire corpus (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005) and the J. D. Power & Associates (JDPA) automotive review blog post (Kessler et al., 2010) corpus are appropriate because both contain subsentence annotations of sentiment-bearing language as text spans.",
        "In some cases, they also include links to within-sentence targets.",
        "This is an example of an MPQA annotation:",
        "That was the moment at which the fabric of compassion tore, and worlds cracked apart; when the contrast and conflict of civilisational values became so great as to remove any sense of common ground even on which to do battle.",
        "The italicized portion is intended to reflect a negative sentiment about the bolded portion.",
        "However, while it is the case that the whole italicized phrase represents a negative sentiment, \"remove\" appears to represent far more of the negativity than \"common\" and \"ground\".",
        "While there are techniques that depend on access to entire phrases, our project is to identify sentiment spans at the length of a single word."

        "In this section, we discuss the data processing pipeline (figure 3) through which we select candidates for annotations and the crowdsourcing interface we present to the end user for classifying individual words into categories that reflect the effect of the word on the worker.",
        "Two social science undergraduate students were hired to do annotations on Information Week with the original intention of doing all the annotations this way.",
        "There was a training period where they annotated about 60 documents in sets of 20 in iterative consultation with one of the authors.",
        "Then they were given 142 documents to annotate simultaneously in order to assess their agreement after training.",
        "Annotation was performed in Atlas.ti, an annotation tool popular with social science researchers.",
        "It was chosen for its familiarity to the social scientists involved in our project and because of their stated preference for using tools that would allow them to share annotations with colleagues.",
        "Atlas.ti has limitations, including the inability to create hierarchical annotations.",
        "We overcame these limitations using a special notation to connect related annotations.",
        "An annotator highlights a sentence that she believes contains an opinion about a mentioned target on one of the lists.",
        "She then highlights the mention of the target and, furthermore, highlights the individual words that express the opinion about the target, using the notation to connect related highlights.",
        "While the use of trained annotators did not produce reliable results (section 6.2) in acceptable time frames, we decided to use the annotations in a process for selecting candidate sentences for crowd-sourcing.",
        "All 219 sentences that the annotators selected as having opinions about within-sentence IT",
        "Figure 1: A work unit presented in grayscale.",
        "\"E-business\" is the IT concept and would be highlighted in blue.",
        "The words in question are highlighted in gray background and turn red after they are dragged to the boxes.",
        "concepts were concatenated into a single string and converted into a TFIDF unit vector.",
        "We then selected all the sentences that contain IT concept mentions from the entire Information Week corpus using an OpenNLP 1.4.3 model as our sentence-splitter.",
        "This produced approximately 77K sentences.",
        "Every sentence was converted into a TFIDF unit vector, and we took the cosine similarity of each sentence with the TFIDF vector.",
        "We then ranked the sentences by cosine similarity.",
        "We ran every sentence through the Stanford part-of-speech tagger.",
        "Words that belonged to open classes such as adjectives and verbs were selected along with certain closed-class words such as modals and negation words.",
        "These candidate words were highlighted in the worker interface.",
        "We did not want to force workers to classify every single word in a sentence, because this would be too tedious.",
        "So we instead randomly grouped the highlighted words into non-overlapping sets of six.",
        "(Remainders less than five were dropped from the task.)",
        "We call these combinations of sentence, six words, and target IT concept a \"highlight group\" (figure 2).",
        "Each highlight group represents a task unit which we present to the worker in our crowdsourcing application.",
        "We generated 1000 highlight groups from",

        "We used CrowdFlower partly because of its automated quality control process.",
        "The bedrock of this process is the annotation of a small amount of gold standard data by the task designers.",
        "Crowd-Flower randomly selects gold-annotated tasks and presents them to workers amidst other unannotated tasks.",
        "Workers are evaluated by the percentage of gold-annotated tasks they perform correctly.",

        "They are permitted to write back to the task designer if they disagree with the gold judgement.",
        "This process functions in a manner analogous to the training of a machine-learning system.",
        "Furthermore, it permits CrowdFlower to exclude or reject low-quality results.",
        "Judgements from a worker who slips below 65% correctness are rated as untrustworthy and not included in the CrowdFlower s results.",
        "We created training gold in the manner recommended by CrowdFlower.",
        "We randomly selected 50 highlight groups from the 1000 mentioned in the previous section.",
        "We ran these examples through CrowdFlower using the interface we discuss in the next section.",
        "Then we used the CrowdFlower gold editor to select 30 highlight groups that contained clear classification decisions where it appeared that the workers were in relative consensus and where we agreed with their decision.",
        "Of these, we designated only the clearest-cut classifications as gold, leaving more ambiguous-seeming ones up to the users.",
        "For example, in the second highlight group in 2, we would designate software and systems as none and extend as positive in the training gold and the remainder as up to the workers.",
        "That would be a \"minimum effort\" to indicate that the worker understands the task the way we do.",
        "Unfortunately, CrowdFlower has some limitations in the way it processes the responses to gold – it is not possible to define a minimum effort precisely.",
        "CrowdFlower s setting either allow us to pass workers based on getting at least one item in each class correct or by placing all items in their correct classes.",
        "The latter is too strict a criterion for an inherently subjective task.",
        "So we accepted the former.",
        "We instead applied our minimum effort criterion in some of our experiments as described in section 4.3.",
        "We randomly selected another 200 highlight groups and posted them at 12 US cents for each set of three highlight groups, with at least three Mechanical Turk workers seeing each highlight group.",
        "The 30 training gold highlight groups were posted along with them.",
        "Including CrowdFlower and Amazon fees, the total cost was approximately 60 USD.",
        "We permitted only USA-based workers to access the task.",
        "Once initiated, the entire task took approximately 24 hours to complete.",
        "Each individual worker s ambiguous annotations are converted to none annotations, as the ambiguous box is intended as an outlet for a worker s uncertainty, but we choose to interpret anything that a worker considers too uncertain to be classified as positive or negative as something that is not strongly opinionated under our definitions.",
        "Aggregation is performed by majority vote of the annotators on each word in each highlight group.",
        "If no classification obtains more than 50% for a given word, the word is dropped as too ambiguous to be accepted either way as a result.",
        "This aggregation has the effect of smoothing out individual annotator differences.",
        "While CrowdFlower provides a first-pass quality control system for selecting annotators who are doing the task in good faith and with some understanding of the instructions, we wanted particularly to select annotators who would be more likely to be consistent on the most obvious cases without overly constraining them.",
        "Even with the same general idea of our intentions, some amount of variation among the annotators is unavoidable; how do we then reject annotations from those workers who pass Crowd-Flower s liberal criteria but still do not have an idea of annotation close enough to ours?",
        "Our solution was to score the annotators post hoc by their accuracy on our minimum-effort training gold data.",

        "We have been able to show that crowdsourcing a very fine-grained, domain-specific sentiment analysis task with a nonstandard, application-specific definition of sentiment is possible with careful user interface design and mutliple layers of quality control.",
        "Our techniques succeed on two different interpretations of the evaluation measure, and we can reclaim any lost words by rerunning the task.",
        "We used an elaborate processing pipeline before and after annotation in order to accomplish this.",
        "In this section, we discuss some aspects of the pipeline that led to the success of this technique.",
        "There are three major aspects of our procedure that directly affect the quality of our results: the first-pass quality control in CrowdFlower, the majority-vote aggregation, and the stringent post hoc filtering of workers.",
        "These interact in particular ways.",
        "The first-pass quality control interacts with the stringent filter in that even if it were possible to have run the stringent filter on CrowdFlower itself, it would probably not have been a good idea.",
        "Although we intended the stringent filter to be a minimum effort, it would have rejected workers too quickly.",
        "It is technically possible to implement the stringent filtering directly without the CrowdFlower built-in control, but that would have entailed spending an unpredictable amount more money paying for additional unwanted annotations from workers.",
        "Furthermore, the majority-vote aggregation requires that there not be too few annotators; our results show that filtering the workers too aggressively harms the aggregation's smoothing effect.",
        "The lesson we take from this is that it can be beneficial to accept some amount of \"bad\" with the \"good\" in implementing a very subjective crowdsourcing task.",
        "Our successful technique for identifying opinionated words was developed after multiple iterations using other approaches which did not succeed in themselves but produced outputs that were amenable to refinement, and so these techniques became part of a larger pipeline.",
        "However, the reasons why they did not succeed on their own are illustrative of some of the challenges in both fine-grained domain-specific opinion annotation and in annotation via crowd-sourcing under highly subjective conditions.",
        "We originally intended to stop with the trained annotation we described in 4.1.1, but collecting opinionated sentences in this corpus turned out to be very slow.",
        "Despite repeated training rounds, the annotators had a tendency to miss a large number of sentences that the authors found to be relevant.",
        "On discussion with the annotators, it turned out that the variable length of the articles made it easy to miss relevant sentences, particularly in the long feature articles likely to contain opinionated language – a kind of \"needle-in-a-haystack\" problem.",
        "Even worse, however, the annotators were variably conservative about what constituted an opinion.",
        "One annotator produced far fewer annotations than the other one – but the majority of her annotations were also annotated by the other one.",
        "Discussion with the annotators revealed that one of them simply had a tighter definition of what constituted an opinion.",

        "Insofar as we were looking for training data for use in downstream machine learning techniques, getting uniform sentence-by-sentence coverage of the corpus was not necessary.",
        "There are 77K sentences in this corpus which mention the relevant IT concepts; even if only a fraction of them mention the IT concepts with opinionated language, we would still have a potentially rich source of training data.",
        "Nevertheless the direct annotation with trained annotators provided data for selecting candidate sentences for a more rapid annotation.",
        "We used the process in section 4.1.2 and chose the top-ranked sentences.",
        "Then we constructed a task design that divided the annotation into two phases.",
        "In the first phase, for each candidate sentence, we ask the annotator whether or not the sentence contains opinionated language about the mentioned IT concept.",
        "(We permit \"unsure\" answers.)",
        "In the second phase, for each candidate sentence for which a majority vote of annotators decided that the sentence contained a relevant opinion, we run a second task asking whether particular words (selected as per section 4.1.3) were words directly involved in the expression of the opinion.",
        "We tested this process with the 90 top-ranked sentences.",
        "Four individuals in our laboratory answered the \"yes/no/unsure\" question of the first phase.",
        "However, when we took their pairwise Cohen's k score, no two got more than approximately 0.4.",
        "We also took majority votes of each subset of three annotators and found the Cohen's k between them and the fourth.",
        "The highest score was 0.7, but the score was not stable, and we could not trust the results enough to move onto the second phase.",
        "We also ran this first phase through Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "It turned out that it was far too easy to cheat on this yes/no question, and some workers simply answered \"yes\" or \"no\" all the time.",
        "Agreement scores of a Turker majority vote vs. one of the authors turned out to yield a Cohen's k of 0.05 – completely unacceptable.",
        "Discussion with the in-laboratory annotators suggested the roots of the problem: it was the same problem as with the direct Atlas.ti annotation we reported in the previous section.",
        "It was very difficult for them to agree on what it meant for a sentence to contain an opinion expressed about a particular concept.",
        "Opinions about the nature of opinion ranged from very \"conservative\" to very \"liberal.\"",
        "Even explicit definition with examples led annotators to reach very different conclusions.",
        "Furthermore, the longer the annotators thought about it, the more confused and uncertain they were about the criterion.",
        "What is an opinion can itself be a matter of opinion.",
        "It became clear that without very tight review of annotation and careful task design, asking users an explicit yes/no question about whether a particular concept has a particular opinion mentioned in a particular sentence has the potential to induce over-thinking by annotators, despite our variations on the task.",
        "The difficulty may also lead to a tendency to cheat.",
        "Crowdsourcing allows us to make use of nonexpert labour on difficult tasks if we can break the tasks down into simple questions and aggregate nonexpert responses, but we needed a somewhat more complex task design in order to eliminate the difficulty of the task and the tendency to cheat."
