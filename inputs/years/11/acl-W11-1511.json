        "The Voynich manuscript, also referred to as the VMS, is an illustrated medieval folio written in an undeciphered script.",
        "There are several reasons why the study of the manuscript is of interest to the natural language processing community, besides its appeal as a long-enduring unsolved mystery.",
        "Since even the basic structure of the text is unknown, it provides a perfect opportunity for the application of unsupervised learning algorithms.",
        "Furthermore, while the manuscript has been examined by various scholars, it has much to benefit from attention by a community with the right tools and knowledge of linguistics, text analysis, and machine learning.",
        "This paper presents a review of what is currently known about the VMS, as well as some original observations.",
        "Although the manuscript raises several questions about its origin, authorship, the illustrations, etc., we focus on the text through questions about its properties.",
        "These range from the level of the letter (for example, are there vowels and consonants?)",
        "to the page (do pages have topics?)",
        "to the document as a whole (are the pages in order?",
        ").",

        "From the illustrations - hairstyles and features of the human figures - as well as the shapes of the glyphs, the manuscript is posited to have been created in Europe.",
        "Carbon-dating at the University of Arizona has found that the vellum was created in the 15 thcentury, and the McCrone Research Institute has asserted that the ink was added shortly afterwards.",
        "The exact history of the VMS is not established.",
        "According to Zandbergen (2010), the earliest owner that it can be traced to is Jacobus de Tepenec in Prague in the early 1600s.",
        "It is speculated that it was given to him by Emperor Rudolf II, but it is unclear how and from where the manuscript entered Prague.",
        "The VMS appears to have circulated in Prague for some time, before being sent to Athanasius Kircher in Italy in 1665.",
        "It remained in Italy until 1912, when it was sold to Wilfrid Voynich, who brought it to America.",
        "It was then sold to the bookdealer Kraus, who later donated it to the Yale University library, where it is currently housed.",
        "The manuscript is divided into quires - sections made out of folded parchment, each of which consists of folios, with writing on both sides of each folio (Reeds, 2002).",
        "Including blank pages and pages with no text, there are 240 pages, although it is believed that some are missing (Pelling, 2006).",
        "225 pages include text, and most are illustrated.",
        "The text was probably added after the illustrations, and shows no evidence of scratching or correction.",
        "The text is written left to right in paragraphs that are left-aligned, justified, and divided by whitespace into words.",
        "Paragraphs do not span multiple pages.",
        "A few glyphs are ambiguous, since they can be interpreted as a distinct character, or a ligature of two or more other characters.",
        "Different transcriptions of the manuscript have been created, depending on various interpretations of the glyphs.",
        "We use a machine-readable transcription based on the alphabet proposed by Currier (1976), edited by D'Imperio (1980) and others, made available by the members of the Voynich Manuscript Mailing List (Gillogly and Reeds, 2005) at http://www.voynich.net/reeds/gillogly/voynich.now.",
        "The Currier transcription maps the characters to the ASCII symbols A-Z, 0-9, and *.",
        "Under this transcription, the VMS is comprised of 225 pages, 8114 word types, and 37919 word tokens.",
        "Figure 1 shows a sample VMS page and its Currier transcription.",
        "Based on the illustrations, the manuscript has traditionally been divided into six sections: (1) herbal, containing drawings of plants; (2) Astronomical, containing zodiac-like illustrations; (3) Biological, mainly containing drawings of female human figures; (4) Cosmological, consisting of circular illustrations; (5) Pharmaceutical, containing drawing of small containers and parts of plants, and (6) Stars (sometimes referred to as Recipes), containing very dense text with drawings of stars in the margins.",
        "Currier (1976) observed from letter and substring frequencies that the text is comprised of two distinct 'languages', A and B. Interestingly, the Biological and Stars sections are mainly written in the B language, and the rest mainly in A.",
        "Using a two-state bigram HMM over the entire text, we find that the two word classes induced by EM more or less correspond to the same division - words in pages classified as being in the A language tend to be tagged as one class, and words in B language pages as the other, indicating that the manuscript does indeed contain two different vocabularies (which may be related languages, dialects, or simply different textual domains).",

        "For coherence, all our experimental results in the rest of this paper are on the B language (which we denote by VMS B) - specifically, the Biological and Stars sections - unless otherwise specified.",
        "These sections together contain 43 pages, with 3920 word types, 17597 word tokens, and 35 characters.",
        "We compare the VMS's statistical properties with three natural language texts of similar size: the first 28551 words from the English Wall Street Journal Corpus, 19327 words from the Arabic Quran (in Buckwalter transcription), and 18791 words from the Chinese Sinica Treebank."

        "If a script is alphabetic, i.e., it uses approximately one character per phoneme, vowel and consonant characters can be separated in a fully unsupervised way.",
        "Guy (1991) applies the vowel-consonant separation algorithm of (Sukhotin, 1962) on two pages of the Biological section, and finds that four characters (O, A, C, G) separate out as vowels.",
        "However, the separation is not very strong, and several words do not contain these characters.",
        "Another method is to use a two-state bigram HMM (Knight et al., 2006; Goldsmith and Xanthos, 2009) over letters, and induce two clusters of letters with EM.",
        "In alphabetic languages like English, the clusters correspond almost perfectly to vowels and consonants.",
        "We find that a curious phenomenon occurs with the VMS - the last character of every word is generated by one of the HMM states, and all other characters by another; i.e., the word grammar is a*b.",
        "There are a few possible interpretations of this.",
        "It is possible that the vowels from every word are removed and placed at the end of the word, but this means that even long words have only one vowel, which is unlikely.",
        "Further, the number of vowel types would be nearly half the alphabet size.",
        "If the script is a syllabary or a logograph, a similar clustering will surface, but given that there are only 35 characters, it is unlikely that each of them represents a syllable or word.",
        "A more likely explanation is that the script is an abjad, like the scripts of Semitic languages, where all or most vowels are omitted.",
        "Indeed, we find that a 2-state HMM on Arabic without diacritics and English without vowels learns a similar grammar, a*b+.",
        "Some characters (F, B, P, V) that appear mainly at paragraphs beginnings are referred to 'gallows' glyphs that are taller and more ornate than others.",
        "Among the glyphs, these least resemble Latin, leading to the belief that they are null symbols, which Morningstar (2001) refutes.",
        "Another hypothesis is that gallows are uppercase versions of other characters.",
        "We define BestSub(c) to be the character x that produces the highest decrease in unigram word entropy when x is substituted for all instances of c. For English uppercase characters c, BestSub(c) is the lowercase version.",
        "However, BestSub of the VMS gallows is one of the other gallows!",
        "This demonstrates that they are not uppercase versions of other letters, and also that they are contextually similar to one another.",
        "We define punctuation as symbols that occur only at word edges, whose removal from the word results in an existing word.",
        "There are two characters that are only found at the ends of words (Currier k and l), but most of the words produced by removing k and l are not in the vocabulary.",
