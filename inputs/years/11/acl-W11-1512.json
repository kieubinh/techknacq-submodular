        "The interesting text segments could be identified using for example semantic features or morphological and syntactic cues in the text.",
        "This would however require natural language processing tools capable of handling historical texts, which are in many respects different from contemporary written language, concerning both spelling and syntax.",
        "Ideally, one would of course like to have tools developed specifically for the time period of interest, and emerging efforts to develop resources and tools for historical languages are therefore welcome.",
        "Despite these efforts, however, it is unlikely that we will have anything close to complete coverage of different time periods even for a single language within the foreseeable future.",
        "In this paper, we will therefore instead examine the possibility of improving information access in historical texts by adapting language technology tools developed for contemporary written language.",

        "For the morphological analyser, the main focus in formulating the rules has been on handling verb forms.",
        "Secondly, to avoid being limited to a small set of rules, an incremental normalisation procedure has been used for the morphological analyser in order to maximise recall without sacrificing precision.",
        "In this incremental process, normalisation rules are applied one by one, and the less confident rules are only applied to words not identified by the morphological analyser in the previous normalisation step.",
        "The tagger on the other hand is robust, always yielding a tag for each token, even in cases where the word form is not present in the dictionary.",

        "In the ongoing Gender and Work project at the Department of History, Uppsala University, historians are interested in what men and women did for a living in the early modern Swedish Society.",
        "Information on this is registered and made available for research in a database, most often in the form of a verb and its object(s).",
        "The automatic verb extraction tool was developed in close cooperation with the Gender and Work participants, with the aim of reducing the manual effort involved in finding the relevant information to enter into the database.",
        "The verb extraction tool was integrated in a prototypical graphical user interface, enabling the historians to run the system on historical texts of their choice.",
        "The interface provides facilities for uploading files, generating a list of all the verbs in the file, displaying verb concordances for interesting verbs, and displaying the verb in a larger context.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the graphical user interface, displaying concordances for the verb anklaga (\"accuse\").",
        "The historians found the interface useful and are interested in integrating the tool in the Gender and Work database.",
        "Further development of the verb extraction tool is now partly funded by the Gender and Work project.",

        "Today historians and other researchers working on older texts have to manually go through large volumes of text when searching for information on for example culture or social structure in historical times.",
        "In this paper we have shown that this time-consuming manual effort could be significantly reduced using contemporary natural language processing tools to display only those text segments that may be of interest to the researcher.",
        "We have described the development of a tool that automatically identifies verbs in historical Swedish texts using morphological analysis and tagging, and a prototypical graphical user interface, integrating this tool.",
        "The results indicate that it is possible to retrieve verbs in Swedish texts from the 17th century with 82% precision and 88% recall, using morphological tools for contemporary Swedish, if the text is normalised into a more modern spelling before the morphological tools are applied (recall may be increased to 92% if a lower precision is accepted).",
        "Adding electronically available dictionaries covering medieval Swedish and 19th century Swedish respectively to the verb extraction tool, did not improve the results as compared to using only contemporary NLP tools.",
        "This seems to be partly due to the dictionaries still being in an early stage of development, where lexical coverage is unevenly spread among different word classes, and frequent, irregularly inflected word forms are not covered.",
        "It would therefore be interesting to study the results of the historical dictionary lookup, when the dictionaries are more mature.",
        "Since the present extraction tool has been evaluated on one single text, it would also be interesting to explore how these extraction methods should be adapted to handle language variation in texts from different genres and time periods.",
        "Due to the lack of spelling conventions, it would also be interesting to see how the extraction process performs on texts from the same period and genre, but written by different authors.",
        "Future work also includes experiments on identifying linguistic categories other than verbs."
