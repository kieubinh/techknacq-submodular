      "text": [
        "Surviving newspapers are among the richest sources of information available to scholars studying peoples and cultures of the past 250 years, particularly for research on the history of the United States.",
        "Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, newspapers served as the central venues for nearly all substantive discussions and debates in American society.",
        "By the mid-nineteenth century, nearly every community (no matter how small) boasted at least one newspaper.",
        "Within these pages, Americans argued with one another over politics, advertised and conducted economic business, and published articles and commentary on virtually all aspects of society and daily life.",
        "Only here can scholars find editorials from the 1870s on the latest political controversies, advertisements for the latest fashions, articles on the latest sporting events, and languid poetry from a local artist, all within one source.",
        "Newspapers, in short, document more completely the full range of the human experience than nearly any other source available to modern scholars, providing windows into the past available nowhere else.",
        "Despite their remarkable value, newspapers have long remained among the most underutilized historical resources.",
        "The reason for this paradox is quite simple: the sheer volume and breadth of information available in historical newspapers has, ironically, made it extremely difficult for historians to go through them page-by-page for a given research project.",
        "A historian, for example, might need to wade through tens of thousands of newspaper pages in order to answer a single research question (with no guarantee of stumbling onto the necessary information).",
        "Recently, both the research potential and problem of scale associated with historical newspapers has expanded greatly due to the rapid digitization of these sources.",
        "The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LOC), for example, are sponsoring a nationwide historical digitization project, Chronicling America, geared toward digitizing all surviving historical newspapers in the United States, from 1836 to the present.",
        "This project recently digitized its one millionth page (and they project to have more than 20 million pages within a few years), opening a vast wealth of historical newspapers in digital form.",
        "While projects such as Chronicling America have indeed increased access to these important sources, they have also increased the problem of scale that have long prevent scholars from using these sources in meaningful ways.",
        "Indeed, without tools and methods capable of handling such large datasets and thus sifting out meaningful patterns embedded within them - scholars find themselves confined to performing only basic word searches across enormous collections.",
        "These simple searches can, indeed, find stray information scattered in unlikely places.",
        "Such rudimentary search tools, however, become increasingly less useful to researchers as datasets continue to grow in size.",
        "If a search for a particular term yields 4,000,000 results, even those search results produce a dataset far too large for any single scholar to analyze in a meaningful way using traditional methods.",
        "The age of abundance, it turns out, can simply overwhelm historical scholars, as the sheer volume of available digitized historical newspapers is beginning to do.",
        "In this paper, we explore the use of topic modeling, in an attempt to identify the most important and potentially interesting topics over a given period of time.",
        "Thus, instead of asking a historian to look through thousands of newspapers to identify what may be interesting topics, we take a reverse approach, where we first automatically cluster the data into topics, and then provide these automatically identified topics to the historian so she can narrow her scope to focus on the individual patterns in the dataset that are most applicable to her research.",
        "Of more utility would be where the modeling would reveal unexpected topics that point towards unusual patterns previously unknown, thus help shaping a scholar's subsequent research.",
        "The topic modeling can be done for any periods of time, which can consist of individual years or can cover several years at a time.",
        "In this way, we can see the changes in the discussions and topics of interest over the years.",
        "Moreover, pre-filters can also be applied to the data prior to the topic modeling.",
        "For instance, since research being done in the History department at our institution is concerned with the \"U. S. cotton economy,\" we can use the same approach to identify the interesting topics mentioned in the news articles that talk about the issue of\"cotton.\""

        "Both pLSA and LDA models are probabilistic models that look at each document as a mixture of multinomials or topics.",
        "The models decompose the document collection into groups of words representing the main topics.",

        "These are the subcategories we chose as samples:",
        "• Newspapers from 1865-1901: During this period, Texans rebuilt their society in the aftermath of the American Civil War.",
        "With the abolition of slavery in 1865, Texans (both black and white) looked to rebuild their postwar economy by investing heavily in cotton production throughout the state.",
        "Cotton was considered a safe investment, and so Texans produced enough during this period to make Texas the largest cotton producer in the United States by 1901.",
        "Yet overproduction during that same period impoverished Texas farmers by driving down the market price for cotton, and thus a large percentage went bankrupt and lost their lands (over 50 percent by 1900).",
        "As a result, angry cotton farmers in Texas during the 1890s joined a new political party, the Populists, whose goal was to use the national government to improve the economic conditions of farmers.",
        "This effort failed by 1896, although it represented one of the largest third-party political revolts in American history.",
        "This period, then, was dominated by the rise of cotton as the foundation of the Texas economy, the financial failures of Texas farmers, and their unsuccessful political protests of the 1890s as cotton bankrupted people across the state.",
        "These are the issues we would expect to emerge as important topics from newspapers in this category.",
        "This dataset consists of 52,555 pages over 5,902 issues.",
        "• Newspapers from 1892: This was the year of the formation of the Populist Party, which a large portion of Texas farmers joined for the U. S. presidential election of 1892.",
        "The Populists sought to have the U. S. federal government become actively involved in regulating the economy in places like Texas (something never done before) in order to prevent cotton farmers from going further into debt.",
        "In the 1892 election, the Populists did surprisingly well (garnering about 10 percent ofthe vote nationally) and won a full 23 percent of the vote in Texas.",
        "This dataset consists of 1,303 pages over 223 issues.",
        "• Newspapers from 1893: A major economic depression hit the United States in 1893, devastating the economy in every state, including Texas.",
        "This exacerbated the problem of cotton within the states economy, and heightened the efforts of the Populists within Texas to push for major political reforms to address these problems.",
        "What we see in 1893, then, is a great deal of stress that should exacerbate trends within Texas society of that year (and thus the content of the newspapers).",
        "This dataset consists of 3,490 pages over 494 issues.",
        "• Newspapers from 1929-1930: These years represented the beginning and initial onset in the United States of the Great Depression.",
        "The United States economy began collapsing in October 1929, when the stock market crashed and began a series of economic failures that soon brought down nearly the entire U. S. economy.",
        "Texas, with its already shaky economic dependence on cotton, was as devastated as any other state.",
        "As such, this period was marked by discussions about how to save both the cotton economy of Texas and about possible government intervention into the economy to prevent catastrophe.",
        "This dataset consists of6,590 pages over 973 issues.",

        "Within the date ranges listed above, we also select all mentions of the topic \"cotton\" - as pertaining to possible discussion relevant to the \"U. S. cotton economy.\"",
        "Cotton was the dominating economic force in Texas throughout this period, and historians have long recognized that issues related to the crop wielded tremendous influence on the political, social, and economic development of the state during this era.",
        "Problems related to cotton, for example, bankrupted half of all Texas farmers between 1865 and 1900, and those financial challenges pushed farmers to create a major new political party during the 1890s.",
        "Before applying topic modeling on our data, some preprocessing steps were applied.",
        "Some challenges in processing the dataset come from errors introduced by the OCR processing, missing punctuations, and unclear separation between different articles on the same page.",
        "Multi-stage preprocessing of the dataset was performed to reduce these errors, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The first phase to reduce errors starts with spelling correction, which replaces words using the Aspell dictionary and de-hyphenates words split across lines.",
        "Suggested replacements are used if they are within the length normalized edit distance of the originals.",
        "An extra dictionary list of location names is used with Aspell.",
        "Next, the spelling corrected dataset is run through the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER).Stanford NER system first detects sentences in the data then labels four classes of named entities: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, and MISCELLANEOUS (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "The model used in conjunction with the tagger is provided by the software and was trained on the CoNLL 2003 training data using distributional similarity features.",
        "The output is then massaged so that entities with multiple words would stay together in the topic modeling phase.",
        "Lastly, the words that are not tagged as named entities pass through an English stemmer while the named entities stay unchanged.",
        "We are using the Snowball stemmer.",
        "At the end ofeach ofthe preprocessing stage, we extract subsets from the data corresponding to the sample years mentioned earlier (1865-1901, 1892, 1893, and 1929-1930), which are then used for further processing in the topic modeling phase.",
        "We made cursory comparisons of the outputs of the topic modeling at each of the three stages (spelling correction, NER, stemming).",
        "Table 4 shows sample topic groups generated at the three stages.",
        "We found that skipping the named entity tagging and stemming phases still gives comparable results.",

        "In this paper, we explored the use of topical models applied on historical newspapers to assist historical research.",
        "We have found that we can automatically generate topics that are generally good, however we found that once we generated a set oftopics, we cannot decide if it is mundane or interesting without an expert and, for example, would have been oblivious to the significance of the San Jacinto topic.",
        "We agree with Block (2006) that \"topic simulation is only a tool\" and have come to the conclusion that it is essential that an expert in the field contextualize these topics and evaluate them for relevancy.",
        "We also found that although our corpus contains noise from OCR errors, it may not need expensive error correction processing to provide good results when using topic models.",
        "We may explore combining the named entity tagged data with a less aggressive stemmer and, additionally, evaluate the usefulness of not discarding the unstemmed words but maintaining their association with their stemmed counterpart.",
        "Acknowledgment",
        "We would like to thank Jon Christensen and Cameron Blevins from Stanford, who have been working with us on the larger project, \"Mapping Historical Texts: Combining Text-Mining and Geo-Visualization to Unlock the Research Potential of Historical Newspapers\", which subsumes the work we have presented in this paper.",
