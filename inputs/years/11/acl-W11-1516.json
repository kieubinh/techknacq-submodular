        "Academic collaboration is on the rise as single authored work becomes less common across the sciences (Rawlings and McFarland, 2011; Jones et al., 2008; Newman, 2001).",
        "In part, this rise can be attributed to the increasing specialization of individual academics and the broadening in scope of the problems they tackle.",
        "But there are other advantages to collaboration, as well: they can speed up production, diffuse knowledge across authors, help train new scientists, and are thought to encourage greater innovation.",
        "Moreover, they can integrate scholarly communities and foster knowledge transfer between related fields.",
        "But all collaborations aren't the same: different collaborators contribute different material, assume different roles, and experience the collaboration in different ways.",
        "In this paper, we present a new frame for thinking about the variation in collaboration types and develop a computational metric to characterize the distinct contributions and roles of each collaborator within the scholarly material they produce.",
        "The topic of understanding collaborations has attracted much interest in the social sciences over the years.",
        "Recently, it has gained traction in computer science, too, in the form of social network analysis.",
        "Much work focuses on studying networks formed via citations (Radev et al., 2009; White and Mccain, 1998), as well as co-authorship links (Nascimento et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2005).",
        "However, these works focus largely on the graphical structure derived from paper citations and author co-occurrences, and less on the textual content of the papers themselves.",
        "In this work, we examine the nature of academic collaboration using text as a primary component.",
        "We propose a theoretical framework for determining the types of collaboration present in a document, based on factors such as the number of established authors, the presence of unestablished authors and the similarity of the established authors' past work to the document's term vector.",
        "These collaboration types attempt to describe the nature of co-authorships between students and advisors (e.g. \"apprentice\" versus \"new blood\") as well as those solely between established authors in the field.",
        "We present a decision diagram for classifying papers into these types, as well as a description of the intuition behind each collaboration class.",
        "We explore our theory with a computational method to categorize collaborative works into their collaboration types using an approach based on topic modeling, where we model every paper as a latent mixture of its authors.",
        "For our system, we use Labeled-LDA (LLDA (Ramage et al., 2009)) to train models over the ACL corpus for every year of the words best attributed to each author in all the papers they write.",
        "We use the resulting author signatures as a basis for several metrics that can classify each document by its collaboration type.",
        "We qualitatively analyze our results by examining the categorization of several high impact papers.",
        "With consultation from prominent researchers and textbook writers in the field, we demonstrate that our system is able to differentiate between the various types of collaborations in our suggested taxonomy, based only on words used, at low but statistically significant accuracy.",

        "In recent years, popular topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) have been increasingly used to study the history of science by observing the changing trends in term based topics (Hall et al., 2008), (Gerrish and Blei, 2010).",
        "In the case of Hall et al., regular LDA topic models were trained over the ACL anthology on a per year basis, and the changing trends in topics were studied from year to year.",
        "Gerrish and Blei's work computed a measure of influence by using Dynamic Topic Models (Blei and Lafferty, 2006) and studying the change of statistics of the language used in a corpus.",
        "These models propose interesting ideas for utilizing topic modeling to understand aspects of scientific history.",
        "However, our primary interest, in this paper, is the study of academic collaboration between different authors; we therefore look to learn models for authors instead of only documents.",
        "Popular topic models for authors include the Author-Topic Model (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), a simple extension of regular LDA that adds an additional author variable over the topics.",

        "Alternatively, Labeled LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), another LDA variation, offers us the ability to directly model authors as topics by considering them to be the topic labels for the documents they author.",

        "As in (Halletal., 2008) and (Gerrish and Blei, 2010), we learn a new topic model for each year in the corpus, allowing us to account for changing author interests over time."

        "The experiments and results discussed in this paper are based on a variation of the LDA topic model run over data from the ACL corpus.",
        "We use the ACL anthology from years 1965 to 2009, training over 12,908 papers authored by over 11,355 unique authors.",
        "We train our per year topic models over the entire dataset; however, when evaluating our results, we are only concerned with papers that were authored by multiple individuals as the other papers are not collaborations.",
        "Every abstract in our dataset reflects the work, to some greater or lesser degree, of all the authors of that work.",
        "We model these degrees explicitly using a latent mixture of authors model, which takes its inspiration from the learning machinery of LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and its supervised variant Labeled LDA (Ramage et al., 2009).",
        "These models assume that documents are as a mixture of 'topics,' which themselves are probability distributions over the words in the vocabulary of the corpus.",
        "LDA is completely unsupervised, assuming that a latent topic layer exists and that each word is generated from one underlying topic from this set of latent topics.",
        "For our purposes, we use a variation of LDA in which we assume each document to be a latent mixture of its authors.",
        "Unlike LDA, where each document draws a multinomial over all topics, the latent mixture of authors model we use restricts a document to only sample from topics corresponding to its authors.",
        "Also, unlike models such as the Author-Topic Model (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), where authors are modeled as distributions over latent topics, our model associates each author to exactly one topic, modeling authors directly as distributions over words.",
        "Like other topic models, we will assume a generative process for our collection of D documents from a vocabulary of size V. We assume that each document d has Nd terms and Md authors from a set of authors A.",
        "Each author is described by a multinomial distribution ÃŸa over words V, which is initially unobserved.",
        "We will recover for each document a hidden multinomial of length Md that describes which mixture of authors' best describes the document.",
        "This multinomial is in turn drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with parameter a restrict to the set of authors A(d) for that paper.",
        "Each document's words are generated by first picking an author z from and then drawing a word from the corresponding author's word distribution.",
        "Formally, the generative process is as follows:",
        "â€¢ For each author a, generate a distribution ÃŸa over the vocabulary from a Dirichlet prior /",
        "â€¢ For each document d, generate a multinomial mixture distribution â€“ Dir(a..1X(d) )",
        "â€¢ For each document d,",
        "We use Gibbs sampling to perform inference in this model.",
        "If we consider our authors as a label space, this model is equivalent to that of Labeled LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), which we use for inference in our model, using the variational objective in the open source implementation.",
        "After inference, our model discovers the distribution over terms that best describes that author's work in the presence of other authors.",
        "This distribution serves as a 'signature' for an author and is dominated by the terms that author uses frequently across collaborations.",
        "It is worth noting that this model constrains the learned 'topics' to authors, ensuring directly interpretable results that do not require the interpretation of a latent topic space, such as in (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004).",
        "To imbue our model with a notion of time, we train a separate LLDA model for each year in the corpus, training on only those papers written before and during the given year.",
        "Thus, we have separate 'signatures' for each author for each year, and each signature only contains information for the specific author's work up to and including the given year.",

        "Once we have a robust way to score different kinds of collaborations in ACL, we can begin to use these scores as a quantitative tool to study phonemena in the computational linguistics community.",
        "With our current technique, we discovered a number of negative results; however, given that our accuracy in binary classification of categories is relatively low, we cannot state for sure whether these are true negative results or a limitation of our model.",
        "Among the questions we looked into, we found the following results:",
        "â€¢ There was no signal indicating that authors who started out as new blood authors were any more or less likely to survive than authors who started out as apprentices.",
        "Survival was measured both by the number of papers eventually published by the author as well as the year of the author's final publication; however, calculations by neither measure correlated with the MaxSim scores of the authors' early papers.",
        "â€¢ Each author in the corpus was labeled for gender.",
        "Gender didn't appear to differentiate how people collaborated.",
        "In particular, there was no difference between men and women based on how they started their careers.",
        "Women and men are equally likely to begin as new blood authors as they are to begin as apprentices.",
        "â€¢ On a similar note, established male authors are equally likely to partake in new blood or apprentice collaborations as their female counterparts.",
        "â€¢ No noticeable difference existed between average page rank scores of a certain categorization of collaborative papers (e.g. high synergy papers vs. low synergy papers).",
        "It is difficult to conclusively demonstrate negative results, particularly given that our MaxSim scores are by themselves not particularly strong discriminators in the binary classification tasks.",
        "We consider these findings to be tentative and an opportunity to explore in the future."

      "heading": "8. Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "Not everything we need to know about academic collaborations can be found in the co-authorship graph.",
        "Indeed, as we have argued, not all types of collaborations are equal, as embodied by differing levels of seniority and contribution from each co-author.",
        "In this work, we have taken a first step toward computationally modeling these differences using a latent mixture of authors model and applied it to our own field, Computational Linguistics.",
        "We used the model to examine how collaborative works differ by authors and subfields in the ACL anthology.",
        "Our model quantifies the extent to which some authors are more prone to being 'hedgehogs,' whereby they heavily focus on certain specific areas, whilst others are more diverse with their fields of study and may be analogized with 'foxes.'",
        "We also saw that established authors in certain subfields have more deviation from their previous work than established authors in different subfields.",
        "This could imply that the former fields, such as 'Sentiment Analysis' or 'Summarization,' are more open to new blood and synergistic ideas, while other latter fields, like 'Statistical Machine Translation' or 'Speech Recognition' are more formal or require more training.",
        "Alternatively, 'Summarization' or 'Sentiment Analysis' could just still be younger fields whose language is still evolving and being influenced by other subareas.",
        "This work takes a first step toward a new way of thinking about the contributions of individual authors based on their network of areas.",
        "There are many design parameters that still exist in this space, including alternative text models that take into account richer structure and, hopefully, perform better at discriminating between the types of collaborations we identified.",
        "We intend to use the ACL anthology as our test bed for continuing to work on textual models of collaboration types.",
        "Ultimately, we hope to apply the lessons we learn on modeling this familiar corpus to the challenge of answering large-scale questions about the nature of collaboration as embodied by large scale publication databases such as ISI and Pubmed."
