        "There are many instances where it is reasonable to expect machines to produce text automatically.",
        "Traditionally, this was tackled as a concept-to-text realization problem.",
        "However, such needs apply sometimes to cases where a new text should be derived from some existing texts, an instance of text-to-text generation.",
        "The general idea is not anymore to produce a text from data, but to transform a text so as to ensure that it has desirable properties appropriate for some intended application (Zhao et al., 2009).",
        "For example, one may want a text to be shorter (Cohn and Lapata, 2008), tailored to some reader profile (Zhu et al., 2010), compliant with some specific norms (Max, 2004), or more adapted for subsequent machine processing tasks (Chandrasekar et al., 1996).",
        "The generation process must produce a text having a meaning which is compatible with the definition of the task at hand (e.g. strict paraphrasing for document normalization, relaxed paraphrasing for text simplification), while ensuring that it remains grammatically correct.",
        "Its complexity, compared with concept-to-text generation, mostly stems from the fact that the semantic relationship between the original text and the new one is more difficult to control, as the mapping from one text to another is very dependent on the rewriting context.",
        "The wide variety of techniques for acquiring phrasal paraphrases, which can subsequently be used by text paraphrasing techniques (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), the inherent polysemy of such linguistic units and the pragmatic constraints on their uses make it impossible to ensure that potential paraphrase pairs will be substitutable in any context, an observation which was already made at a lexical level (Zhao et al., 2007).",
        "Hence, automatic contextual validation of candidate rewritings is a fundamental issue for text paraphrasing with phrasal units.",
        "In this article, we tackle the problem of what we call targeted paraphrasing, defined as the rewriting of a subpart of a sentence, as in e.g. (Resnik et al., 2010) where it is applied to making parts of sentences easier to translate automatically.",
        "While this problem is simpler than full sentence rewriting, its study is justified as it should be handled correctly for the more complex task to be successful.",
        "Moreover, being simpler, it offers evaluation scenarios which make the performance on the task easier to assess.",
        "Our particular experiments here aim to assist a Wikipedia contributor in revising a text to improve its quality.",
        "For this, we use a collection of phrases that have been rewritten in Wikipedia, and test the substitutability of paraphrases coming from a repertoire of sub-sentential paraphrases acquired from different sources.",
        "We thus consider that preexisting repertoires of sub-sentential paraphrase pairs are available, and that each potential candidate has to be tested in the specific context of the desired rewriting.",
        "Due to the large variety of potential phrases and their associated known paraphrases, we do not rely on precomputed models of substitutability, but rather build them on-the-fly using information derived from web queries.",
        "This article is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we first describe the task of text revision, where a subpart of a sentence is rewritten, as an instance of targeted paraphrasing.",
        "Section 3 presents previous works on the acquisition of sub-sentential paraphrases and describes the knowledge sources that we have used in this work.",
        "We then describe in section 4 how we estimate models of phrase substitution in context by exploiting information coming from the web.",

        "One of the important processes of text revision is the rewording of parts of sentences.",
        "Some rewordings are not intended to alter meaning significantly, but rather to make text more coherent and easier to comprehend.",
        "Those instances which express close meanings are sub-sentential paraphrases: in their simpler form, they can involve synonym substitution, but they can involve more complex deeper lexical-syntactic transformations.",
        "Such rephrasings are commonly found in recordings of text revisions, which now exist in large quantities in the collaborative editing model of Wikipedia.",
        "In fact, revision histories of the encyclopedia contain a significant amount of sub-sentential paraphrases, as shown by the study of (Dutrey et al., 2011).",
        "This study also reports that there is an important variety of rephrasing phenomena, as illustrated by the difficulty of reaching a good identification coverage using a rule-based term variant identification engine.",
        "!Note that using the web may not always be appropriate, or that at least it should be used in a different way than what we propose in this article, in particular in cases where the desired properties of the rewritten text are better described in controlled corpora.",
        "The use of automatic targeted paraphrasing as an authoring aid has been illustrated by the work of Max and Zock (2008), in which writers are presented with potential paraphrases of sub-sentential fragments that they wish to reword.",
        "The automatic paraphrasing technique used is a contextual variant of bilingual translation pivoting (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "It has also been proposed to externalize various text editing tasks, including proofreading, by having crowdsourcing functions on text directly from word processors (Bernstein et al., 2010).",
        "Text improvements may also be more specifically targeted for automatic applications.",
        "In the work by Resnik et al.",
        "(2010), rephrasings for specific phrases are acquired through crowdsourcing.",
        "Difficult-to-translate phrases in the source text are first identified, and monolingual contributors are asked to provide rephrasings in context.",
        "Collected rephrasings can then be used as input for a Machine Translation system, which can positively exploit the increased variety in expression to produce more confident translations for better estimated source units (Schroeder et al., 2009).",
        "For instance, the phrase in bold in the sentence The number of people known to have died has now reached 358 can be rewritten as 1) who died, 2) identified to have died and 3) known to have passed away.",
        "All such rephrasings are grammatically correct, the first one being significantly shorter, and they all convey a meaning which is reasonably close to the original wording.",
        "The task of rewriting complete sentences has also been addressed in various works (e.g. (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2010)).",
        "It poses, however, numerous other challenges, in particular regarding how it could be correctly evaluated.",
        "Human judgments of whole sentence transformations are complex and intra-and inter-judge coherence is difficult to attain with hypotheses of comparable quality.",
        "Using sentential paraphrases to support a given task (e.g. providing alternative reference translations for optimizing Statistical Machine Translation systems (Madnani et al., 2008)) can be seen as a proxy for extrinsic evaluation of the quality of paraphrases, but it is not clear from published results that improvements on the task are clearly correlated with the quality of the produced paraphrases.",
        "Lastly, automatic metrics have been proposed for evaluating the grammaticality of sentences (e.g. (Mutton et al., 2007)).",
        "Automatic evaluation of sentential paraphrases has not produced any consensual results so far, as they do not integrate task-specific considerations and can be strongly biased towards some paraphrasing techniques.",
        "In this work, we tackle the comparatively more modest task of sub-sentential paraphrasing applied to text revision.",
        "In order to use an unbiased task, we use a corpus of naturally-occurring rewritings from an authoring memory of Wikipedia articles.",
        "We use the WiCoPaCo corpus (Max and Wisniewski, 2010), a collection of local rephras-ings from the edit history of Wikipedia which contains instances of lexical, syntactical and semantic rephrasings (Dutrey et al., 2011), the latter type being illustrated by the following example: Ce vers de Nuit rh√©nane d'Apollinaire [qui para√Æt presque sans structure rythmique ‚Äì dont la c√©sure est comme masqu√©e]...",
        "The appropriateness of this corpus for our work is twofold: first, the fact that it contains naturally-occurring rewritings provides us with an interesting source of text spans in context which have been rewritten.",
        "Moreover, for those instances where the meaning after rewriting was not significantly altered, it provides us with at least one candidate rewriting that should be considered as a correct paraphrase, which can be useful for training validation algorithms.",
        "3 Automatic sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition and generation",
        "The acquisition of paraphrases, and in particular of sub-sentential paraphrases and paraphrase patterns, has attracted a lot of works with the advent of data-intensive Natural Language Processing (Mad-nani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "The techniques proposed have a strong relationship to the type of text corpus used for acquisition, mainly:",
        "‚Ä¢ pairs of sentential paraphrases (monolingual parallel corpora) allow for a good precision but evidently a low recall (e.g. (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003; Cohn et al., 2008; Bouamor et al., 2011))",
        "‚Ä¢ pairs of bilingual sentences (bilingual parallel corpora) allow for a comparatively better recall (e.g. (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Kok and Brockett, 2010))",
        "‚Ä¢ pairs of related sentences (monolingual comparable corpora) allow for even higher recall but possibly lower precision (e.g. (Barzilay",
        "Although the precision of such techniques can in some cases be formulated with regards to a predefined reference set (Cohn et al., 2008), it should more generally be assessed in the specific context of some use of the paraphrase pair.",
        "This refers to the problem of substituability in context (e.g. (Connor and Roth, 2007; Zhao et al., 2007)), which is a well studied field at the lexical level and the object of evaluation campains (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009).",
        "Contextual phrase substitution poses the additional challenge that phrases are rarer than words, so that building contextual and grammatical models to ensure that the generated rephrasings are both semantically compatible and grammatical is more complicated (e.g. (Callison-Burch, 2008)).",
        "The present work does not aim to present any original technique for paraphrase acquisition, but rather focusses on the task of sub-sentential paraphrase validation in context.",
        "We thus resort to some existing repertoire of phrasal paraphrase pairs.",
        "As explained in section 2, we use the WiCoPaCo corpus as a source of sub-sentential paraphrases: the phrase after rewriting can thus be used as a potential paraphrase in context.",
        "To obtain other candidates of various quality, we used two knowledge sources.",
        "The first uses automatic pivot translation (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), where a state-of-the-art general-purpose Statistical Machine Translationsystem is used in a two-way translation.",
        "The second uses manual acquisition of paraphrase candidates.",
        "Web-based acquisition of this type of knowledge has already been done before (Chklovski, 2005; Espana Bonet et al., 2009), and could be done by crowd-sourcing, a technique growing in popularity in recent years.",
        "We have instead formulated manual acquisition as a web-based game.",
        "Players can take parts in two parts of the game, illustrated on Figure 3.",
        "First, players propose sub-sentential paraphrases in context for selected text spans in web documents (top of Figure 3), and then raters can take part in assessing paraphrases proposed by other players (bottom of Figure 3).",
        "In order to avoid any bias, players cannot evaluate games in which they played.",
        "Evaluation is sped up by using a compact word lattice view for eliciting human judgments, built using the syntactic fusion algorithm of (Pang et al., 2003).",
        "Data acquisition was done in French to remain coherent with our experiments on the French corpus of WiCoPaCo, and both players and raters were native speakers.",
        "An important point is that in our experiments the context of acquisition and of evaluation were different: players were asked to generate paraphrases in contexts that are different from those of the WiCoPaCo corpus used for evaluation.",
        "To this end, web snippets were automatically retrieved for the various phrases of our dataset without contexts, so that sentences from the Web (but not from Wikipedia) were used for manual paraphrase acquisition.",
        "This allows us to simulate the availability ofa preexisting repertoire of (contextless) sub-sentential paraphrases, and to assess the performance of our contextual validation techniques on a possibly incompatible context."

        "We thus build syntactic dependencies for both the original and rewritten sentence, using the French version (Candito et al., 2010) of the Berkeley probabilistic parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), and consider the subset of dependencies for the two sentences that exist between a word inside the phrase under focus and a word outside it (Deporig and Deppara).",
        "Our ContDep baseline considers a sentence as a paraphrase iff Deppara = Deporig.",
        "We used the models described in Section 4 to build a SVM classifier using the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin, 2001).",
        "Accuracy results are reported on Figure 5.",
        "Figure 5: Accuracy results for the three baselines and our classifier on the test set for the three conditions.",
        "Note that the SURER condition cannot be directly compared with the other two as the number of training and test examples are not the same.",
        "The first notable observation is that our task is not surprisingly a difficult one.",
        "The best performance achieved is an accuracy of 70.69 with our system in the SURE condition.",
        "There are, however, some important variations across conditions, with a result as low as 57.67 for our system in the POSSIBLE condition (recall that in this condition candidates are considered paraphrases when only one of the two judges considered it a paraphrase, i.e. when the two judges disagreed).",
        "Overall, the WebLM baseline and our system appear as stronger than the two other baselines.",
        "The two lower baselines, BoundLM and ContDep, attempt to model local grammatical constraints, which are not surprisingly not sufficient for paraphrase identification.",
        "WEBLM is comparatively a much more competitive baseline, but its accuracy in the SURER condition is not very strong.",
        "As this latter condition considers only consensual judgements for the two judges, we can hypothesize that the interpretation of its results is more reliable.",
        "In this condi-",
        "Figure 6: Paraphrase accuracy of our different paraphrase acquisition methods for the three conditions.",
        "tion, our system obtains the best performance, with a +6.06 advantage over WEBLM.",
        "As found in other works (e.g. (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005)), using language models for paraphrase validation is not sufficient as it cannot model meaning preservation, and our results show that this is also true even when counts are estimated from the Web.",
        "Using a ratio of normalized LM scores may have improved the situation a bit.",
        "Lastly, we report in Figure 6 the paraphrase accuracy of each individual acquisition technique (i.e. source of paraphrases from the preexisting repertoire).",
        "The original rewritting from WiCo-PaCo obtains not surprisingly a very high paraphrase accuracy, in particular in the POSSIBLE and SURER conditions.",
        "Paraphrases obtained through our Web-based game have an acceptable accuracy: the numbers confirm that paraphrase pairs are highly context-dependent, because the pairs which were likely to be paraphrases in the context of the game are not necessarily so in a different context.",
        "This, of course, may be due to a number of reasons that we will have to investigate.",
        "Lastly, there is a significant drop in accuracy for the automatic pivot paraphrasers, but pivoting through Spanish obtained, not suprisingly again, a much better performance than pivoting through Chinese."
