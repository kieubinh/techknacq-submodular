        "Text simplification is the process of transforming a text into an equivalent which is more understandable for a target user.",
        "This simplification is beneficial for many groups of readers, such as language learners, elderly persons and people with other special reading and comprehension necessities.",
        "Simplified texts are characterized by a simple and direct style and a smaller vocabulary which substitutes infrequent and otherwise difficult words (such as long composite nouns, technical terms, neologisms and abstract concepts) by simpler corresponding expressions.",
        "Usually unnecessary details are omitted.",
        "Another characteristic trait of simplified texts is that usually only one main idea is expressed by a single sentence.",
        "This also means that in the simplification process complex sentences are often split into several smaller sentences.",
        "The availability of a sentence-aligned corpus of original texts and their simplifications is of paramount importance for the study of simplification and for developing an automatic text simplification system.",
        "The different strategies that human editors employ to simplify texts are varied and have the effect that individual parts of the resulting text may either become shorter or longer than the original text.",
        "An editor may, for example, delete detailed information, making the text shorter.",
        "Or she may split complex sentences into various smaller sentences.",
        "As a result, simplified texts tend to become shorter than the source, but often the number of sentences increases.",
        "Not all of the information presented in the original needs to be preserved but in general all of the information in the simplified text stems from the source text.",
        "The need to align parallel texts arises from a larger need to create a medium size corpus which will allow the study of the editing process of simplifying text, as well as to serve as a gold standard to evaluate a text simplification system.",
        "Sentence alignment for simplified texts is related to, but different from, the alignment of bilingual text and also from the alignment of summaries to an original text.",
        "Since the alignment of simplified sentences is a case of monolingual alignment the lexical similarity between two corresponding sentences can be taken as an indicator of correspondence.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces text simplification which contextualises this piece of research and Section 3 discusses some related work.",
        "In Section 4 we briefly describe the texts we are working with and in Section 5 we present the alignment algorithm.",
        "Section 6 presents the details of the experiment and its results.",

        "The simplification of written documents by humans has the objective of making texts more accessible to people with a linguistic handicap, however manual simplification of written documents is very expensive.",
        "If one considers people who cannot read documents with heavy information load or documents from authorities or governmental sources the percent of need for simplification is estimated at around 25% of the population, it is therefore of great importance to develop methods and tools to tackle this problem.",
        "Automatic text simplification, the task of transforming a given text into an \"equivalent\" which is less complex in vocabulary and form, aims at reducing the efforts and costs associated with human simplification.",
        "In addition to transforming texts into their simplification for human consumption, text simplification has other advantages since simpler texts can be processed more efficiently by different natural language processing processors such as parsers and used in applications such as machine translation, information extraction, question answering, and text summarization.",
        "Early attempts to text simplification were based on rule-based methods where rules were designed following linguistic intuitions (Chandrasekar et al., 1996).",
        "Steps in the process included linguistic text analysis (including parsing) and pattern matching and transformation steps.",
        "Other computational models of text simplification included processes of analysis, transformation, and phrase regeneration (Sid-dharthan, 2002) also using rule-based techniques.",
        "In the PSET project (Carroll et al., 1998) the proposal is for a news simplification system for aphasic readers and particular attention is paid to linguistic phenomena such as passive constructions and coref-erence which are difficult to deal with by people with disabilities.",
        "The PorSimples project (Aluisio et al., 2008) has looked into simplification of the Portuguese language.",
        "The methodology consisted in the creation of a corpus of simplification at two different levels and on the use of the corpus to train a decision procedure for simplification based on linguistic features.",
        "Simplification decisions about whether to simplify a text or sentence have been studied following rule-based paradigms (Chandrasekar et al., 1996) or trainable systems (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007) where a corpus of texts and their simplifications becomes necessary.",
        "Some resources are available for the English language such as parallel corpora created or studied in various projects (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003; Feng et al., 2009; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007; Quirk et al., 2004); however there is no parallel Spanish corpus available for research into text simplification.",

        "The problem of sentence alignment was first tackled in the context of statistical machine translation.",
        "Gale and Church (1993) proposed a dynamic programming algorithm for the sentence-level alignment of translations that exploited two facts: the length of translated sentences roughly corresponds to the length of the original sentences and the sequence of sentences in translated text largely corresponds to the original order of sentences.",
        "With this simple approach they reached a high degree of accuracy.",
        "Within the field of monolingual sentence alignment a large part of the work has concentrated on the alignment between text summaries and the source texts they summarize.",
        "Jing (2002) present an algorithm which aligns strings of words to pieces of text in an original document using a Hidden Markov Model.",
        "This approach is very specific to summary texts, concretely such summaries which have been produced by a \"cut and paste\" process.",
        "A work which is more closely related to our task is presented in Barzilay and Elhadad (2003).",
        "They carried out an experiment on two different versions of the Encyclopedia Britannica (the regular version and the Britannica Elementary) and aligned sentences in a four-step procedure: They clustered paragraphs into 'topic' groups, then they trained a binary classifier (aligned or not aligned) for paragraph pairs on a handcrafted set of sentence alignments.",
        "After that they grouped all paragraphs of unseen text pairs into the same topic clusters as in the first step and aligned the texts on the paragraph level, allowing for multiple matches.",
        "Finally they aligned the sentences within the already aligned paragraphs.",
        "Their similarity measure, both for paragraphs and sentences, was based on cosine distance of word overlap.",
        "Nelken and Shieber (2006) improve over Barzilay and Elhadad's work: They use the same data set, but they base their similarity measure for aligning sentences on a TF*IDF score.",
        "Although this score can be obtained without any training, they apply logistic regression on these scores and train two parameters of this regression model on the training data.",
        "Both of these approaches can be tuned by parameter settings, which results in a trade-off between precision and recall.",
        "Barzilay and Elhadad report a precision of 76.9% when the recall reaches 55.8%.",
        "Nelken and Shieber raise this value to 83.1% with the same recall level and show that TF*IDF is a much better sentence similarity measure.",
        "Zhu et al.",
        "(2010) even report a precision of 91.3% (at the same fixed recall value of 55.8%) for the alignment of simple English Wikipedia articles to the English Wikipedia counterparts using Nelken and Shieber's TF*IDF score, but their alignment was part of a larger problem setting and they do not discuss further details.",
        "We consider that our task is not directly comparable to this previous work: the texts we are working with are direct simplifications of the source texts.",
        "So we can assume that all information in the simplified text must stem from the original text.",
        "In addition we can make the simplifying assumption that there are one-to-many, but no many-to-one relations between source sentences and simplified sentences, a simplification which largely holds for our corpus.",
        "This means that all target sentences must find at least one alignment to a source sentence, but not vice versa.",
        "Nelken and Shieber make the interesting observation that dynamic programming, as used by Gale and Church (1991) fails to work in the monolingual case.",
        "Their test data consisted of pairs of encyclopedia articles which presented a large intersection of factual information, but which was not necessarily presented in the same order.",

Since long jumps are relatively rare, we used a normalized even probability distribution for all jump lengths greater than 2 and smaller than -1.",
        "Since we have no training data, we have to initially set these probabilities by hand.",

        "Although this model for sentence transitions is apparently oversimplistic and gives a very bad estimate for each P(source-senti\\aligni-ltj-k), the probabilities for P(align™) give a counterweight to these bad estimates.",
