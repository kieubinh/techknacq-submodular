        "Tasks such as sentence compression, which strives to retain the most salient content of an input sentence, and sentence fusion, which attempts to combine the important content in related sentences, are useful components for tackling larger natural language problems such as abstractive summarization of documents.",
        "Systems for these types of text-to-text problems are typically evaluated on the informativeness of the output text as judged by human annotators.",
        "A natural aspect of most text generation systems is that a given input can map to a range of lexically diverse outputs.",
        "However, text-to-text tasks defined with vague criteria such as the preservation of the \"important\" information in text can also permit outputs that are semantically distinct.",
        "This can make evaluation difficult; for instance, system-generated sentences may differ (partially or completely) in informational content from reference human-annotated text.",
        "This phenomenon has been noted and discussed in the task of pairwise sentence fusion (Daumé III and Marcu, 2004) and also in sentence compression (McDonald, 2006).",
        "Some examples are listed in Table 1.",
        "In this work, we examine the task of sentence intersection: a variant of sentence fusion that does not permit semantic variation in the output.",
        "A strict intersection system is expected to produce a fused sentence that contains all the information common to its input sentences and avoid information that is in just one of the inputs.",
        "In other words, a valid intersection should only contain information that is substantiated by all input sentences.",
        "The set-theoretic notions of intersection (along with union) have been employed to describe variants of sentence fusion tasks in previous work (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005; Krahmer et al., 2008) but, to our knowledge, this work is the first to explicitly tackle and evaluate the strict intersection task.",

        "In addition to a search-based decoding strategy, we propose a constrained integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that attempts to decode the most fluent sentence covering all these aspects while minimizing the size and disfluency of interleaving text.",
        "This is a fairly general model which can also be extended to other alignment-based tasks such as pairwise union and difference.",
        "As this is a substantially more constrained task than generic sentence fusion, we also present a novel evaluation approach that avoids out-of-context salience judgments.",

        "The distinction between intersection and union of text was introduced in the context of sentence fusion (Krahmer et al., 2008; Marsi and Krahmer, 2005) in order to distinguish between traditional fusion strategies that attempted to include only common content and fusions that attempted to include all non-redundant content from the input.",
        "We focus here on strict sentence intersection, explicitly incorporating a constraint that requires that a produced fusion must not contain information that is not present in all input sentences.",
        "This distinguishes our approach from traditional sentence fusion approaches (Jing and McKeown, 2000; Barzi-lay and McKeown, 2005; Filippova and Strube, 2008b) which generally attempt to retain common information but are typically evaluated in an abstractive summarization context in which additional information in the fusion output does not negatively impact judgments.",
        "This task is also related to the field of sentence compression which has received much attention in recent years (Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova and Strube, 2008a; Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Marsi et al., 2010).",
        "Intersections can be viewed as guided compressions in which the redundancy of information content across input sentences in a multidocument setting is assumed to directly indicate its salience, thereby consigning it to the output.",
        "Additionally, in this work, we frequently consider the sentence intersection task from the perspective of textual entailment (cf. §5.1).",
        "The textual entailment task involves automatically determining whether a given hypothesis can be inferred from a textual premise (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2006).",
        "Automatic construction of positive and negative entailment examples has been explored in the past (Bensley and Hickl, 2008) to provide training data for entailment systems; however the production of text that is simultaneously entailed by two (or more) sentences is a far more constrained and difficult challenge.",
        "ILP has been used extensively for text-to-text generation problems in recent years (Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova and Strube, 2008b; Woodsend et al., 2010), including techniques which incorporate syntax directly into the decoding to imporove the fluency of the resulting text.",

        "The need for strict variants of fusion is motivated by considerations of evaluation and utility in text-to-text generation tasks.",
        "Without explicit constraints on the semantic content of valid output, the operational definition of fusion can encompass the full spectrum from sentence intersection to sentence union.",
        "This makes the comparison of different fusion systems dependent on task-based utility.",
        "In addition, intersection comprises an interesting problem in its own right.",
        "It necessitates the use of generalization over phrases in order to convey only the content of the input sentences when different wording is used and therefore involves more than just word deletion.",
        "The analogy to set-theoretic intersection in this task implies an underlying consideration of each sentence as a set of informational concepts, similar to previous work in summarization and redundancy (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004; Thadani and McKeown, 2008).",
        "While we don't commit to any semantic representation for such elements of information, we can nevertheless attempt to identify repeated information using well-studied natural language analysis techniques such as alignment and paraphrase recognition, and furthermore isolate this information through text-to-text generation techniques.",
        "Consider, for example, the first sentence pair from the examples in Table 2.",
        "A valid intersection for these sentences must not contain any information that is not substantiated by both of them, so a fusion that mentions \"Mr Litvinenko's poisoning\", \"Britain\" or \"Sunday\" would not satisfy this criterion.",
        "In other words, a valid intersection must necessarily be textually entailed by every input sentence.",
        "Following this, we can interpret the sentence intersection task as one that requires the generation of fluent text that is mutually entailed by all input sentences.",
        "We use this perspective in developing an evaluation technique for strict intersection in §5.1.",
        "A major distinguishing factor between this work and previous work on fusion is that simply adding or deleting words in a sentence is not adequate; in many cases, intersections require additional words or phrases to be introduced in order to generalize over related but non-interchangeable aligned terms (such as \"go\" and \"expand\").",
        "Additionally, we must attempt to avoid introducing additional content-bearing text in the output while simultaneously striving to maintain the fluency of text.",

        "A similar phenomenon was noted by Krahmer et al.",
        "(2008): while demonstrating that query-based human fusions exhibited less variation than generic fusions, it was also observed that intersections varied more than unions.",
        "Due to the absence of adequate training data for intersection, our approach to the task is unsupervised, similar to previous work in fusion (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Filippova and Strube, 2008b) and sentence compression (Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova and Strube, 2008a).",

        "We make use of an adaptation of the supervised MANLI phrase-based alignment technique originally developed for textual entailment systems (MacCartney et al., 2008); our implementation replaces approximate search-based decoding with exact ILP-based alignment decoding and incorporates syntactic constraints to produce more precise alignments (Thadani and McKe-own, 2011).",
        "The aligner is trained on a corpus of human-generated alignment annotations produced by Microsoft Research (Brockett, 2007) for inference problems from the second Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE2) challenge (Bar-Haim et al., 2006).",
        "Entailment problems are inherently asymmetric because premise text is generally larger than hypothesis text; however, this does not apply to our intersection problems and consequently our MANLI implementation drops asymmetric indicator features.",

        "(2008).",
        "An aligned phrase pair produced by the previous step does not necessarily indicate that the phrases are equivalent but merely that they are similar in the given sentence context (such as \"accuser\" and \"boy\" in the third example from Table 2).",
        "We need to generalize over these phrases as they are not interchangeable from the perspective of the intersection task.",

        "Although generalization of words within standalone sentences is usually hampered by word sense ambiguity, our approach is less likely to encounter this problem because we can generalize simultaneously over phrases which have already been aligned using additional information (such as their neighboring context), thus avoiding generalizations that do not fit the alignment.",
        "For our experiments, we make use of the Wordnet ontology (Miller, 1995) to find the hypernyms common to every aligned pair of non-identical phrases, and only attempt to detect entailments which are comprised of specific instances that entail general concepts.",
        "This approach can be augmented by the use of entailment corpora and distributional clustering which we intend to explore in future work.",
        "We also use the lexical resource CatVar (Habash and Dorr, 2003) to try to generate morphological variants of aligned words that enable them to be interchanged without creating disfluencies.",

        "For example, the phrases \"polonium\" and \"radioactive substances\" in the second sentence pair from Table 2 fail to align with each other.",
        "On the other hand, retaining unaligned text from one of the input sentences for the sake of fluency is likely to introduce information that is not supported by the other input sentence.",
        "We therefore need to abstract away as much content from the unaligned portions of the text as possible.",
        "For this purpose, we generate a large number of potential compressions and abstractions for every unaligned span that occurs between two consecutive aligned phrases in each sentence.",
        "These compressions and abstractions, referred to as interleaving paths, between pairs of aligned phrases essentially construct a lattice over the input sentences that encodes all potential intersection outputs.",
        "Generation of interleaving paths is accomplished through the application of rules on the dependency parse structure over unaligned text spans from a single sentence (as well as spans that occur before the first aligned phrase and after the last aligned phrase in each sentence).",

        "The experimental results indicate that the two systems we describe, particularly the segmented decoder, do a reasonable job of finding valid intersections with good coverage; however, producing fluent output remains a challenge.",
        "Analysis of the intersections produced leads us to note that the quality of interleaving paths is the prime obstacle to improving intersection output (cf. Table 3): producing syntactically-valid textual abstractions to connect text is a challenge that is not met by our simple rule-based approach.",
        "Furthermore, we notice that the quality of alignment also factors in to this problem: systems that miss phrases which should be aligned or systems that mistakenly align faraway fragments both cause spans of unaligned text that must be then abstracted over.",
        "We hypothesize that these issues could be tackled with the use of joint models: a system that aligns as it decodes could reduce the need for abstraction over long unaligned spans, although care would have to be taken to ensure that coverage is maintained.",
        "Additionally, richer lexical resources such as wider-coverage ontologies (Snow et al., 2006) and entailment/paraphrase dictionaries could aid in improving coverage.",
        "Finally, previous work in fusion (Filippova and Strube, 2008b; Filippova and Strube, 2009) has noted that models based on syntax outperform techniques that rely solely on LM scores to determine fluency, and strict intersection appears to be well-suited for further exploration in this vein."

        "We tackle the task as lattice decoding and discuss two decoding strategies for producing valid intersections.",
        "In addition, we assume that strict intersection tasks are best considered as problems of mutual entailment generation and describe evaluation strategies for this task that make use of both human judgments as well as automated metrics run over a related corpus.",
        "Experimental results indicate that these systems are fairly effective at generating valid intersections and that our novel segmented decoder strategy outperforms the traditional beam search approach.",
        "Although fluency remains a challenge, we hypothesize that the use of joint models, syntactic constraints and lexical resources could bring improvements."
