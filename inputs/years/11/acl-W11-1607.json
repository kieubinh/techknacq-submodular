        "Sentence fusion is the process by which content from two or more original sentences is transformed into a single output sentence.",
        "It is usually studied in the context of multidocument summarization, since fusing similar sentences can avoid repetition of material which is shared by more than one input.",
        "However, human editors and summarizers do not restrict themselves to combining sentences which share most of their content.",
        "This paper extends previous work on fusion to the case in which the input sentences are drawn from the same document and express fundamentally different content, while still remaining related enough to make fusion sensible .",
        "Our data comes from a corpus of news articles for which we have unedited and edited versions.",
        "We search this corpus for sentences which were fused (or separated) by the editor; these constitute naturally occurring data for our system.",
        "One example from our dataset consists of input sentences (1) and (2) and output (3).",
        "We show corresponding regions of the input and output in boldface.",
        "(1) The bodies showed signs of torture.",
        "(2) They were left on the side of a highway in Chilpancingo, about an hour north of the tourist resort of Acapuico in the southern state of Guerrero, state police said.",
        "(3) The bodies of the men, which showed signs of torture, were left on the side of a highway in Chilpancingo, which is about an hour north of the tourist resort of Acapulco, state police told Reuters.",
        "While the two original sentences are linked by a common topic and reference to a shared entity, they are not paraphrases of one another.",
        "This could create a problem for traditional fusion systems which first find an alignment between similar dependency graphs, then extract a shared structure.",
        "While our system has the same basic framework of alignment and extraction, it performs the two jointly, as parts of a global optimization task.",
        "This makes it robust to uncertainty about the hidden correspondences between the sentences.",
        "We use structured online learning to find parameters for the system, allowing it to",
        "bitbucket.org/melsner/sentencefusion.",
        "discover good ways to piece together input sentences by examining examples from our corpus.",
        "Sentence fusion is a common strategy in human-authored summaries of single documents 36% of sentences in the summaries investigated by Jing and McKeown (1999) contain content from multiple sentences in the original document.",
        "This suggests that a method to fuse dissimilar sentences could be useful for single-document summarization.",
        "Our dataset is evidence that editing also involves fusing sentences, and thus that models of this task could contribute to systems for automatic editing.",

        "Previous work on sentence fusion examines the task in the context of multidocument summarization, targeting groups of sentences with mostly redundant content.",
        "The pioneering work on fusion is Barzilay and McKeown (2005), which introduces the framework used by subsequent projects: they represent the inputs by dependency trees, align some words to merge the input trees into a lattice, and then extract a single, connected dependency tree as the output.",
        "Our work most closely follows Filippova and Strube (2008), which proposes using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for extraction of an output dependency tree.",
        "ILP allows specification of grammaticality constraints in terms of dependency relationships (Clarke and Lapata, 2008), as opposed to previous fusion methods (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Marsi and Krahmer, 2005) which used language modeling to extract their output.",
        "In their ILP, Filippova and Strube (2008) optimize a function based on syntactic importance scores learned from a corpus of general text.",
        "While similar methods have been used for the related task of sentence compression, improvements can be obtained using supervised learning (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Turner and Charniak, 2005; Cohn and Lapata, 2009) if a suitable corpus of compressed sentences can be obtained.",
        "This paper is the first we know of to adopt the supervised strategy for sentence fusion.",
        "For supervised learning to be effective, it is necessary to find or produce example data.",
        "Previous work does produce some examples written by humans, though these are used during evaluation, not for learning (a large corpus of fusions (McKeown et al., 2010) was recently compiled as a first step toward a supervised fusion system).",
        "However, they elicit these examples by asking experimental subjects to fuse selected input sentences-the choice of which sentences to fuse is made by the system, not the subjects.",
        "In contrast, our dataset consists of sentences humans actually chose to fuse as part of a practical writing task.",
        "Moreover, our sentences have disparate content, while previous work focuses on sentences whose content mostly overlaps.",
        "Input sentences with differing content present a challenge to the models used in previous work.",
        "All these models use deterministic node alignment heuristics to merge the input dependency graphs.",
        "Filippova and Strube (2008) align all content words with the same lemma and part of speech; Barzi-lay and McKeown (2005) and Marsi and Krahmer (2005) use syntactic methods based on tree similarity.",
        "Neither method is likely to work well for our data.",
        "Lexical methods over-align, since there are many potential points of correspondence between our sentences, only some of which should be merged \"the Doha trade round\" and \"U.S. trade representative\" share a word, but probably ought to remain separate regardless.",
        "Syntactic methods, on the other hand, are unlikely to find any alignments since the input sentences are not paraphrases and have very different trees.",
        "Our system selects the set of nodes to merge during ILP optimization, allowing it to choose correspondences that lead to a sensible overall solution."

        "Since these sentences are relatively rare, we use both merges (where the editor fused two input sentences) and splits (where the editor splits an input sentence into multiple outputs) as examples for our system.",
        "In the case of a split, we take the edited sentences as input for our method and attempt to produce the original through fusion.",
        "This is suboptimal, since the editor's decision to split the sentences probably means the fused version is too long, but is required in this small dataset to avoid sparsity.",

        "In this paper, we focus on the generation stage.",
        "To avoid having to perform content selection , we provide our system with the true information selected by the editor.",

        "In many cases, even when the result is awkward or ungrammatical, the ILP system makes reasonable choices of mergers and dependencies to retain.",
        "For inputs (24) and (25), the system (26) decides \"Secretary-General\" belongs as a modifier on \"de Mello\", which is in fact the choice made by the editor (27).",
        "In order to add the relative clause, the editor paraphrased \"de Mello's death\" as \"de Mello was killed\".",
        "Our system, without this paraphrase option, is forced to produce the improper phrase \"de Mello's death who\"; a wider array of paraphrase options might lead to better results.",
        "This example also demonstrates that the system does not simply keep the LCS-aligned retained regions and throw away everything else, since the result would be ungrammatical.",
        "Here it links the selected content by also choosing to keep \"could have been\", \"an account\" and \"death\".",
        "(24) Barker mixes an account of Vieira de Mello's death with scenes from his career, which included working in countries such as Mozambique, Cyprus, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and the former Yugoslavia.",

        "U.N. Secretary-General, was killed and mixes in the story of the 55-year-old's career, which included working in countries such as Mozambique, Cyprus, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Yugoslavia.",
        "Many of our errors are due to our simplistic linearization.",
        "For instance, we produce a sentence beginning \"Biden a veteran Democratic senator from Delaware that Vice president-elect and Joe...\", where a correct linearization of the output tree would have begun \"Vice President-elect Joe Biden, a veteran Democratic senator from Delaware that...\".",
        "Some errors also occur during the ILP tree extraction process.",
        "In (28), the system fails to mark the arguments of \"took\" and \"position\" as required, leading to their omission, which makes the output ungrammatical.",
        "(28) The White House that took when Israel invaded Lebanon in 2006 showed no signs of preparing to call for restraint by Israel and the stance echoed of the position."

        "We present a supervised method for learning to fuse disparate sentences.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt at supervised learning for this task.",
        "We apply our method to naturally occurring sentences from editing data.",
        "Despite using text generation, our system is comparable to a non-abstractive baseline.",
        "Our technique is general enough to apply to conventional fusion of similar sentences as well-all that is needed is a suitable training dataset.",
        "We hope to make use of the new corpus of McKeown et al.",
        "(2010) for this purpose.",
        "We are also interested in evaluating our approach on the fused sentences in abstractive single-document summaries.",
        "The performance of our readability upper bound suggests we could improve our results using better tree linearization techniques and parsing.",
        "Although we show results for our system using handannotated pronoun coreference, it should be possible to use automatic coreference resolution instead.",
        "Paraphrase rules would help our system replicate some output structures it is currently unable to match (for instance, it cannot convert between the copular \"X is Y\" and appositive \"X, a Y\" constructions).",
        "Currently, the system has just one such rule, which converts main clauses to relatives.",
        "Others could potentially be learned from a corpus, as in (Cohn and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Finally, in this study, we deliberately avoid investigating the way editors choose which sentences to fuse and what content from each of them to retain.",
        "This is a challenging discourse problem that deserves further study."
