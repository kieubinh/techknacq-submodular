        "Recent work has highlighted the challenges of identifying the stance that a speaker holds towards a particular political, social or technical topic.",
        "Classifying stance involves identifying a holistic subjective disposition, beyond the word or sentence (Lin et al., 2006; Malouf and Mullen, 2008; Greene and Resnik, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; So-masundaran and Wiebe, 2010).",
        "Our work is inspired by the large variety of such conversations now freely available online, and our observation that the contextual affordances of different debate and discussion websites vary a great deal.",
        "One important contextual variable, discussed at length below, is the percentage of posts that are rebuttals to previous posts, which varies in our data from 34% to 80%.",
        "The ability to explicitly rebut a previous post gives these debates both monologic and dialogic properties (Biber, 1991; Crystal, 2001; Fox Tree, 2010); Compare Figure 1 to Figure 2.",
        "We believe that discussions containing many rebuttal links require a different type of analysis than other types of debates or discussions.",
        "Dialogic Capital Punishment",
        "Studies have shown that using the death penalty saves 4 to 13 lives per execution.",
        "That alone makes killing murderers worthwhile.",
        "What studies?",
        "I have never seen ANY evidence that capital punishment acts as a deterrant to crime.",
        "I have not seen any evidence that it is \"just\" either.",
        "When Texas and Florida were executing people one after the other in the late 90's, the murder rates in both states plunged, like Rosie O'donnel off a diet.. .",
        "That's your evidence?",
        "What happened to those studies?",
        "In the late 90s a LOT of things were different than the periods preceding and following the one you mention.",
        "We have no way to determine what of those contributed to a lower murder rate, if indeed there was one.",
        "You have to prove a cause and effect relationship and you have failed.",

        "See Table 1.",
        "On Convinceme, a person starts a debate by posting a topic or a question and providing sides such as for vs. against.",
        "Debate participants can then post arguments for one side or the other, essentially self-labelling their post for stance.",
        "These debates may be heated and emotional, discussing weighty issues such as euthanasia and capital punishment, such as the example in Figure 1.",
        "But they also appear to be a form of entertainment via playful debate.",
        "Popular topics on Convinceme.net over the past 4 years include discussions of the merits of Cats vs.",
        "Dogs, or Pirates vs. Ninjas (almost 1000 posts).",
        "See Figure 3.",
        "Monologic Capital Punishment",
        "I value human life so much that if someone takes one than his should be taken.",
        "Also if someone is thinking about taking a life they are less likely to do so knowing that they might lose theirs Death Penalty is only a costlier version of a lifetime prison sentence, bearing the exception that it offers euthanasia to criminals longing for an easy escape, as opposed to a real punishment.",
        "There is no proof that the death penalty acts as a deterrent, plus due to the finalty of the sentence it would be impossible to amend a mistaken conviction which happens with regualrity especially now due to DNA and improved forensic science.",
        "Actually most hardened criminals are more afraid to live-then die.",
        "I'd like to see life sentences without parole in lieu of capital punishment with hard labor and no amenities for hard core repeat offenders, the hell with PC and prisoner's rights-they lose priv-eledges for their behaviour.",
        "Figure 2: Posts on the topic Capital punishment without explicit link structure.",
        "The discussion topic was \"Death Penalty\", and the argument was framed as yes we should keep it vs. no we should not.",
        "Our long term goal is to understand the discourse and dialogic structure of such conversations.",
        "This could be useful for: (1) creating automatic summaries of each position on an issue (Sparck-Jones, 1999); (2) gaining a deeper understanding of what makes an argument persuasive (Marwell and Schmitt, 1967); and (3) identifying the linguistic reflexes of perlocutionary acts such as persuasion and disagreement (Walker, 1996; Greene and Resnik, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010; Marcu, 2000).",
        "As a first step, in this paper we aim to automatically identify rebuttals, and identify the speaker's stance towards a particular topic.",
        "Dialogic Cats vs.",
        "Dogs",
        "Since we're talking much of $hit, then Dogs rule!",
        "Cat poo is extremely foul to one's nostrils you'll regret ever handling a cat.",

        "If your dog sh*ts in a field you aren't going to walk out and pick it up.",
        "Cat owners HAVE to handle sh*t, they MUST clean out a litter box...so suck on that!",
        "The most similar work to our own is that of So-masundaran & Wiebe (2009, 2010) who also focus on automatically determining the stance of a debate participant with respect to a particular issue.",
        "Their data does not provide explicit indicators of dialogue structure such as are provided by the rebuttal links in Convinceme.",
        "Thus, this work treats each post as a monologic text to be classified in terms of stance, for a particular topic.",
        "They show that discourse relations such as concessions and the identification of argumentation triggers improves performance over sentiment features alone (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010).",
        "This work, along with others, indicates that for such tasks it is difficult to beat a unigram baseline (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Other similar related work analyzes Usenet forum quote/response structures (Wang and Rose, 2010).",
        "We believe quote/response pairs have a similar discourse structure to the rebuttal post pairs in Con-vinceme, but perhaps with the linguistic reflexes of stance expressed even more locally.",
        "However agreement vs. disagreement is not labelled across quote/response pairs and Wang & Rose (2010) do not attempt to distinguish these different discourse relations.",
        "Rather they show that they can use a variant of LSA to identify a parent post, given a response post, with approximately 70% accuracy.",
        "A recent paper by (Abbott et al., 2011) examines agreement and disagreement in quote/response pairs in idealogical and nonidealogical online forum discussions, and shows that you can distinguish the agreement relation with 68% accuracy.",
        "Their results indicate that contextual features do improve performance for identifying the agreement relation between quotes and responses.",
        "Other work has utilized the social network structure of online forums, either with or without textual features of particular posts (Malouf and Mullen, 2008; Mishne and Glance, 2006; Murakami and Raymond, 2010; Agrawal et al., 2003).",
        "However this work does not examine the way that the dialogic structure varies by topic, as we do, and the threading structure of their debates does not distinguish between agreement and disagreement responses.",
        "(Mishne and Glance, 2006) show that most replies to blog posts are disagreements, while Agar-wal's work assumed that adjacent posts always disagree, and did not use any of the information in the text.",
        "Murakami & Raymond (2010) show that simple rules for identifying disagreement, defined on the textual content of the post, can improve over Agarwal's results and (Malouf and Mullen, 2008) show that a combination of textual and social network features provides the best performance.",
        "We leave the incorporation of social network information for stance classification to future work.",
        "Section 3 discusses our corpus in more detail, and presents the results of a human debate-side classification task conducted on Mechanical Turk.",
        "Section 3 describes two different machine learning experiments: one for identifying rebuttals and the other for automatically determining stance.",
        "Section 4 presents our results.",
        "We show that we can identify rebuttals with 63% accuracy, and that using sentiment, subjectivity and dialogic features, we can achieve debate-side classification accuracies, on a per topic basis, that range from 54% to 69%, as compared to unigram baselines that vary between 49% and 60%."

        "Convinceme provides three possible sources of dialogic structure: (1) the SIDE that a post is placed on indicates the poster's stance with respect to the original debate topic, and thus can be considered as a response to that post; (2) rebuttal links between posts which are explicitly indicated by the poster using the affordances of the site; and (3) the TEMPOral context of the debate, i.e. the state of the debate at a particular point in time, which a debate participant orients to in framing their post.",

        "This is shown by the fact that there are more rebuttals per topic and more posts per author (P/A) in the topics below the line in Table 1.",
        "It follows that these topics have a much higher degree of context-dependence in each post, since posts respond directly to the parent post.",
