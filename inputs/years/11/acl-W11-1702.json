        "This paper presents a lexicon model for the description of verbs to be used in applications like sentiment analysis and opinion mining.",
        "Verbs are considered as the core of the sentence as they name events or states with participants expressed by the other elements in the sentence.",
        "We consider the detailed and subtle subjectivity relations that exist between the different participants as part of the meaning of a verb that can be modelled in a lexicon.",
        "Consider the following example:",
        "Ex.",
        "(1) ... Damilola's killers were boasting about his murder...",
        "This sentence expresses a positive sentiment of the killers towards the fact they murdered Damilola and it expresses the negative attitude on behalf of the speaker/writer who has negative opinion of the the murderers of Damilola.",
        "Both attitudes are part of the semantic profile of the verb and should be modelled in a subjectivity lexicon.",
        "As opinion mining and sentiment analysis applications tend to utilize more and more the composition of sentences (Moilanen (2007), Choi and Cardie (2008), Jia et al.",
        "(2009)) and to use the value and properties of the verbs expressed by its dependency trees, there is a need for specialized lexicons where this information can be found.",
        "For the analysis of more complex opinionated text like news, political documents, and (online) debates the identification of the attitude holder and topic are of crucial importance.",
        "Applications that exploit the relations between the verb meaning and its arguments can better determine sentiment at sentence-level and trace emotions and opninions to their holders.",
        "Our model seeks to combine the insights from a rather complex model like Framenet (Ruppenhofer et al.",
        "(2010)) with operational models like Senti-wordnet where simple polarity values (positive, negative, neutral) are applied to the entire lexicon.",
        "Subjectivity relations that exist between the different participants are labeled with information concerning both the identity of the attitude holder and the orientation (positive vs. negative) of the attitude.",
        "The model accounts for the fact that verbs may express multiple attitudes.",
        "It includes a categorisation into semantic categories relevant to opinion mining and sentiment analysis and provides means for the identification of the attitude holder and the polarity of the attitude and for the description of the emotions and sentiments of the different participants involved in the event.",
        "Attention is paid to the role of the speaker/writer of the event whose perspective is expressed and whose views on what is happening are conveyed in the text.",
        "As we wish to provide a model for a lexicon that is operational and can be exploited by tools for deeper sentiment analysis and rich opinion mining, the model is validated by an annotation study of 580 verb lexical units (cf. section 4)."

        "Polarity and subjectivity lexicons are valuable resources for sentiment analysis and opinion mining.",
        "For English, a couple of smaller and larger lexicons are available.",
        "Widely used in sentiment analysis are automatically derived or manually built polarity lexicons.",
        "These lexicons are lists of words (for example, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), Kamps et al.",
        "(2004), Kim and Hovy (2004) or word senses (for example, Esuli and Sebastiani (2006), Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006), Su and Mar-kert, (2008)) annotated for negative or positive polarity.",
        "As they attribute single polarity values (positive, negative, neutral) to words they are not able to account for more complex cases like boast (cf. example 1) which carry both negative and positive polarity dependening on who is the attitude holder.",
        "Strapparava and Valitutti (2004) developed Wordnet-Affect, an affective extension of Wordnet.",
        "It describes 'direct' affective words, i.e. words which denote emotions.",
        "Synsets are classified into categories like emotion, cognitive state, trait, behaviour, attitude and feeling.",
        "The resource is further developed (Valittutti and Strapparava, 2010) by adding the descriptions of 'indirect' affective words according to a specific appraisal model of emotions (OCC).",
        "An indirect affective word indirectly refers to emotion categories and can refer to different possible emotions according to the subjects (actor, actee and observer) semantically connected to it.",
        "For example, the word victory, if localized in the past, can be used for expressing pride (related to the actor or \"winner\"), and disappointment (related to the actee or \"loser\").",
        "If victory is a future event the expressed emotion is hope.",
        "Their model is similar to ours, as we both relate attitude to the participants of the event.",
        "However, their model focuses on a rich description of different aspects and implications of emotions for each participant whereas we infer a single positive or negative attitude.",
        "Their model seems to focus on the cognitive aspects of emotion whereas we aim to also model the linguistic aspects by including specifically the attitude of the Speaker/Writer in our model.",
        "Moreover, our description is not at the level of the synset but at lexical unit level which enables us to differentiate gradations of the strength of emotions within the synsets.",
        "This enables us to relate the attitudes directly to the syntactic-semantic patterns of the lexical unit.",
        "Also Framenet (Ruppenhofer et al.",
        "(2010)) is used as a resource in opinion mining and sentiment analysis (Kim and Hovy (2006)).",
        "Framenet (FN) is an online lexical resource for English that contains more than 11,600 lexical units.",
        "The aim is to classify words into categories (frames) which give for each lexical unit the range of semantic and syntactic combinatory possibilities.",
        "The semantic roles range from general ones like Agent, Patient and Theme to specific ones such as Speaker, Message and Addressee for Verbs of Communication.",
        "FN includes frames such as Communication, Judgment, Opinion, EmotionDirected and semantic roles such as Judge, Experiencer, Communicator which are highly relevant for opinion mining and sentiment analysis.",
        "However, subjectivity is not systematically and not (yet) exhaustively encoded in Framenet.",
        "For example, the verb gobble (eat hurriedly and noisily) belongs to the frame Ingestion (consumption of food, drink or smoke) and neither the frame nor the frame elements account for the negative connotation of gobble.",
        "Yet, we think that a resource like FN with rich and corpus based valency patterns is an ideal base/ starting point for subjectivity description.",
        "None of these theories, models or resources is specifically tailored for the subjectivity description of verbs.",
        "Studies which focus on verbs for sentiment analysis, usually refer to smaller subclasssess like, for example, emotion verbs (Mathieu, 2005, Mathieu and Fellbaum, 2010) or quotation verbs (Chen 2005, 2007)."

        "In this paper we presented a lexicon model for the description of verbs to be used in applications like deeper sentiment analysis and opinion mining, describing the detailed and subtle subjectivity relations that exist between the different participants of a verb.",
        "The relations can be labeled with subjectivity information concerning the identity of the attitude holder, the orientation (positive vs. negative) of the attitude and its target.",
        "Special attention is paid to the role of the speaker/writer of the event whose perspective is expressed and whose views on what is happening are conveyed in the text.",
        "We measured the reliability of the annotation.",
        "The results show that when using all 7 attitude holder categories, 3 categories, SW, A1A2 and A1A3 are reliable and the other 4 are not.",
        "As these not reliable categories are also small, we think that the annotation schema is sufficiently validated.",
        "An additional outcome to our study is that we created a gold standard of 580 verb senses.",
        "In the future we will use this gold standard to test methods for the automatic detection of subjectivity and polarity properties of word senses in order to build a rich subjectivity lexicon for Dutch verbs."
