        "According to \"Semantic Differential\" theory (Osgood et al., 1957), the connotative meaning of most adjectives can be, both qualitatively and quantitatively, differentiated along a scale, the ends of which are antonymic adjectives.",
        "Such a pair of antonymic adjectives is called a factor.",
        "The intensive experiments Osgood and his colleagues made with their students outlined that most of the variance in the text judgment was explained by only three major factors: the evaluative factor (e.g., good-bad), the potency factor (e.g., strong-weak), and the activity factor (e.g., active-passive).",
        "Kamps and Marx (2002) implemented a WordNet-based method in the spirit of the theory of semantic differentials and proposed a method to assess the\"attitude\" of arbitrary texts.",
        "In their approach, a text unit is regarded as a bag of words and the overall scoring of the sentence is obtained by combining the scores for the individual words of the text.",
        "Depending on the selected factor, various facets of subjective meanings come under scrutiny.",
        "The inspiring work of Kamps and Marx still has several limitations.",
        "The majority of researchers working on subjectivity agree that the subjectivity load of a given word is dependent on the senses of the respective word (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2007) , (Valiutti et al., 2004) and many others.",
        "; yet, in Kamps and Marx's model (KMM, henceforth), because they work with words and not wordsenses, the sense distinctions are lost, making it impossible to assign different scores to different senses of the word in case.",
        "Going up from the level of word to the level of sentence, paragraph or entire text, the bag of words approach can easily be fooled in the presence of valence shifters (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006).",
        "In order to cope with this problem, the text under investigation needs a minimal level of sentence processing, required for the identification of the structures that could get under the scope of a valence shifter (Tufis, 2008).",
        "For dealing with irony or sarcasm, processing requirements go beyond sentence level, and discourse structure of the text might be necessary.",
        "On the other hand, although the adjectives make up the obvious class of subjectivity words, the other open class categories have significant potential for expressing subjective meanings.",
        "In our models, unlike KMM, the building block is the word sense, thus making possible to assign different connotation values to different senses of a word.",
        "This was possible by using an additional source of information besides the WordNet itself, namely the SUMO/MILO ontology.",
        "Moreover, we considered all the word classes contained in WordNet, not only adjectives.",
        "From this point of view, our work, although through a different approach, shares objectives with other wordnet-based methods such as SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) (Baccianella et al., 2010) and WordNet Affect (Valiuttti et al.",

        "This is different from being unrelated.",
        "Definition 4: If a-ß is a factor used for the computation of relatedness of wi to aand ß, the proper function TRI*a-ß (w,) returns a value outside the interval [-1, 1] when wi is unrelated to the a-ß factor:",

        "Synonymy is a lexical relation that holds not between a pair of words but between specific senses of those words.",
        "That is, the notation {literal1:n1 literal2:n2 ... literalk:nk} will mean that the meaning given by the sense number n1 of the literal1, the meaning given by sense number n2 of the literal2 and so on are all pairwise synonymous.",

        "This conceptual opposition is even more obvious in this example, as the pairs <go up:1 go down:1> and <come up:1 come down:1> are also explicitly marked as antonymic.",

        "It generalizes the SWN3.0 subjectivity mark-up, according to a user-based multi-criteria differential semantics model.",
        "The partial comparison with SWN3.0 revealed specific limitations of our approach.",
        "The major one is due to the definitions of n-relatedness and the TRI relation.",
        "The problem resides in indiscriminate treatment of literals which have senses with different polarities with respect to a factor.",
        "If one of these senses is significantly closer to one of the poles of the factor, that sense might impose the sign for the rest of the senses.",
        "This risk is amplified when literals with high degrees of polysemy and/or high degrees of synonymy are reached on the way from the synset of interest to the synsets defining the S-factor (higher the polysemy/synonymy, higher the number of paths to the constituents of the S-factor).",
        "Most of the erroneous scores we noticed were explained by this drawback.",
        "We say that the words affected by this limitation of the current algorithm have a significant connotation shift potential (Tufis, 2009), (§tefanescu, 2010).",
        "As such words could generate undesired implicatures, they should be avoided in formal texts and replaced by synonyms with less connotation shift potential.",
