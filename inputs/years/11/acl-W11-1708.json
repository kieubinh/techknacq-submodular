        "The rapid growth of Social Networking Services such as Facebook, Myspace and Twitter over the last few years has made it possible to gather data on human interactions on a large scale, causing an increased interest in the field of Social Network Analysis and Extraction.",
        "Although we are now more interconnected than ever before due to technological advances, social networks have always been a vital part of human existence.",
        "They are prerequisite to the distribution of knowledge and beliefs among people and to the formation of larger entities such as organizations and communities.",
        "By applying the technology of today to the heritage of our past, it may be possible to uncover yet unknown patterns and provide a better insight into our society's development.",
        "In this paper we present a case study based on historical biographical information, so-called secondary historical sources, describing people in a particular domain, region and time frame: the Dutch social movement between the mid-19th and mid-20th century.",
        "\"Social movement\" refers to the social-political-economical complex of ideologies, worker's unions, political organizations, and art movements that arose from the ideas of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and followers.",
        "In the Netherlands, a network of persons unfolded over time with leader figures such as Ferdinand Domela Nieuwen-huis (1846-1919) and Pieter Jelles Troelstra (18601930).",
        "Although this network is implicit in all the primary and secondary historical writings documenting the period, and partly explicit in the minds of experts studying the domain, there is no explicitly modeled social network ofthis group ofpersons.",
        "Yet, it would potentially benefit further research in social history to have this in the form of a computational model.",
        "In our study we focus on detecting and labeling relations between two persons, where one of the persons, A, is the topic of a biographical article, and the other person, B, is mentioned in that article.",
        "The genre of biographical articles allows us to assume that person A is topical throughout the text.",
        "What remains is to determine whether the mention of person B signifies a relation between A and B, and if so, whether the relation in the direction of A to B can be labeled as positive, neutral, or negative.",
        "Many more fine-grained labels are possible (as discussed later in the paper), but the primary aim of our case study is to build a basic network out of robustly recognized person-to-person relations at the highest possible accuracy.",
        "As our data only consists of several hundreds of articles describing an amount of people of roughly the same order of magnitude, we are facing data sparsity, and thus are limited in the granularity of the labels we wish to predict.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "After a brief survey of related research in Section 2, we describe our method of research, our data, and our annotation scheme in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we describe how we implement relation detection and classification as supervised machine learning tasks.",
        "The outcomes of the experiments on our data are provided in Section 5.",

        "Our research combines Social Network Extraction and Sentiment Analysis.",
        "We briefly review related research in both areas.",
        "A widely used method for determining the relatedness of two entities was first introduced by Kautz et al. (1997).",
        "They compute the relatedness between two entities by normalizing their co-occurrence count on the Web with their individual hit counts using the Jaccard coefficient.",
        "If the coefficient reaches a certain threshold, the entities are considered to be related.",
        "For disambiguation purposes, keywords are added to the queries when obtaining the hit counts.",
        "Matsuo et al. (2004) apply the same method to find connections between members of a closed community of researchers.",
        "They gather person names from conference attendance lists to create the nodes of the network.",
        "The affiliations of each person are added to the queries as a crude form of named entity disambiguation.",
        "When a connection is found, the relation is labeled by applying minimal rules, based on the occurrence of manually selected keywords, to the contents of websites where both entities are mentioned.",
        "A more elaborate approach to network mining is taken by Mika (2005) in his presentation of the Flink system.",
        "In addition to Web cooccurrence counts of person names, the system uses data mined from other – highly structured – sources such as email headers, publication archives and so-called Friend-Of-A-Friend (FOAF) profiles.",
        "Cooccurrence counts of a name and different interests taken from a predefined set are used to determine a person's expertise and to enrich their profile.",
        "These profiles are then used to resolve named entity co-reference and to find new connections.",
        "Elson et al. (2010) use quoted speech attribution to reconstruct the social networks of the characters in a novel.",
        "Though this work is most related regarding the type of data used, their method can be considered complementary to ours: where they relate entities based on their conversational interaction without further analysis of the content, we try to find connections based solely on the words that occur in the text.",
        "Efforts in more general relation extraction from text have focused on finding recurring patterns and transforming them into triples (RDF).",
        "Relation types and labels are then deduced from the most common patterns (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Culotta et al., 2006).",
        "These approaches work well for the induction and verification of straightforwardly verbalized factoids, but they are too restricted to capture the multitude of aspects that surround human interaction; a case in point is the kind of relationship between two persons, which people can usually infer from the text, but is rarely explicitly described in a single triple.",
        "Sentiment analysis is concerned with locating and classifying the subjective information contained in a source.",
        "Subjectivity is inherently dependent on human interpretation and emotion.",
        "A machine can be taught to mimic these aspects, given enough examples, but the interaction of the two is what makes humans able to understand, for instance, that a sarcastic comment is not meant to be taken literally.",
        "Although the general distinction between negative and positive is intuitive for humans to make, subjectivity and sentiment are very much domain and context dependent.",
        "Depending on the domain and context, a single sentence can have opposite meanings (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Many of the approaches to automatically solving tasks like these involve using lists of positively and negatively polarized words or phrases to calculate the overall sentiment of a clause, sentence or document (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "As shown by Kim and Hovy (2006), the order of the words potentially influences the interpretation of a text.",
        "Pang et al. (2002) also found that the simple presence of a word is more important than the number of times it appears.",
        "Word sense disambiguation can be a useful tool in determining polarity.",
        "Turney (2002) proposed a simple, but seemingly effective way to determine polarity at the word level.",
        "He calculates the difference between the mutual information gain of a phrase and the word 'excellent' and of the same phrase and the word 'poor'."

        "In contrast to most previous work regarding social network extraction, we do not possess any explicit record of the network we are after.",
        "Although the documents we work with are available online, the number of hyperlinks between them is minimal and all personal relations are expressed only in running text.",
        "We aim to train a system able to extract these relations and classify their polarity automatically using as little information as possible that is not explicitly included in the text, thus keeping the reliance on external resources as limited as possible.",
        "We take the same approach with regards to the sentiment analysis part of the task: no predefined lists are supplied to the system and no word sense disambiguation is performed.",
        "We take a supervised machine learning approach to solving the problem, by training support vector machines on a limited number of preclassified examples.",
        "We chose to use SVMs as a baseline method that has been shown to be effective in text categorization tasks (Joachims, 1998).",
        "We compare performance between joint learning, using one multi-class classifier, and a pipeline, using a single class classifier to judge whether an instance describes a relation, and a second classifier to classify the relations according to their polarity.",
        "We use the Biographical Dictionary of Socialism and the Workers' Movement in the Netherlands (BWSA) as input for our system.",
        "This digital resource consists of 574 biographical articles, in Dutch, relating to the most notable actors within the domain.",
        "The texts are accompanied by a database that holds such metadata as a person's full name and known aliases, dates of birth and death, and a short description of the role they played within the Workers' Movement.",
        "The articles were written by over 200 different authors, thus the use of vocabulary varies greatly across the texts.",
        "The length ofthe biographies also varies: the shortest text has 308 tokens, the longest has 7,188 tokens.",
        "The mean length is 1,546 tokens with a standard deviation of784.",
        "A biography can be seen as a summary ofthe most important events in a person's life.",
        "Therefore, this type of data suits our purpose well: any person that the main character was closely related to, can be expected to appear in his or her biography.",
        "In training our relation extraction system we look only at the relation from A to B and its associated polarity.",
        "The assumption that we make here is that by processing the BWSA in its entirety, making each of the 574 main characters person A once and harvesting all of their relations, we will get a full view of the existing relations, including the relation from B to A if A and B have a relation and B also has a biography in the BWSA.",
        "We create one data set focused on a particular person who is prevalent throughout the data, namely Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis (FDN).",
        "He started his career as a Lutheran priest, but lost his faith and pursued a career in socialist politics.",
        "After a series ofdisappointments, however, he turned to anarchism and eventually withdrew himself from the political stage completely, though his ideas continued to inspire others.",
        "We expect that the turmoil of his life will be reflected in his social network and the variety of relationships surrounding him.",
        "As a first step in recreating Domela Nieuwenhuis' network, we extract all sentences from the BWSA that mention the name 'Domela', by which he is generally known.",
        "We exclude Domela's own biography from the search.",
        "All but one of the extracted sentences, 447 in total, actually refer to Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis.",
        "This sentence is removed, resulting in a total of 446 sentences spread over 153 biographies.",
        "Each sentence with a mention is expanded with additional context, to capture more clues than the sentence with the mention might hold.",
        "Preliminary tests showed that two sentences of context before the mention, and two sentences of context after the mention is sufficient.",
        "Often there is an introduction before a person is mentioned, and an elaboration on the relation after the mention.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example fragment.",
        "However, since Domela was a rather controversial and atypical figure, his network might not be a good representation of the actual relations in the data.",
        "Therefore, we create a second data set by randomly extracting another 534 sentences with their surrounding context from the BWSA that contain a named entity which is not the main entity of the biography.",
        "We aim to test which data set leads to better performance in finding and classifying relations across the entire community.",
        "All fragments in the Domela set were annotated by two human annotators, native speakers of Dutch, but unfamiliar with the domain of social history.",
        "They were asked to judge whether the fragment does in fact describe a relation between the two entities and, ifso, whether the polarity ofthe relation from A to B is negative, neutral, or positive; i.e. whether person A has a negative, neutral or positive attitude towards person B.",
        "With regards to the existence of a relation, the annotators reached an agreement of 74.9%.",
        "For the negative, neutral and positive classes they agreed on 60.8%, 24.2%, and 66.5%, respectively.",
        "All disagreements were resolved in discussion.",
        "The class distribution over the three polarities after resolution is shown in Table 1.",
        "The generic set was annotated by only one of the annotators.",
        "The class distribution of this set is also shown in Table 1.",

        "A possible explanation for this is the fact that the 'not related' fragments in the FDN set specifically describe situations where the main entity is not related to Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis; these fragments could still describe a relation from the main entity to another person mentioned in the fragment and therefore be miss-classified.",
