        "The approach does not rely on predefined sentiment lexicons, and the motivation for this is that potentially every word could be considered as expressing something positive and/or negative in different situations, and that the context and the personal attitude of the opinion holder should be taken into account when determining the polarity of the phrase, instead of doing this out of particular context."

        "In order to extract distinctive phrases we use the approach of Burek and Gerdemann (2009), who try to identify phrases, which are distinctive for each of the four different categories of documents in their medical data.",
        "With distinctive they mean phrases, which occur predominantly in one category of the documents or another.",
        "The algorithm extracts phrases of any length.",
        "The idea is that if a phrase is distinctive for a particular category, it does not matter how long the phrase is.",
        "The algorithm looks for repeats of phrases of any length, and could also count different types of occurrences of phrases, e.g. maximal, left-maximal, or right maximal.",
        "Considering such types of occurrences, it is possible to restrict the use of certain phrases, which might not be much distinctive and therefore might not be representative for a category.",
        "Similar to Burek and Gerdemann (2009) we experiment with using all types of occurrences of a phrase as long as the phrase occurs maximally at least one time in the text.",
        "Distinctive phrases are phrases, which predominantly occur in one particular type of documents (Burek and Gerdemann, 2009).",
        "The presence of such phrases in a document is a good indicator of the category (or type) of the document.",
        "The general rule, as Burek and Gerdemann (2009) point out, is that if some phrases are uniformly distributed in a set of documents with different categories, then these phrases are not distinctive for any of the categories in the collection.",
        "On the other hand, if particular phrases appear more often in one category of documents than in another, they are good representatives for the documents of this type, and consequently are said to be distinctive.",
        "There are different weighting schemes, which one can use to determine the importance of a term for the semantics of a document.",
        "Burek and Gerdemann (2009) implement their own scoring function for weighting the extracted phrases.",
        "One of their reasons not to use the standard weighting function tf-idf is that the idf measure does not take into account what the category of the documents is, in which the term occurs.",
        "This is important in their case, because their data consist of four categories, which could be grouped in two main classes, namely excellent and good on the one hand, and fair and poor on the other hand.",
        "A problem when using tf-idf will appear, if there is a rare phrase, which occurs in a small number of documents, however, it clusters in documents from the two different classes, for example, in excellent and fair, or in good and poor.",
        "This will not be a good distinctive phrase for this categorization of the data.",
        "Another motivation to develop their own scoring function is to cope with the problem of burstiness (see section 2.2.1).",
        "This section describes the algorithm of Burek and Gerdemann (2009) for extracting distinctive phrases and how we have modified and used it in the context of our work.",
        "We first show how the phrases are ranked, so that one knows what phrases are more or less distinctive than others.",
        "The extracted phrases are represented by occurrence vectors.",
        "These vectors have two elements - one for the number of documents with category positive polarity, and another for the negative polarity.",
        "Each element of the vector stores the number of distinct documents, in which the phrase occurs.",
        "For example, if a phrase occurs in 10 positive reviews, and 1 negative review, the occurrence vector of this phrase is <10, 1> .",
        "This shows that for the representation of the phrases we take into account the document frequency of the phrase, and not its term frequency.",
        "The motivation behind this choice is to cope with the problem of burstiness of terms.",
        "Madsen et al.",
        "(2005) explain burstiness in the following way: The term burstiness (Church and Gale, 1995; Katz, 1996) describes the behavior of a rare word appearing many times in a single document.",
        "Because of the large number of possible words, most words do not appear in a given document.",
        "However, if a word does appear once, it is much more likely to appear again, i.e. words appear in bursts.",
        "We assign a score to a phrase by giving the phrase one point, if the phrase occurs in a document with positive polarity and zero points, if it occurs in a document with negative polarity.",
        "Let us take again the occurrence vector of <10, 1> .",
        "According to the way the points are given, the vector will be assigned a score of 10 ((1 point * 10) + (0 points * 1) = 10).",
        "Is this a good score, which indicates that the phrase is distinctive for documents of category positive polarity?",
        "We can answer this question, if we randomly choose another phrase, which occurs in 11 documents, and see what the probability is, that this phrase would have a score, which is higher than or equally high to the score of the phrase in question (Burek and Gerdemann, 2009).",
        "In order to calculate this probability, the scoring method performs a simulation, in which occurrence vectors for randomly chosen phrases are created.",
        "Let us pick randomly one phrase, which hypothetically occurs in 11 reviews.",
        "Let also, have a data of 600 positive reviews and 600 negative reviews.",
        "The probability then, that the random phrase would occur in a positive or a negative review is 0.5.",
        "Based on these probabilities, the simulation process constructs random vectors for the random phrase, indicating whether the phrase occurs in a positive or in negative review.",
        "For example, if in a particular run, the simulation says that the random phrase occurs in a positive review, then we have a random vector of <1, 0>.",
        "Otherwise, <0, 1> for a negative review.",
        "The program calculates as many random vectors as the number of reviews, in which the random phrase is said to occur.",
        "In this example, the number of documents is 11.",
        "Therefore, 11 random vectors will be constructed.",
        "They may look like this: <1, 0>, <1, 0>, <0, 1> , <1, 0>, <1, 0>, <0, vectors are then summed up, and the result vector <6, 5> is the random occurrence vector for the random phrase.",
        "It tells us that the phrase, hypothetically, occurs in 6 positive and in 5 negative reviews.",
        "The score for the random phrase is now calculated in the same way as for the non-random phrases: 1 point is given for each occurrence of the phrase in a positive review, and 0 points otherwise.",
        "So, the score for this phrase is 6 ( ((1 point * 6) + (0 points * 5) = 6) ).",
        "This process is performed a certain number of times.",
        "For the experiments presented in section 3.2, we run the simulation 10,000 times for each extracted phrase.",
        "This means that 10,000 random vectors per phrase are created.",
        "The last step is to compare the scores of the random phrase with the score of the actual phrase, and to see how many of the 10,000 random vectors give a score higher than or equally high to the score of the actual phrase.",
        "If the number of random vectors, which give a higher than or equally high score to the actual phrase, is bigger than the number of random vectors, which give a score lower than the actual phrase, then the actual phrase is assigned a positive score, and the value of this score is the approximate number of random vectors, from which higher than or equally high scores to the actual phrase score are calculated.",
        "If the number is lower, the phrase is assigned the approximate number of random vectors, from which lower scores than the actual phrase score are calculated, and a minus sign is attached to the number, making the score negative.",
        "The main idea of the algorithm is that if a phrase is distinctive for a particular category, it does not matter how long the phrase is - as long as it helps for distinguishing one type of document from another, it should be extracted.",
        "In order to extract phrases in this way, the whole collection of documents is represented as one long string.",
        "Each phrase is then a substring of this string.",
        "It will be very expensive to compute statistics (i.e. tf and df) and to run the simulation process (see 2.2.1) for each substring in the text.",
        "The reason is that the amount of substrings might be huge - there are a total of N(N + 1) / 2 substrings in a corpus (Yamamoto and Church, 2001).",
        "Yamamoto and Church (2001) show how this problem can be overcome by grouping the substrings into equivalence classes and performing operations (i.e. computing statistics) on these classes instead of on the individual elements of the classes.",
        "They use for this the suffix array data structure.",
        "The number of the classes is at most 2N - 1.",
        "The suffix array data structure allows for easy manipulation of the strings.",
        "The algorithm extracts phrases if they repeat in text, and if the phrases occur maximally at least once in the text.",
        "If the phrase do not occur maximally at least one time, then it may not be a good linguistic unit, which could stand on its own.",
        "Example of such words might be the different parts of certain named entities.",
        "For instance, the name Bugs Bunny.",
        "If Bugs or Bunny never appear apart from each other in the text, then this imply that they comprise a single entity and they should always appear together in the text.",
        "In this case it does not make sense, for example, to count only Bugs or only Bunny and calculate statistics (e.g. tf or df) for each of them.",
        "They should be grouped instead into a class.",
        "Burek and Gerdemann (2009) mention three different types of occurrences of a phrase: left maximal, right maximal, and maximal.",
        "A left maximal occurrence of a phrase S[i,j] means that the longer phrase S[i-1,j] does not repeat in the corpus (Burek and Gerdemann, 2009).",
        "For example, in the sentences below, the phrase recommend is not left maximal, because it can be extended to the left with the word highly:",
        "I highly recommend the book.",
        "You highly recommend this camera.",
        "On the other hand the phrase highly recommend is left maximal.",
        "In a similar way we define the notion of right maximal occurrence of a phrase.",
        "A maximal occurrence of a phrase is when the occurrence of the phrase is both left maximal and right maximal (Burek and Gerdemann, 2009).",
        "The phrase highly recommend in the example sentences above is in this sense maximal.",
        "It is not clear a priori which of these types should be taken into account for the successful realization of a given application.",
        "One could consider only the left maximal, only the right maximal, only the maximal occurrences of the phrases, or all occurrences.",
        "We experimented with all occurrences.",
        "Our motivation is that using all phrases would give us a big enough number of distinctive phrases and we will most probably not have a problem with data sparseness."

        "On the one hand, the phrases should be as much distinctive as possible.",

        "On the other hand, using all extracted phrases might bring a lot of noise, because many of the phrases will not be very good characteristics of the data.",
        "We experimented with several different subsets of the set of all extracted phrases.",

        "It is interesting to notice that although the results of the experiments are different, they are very close to each other, regardless of the big difference in the number of phrases used as features.",
        "Therefore, we decided to experiment with all extracted phrases.",
        "It turned out that the results of that experiment are the best.",
        "This would imply that the bigger number of phrases is helpful and it compensates for the use of phrases that are not much distinctive.",

        "It seems intuitive that when bigrams are used, we would have a better representation of the texts, because we would know what words combine with what other words in the texts.",

        "For the domain books the overall precision, recall and F-measure results achieved with that model (81%) are 2% higher than the results obtained using the 1-gram model, and 6% higher than the results obtained using the 2-gram model.",
        "For domain cameras & photos, an improvement of 1% and 3% is achieved with the phrase model in comparison with the 1-gram and 2 gram models, respectively.",
        "Related Work",
        "Close to our work seems to be Funk et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "They classify product and company reviews into one of the 1-star to 5-star categories.",
        "The features to the learning algorithm (also SVM) are simple linguistic features of single tokens.",
        "They report best results with the combinations root & orthography, and only root.",
        "Another interesting related work is that of Turney (2002).",
        "He uses an unsupervised learning algorithm to classify a review as recommended or not recommended.",
        "The algorithm extracts phrases from a given review, and determines their pointwise mutual information with the words excellent and poor.",
        "Turney (2002) points out that the contexual information is very often necessary for the correct determination of the sentiment polarity of a certain word.",
        "Conclusion",
        "This paper presented different experiments on classifying product reviews of domains books and cameras & photos under the categories positive polarity and negative polarity using distinctive (maximally occurring) phrases as features.",
        "For both domains best results were achieved with all extracted distinctive phrases as features.",
        "This approach outperforms slightly the 1-gram and 2-gram experiments on this data and shows that the use of phrases occurring maximally in text could be successfully applied in the classification of sentiment data and that it is worth experimenting with classifying sentiment data without necessarily relying on general predefined sentiment lexicons.",
