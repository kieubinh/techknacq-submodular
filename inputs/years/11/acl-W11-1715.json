        "It implies to share a common code as well as being able to infer information beyond the semantic meaning.",
        "A lot of communicative acts imply information not grammatically expressed to be able to decode the whole sense: if the hearer is not capable to infer that information, the communicative process is incomplete.",
        "Let us consider a joke.",
        "The amusing effect sometimes relies on not given information.",
        "If such information is not filled, the result is a bad, or better said, a misunderstood joke.",
        "This information, which is not expressed with \"physical\" words, supposes a great challenge, even from a linguistic analysis, because it points to social and cognitive layers quite difficult to be computationally represented.",
        "One of the communicative phenomena which better represents this problem is irony.",
        "According to Wilson and Sperber (2007), irony is essentially a communicative act which expresses an opposite meaning of what was literally said.",
        "Due to irony is common in texts that express subjective and deeply-felt opinions, its presence represents a significant obstacle to the accurate analysis of sentimentin such texts (cf. Councill etal.",

      "text": [
        "Literature divides two primaries classes of irony: verbal and situational.",
        "Most theories agree on the main property of the former: verbal irony conveys an opposite meaning; i.e. a speaker says something that seems to be the opposite of what s/he means (Colston and Gibbs, 2007).",
        "In contrast, situational irony is a state of the world which is perceived as ironical (Attardo, 2007); i.e. situations that should not be (Lucariello, 2007).",
        "Our work focuses on verbal irony.",
        "This kind of irony is defined as a way of intentionally denying what it is literally expressed (Curco, 2007); i.e. a kind of indirect negation (Giora, 1995).",
        "On the basis of some pragmatic frameworks, authors focus on certain fine-grained aspects of this term.",
        "For instance, Grice (1975) considers that an utterance is ironic if it intentionally violates some conversational maxims.",
        "Wilson and Sperber (2007) assume that verbal irony must be understood as echoic; i.e. as a distinction between use and mention.",
        "Utsumi (1996), in contrast, suggests an ironic environment which causes a negative emotional attitude.",
        "According to these points of view, the elements to conceive a verbal expression as ironic point to different ways of explaining the same underlying concept of opposition, but specially note, however, that most of them rely on literary studies (Attardo, 2007); thus, their computational formalization is quite challenging.",
        "Furthermore, consider that people have their own concept of irony, which often does not match with the rules suggested by the experts.",
        "For instance, consider the following expressions retrieved from the web:",
        "1.",
        "\"If you find it hard to laugh at yourself, I would be happy to do it for you.\"",
        "2.",
        "\"Let's pray that the human race never escapes from Earth to spread its iniquity elsewhere.\"",
        "These examples, according to some usergenerated tags, could be either ironic, or sarcastic, or even satiric.",
        "However, the issue we want to focus does not lie on what tag should be the right for every expression, but on the fact that there is not a clear distinction about the boundaries among these terms.",
        "For Colston (2007), sarcasm is a term commonly used to describe an expression of verbal irony; whereas for Gibbs (2007), sarcasm along with jocularity, hyperbole, rhetorical questions, and understatement, are types of irony.",
        "Attardo (2007) in turn, considers that sarcasm is an overtly aggressive type of irony.",
        "Furthermore, according to Gibbs and Colston (2007), irony is often compared to satire and parody.",
        "In accordance with these statements, the limits among these figurative devices are not clearly differentiable.",
        "Their differences rely indeed on matters of usage, tone, and obviousness, which are not so evident in ordinary communication acts.",
        "Therefore, if there are no formal boundaries to separate these concepts, even from a theoretical perspective, people will not be able to produce ironic expressions as the experts suggest.",
        "Instead, there will be a mixture of expressions pretending to be ironic but being sarcastic, satiric, or even humorous.",
        "This get worse when dealing with non prototypical examples.",
        "Observe the following fragment from our corpus:",
        "3.",
        "\"I am giving this product [a t-shirt] 5 stars because not everyone out there is a ladies' man.",
        "In the hands of lesser beings, it can help you find love.",
        "In the hands of a playa like me, it can only break hearts.",
        "That's why I say use with caution.",
        "I am passing the torch onto you, be careful out there folks.\"",
        "In this text irony is perceived as a mixture of sarcasm and satire, whose effect is not only based on expressing an opposite or negative meaning, but a humorous one as well.",
        "Taking into account these assumptions, we begin by defining irony as a verbal subjective expression whose formal constituents attempt to communicate an underlying meaning, focusing on negative or humorous aspects, which is opposite to the one expressed.",
        "Based on this definition, we consider sarcasm, satire, and figures such as the ones suggested in (Gibbs, 2007), as specific extensions of a general concept of irony, and consequently, we will not make any fine-grained distinction among them; i.e. irony will include them."

        "However, his model is too abstract to represent irony beyond an idealized hearer-listener interaction.",

        "A total of 3,163 reviews were retrieved.",
        "Then, in order to automatically filter the ones more likely to be ironic without performing a manual annotation (which is planned to be carried out in the near feature), we removed the reviews whose customer rating, according to the Amazon rating criteria, was lesser than four stars.",
        "The assumptions behind this decision rely on two facts: i) the viral purpose, and ii) the ironic effect.",
        "The former caused that people to post reviews whose main purpose, and perhaps the only one, was to exalt superficial properties and non-existent consequences; thus the possibilities to find real reviews were minimal.",
        "Considering this scenario, the latter supposes that, if someone ironically wants to reflect properties and consequences such as the previous ones, s/he will not do it by rating the products with one or two stars, instead, s/he will rate them with the highest scores.",
        "After applying this filter, we obtained an ironic set integrated with 2,861 documents.",
        "On the other hand, two negative sets were automatically collected from two sites: Amazon.com (AMA) and Slashdot.com (SLA).",
        "Each contains 3,000 documents.",

        "For instance, consider the following ironic sentence: \"I became the man I always dreamed I could be all those nights staying up late watching wrestling\", where most of its constituents are words whose pleasantness score is > 2.5; i.e. these words (in italics) should communicate information related to favorable pleasant contexts."

        "Irony is one of the most subjective phenomena related to linguistic analysis.",
        "Its automatic processing is a real challenge, not only from a computational perspective but from a linguistic one as well.",
        "In this work we have suggested a model of six categories which attempts to describe salient characteristics of irony.",
        "They intend to symbolize low and high level properties of irony on the basis of formal linguistic elements.",
        "This model was assessed by creating a freely available data set with ironic reviews.",
        "The results achieved with three different classifiers are satisfactory, both in terms of classification accuracy, as well as precision, recall, and F-measure.",
        "Further work consists of improving the quality of every category, as well as of identifying new ones in order to come up with an improved model capable to detect better ironic patterns in different kinds of texts."
