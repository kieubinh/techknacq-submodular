        "Summarization systems may want to summarize factual and opinionated content differently (Murray and Carenini, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we perform subjectivity detection at sentence level, which is more appropriate for some subsequent processing such as opinion summarization.",
        "Previous work has shown that when enough labeled data is available, supervised classification methods can achieve high accuracy for subjectivity detection in some domains.",
        "However, it is often expensive to create such training data.",
        "On the other hand, a lot of unannotated data is readily available in various domains.",
        "Therefore an interesting and important problem is to develop semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods that can learn from an unannotated corpus.",
        "In this study, we use an unsupervised learning approach where we first use a knowledge-based method to create an initial training set, and then apply a calibrated EM method to learn from an unannotated corpus.",
        "Our experiments show significant differences among the three domains: movie, news article, and meeting dialog.",
        "This can be explained by the inherent difference of the data, especially the task difficulty and classifier's performance for a domain.",
        "We demonstrate that for some domains (e.g., movie data) the unsupervised learning methods can rival the supervised approach."

        "In the early age, knowledge-based methods were widely used for subjectivity detection.",
        "They used a lexicon or patterns and rules to predict whether a target is subjective or not.",
        "These methods tended to yield a high precision and low recall, or low precision and high recall (Kim and Hovy, 2005).",
        "Recently, machine learning approaches have been adopted more often (Ng et al., 2006).",
        "There are limitations in both methods.",
        "In knowledge-based approaches, a predefined subjectivity lexicon may not adapt well to different domains.",
        "While in machine learning approach, human labeling efforts are required to create a large training set.",
        "To overcome the above drawbacks, unsupervised or semi-supervised methods have been explored in sentiment analysis.",
        "For polarity classification, some previous work used spectral techniques (Dasgupta and Ng, 2009) or co-training (Li et al., 2010) to mine the reviews in a semi-supervised manner.",
        "For subjectivity identification, Wiebe and Riloff (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) applied a rule-based method to create a training set first and then used it to train a naive Bayes classifier.",
        "Melville et al.",
        "(Melville et al., 2009) used a pooling multinomial method to combine lexicon derived probability and statistical probability.",
        "Our work is similar to the study in (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) in that we both use a rule-based method to create an initial training set and learn from unannotated corpus.",
        "However, there are two key differences.",
        "First, unlike the self-training method they used, we use a calibrated EM iterative learning approach.",
        "Second, we compare the results on three different corpora in order to evaluate the domain/genre effect of the unsupervised method.",
        "Our cross-corpus study shows how the unsupervised learning approach performs in different domains and helps us understand what are the factors impacting the learning methods.",
        "We use three data sets from different domains: movie, news resource, and meeting conversations.",
        "The first two are from written text domain and have been widely used in many previous studies for sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004; Raaijmakers and Kraaij, 2008).",
        "The third one is from speech transcripts.",
        "It has been used in a few recent studies (Raaijmakers et al., 2008; Murray and Carenini, 2009), but not as much as those text data.",
        "The following provides more details of the data.",
        "• The first corpus is movie data (Pang and Lee, 2004).",
        "It contains 5,000 subjective sentences collected from movie reviews and 5,000 objective sentences collected from movie plot summaries.",
        "The sentences in each collection are randomly ordered.",
        "• The second one is extracted from MPQA corpus (version 2.0) (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003), which is collected from news articles.",
        "This data has been annotated with subjective information at phrase level.",
        "We adopted the same rules as in (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) to create the sentence level label: if a sentence has at least one private state of strength medium or higher, then the sentence is labeled SUBJECTIVE, otherwise it is labeled OBJECTIVE.",
        "We randomly extracted 5,000 subjective and 5,000 objective sentences from this corpus to make it comparable with the movie data.",
        "• The third data set is from AMI meeting corpus.",
        "It has been annotated using the scheme described in (Wilson, 2008).",
        "There are 3 main categories of annotations regarding sentiments: subjective utterances, subjective questions, and objective polar utterances.",
        "We consider the",
        "union of subjective utterance and subjective question as subjective and the rest as objective.",
        "The subjectivity classification task is done at the dialog act (DA) levels.",
        "We label each DA using the label of the utterance that has overlap with it.",
        "We create a balanced data set using this corpus, containing 9,892 DAs in total.",
        "This number is slightly less than those for movie and MPQA data because of the available data size in this corpus.",
        "The data is also randomly ordered without considering the role of the speaker and which meeting it belongs to.",
        "Table 1 summarizes statistics for the three data sets.",
        "We can see that sentences in meeting dialogs (AMI data) are generally shorter than the other domains, and that sentences in news domain (MPQA) are longer, and also have a larger variance.",
        "In addition, the inter-annotator agreement on AMI data is quite low, which shows it is even difficult for human to determine whether an utterance contains sentiment in meeting conversations.",
        "Table 1: Statistics for the three data sets: movie, MPQA, and AMI data.",
