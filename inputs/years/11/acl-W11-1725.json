        "A comprehensive state of the art in the field of sentiment analysis, together with potential applications of such opinion identification tools, is presented in (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Starting from the early 1990s, the research on sentiment-analysis and point of views generally assumed the existence of subsystems for rather sophisticated NLP tasks, ranging from parsing to the resolution of pragmatic ambiguities (Hearst, 1992; Wiebe 1990 and 1994).",
        "In Sentimatrix, in order to identify the sentiment a user expresses about a specific product or company, the company name must be first identified in the text.",
        "Named entity recognition (NER) systems typically use linguistic grammar-based techniques or statistical models (an overview is presented in (Nadeau and Satoshi Sekine.",
        "2007)).",
        "Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists.",
        "Besides, the task is hard to adapt to new domains.",
        "Various sentiment types and levels have been considered, starting from the \"universal\" six level of emotions considered in (Ovesdotter Alm, 2005; Liu et al., 2003; Subasic and Huettner, 2001): anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.",
        "For Sentimatrix, we adapted this approach to five levels of sentiments: strong positive, positive, neutral, negative and strong negative.",
        "The first known systems relied on relatively shallow analysis based on manually built discriminative word lexicons (Tong 2001), used to classify a text unit by trigger terms or phrases contained in a lexicon.",
        "The lack of sufficient amounts of sentiment annotated corpora led the researchers to incorporate learning components into their sentiment analysis tools, usually supervised classification modules, (e.g., categorization according to affect), as initiated in (Wiebe and Bruce 1995).",
        "Much of the literature on sentiment analysis has focused on text written in English.",
        "Sentimatrix is designed to be, as much as possible, language independent, the resources used being easily adaptable for any language.",
        "Some of the most known tools available nowadays for NER and Opinion Mining are: Clarabridge (www.clarabridge.com), RavenPack (ravenpack.com), Lexalytics (www.lexalytics.com) OpenAmplify (openamplify.com), Radian6 (www.radian6.com), Limbix (lymbix.com), but companies like Google, Microsoft, Oracle, SAS, are also deeply involved in this task."

        "Each token is annotated with two pieces of information: its lemma (for Romanian it is obtained from our resource with 76,760 word lemmas corresponding to 633,444 derived forms) and the normalized form (translated into the proper diacritics).",
        "Language detection is a preprocessing step problem of classifying a sample of characters based on its features (language-specific models).",

        "The Romanian 3-gram profile for this method was developed from scratch, using our articles archive.",
        "The language detection in this case performs simple distance measurement between every language profile that we have and the test document profile.",
        "The N-grams classification method implies, along with computing frequencies, a posterior Naive Bayes implementation.",
        "The third method solves the problematic issue of short phrases language detection and it implies looking through the lemmas of several words to obtain the specificity of the test document.",
        "The Named Entity Recognition component for Romanian language is created using linguistic grammar-based techniques and a set of resources.",
        "Our component is based on two modules, the named entity identification module and the named entity classification module.",

        "2. the first token of a phrase is in our common word list.",
        "In the second situation there are considered two cases:",

        "),",
        "b. this common word is followed by uppercase words (in this case the first word of the sentence is kept in the NEs candidate list, and in a further step it will be decided if it will be combined with the following word in order to create a composed named entity).",
        "Named Entities Classification: In the classification process we use some of rules utilized in the unification of NEs candidates along with the resource of NEs and several rules specifically tailored for classification.",
        "Thus, after all NEs in the input text are identified and, if possible, compound NEs have been created, we apply the following classification rules: contextual rules (using contextual information, we are able to classify candidate NEs in one of the categories Organization, Company, Person, City and Country by considering a mix between regular expressions and trigger words) and resource-based rules (if no triggers were found to indicate what type of entity we have, we start searching our databases for the candidate entity).",
        "Evaluation: The system's Upper Bound and its performance in real context are evaluated for each of the two modules (identification and classification) and for each named entity type.",
        "The first part of the evaluation shows an upper bound of 95.76% for F-measure at named entity extraction and 95.71% for named entity classification.",
        "In real context the evaluation shows a value of 90.72% for F-measure at named entity extraction and a value of 66.73% for named entity classification.",
