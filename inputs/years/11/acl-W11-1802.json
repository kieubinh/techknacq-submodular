        "The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter) is a series of efforts to promote a community-wide collaboration towards fine-grained information extraction (IE) in biomedical domain.",
        "The first event, BioNLP-ST 2009, introducing a bio-molecular event (bio-event) extraction task to the community, attracted a wide attention, with 42 teams being registered for participation and 24 teams submitting final results (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "To establish a community effort, the organizers provided the task definition, benchmark data, and evaluations, and the participants competed in developing systems to perform the task.",
        "Meanwhile, participants and organizers communicated to develop a better setup of evaluation, and some provided their tools and resources for other participants, making it a collaborative competition.",
        "Yue Wang",
        "Akinori Yonezawa",
        "The final results enabled to observe the state-of-the-art performance of the community on the bioevent extraction task, which showed that the automatic extraction of simple events - those with unary arguments, e.g. gene expression, localization, phos-phorylation - could be achieved at the performance level of 70% in F-score, but the extraction of complex events, e.g. binding and regulation, was a lot more challenging, having achieved 40% of performance level.",
        "After BioNLP-ST 2009, all the resources from the event were released to the public, to encourage continuous efforts for further advancement.",
        "Since then, several improvements have been reported (Miwa et al., 2010b; Poon and Vanderwende, 2010; Vlachos, 2010; Miwa et al., 2010a; Bj√∂rne et al., 2010).",
        "For example, Miwa et al.",
        "(Miwa et al., 2010b) reported a significant improvement with binding events, achieving 50% of performance level.",
        "The task introduced in BioNLP-ST 2009 was renamed to Genia event (GE) task, and was hosted again in BioNLP-ST 2011, which also hosted four other IE tasks and three supporting tasks (Kim et al., 2011).",
        "As the sole task that was repeated in the two events, the GE task was referenced during the development of other tasks, and took the role of connecting the results of the 2009 event to the main tasks of 2011.",
        "The GE task in 2011 received final submissions from 15 teams.",

        "When only primary arguments are considered, the first five event types in Table 1 are classified as simple event types, requiring only unary arguments.",
        "The Binding and Regulation types are more complex: Binding requires detection of an arbitrary number of arguments, and Regulation requires detection ofrecur-sive event structure.",
        "Based on the definition of event types, the entire task is divided to three subtasks addressing event extraction at different levels of specificity:",
        "Task 1.",
        "Core event extraction addresses the extraction of typed events together with their primary arguments.",
        "Task 2.",
        "Event enrichment addresses the extraction of secondary arguments that further specify the events extracted in Task 1.",
        "Task 3.",
        "Negation/Speculation detection addresses the detection of negations and speculations over the extracted events.",
