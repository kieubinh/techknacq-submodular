        "The Infectious Diseases (ID) task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (Kim et al., 2011a) is an information extraction task focusing on the biomolecu-lar mechanisms of infectious diseases.",
        "The primary target of the task is event extraction (Ananiadou et al., 2010), broadly following the task setup of the BioNLP'09 Shared Task (BioNLP ST'09) (Kim et al., 2009).",
        "The task concentrates on the specific domain of two-component systems (TCSs, or two-component regulatory systems), a mechanism widely used by bacteria to sense and respond to the environment (Thomason and Kay, 2000).",
        "Typical TCSs consist of two proteins, a membrane-associated sensor kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator.",
        "The sensor kinase monitors changes in the environment while the response regulator mediates an adaptive response, usually through differential expression of target genes (Mascher et al., 2006).",
        "TCSs have many functions, but those of particular interest for infectious disease researchers include virulence, response to antibiotics, quorum sensing, and bacterial cell attachment (Krell et al., 2010).",
        "Not all TCS functions are well known: in some cases, TCSs are involved in metabolic processes that are difficult to precisely characterize (Wang et al., 2010).",
        "TCSs are of interest also as drugs designed to disrupt TCSs may reduce the virulence of bacteria without killing it, thus avoiding the potential selective pressure of antibiotics lethal to some pathogenic bacteria (Gotoh et al., 2010).",
        "Information extraction techniques may support better understanding of these fundamental systems by identifying and structuring the molecular processes underlying two component signaling.",
        "The ID task seeks to address these opportunities by adapting the BioNLP ST'09 event extraction model to domain scientific publications.",
        "This model was originally introduced to represent biomolecu-lar events relating to transcription factors in human blood cells, and its adaptation to a domain that centrally concerns both bacteria and their hosts involves a variety of novel aspects, such as events concerning whole organisms, the chemical environment of bacteria, prokaryote-specific concepts (e.g. regulons as elements of gene expression), as well as the effects of biomolecules on larger-scale processes involving hosts such as virulence."

      "heading": "2. Task Setting",
      "text": [
        "The ID task broadly follows the task definition and event types of the BioNLP ST'09, extending it with new entity categories, correspondingly broadening the scope of events, and introducing a new class of events, high-level biological processes.",
        "The ID task defines five core types of entities: genes/gene products, two-component systems, regulons/operons, chemicals, and organisms.",
        "Following the general policy of the BioNLP Shared Task, the recognition of the core entities is not part of the ID task.",
        "As named entity recognition (NER) is considered in other prominent domain evaluations (Krallinger et al., 2008), we have chosen to isolate aspects of extraction performance relating to NER from the main task of interest, event extraction, by providing participants with human-created gold annotations for core entities.",
        "These annotations are briefly presented in the following.",
        "Mentions of names of genes and their products (RNA and proteins) are annotated with a single type, without differentiating between subtypes, following the guidelines of the GENIA GGP corpus (Ohta et al., 2009).",
        "This type is named ProTEIN to maintain consistency with related tasks (e.g. BioNLP ST'09), despite slight inaccuracy for cases specifically referencing RNA or DNA forms.",
        "Two-component systems, consisting of two proteins, frequently have names derived from the names of the proteins involved (e.g. PhoP-PhoR or SsrA/SsrB).",
        "Mentions of TCSs are annotated as Two-component-system, nesting Protein annotations if present.",
        "Regulons and operons are collections of genes whose expression is jointly regulated.",
        "Like the names of TCSs, their names may derive from the names of the involved genes and proteins, and are annotated as embedding Protein annotations when they do.",
        "The annotation does not differentiate between the two, marking both with a single type REGULON-OPERON.",
        "In addition to these three classes relating to genes and proteins, the core entity annotation recognizes the classes Chemical and Organism.",
        "All mentions of formal and informal names of atoms, inorganic compounds, carbohydrates and lipids as well as organic compounds other than amino acid and nucleic acid compounds (i.e. gene/protein-related compounds) are annotated as Chemical.",
        "Mentions of names of families, genera, species and strains as well as non-name references with comparable specificity are annotated as Organism.",
        "Finally, the non-specific type ENTITY is defined for marking entities that specify additional details of events such as the binding site in a Binding event or the location an entity moves to in a LOCALIZATION event.",
        "Unlike the core entities, annotations of the generic Entity type are not provided for test data and must be detected by participants addressing the full task.",
        "The ID task involves one relation, Equiv, defining entities (of any of the core types) to be equivalent.",
        "This relation is used to annotate abbreviations and local aliases and it is not a target of extraction, but provided for reference and applied in evaluation, where references to any of a set of equivalent entities are treated identically.",
        "The primary extraction targets of the ID task are the event types summarized in Table 1.",
        "These are a superset of those targeted in the BioNLP ST'09 and its repeat, the 2011 GE task (Kim et al., 2011b).",
        "This design makes it possible to study aspects of domain adaptation by having the same extraction targets in two subdomains of biomedicine, that of transcription factors in human blood cells (GE) and infectious diseases.",
        "The events in the ID task extend on those of GE in the inclusion of additional entity types as participants in previously considered event types and the introduction of a new type, PROCESS.",

        "Only two teams, UTurku and Con-cordU (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2011), attempted to extract event modifications, with somewhat limited performance.",
        "The difficulty of correct extraction of event modifications is related in part to the recursive nature of the problem (similarly as for nested regulation events): to extract a modification correctly, the modified event must also be extracted correctly.",
        "Further, only UTurku predicted any instances of secondary arguments.",
        "Thus, teams other than UTurku and ConcordU addressed only the core task extraction targets.",

        "This allows additional perspective into the relative performance of the systems.",
        "While there is a 13% point spread in overall results for the top five systems here, in GE all these systems achieved F-scores ranging between 50-56%.",
        "The results for FAUST, UMass and Stanford were similar in both tasks, while the ConcordU result was 6% points higher for GE and the UTurku result over 10% points higher for GE, ranking third after FAUST and UMass.",
        "These results suggest that while the FAUST and UMass systems in particular have some systematic (e.g. architectural) advantage at both tasks, much of the performance difference observed here between the top three systems and those of ConcordU and UTurku is due to strengths or weaknesses specific to ID.",
        "Possible weaknesses may relate to the treatment of multiple core entity types (vs. only Protein in GE) or challenges related to nested entity annotations (not appearing in GE).",

        "While this supports the conclusion that ID performance differences do not reflect a simple universal ranking of the systems, due to many substantial differences between the ID and EPI setups it is not straightforward to identify specific reasons for relative differences to performance at EPI.",
        "Table 8 summarizes the core task results.",
        "There are only modest and largely consistent differences to the corresponding full task results, reflecting in part the relative sparseness of additional arguments: in the training data, for example, only approximately 3% of instances of event types that can potentially take additional arguments had at least one additional argument.",
        "While event modifications represent a further 4% of full task extraction targets not required for the core task, the overall low extraction performance for additional arguments and modifications limits the practical effect of these annotation categories on the performance difference between systems addressing only the core targets and those addressing the full task."

        "Despite the novel challenges of full papers, four new entity types, extension of event scopes and the introduction of a new event category for high-level processes, the highest results for the full ID task were comparable to the state-of-the-art performance on the established ST'09 data, showing that the event extraction approach and present systems generalize well and demonstrating the feasibility of event extraction for the infectious diseases domain.",
        "Analysis of results suggested further opportunities for improving extraction performance by combining the strengths of various systems and the use of other event resources.",
        "The task design takes into account the needs of supporting practical applications, and its results and findings will be adopted in future development of the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center(PATRIC).",
        "Specifically, PATRIC will combine domain named entity recognition and event extraction to mine the virulence factor literature and integrate the results with literature search and retrieval services, protein feature analysis, and systems such as Disease View.",
        "Present and future advances at the ID event extraction task can thus assist biologists in efforts of substantial public health interest.",
