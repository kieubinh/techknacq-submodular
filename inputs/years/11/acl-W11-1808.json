        "To date, most approaches to the BioNLP event extraction task (Kim et al., 2011a) use a single model to produce their output.",
        "However, model combination techniques such as voting, stacking, and rerank-ing have been shown to consistently produce higher performing systems by taking advantage of multiple views of the same data.",
        "The Netflix Prize (Bennett et al., 2007) is a prime example of this.",
        "System combination essentially allows systems to regularize each other, smoothing over the artifacts of each (c.f.",
        "Nivre and McDonald (2008), Surdeanu and Manning (2010)).",
        "To our knowledge, the only previous example of model combination for the BioNLP shared task was performed by Kim et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Using a weighted voting scheme to combine the outputs from the top six systems, they obtained a 4% absolute /-score improvement over the best individual system.",
        "This paper shows that using a straightforward model combination strategy on two competitive systems produces a new system with substantially higher accuracy.",
        "This is achieved with the framework of stacking: a stacking model uses the output of a stacked model as additional features.",
        "While we initially considered voting and rerank-ing model combination strategies, it seemed that given the performance gap between the UMass and Stanford systems that the best option was to include the predictions from the Stanford system into the UMass system (e.g., as in Nivre and McDonald (2008)).",
        "This has the advantage that one model (Umass) determines how to integrate the outputs of the other model (Stanford) into its own structure, whereas in reranking, for example, the combined model is required to output a complete structure produced by only one of the input models."

      "text": [
        "In the following we briefly present both the stacking and the stacked model and some possible ways of integrating the stacked information.",
        "As our stacking model, we employ the UMass extractor (Riedel and McCallum, 2011).",
        "It is based on a discriminatively trained model that jointly predicts trigger labels, event arguments and protein pairs in binding.",
        "We will briefly describe this model but first introduce three types of binary variables that will represent events in a given sentence.",
        "Variables ei)tare active if and only if the token at position i has the label t. Variables ai)j;r are active if and only if there is an event with trigger i that has an argument with role r grounded at token j.",
        "In the case of an entity mention this means that the mention's head is j.",
        "In the case of an event j is the position of its trigger.",
        "Finally, variables bPA indicate whether or not two entity mentions at p and q appear as arguments in the same binding event.",
        "Two parts form our model: a scoring function, and a set of constraints.",
        "The scoring function over the trigger variables e, argument variables a and binding pair variables b is with local scoring functions st (i, t) d=ef(wt, ft (i,t)), sr (i,j,r) = (wr, fr (i,j,r)) and sb (p, q) = (wb, fb (p, q)).",
        "Our model scores all parts of the structure in isolation.",
        "It is a joint model due to the nature of the constraints we enforce: First, we require that each active event trigger must have at least one Theme argument; second, only regulation events (or Catalysis events for the epi track) are allowed to have Cause arguments; third, any trigger that is itself an argument of another event has to be labelled active, too; finally, if we decide that two entities p and q are part of the same binding (as indicated by bp,q = 1), there needs to be a binding event at some trigger i that has p and q as arguments.",
        "We will denote the set of structures (e, a, b) that satisfy these constraints as Y.",
        "Stacking with this model is simple: we only need to augment the local feature functions ft (i, t), fR (i, j, r) and fB (p, q) to include predictions from the systems to be stacked.",
        "For example, for every system S to be stacked and every pair of event types (t', ts ) we add the features to fT (i, t).",
        "Here hs (i) is the event label given to token i according to S. These features allow different weights to be given to each possible combination of type t' that we want to assign, and type ts that S predicts.",
        "Inference in this model amounts to maximizing s (e, a, b) over Y.",
        "Our approach to solving this problem is dual decomposition (Komodakis et al., 2007; Rush et al., 2010).",
        "We divide the problem into three subproblems: (1) finding the best trigger label and set of outgoing edges for each candidate trigger; (2) inding the best trigger label and set of incoming edges for each candidate trigger; (3) finding the best pairs of entities to appear in the same binding.",
        "Due to space limitations we refer the reader to Riedel and McCallum (2011) for further details.",
        "For the stacked model, we use a system based on an event parsing framework (McClosky et al., 2011a) referred to as the Stanford model in this paper.",
        "This model converts event structures to dependency trees which are parsed using MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Once parsed, the resulting dependency tree is converted back to event structures.",
        "Using the Stanford model as the stacked model is helpful since it captures tree structure which is not the focus in the UMass model.",
        "Of course, this is also a limitation since actual BioNLP event graphs are DAGs, but the model does well considering these restrictions.",
        "Additionally, this constraint encourages the Stanford model to provide different (and thus more useful for stacking) results.",
        "Of particular interest to this paper are the four possible decoders in MSTParser.",
        "These four decoders come from combinations of feature order (irst or second) and whether the resulting dependency tree is required to be projective.",
        "Each decoder presents a slightly different view of the data and thus has different model combination properties.",
        "Projectivity constraints are not captured in the UMass model so these decoders incorporate novel information.",
        "To produce stacking output from the Stanford system, we need its predictions on the training, devel-",

        "T1 and T2 stand for task 1 and 2, respectively.",
        "C stands for CORE metric, F for FULL metric.",
        "opment and test sets.",
        "For predictions on test and development sets we used models learned from the the complete training set.",
        "Predictions over training data were produced using crossvalidation.",
        "This helps to avoid a scenario where the stacking model learns to rely on high accuracy at training time that cannot be matched at test time.",
        "Note that, unlike Stanford's individual submission in this shared task, the stacked models in this paper do not include the Stanford reranker.",
        "This is because it would have required making a reranker model for each crossvalidation fold.",
        "We made 19 crossvalidation training folds for Ge-nia (ge) (Kim et al., 2011b), 12 for Epigenetics (epi), and 17 for Infectious Diseases (id) (Kim et al., 2011b; Ohta et al., 2011; Pyysalo et al., 2011, respectively).",
        "Note that while id is the smallest and would seem like it would have the fewest folds, we combined the training data of id with the training and development data from ge.",
        "To produce predictions over the test data, we combined the training folds with 6 development folds for ge, 4 for epi, and 1 for id."

        "Remarkably, while there is a 7 point gap between the best individual Stanford system and the standalone UMass systems, integrating the Stanford prediction still leads to an /-score improvement of 1.",
        "This can be seen when comparing the UMass, Stanford 1N and FAUST+All results, where the latter stacks 1N, 1P, 2N and 2P.",
        "We also note that stacking the projective 1P and 2P systems helps almost as much as stacking all Stanford systems.",

        "Given the small gains over the original UMass system, it is clear that stacking information is only useful when attached to triggers and arguments.",
        "Our theory is that most of our gains come from when the UMass and Stanford systems disagree on triggers and the Stanford system provides not only its triggers but also their attached arguments to the UMass system.",
        "This is supported by a pilot experiment where we trained the Stanford model to use the UMass triggers and saw no benefit from stacking (even when both triggers and arguments were used).",
