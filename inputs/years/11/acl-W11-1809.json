        "The Bacteria Biotope (BB) task is one of the five main tasks of the BioNLP Shared Tasks 2011.",
        "The BB task consists of extracting bacteria location events from Web pages, in other words, citations of places where a given species lives.",
        "Bacteria locations range from plant or animal hosts for pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria, to natural environments like soil or water.",
        "Challenges for Information Extraction (IE) of relations in Biology are mostly devoted to the identification of bio-molecular events in scientific papers where the events are described by relations between named entities, e.g. genic interactions (Nédellec, 2005), protein-protein interactions (Pyysalo et al., 2008), and more complex molecular events (Kim et al., 2011).",
        "However, this far from reflects the diversity of the potential applications of text mining to biology.",
        "The objective of previous challenges has mostly been focused on modeling biological functions and processes using the information on elementary molecular events extracted from text.",
        "The BB task is the first step towards linking information on bacteria at the molecular level to ecological information.",
        "The information on bacterial habitats and properties of these habitats is very abundant in literature, in particular in Systematics literature (e.g. International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology), however it is rarely available in a structured way (Hirschman et al., 2008; Tamames and de Lorenzo, 2009).",
        "The NCBI GenBank nucleotide isolation source field (GenBank) and the JGI Genome OnLine Database (GOLD) isolation site field are incomplete with respect to the microbial diversity and are expressed in natural language.",
        "The two critical missing steps in terms of biotope knowledge modeling are (1) the automatic population of databases with organism/location pairs that are extracted from text, and (2) the normalization of the habitat name with respect to biotope ontologies.",
        "The BB task mainly aims at solving the first information extraction issue.",
        "The second classification issue is handled through the categorization of locations into eight types."

      "heading": "2. Context",
      "text": [
        "According to NCBI statistics there are nearly 900 bacteria with complete genomes, which account for more than 87% of total complete genomes.",
        "Consequently, molecular studies in bacteriology are shifting from species-centered to full diversity investigation.",
        "The current trend in high-throughput experiments targets diversity related fields, typically phylogeny or ecology.",
        "In this context, adaptation properties, biotopes and biotope properties become critical information.",
        "Illustrative questions are:",
        "• Is there a phylogenetic correlation between species that share the same biotope?",
        "• What are common metabolic pathways of species that live in given conditions, especially species that survive in extreme conditions?",
        "• What are the molecular signaling patterns in host relationships or population relationships (e.g. in biofilms)?",
        "Recent metagenomic experiments produce molecular data associated with a habitat rather than a single species.",
        "This raises new challenges in computational biology and data integration, such as identifying known and new species that belong to a metagenome.",
        "Not only will these studies require comprehensive databases that associate bacterial species to their habitat, but they also require a formal description of habitats for property inference.",
        "The bacteria biotope description is potentially very rich since any physical object, from a cell to a continent, can be a bacterial habitat.",
        "However these relations are much simpler to model than with general formal spatial ontologies.",
        "A given place is a bacterial habitat if the bacteria and the habitat are physically in contact, while the relative position of the bacteria and its dissemination are not part of the BB task model.",
        "The BB Task requires the locations to be assigned different types (e.g. soil, water).",
        "We view location typing as a preliminary step of more finegrained modeling in location ontologies.",
        "Some classifications for bacteria biotopes have been proposed by some groups (Floyd et al., 2005; Hirschman et al., 2008; Field et al., 2008; Pignatelli et al., 2009).",
        "The Environment Ontology project (EnvO) is developing an ambitious detailed environment ontology for supporting standard manual annotation of environments of all types of organisms and biological samples (Field et al., 2008).",
        "In a similar way, the GOLD group at JGI defined a standard classification for bacteria population metagenome projects.",
        "Developing methods for the association of such biotope classes to organisms remains an open question.",
        "EnvDB (Pignatelli et al., 2009) is an attempt to inventory isolation sources of bacteria as recorded in GenBank and to map them to a three level hierarchy of 71 biotope classes.",
        "The assignment of bacterial samples in one of the EnvDB classes is supported by a text-mining tool based on a Naïve",
        "Bayes (NB) classifier applied to a bag of words representing the associated reference title and abstract.",
        "Unfortunately, the low number of paper references associated with the isolation source field (46 %) limits the scope of the method.",
        "The BB task has a similar goal, but directly applies to natural language texts thus avoiding the issue of database incompleteness.",
        "As opposed to database-based approaches, biotope information density is higher but the task has to include bacteria and location identification, as well as information extraction to relate them.",
        "The eight types of locations in the BB task capture high-level information for further ontology mappings.",
        "The location types are Host, HostPart, Geographical and Environmental.",
        "Environmental is broadly defined to qualify locations that are not associated to hosts, in a similar way to what was described by Floyd et al.",
        "(Floyd et al., 2005).",
        "In addition, the BB task types exclude artificially constructed biotopes (e.g. bacteria growing in labs on a specific medium) and laboratory mutant bacteria.",
        "The Environmental class is divided into Food, Medical, Soil and Water.",
        "Locations that are none of these subtypes are classified as Environmental.",
        "The exact geographical location (e.g. latitude and longitude coordinates) has less importance here than in eukaryote ecology because most of the biotope properties vary along distances smaller than the precision of the current positioning technologies.",
        "Geographical names are only useful in bacteria biotope studies when the physico-chemical properties of the location can be inferred.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, the locations of bacteria host (e.g. the stall of the infected cow) are not taken into account despite their richness (Floyd et al., 2005).",
        "The important information conveyed by the locations, especially of Environment type, is the function of the bacterium in its ecosystem rather than the substance of the habitat.",
        "Indeed the final goal is to extract habitat properties and bacteria phenotypes.",
        "Beyond the identification of locations, their properties (e.g. temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen) are of high interest for phenotypes (e.g. thermophily, acidophily, halophily) and trophism studies.",
        "This information is difficult to extract, and is often incomplete or even not available in papers (Tamames and de Lorenzo., 2009).",
        "Hopefully, some properties can be automatically retrieved with the help of specialized databases, which give the physico-chemical properties of locations, such as hosts (plant, animal, human organs), soils (see WebSoilSurvey, Corine Land Cover), water, or chemical pollutants.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, the BB task differs from other IE molecular biology tasks while it raises some issues common to biomedicine and more general IE tasks.",
        "The documents are scientific Web pages intended for non-experts such as encyclopedia notices.",
        "The information is dense compared to scientific papers.",
        "Documents are structured as encyclopedia pages, with the main focus on a single species or a few species of the same genus or family.",

        "We decided to include fluids, secretions and excretions (which are not strictly organs).",

        "We also redefined Jab as: if the Location arguments overlap, then Jab = 1, otherwise Jab = 0.",
        "This means that boundaries were relaxed.",
        "The relaxed scores are shown in Table 5.",
        "While the difference is not significant for JAIST and UTurku, the Bibliome results exhibit a 9 point increase.",

        "The Bibliome submission is the only one that performed bacteria coreference resolution.",
        "Their system is rule-based and dealt with referential \"it\", bi-antecedent anaphora and more importantly sortal anaphora.",
        "The JAIST system has a bacteria coreference module based on ML.",
        "However the submission was done without coreference resolution since their experiments did not show any performance improvement.",
        "Event extraction.",
        "Both UTurku and JAIST approached the event extraction as a classification task using ML (SVM).",
        "Bibliome exploited the cooccurrence of arguments and the presence of trigger words from a predefined list.",
        "Both UTurku and Bibliome generate events in the scope of a sentence, whereas JAIST generates events in the scope of a paragraph.",
        "As shown in Table 6, UTurku achieved the best score for PartOf events.",
        "For all participants, the prediction is often correct (between 60 and 80%) while the recall is rather low (20 to 32%).",
        "Recall Precis.",
        "F-score",
        "Conversely, the score of the Localization relation by UTurku has been penalized by its low recognition of bacteria names (16%).",
        "This strongly affects the score of Localizations since the bacterium is the only expected agent argument.",
        "The good results of Bibliome are partly explained by its high bacteria name recall of 84%.",
        "The lack of coreference resolution might penalize the event extraction recall.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we computed the recall by taking only into account events where both arguments occur in the same sentence.",
        "The goal of this selection is to remove most events denoted through a coreference.",
        "The recall difference was not significant for Bibliome and JAIST, however UTurku recall raised by 12 points (29%).",
        "That experiment confirms that UTurku low recall is explained by coreferences rather than the quality of event extraction.",
        "The paragraph scope chosen by JAIST probably compensates the lack of coreference resolution.",
