        "In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach for bacteria biotopes extraction of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (Bossy et al.",
        ", 2011).",
        "The task consists of extracting bacteria localization events, namely, mentions of given species and the place where it lives.",
        "Places related to bacteria localization events range from plant or animal hosts for pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria to natural environments like soil or water.",
        "This task also targets specific environments of interest such as medical environments (hospitals, surgery devices, etc.",
        "), processed food (dairy) and geographical localizations.",
        "The task of extracting bacteria biotopes involves two steps: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and event detection.",
        "The current dominant approach to NER problems is to use supervised machine learning models such as Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).",
        "These models have been shown to work reasonably well when a large amount of training data is available (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).",
        "However, because the annotated corpus delivered for this particular subtask in the shared task is very small (78 documents with 1754 sentences), we have decided to use a semi-supervised learning method in our system.",
        "Our NER module uses a CRF model with enhanced features created from external resources.",
        "More specifically, we use additional features created from the output of HMM clustering performed on a large amount of raw text, and word senses from WordNet for tagging.",
        "The target events in this shared task are divided into two types.",
        "The first is Localization events which relates a bacterium to the place where it lives.",
        "The second is PartOf events which denotes an organ that belongs to an organism.",
        "As in Bossy et al.",
        "(2010), the largest possible scope of the mention of a relation is the whole document, and thus it may span over several sentences (or even paragraphs).",
        "This observation motivated us to perform coreference resolution as a preprocessing step, so that each event can be recognized within a narrower textual scope.",
        "There are two common approaches to coreference resolution: one mainly relies on heuristics, and the other employs machine learning.",
        "Some instances of the heuristics-based approach are described in (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Markert and Nissim, 2005; Yang and Su, 2007), where they use lexical and encyclopedic knowledge.",

        "In our system, we employ the simple supervised method presented in Soon and Ng (2001).",
        "To create the training data, we have manually annotated the corpus with coreference information about bacteria.",
        "Our approach, consequently, has three processes: NER, coreference resolution of bacterium entities, and event extraction.",
        "The latter two processes can be formulated as classification problems.",
        "Coreference resolution is to determine the relation between candidate noun phrases and bacterium entities, and the event extraction is to detect the relation between two entities.",
        "It should be noted that our official submission in the shared task was carried out without using a coreference resolution module, and the system has been improved after the submission deadline.",
        "Our contribution in this paper is two-fold.",
        "In the methodology aspect, we use an unsupervised learning method to create additional features for the CRF model and perform coreference resolution to narrow the scope of events.",
        "In the resource aspect, the manual annotations for training our coreference resolution module will be made available to the research community.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as followed.",
        "Section 2, 3 and 4 describe details about the implementation of our system.",
        "Section 5 presents the experimental results with some error analysis.",
        "Finally, we conclude our approach and discuss future work in section 6."

        "The optimal number of hidden states is selected by evaluating its effectiveness on NER using the development set.",
        "To prepare the raw text for HMM clustering, we downloaded 686 documents (consisting of both full documents and abstracts) about bacteria biotopes from MicrobeWiki, JGI Genome Portal, Genoscope, 2Can bacteria pages at EBI and NCBI Genome Project (the training corpus is also downloaded from these five webpages).",
        "In addition, we use the 100,000 latest MEDLINE abstracts containing the string \"bacteri\" in our clustering.",

        "Although WordNet is a large lexical database, it only comprises words in the general genre, to which only the localization entities belong.",
        "Since it does not contain the bacterial taxon names, the most important entities in this task, we used another dictionary for bacteria names.",
        "The dictionary was extracted from the genomic BLAST page of NCBI .",
        "To connect these two resources, we simply place all entries from the NCBI dictionary under the 'bacterium' sense of WordNet.",
        "Table 1 illustrates some word sense features employed in our model.",

        "We have presented our machine learning-based approach for extracting bacteria biotopes.",

        "For NER, we used a CRF tagger with four types of features: lexical and syntactic features, the word cluster and word sense extracted from the external resources.",
        "Although we achieved a significant improvement by employing WordNet and the HMM clustering on raw text, there is still much room for improvement.",
        "For example, because all extracted knowledge used in this NER module belongs to the general knowlegde, its performance is not as good as our expectation.",
        "We envisage that the performance of the module will be improved if we can find useful biological features.",
        "We have attempted to use the information obtained from the coreference resolution of bacteria to narrow the event's scope.",
        "On the test set, although it does not improve the system significantly, the coreference information has shown to be useful in event extraction.",
        "In this work, we simply used binary classifiers with standard features for both coreference resolution and event detection.",
        "More advanced machine learning approaches for structured prediction may lead to better performance, but we leave it for future work."
