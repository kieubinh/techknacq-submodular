        "Moreover, specifying some of these synonymy relations as renaming appears quite rare (Weissenbacher, 2004).",

        "As opposed to what is observed in Gene Normalization tasks (Hirschman et al., 2005), the Rename task is characterised by the lack of morphological resemblance of gene synonyms.",
        "The gene synonyms are not typographic variants and the recognition of renaming act requires gene context analysis.",
        "The clear bottleneck of our system is the sentence filtering part and in particular the feature selection that brings a lot of noise by ranking statistically spurious terms.",
        "On the plus side, the whole system is fully automated to the exception of the resources used for the word segmentation that were designed manually for other tasks.",
        "Moreover, our strategy does not assume that the gene pairs from the nomenclature may be mentioned for other reasons than renaming, it then tends to overgeneralize.",
        "However, many occurrences of the predicted gene pairs are not involved in renaming acts because the reasons for mentioning synonyms may be different than renaming.",
        "In particular, equivalent genes of other species (orthologues) with high sequence similarities may have the same name as in Bacillus subtilis.",
        "An obvious improvement of our method would consists in first relating the genes to their actual species before relating the only Bacillus subtilis gene synonyms by the renaming relation.",
        "After the official submission and given the result of our system compared to competitors, a simple modification of the feature selection was tested with significant benefits: the addition of regular expressions as additional features.",
        "Intuitively there are words or patterns that strongly appeal to the reader as important markers of renaming acts.",
        "For example, variations of rename or adverbs such originally or formerly would certainly be reasonable candidates.",
        "Fifteen such shallow patterns were designed (see Table 5) supplemented by six more complex ones, originally designed to single out gene names.",
        "In appendix A, one of them is presented, the precision of which is 95.3% and recall 27.5%.",
        "That is, more than a quarter of renaming acts in the training and development sets together.",

        "In contrast, the words originally and reannotated although having 100% precision are respectively ranked 33rd and 777th.",
        "In total, 21 patterns are represented as boolean features of the classification step in addition to the ones selected by feature selection.",
        "Unsurprisingly, the best classifiers, according to the cross-validation F-measure after the grid search, only used the regular expressions as features neglecting the terms chosen by feature selection.",

        "In this case the sentence has been filtered out by the SVM and then the couple abn2/yxia was not annotated as a renaming act, 2) incorrect information in the nomenclature: These results substantiate the view that sigE is the distal member of a 2-gene operon and demonstrate that the upstream gene (spoIIGA) is necessary for sigma E formation.",
        "(PMID 2448286).",
        "Here, the integration of the Genetic Map to the nomenclature has introduced a wrong synonymy relation between spoIIGA and sigE, 3) homology with another species: We report the cloning of the wild-type allele of divIVBl and show that the mutation lies within a stretch ofDNA containing two open reading frames whose predicted products are in part homologous to the products of the Escherichia coli minicell genes minC and exists in the nomenclature but here, divIVBl is a gene of B. subtilis and minC is a gene of E. Coli, 4) another problem linked to the lexicon is the fact the synonym classes are not disjoint.",

        "For example, purF and purB referred to two different genes of B. subtilis but purB was also formerly known as purF: The following gene order has been established: pbuG-purB-purF-purM-purH-purD-tre (PMID 3125411).",
        "Hence, purF and purB are uncorrectly recognized as synonyms while they refer to two different genes in this context.",
        "Possible solutions for improving the system could be: 1) the inclusion of species names as SVM features, 2) the removal of some couples from the nomenclature (PurF/purB for instance), 3) evaluate the benefits of each resource part of the nomenclature."

        "Our system detects renaming acts of Bacillus sub-tilis genes with a final F-measure of 64.4%.",
        "After sentence segmentation, the emphasis is on sentence filtering using an exhaustive nomenclature and a SVM.",
        "An amelioration of this method using patterns as features of the machine learning algorithm was shown to improve significantly (+8.7%) the final performance.",
        "It was also shown that the bag of words representation is suboptimal for text classification experiments (Fagan, 1987; Caropreso and Matwin, 2006) With the use of such patterns, the filtering step is now very efficient.",
        "The examination of the remaining errors showed the limits of the current shallow system.",
        "A deeper linguistic approach using syntactic parsing seems indicated to improve the filtering step further."
