        "The BioNLP 2009 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2009) was the first shared task to address fine-grained information extraction for the bio-molecular domain, by defining a task involving extraction of event types from the GENIA ontology.",
        "The BioNLP 2011 Shared Task ( (Kim et al., 2011)) series generalized this defining a series of tasks involving more text types, domains and target event types.",
        "Among the tasks for the new series is the Infection Disease task, proposed and investigated by (Pyysalo et al., 2011; Pyysalo et al., 2010; Bjorne et al., 2010).",
        "Like the other tasks for the BioNLP Shared Task series, the goal is to extract mentions of relevant events from biomedical publications.",

        "Our system uses a signature-based machine-learning approach.",
        "The system is domain-independent, using a primary task description vocabulary and training data to learn the task, but domain resources can be incorporated as additional features when available, as described here.",
        "The approach can be broken down into 4 components: an automated annotation pipeline to provide the basis for features, classification-based trigger identification and argument identification components, and a post-processing component to apply semantic constraints.",
        "The UIMA framework is used to integrate the components into a pipeline architecture.",
        "A definition of the events to be extracted is used to define candidates for classification and post-process the results of the classification.",

        "= zero-to-one, * = zero-to-many, otherwise = one).",
        "these classes are assumed to be annotated in the data, as is the case for the Infectious Disease task.",
        "Then, each event class is given, with a list of argument types for each.",
        "Each argument is marked with its multiplicity, indicating how many of this argument type is valid for each event, either: one - exactly one is required, one-to-many - one or more is required, zero-to-one - one is optional, and zero-to-many one or many are optional.",
        "Also, restrictions on the classes of entities that can fill each argument are given, by listing: one or more class names - indicating the valid domain-specific entity classes from the definition, core_entity - indicating that any domain-specific entity in the definition is valid, event - indicating that any event in the definition is valid, or entity - indicating that any span from the text is valid.",
        "Table 1 shows the summary of the event extraction tasks for the Infectious Disease track.",
        "Linguistic and domain annotations are automatically applied to the document to be used for trigger and argument identification in framing the tasks for classification and generating features for each instance.",
        "Linguistic annotations include sentence splits, tokens, parts of speech, tree parses, typed dependencies (deMarneffe et al., 2006; MacKinlay et al., 2009), and stems.",
        "For the Infectious Disease task, the parses from the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) provided by the Supporting Analysis (Stenetorp et al., 2011) was used to obtain all of these linguistic annotations, except for the stems, which were obtained from the Porter Stemmer (van",
        "Rijsbergen et al., 1980).",
        "For the Infectious Disease task, two sets of domain specific annotations are included: known trigger words for each event class and semantic tags from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider, 2004).",
        "Annotations for known trigger words are created using a dictionary of word stem-event class pairs created from annotated training data.",
        "An entry is created in the dictionary every time a new stem is seen as a trigger for an event class.",
        "When a word with one of these stems is seen during processing, it is annotated as a typical trigger word for that event class.",

        "We posit that false negative trigger identifications are due to the limited full text training data (i.e. transcription events) and the inability of our system to predict non-verb triggers (i.e. second transcription example above).",
        "The SVM classifier was unable to distinguish between true transcription event triggers and transcription-related terms and ultimately, did not predict any transcription event in the development or test evaluations.",
        "To improve transcription event prediction, immediate effort should focus on 1) providing additional training data (e.g., BioCreativeciteBioCreative) and 2) introduce a trigger word filter that defines a subset of event triggers that have the best hit rate in the corpus.",
        "The hit rate is the number of occurrences of the word in a sentence per event type, divided by the total count in the gold standard (Nguyen et al., 2010).",

        "In the preceding example, our system correctly predicted the +regulation trigger and the theme hilE; however, the correct argument was a gene expression event, not the entity.",
        "Many errors in the positive and negative regulation events were of this type; the predicted argument was a theme and not an event.",
        "Evaluation of our system's binding event predictions resulted in low recall (12.50 or 0.0) in the test and development evaluations.",
        "The proceeding binding events are from document PMC1874608-03-RESULTS-05 in the development data.",
        "In both of the examples, our system correctly predicted the trigger binding; however, no arguments were predicted.",
        "Evaluation on the development data with gold standard triggers also resulted in an fscore of 0.0; thus, further algorithm refinement is needed to improve binding scores.",
        "• Mlc directly represses hilE by binding to the P3 promoter",
        "• These results clearly demonstrate that Mlc can regulate directly the hilE P3 promoter by binding to the promoter.",

        "Here, the trigger is correctly predicted; however, the candidate arguments did not match with the reference data.",
        "Upon closer look, the arguments were drawn from the entire sentence, rather than an independent clause.",
        "The syntactic parse feature was not sufficient to prevent over-predicting arguments for the trigger, a potential solution is to add the arguments syntactic dependency to the trigger as a feature to the candidate argument selection.",
