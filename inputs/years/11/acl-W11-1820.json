        "The explosive growth of biomedical scientific literature has attracted a significant interest on developing methods to automatically extract biological relations in texts.",
        "Until recently, most research was focused on extracting binary relations such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), gene-disease, and drug-mutation relations.",
        "However, the extracted binary relations cannot fully represent the original biomedical data.",
        "Therefore, there is an increasing need to extract fine-grained and complex relations such as biological events (Miwa et al., 2010).",
        "The BioNLP'09 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2009) was the first shared task that provided a consistent data set and evaluation tools for extraction of such biological relations.",
        "Several approaches to extract biological events have been proposed for this shared task.",
        "Based on their characteristics, these approaches can be divided into 3 groups.",
        "The first group uses a rule-based approach which implements a set of manually defined rules developed by experts or automatically learned from training data.",
        "These rules are then applied on dependency parse trees to extract biological events (Kaljurand et al., 2009; Kil-icoglu and Bergler, 2009).",
        "The second group uses a machine learning (ML)-based approach which exploits various specific features and learning algorithms to extract events (Bj√∂rne at al., 2009; Miwa et al., 2010).",
        "The third group uses hybrid methods that combine both rule-and ML-based approaches to solve the problem (Ahmed et al., 2009; Mora et al., 2009).",
        "Among these proposed approaches, the ML achieved the best results, however, it is nontrivial to apply.",
        "In this paper, we propose a rule-based approach which uses two syntactic patterns derived from a parse tree.",
        "The proposed approach consists of the following components: a dictionary to detect triggers, text pre-processing, and event extraction."

      "text": [
        "The construction of the dictionary consists of the following steps: grouping annotated triggers, filtering out irrelevant triggers, and calculating supportive scores.",
        "First, we collect all annotated triggers in the training and development datasets, convert them to lowercase format and group them based on their texture values and event types.",
        "For each trigger in a group, we count its frequency being annotated as trigger and its frequency being found in the training datasets to compute a confident score.",
        "Next, we create a list of non-trigger words from the training dataset which consists of a list of prepositions (e.g. to, by), and a list of adjectives (e.g. high, low).",
        "We then filter out triggers that belong to the non-trigger list as well as triggers that consist of more than two words as suggested in the previous studies (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2009).",
        "We further filter out more triggers by setting a frequency threshold for each event type.",
        "Triggers that have a frequency lower than a given threshold (which is empirically determined for each event type) are excluded.",
        "In addition, for each binding trigger (i.e. trigger of binding event) we compute a t2score which is the ratio of having a second argument.",
        "For each regulatory trigger we compute an escore which is the ratio of having an event as the first argument (theme) and a cscore is the ratio of having a second argument (cause).",
        "Text preprocessing includes splitting sentences, replacing protein names with place-holders, and parsing sentences using the Stanford Lexical Parser.",
        "First, we split the input text (e.g. title, abstract, paragraph) into single sentences using LingPipe sentence splitter.",
        "Sentences that do not contain protein names are dropped.",
        "Second, we replace protein names with their given annotated IDs in order to prevent the parser from segmenting multiple word protein names.",
        "Finally, the sentences are parsed with the Stanford parser to produce syntactic parse trees.",
        "All parse trees are stored in a local database for later use.",
        "Detection of event trigger and event type: For each input sentence, we split the sentence into tokens and use the dictionary to detect a candidate trigger and determine its event type (hereafter we referred to as 'trigger' type).",
        "After this step, we obtain a list of candidate triggers and their related scores for each event type.",
        "To extract the biological events from a parse tree after obtaining a list of candidate triggers, we adapt two syntactic patterns based on our previous work on extracting PPIs (Bui et al., 2011).",
        "These patterns are applied for triggers in noun, verb, and adjective form.",

        "It outperforms previously proposed rule-based systems on these event types despite the fact that part of the test set consists of full text sentences.",
        "In addition, our system adapts two syntactic patterns which were previously developed for PPIs extraction.",
        "This means that the application of syntactic information is still relevant to extract biological events.",
        "In other words, there are some properties these extraction tasks share.",
        "However, the performance significantly decreases on regulatory events with an F-score of 26.61%.",
        "Analyzing the performance of our system on regulatory events reveals that in most of false positive cases, the errors are caused by not resolving reference events properly.",
        "These errors can be reduced if we have a better implementation of the post-processing phase.",
        "Another source of errors is that the proposed method did not take into account the dependency among events.",
        "For example, most transcription events occurred when the regulatory events occurred (more than 50% cases).",
        "If association rules are applied here then the precision of both event types will increase.",
        "To improve the overall performance of the system, there are many issues one should take into account.",
        "The first issue is related to the distance or the path length from the joined node between an event trigger and its arguments.",
        "By setting a threshold for the distance for each event type we increase the precision of the system.",
        "The second issue is related to setting thresholds for the extraction rules (e.g. t2score, cscore) which is done by using empirical data.",
        "Many interesting challenges remain to be solved, among which are the co-reference, anaphora resolution, and cross sentence events.",
        "Furthermore, the trade-off between recall and precision needs to be taken into account, setting high thresholds for a dictionary might increase the precision, but could however drop the recall significantly."
