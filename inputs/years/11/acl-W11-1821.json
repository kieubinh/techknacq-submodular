        "This year, the ST'11 provides a further generalization on three key aspects: text type, subject domain, and targeted event types.",
        "One of the supporting tasks established to provide more finegrained text predictions is the extraction of entity relations.",
        "We have implemented an extraction system for such non-causal relations between named entities and domain terms, applying semantic spaces and machine learning techniques.",
        "Our system ranks second of four participating teams, achieving 37.04% precision, 47.48% recall and 41.62% F-score."

        "Understanding complex noun phrases with embedded gene symbols is crucial for a correct interpretation of text mining results (Van Landeghem et al., 2010).",
        "Such non-causal relations between a noun phrase and its embedded gene symbol are referred to as entity relations.",
        "As a supporting task for the BioNLP ST'11, we have studied two types of such entity relations: Subunit-Complex and Protein-Component.",
        "These relationships may occur within a single noun phrase, but also between two different noun phrases.",
        "A few examples are listed in Table 1; more details on the datasets and definitions of entity relations can be found in (Pyysalo et al., 2011).",
        "Valid entity relations involve one GGP (gene or gene product) and one domain term (e.g. \"promoter\") and they always occur within a single sentence.",
        "In the first step towards classification of entity relations, we have calculated the semantic similarity between domain terms (Section 2).",
        "Supervised learning techniques are then applied to select sentences likely to contain entity relations (Section 3).",
        "Finally, domain terms are identified with a novel rule-based system and linked to the corresponding GGP in the sentence (Section 4)."

        "We have implemented two strategies to capture this textual variation, grouping semantically similar words together.",
        "The first method takes advantage of manual annotations of semantic categories in the GENIA event corpus.",
        "This corpus contains manual annotation of various domain terms such as promoters, complexes and other biological entities in 1000 PubMed articles (Kim et al., 2008).",
        "The second method relies on statistical properties of nearly 15.000 articles, collected by searching PubMed articles involving human transcription factor blood cells.",
        "From these articles, we have then calculated a semantic space using latent semantic analysis (LSA) as implemented by the S-Space Package (Jurgens and Stevens, 2010).",
        "The algorithm results in high-dimensional vectors that represent word contexts, and similar vectors then refer to semantically similar words.",

        "Our framework tries to define for each GGP in the data whether it is part of any of the two entity relations, by analysing the sentence context.",
        "To capture the lexical information for each sentence, we have derived bag-of-word features.",
        "In addition, 2-and 3-grams were extracted from the sentence.",
        "Finally, the content of the gene symbol was also used as lexical information.",
        "All lexical information in the feature vectors has undergone generalization by blinding the gene symbol with \"protx\" and all other co-occurring gene symbols with \"exprotx\".",
        "Furthermore, terms occurring in the semantic lexicons described in Section 2 were mapped to the corresponding cluster number or category.",
        "For each generalization, a blinded and a non-blinded variant is included in the feature vector.",
        "Dependency graphs were further analysed for the extraction of grammatical patterns consisting of two nodes (word tokens) and their intermediate edge (grammatical relation).",
        "For the nodes, the same generalization rules as in the previous paragraph are applied.",
        "Finally, similar patterns are generated with the nodes represented by their part-of-speech tag.",
        "The final feature vectors, representing sentences with exactly one tagged gene symbol, are classified using an SVM with a radial basis function as kernel.",
        "An optimal parameter setting (C and gamma) for this kernel was obtained by 5-fold cross-validation on the training data."

        "The window size is increased to a predefined maximum as long as a maximal number of domain terms was not found.",
        "Within the search window, a rule-based algorithm decides whether a given token qualifies as a relevant domain term, employing first a high-precision dictionary and then high-recall dictionaries."
