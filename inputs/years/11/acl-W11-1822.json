        "BioNLP Shared Task 2011 has been the latest event following the first attracted event in 20092010.",
        "We enrolled and submitted the results of Entity Relations Supporting Task and GENIA Event Extraction.",
        "In brief, the GENIA task requires the recognition of 9 biological events on genes or gene products described in the biomedical literature.",
        "Participants are required to extract and classify 9 kinds of event with appropriate arguments.",
        "First time joining biomedical domain, we aim to learn current problems and approaches in biomedical research.",
        "Therefore, we have chosen simple approaches such as rule-based and pattern-based.",
        "In the following section, we will explain our work on GENIA Event Extraction Task (GENIA) in details.",
        "Finally, we will analyze and discuss results.",
        "Our approach",
        "The project uses UIMA Framework , an open source framework for analyzing unstructured information, to develop all analysis components.",
        "Events bounded in a sentence are 94.4% in training",
        "' Available at http://uima.apache.org/",
        "corpus.",
        "Consequently, sentences are processed in succession at each step.",
        "We divide the whole system into 3 parts: Preprocessing, Event Trigger annotation and Event annotation.",
        "At this step, the input documents are converted into objects of the framework.",
        "All analysis components will process objects and put results into them.",
        "Then we go through natural language processes that include sentence splitting, tokenizing and POS tagging by OpenNLP library.",
        "Lastly, the given Protein concepts are annotated.",
        "According to our statistics in the training corpus, the percentage of single token trigger is 91.8%.",
        "To simplify it, we focus on triggers which span on one token.",
        "At this stage, rule-based and dictionary-based approaches are combined.",
        "We choose tokens which are near a protein and have appropriate POS tags.",
        "Heuristic rules extracted from training corpus are used to identify candidate triggers.",
        "Those rules are, for instance, NN/NNS + of + PROTEIN, VBN + PROTEIN and so on.",
        "Event triggers are diverse in lexical and ambiguous in classification (Bj√∂rne et al.",
        "(2009) and Buyko et al.",
        "(2009)).",
        "Candidate triggers are classified by a dictionary.",
        "The dictionary containing words of triggers with their corresponding classes is built from training corpus.",
        "For ambiguous trigger classes, the class that has the highest rate of appearance is chosen.",
        "Basing on the number of arguments and type of arguments, we categorize 9 event classes into 3 groups.",
        "The first group including Gene expression,",
        "leem- ntson@fit.hcmus.edu.",
        "Transcription and Protein catabolism has only one Protein as the argument.",
        "The second group contains events with Protein and Entity as argument.",
        "Phosphorylation, Localization and Binding belong to that group.",
        "The third group has the most complex types, i.e. Regulation, Positive regulation and Negative regulation.",
        "These events can have other events as their argument.",
        "Our method of event detection is using dependency graph as results of deep syntactic parsing.",
        "We prune parse tree and assign concept to nodes.",
        "Next, sub-trees which contains only conceptual node as patterns are extracted and represented as string form.",
        "We travel breadth-first and write conceptual labels to the string pattern.",
        "The pattern list is built from training data.",
        "Firstly, for each sentence contains at least one trigger, we get the parse tree of the sentence.",
        "We prune nodes which contain only one child and that child node has zero or one descendant.",
        "It reduces the complexity and retains important and general parts of the parse tree.",
        "Secondly, candidate arguments of events are identified by combining Protein, Entity and Event Trigger in that sentence.",
        "The number of combination can be huge, so we restrict it by the following conditions.",
        "Each combination has at least one Event Trigger with one Protein or Event.",
        "The number of argument depends on types of events and is usually less than 5.",
        "In addition, the difference of depth on tree between arguments has to be under a threshold.",
        "Thirdly, concepts of arguments in each combination are assigned to parse tree nodes.",
        "The assignment bases on the span of argument and content of nodes.",
        "The pattern is extracted from the parse tree and examined whether it belongs to the pattern list.",
        "In order to increase the precision, we discard patterns having the depth of the tree greater than a threshold.",
        "The threshold is chosen by counting on the training corpus.",
        "Finally, we classify events and determine role of arguments for each event.",
        "The type of the event is chosen by the type of the trigger of that event.",
        "We still simply assign roles of arguments in a fixed order of arguments."
