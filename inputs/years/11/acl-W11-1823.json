        "Although it might not seem to be necessary to generate full coreference sets, anaphora resolution still benefits from their establishment.",
        "Our incremental approach (Klenner et al., 2010) naturally enforces transitivity constraints and thereby reduces the number of potential antecedent candidates.",

        "OntoGene's text mining system is based on an internally-developed fast, broad-coverage, deepsyntactic parsing system (Schneider, 2008).",
        "The parser is wrapped into a pipeline which uses a number of other NLP tools.",
        "The parser is a key component in a pipeline of NLP tools (Rinaldi et al., 2010), used to process input documents.",
        "First, in a preprocessing stage, the input text is transformed into a custom XML format, and sentences and tokens boundaries are identified.",
        "The OntoGene pipeline also includes a step of term annotation and disambiguation, which are not used for the BioNLP shared task, since relevant terms are already provided in both the training and test corpora.",
        "The pipeline also includes part-of-speech taggers, a lemmatizer and a syntactic chunker.",
        "When the pipeline finishes, each input sentence has been annotated with additional information, which can be briefly summarized as follows: sentences are tokenized and their borders are detected; each sentence and each token has been assigned an ID; each token is lemmatized; tokens which belong to terms are grouped; each term is assigned a normal-form and a semantic type; tokens and terms are then grouped into chunks; each chunk has a type (NP or VP) and a head token; each sentence is described as a syntactic dependency structure.",
        "All this information is represented as a set of predicates and stored into the Knowledge Base of the system, which can then be used by different applications, such as the OntoGene Relation Miner (Rinaldi et al., 2006) and the OntoGene Protein-Protein Interaction discovery tool (Rinaldi et al., 2008)."

        "The virtual prototype bears morphologic and semantic information accumulated from all elements of the coreference set.",

        "Thus, the pair 'modulator'-'it' need not be considered at all.",
        "We have not yet implemented a fullblown binding theory.",
