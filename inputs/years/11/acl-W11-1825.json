        "Our event extraction system is a pipelined approach, closely following the structure used by the best performing system in 2009 (BjÃ¶rne et al., 2009).",
        "Given an input sentence along with tokenization information and a set of parses, we first attempt to identify the words that trigger complex events using a multiclass classifier.",
        "Next we identify edges between triggers and proteins, or between triggers and other triggers.",
        "Finally, given a graph of proteins and triggers, we use a rule-based post-processing component to produce events in the format of the shared task.",
        "We began with the articles as provided, with an included tokenization of the input and identification of the proteins in the input.",
        "However, we did modify the token text and the part-of-speech tags of the annotated proteins in the input to be PROT after tagging and parsing, as we found that it led to better trigger detection.",
        "The next major step in preprocessing was to produce labeled dependency parses for the input.",
        "Note that the dependencies may not form a tree: there may be cycles and some words may not be connected.",
        "During feature construction, this parsing graph was used to find paths between",
        "Figure 1: Example sentence from the GENIA corpus, (a) Two of the top 50 constituency parses from the MCCC-I parser; the first had a total probability mass of 0,43 and the second 0,25 after renormalization, Nodes that differ between parses are shaded and outlined.",
        "(b) The dependency posteriors (labels omitted due to space) after conversion of 50-best parses.",
        "Solid lines indicate edges with posterior > 0.95; edges with posterior < 0.05 were omitted.",
        "Most of the ambiguity is in the attachment of \"elicited\".",
        "words in the sentence.",
        "Since proteins may consist of multiple words, for paths we picked a single representative word for each protein to act as its starting point and ending point.",
        "Generally this was the token inside the protein that is closest to the root of the dependency parse.",
        "In the case of ties, we picked the rightmost such node.",
        "The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus.",
        "In addition, we used an improved set of parsing models that leverage unsupervised data, MCCC-I (McClosky, 2010).",
        "In both cases, the Stanford Parser was used to convert constituency trees in the Penn Treebank format into labeled dependency parses: we used the collapsed dependency format.",
        "Effectively maintaining and leveraging the ambiguity present in the underlying parser has improved task accuracy in some downstream tasks (e.g., Mi et al.",
        "2008).",
        "McClosky-Charniak parses in two passes: the first pass is a generative model that produces a set of n-best candidates, and the second pass is a discriminative reranker that uses a rich set of features including non-local information.",
        "We renormalized the outputs from this log-linear discriminative model to get a posterior distribution over the 50-best parses.",
        "This set of parses preserved some of the syntactic ambiguity present in the sentence.",
        "The Stanford parser deterministically converts phrase-structure trees into labeled dependency graphs (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "We converted each constituency tree into a dependency graph separately and retained the probability computed above on each graph.",
        "One possibility was to run feature extraction on each of these 50 parses, and weight the resulting features in some manner.",
        "However, this caused a significant increase in feature count.",
        "Instead, we gathered a posterior distribution over dependency edges: the posterior probability of a labeled dependency edge was estimated by the sum of the probability of all parses containing that edge.",
        "Gathering all such edges produced a single labeled graph that retained much of the ambiguity of the input sentence.",
        "Figure 1 demonstrates this process on a simple example.",
        "We applied a threshold of 0.5 and retained all edges above that threshold, although there are many alternative ways to exploit this structure.",
        "As above, the resulting graph is likely no longer a connected tree, though it now may also be cyclic and rather strange in structure.",
        "Most of the dependency features were built on shortest paths between words.",
        "We used the algorithm in Cormen et al.",
        "(2002, pp.595) to find shortest paths in a cyclic graph with non-negative edge weights.",
        "The shortest path algorithm used in feature finding was supplied uniform positive edge weights.",
        "We could also weight edges by the negative log probability to find the shortest, most likely path.",
        "We also experimented with the ENJU parses (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008) provided by the shared task organizers.",
        "The distribution contained the output of the ENJU parser in a format consistent with the Stanford Typed Dependency representation .",
        "We know that even the best modern parsers are prone to errors.",
        "Including features from multiple parsers helps mitigate these errors.",
        "When different parsers agree, they can reinforce certain classification decisions.",
        "The features that were extracted from a dependency parse have names that include an identifier for the parser that produced them.",
        "In this way, the machine learning algorithm can assign different weights to features from different parsers.",
        "For finding heads of multiword entities, we preferred the ENJU parser if present in that experimental condition, then fell back to MCCC parses, and finally MCCC-I.",
        "We computed our set of dependency features (see 2.2.1) from the collapsed, propagated Stanford Typed Dependency representation (see http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/dependencies man ual.pdf and de Marneffe et al., 2006), made available by the organizers.",
        "We chose this form of representation since we are primarily interested in computing features that hold between content words.",
        "Consider, for example, the noun phrase \"phosphorylation of TRAF2\".",
        "A dependency representation would specify head-modifier relations for the tuples (phosphorylation, of) and (of, TRAF2).",
        "Instead of head-modifier, a typed dependency representation specifies PREP and",
        "PPOBJ as the two grammatical relations: PREP(phosphorylation-1, of-2) and PPOBJ(of-2, TRAF2-3).",
        "A collapsed representation has a single triplet specifying the relation between the content words directly, PREP_OF(phosphorylation-1, TRAF2-3); we considered this representation to be the most informative.",
        "We experimented with a representation that further normalized over syntactic variation.",
        "The system submitted for the GENIA subtask does not use these conversion rules, while the system submitted for the EPI subtask does use these rules.",
        "See Table 2 for further details.",
        "While for some applications it may be useful to distinguish whether a given relation was expressed in the active or passive voice, or in a main or a relative clause, we believe that for this application it is beneficial to normalize over these types of syntactic variation.",
        "Accordingly, we had a set of simple renaming conversion rules, followed by a rule for expansion; this list was our first effort and could likely be improved.",
        "We modeled this normalized level of representation on the logical form, described in Jensen (1993), though we were unable to explore NP-or VP-anaphora Renaming conversion rules:",
        "We experimented with feature reduction and feature combination within the set of features described here.",
        "For feature reduction we tried a number of simple approaches that typically work well in text classification.",
        "The latter is similar to the task at hand, in that there is a very large but sparse feature set.",
        "We tried two feature reduction methods: a simple count cutoff, and selection of the top n features in terms of log likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) with the target values.",
        "For a count cutoff, we used cutoffs from 3 to 10, but we failed to observe any consistent gains.",
        "Only low cutoffs (3 and occasionally 5) would ever produce any small improvements on the development set.",
        "Using log likelihood ratio (as determined on the training set), we reduced the total number of features to between 10,000 and 75,000.",
        "None of these experiments improved results, however.",
        "One potential reason for this negative result may be that there were a lot of features in our set that capture the same phenomenon in different ways, i.e. which correlate highly.",
        "By retaining a subset of the original feature set using a count cutoff or log likelihood ratio we did not reduce this feature overlap in any way.",
        "Alternative feature reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis, on the other hand, would target the feature overlap directly.",
        "For reasons of time we did not experiment with other feature reduction techniques but we believe that there may well be a gain still to be had.",
        "For our feature combination experiments the idea was to find highly predictive Boolean combinations of features.",
        "For example, while the features a and b may be weak indicators for a particular trigger, the cases where both a and b are present may be a much stronger indicator.",
        "A linear classifier such as the one we used in our experiments by definition is not able to take such Boolean combinations into account.",
        "Some classifiers such as SVMs with non-linear kernels do consider Boolean feature combinations, but we found the training times on our data prohibitive when using these kernels.",
        "As an alternative, we decided to pre-identify feature combinations that are predictive and then add those combination features to our feature inventory.",
        "In order to pre-identify feature combinations, we trained decision tree classifiers on the training set, and treated each path from the root to a leaf through the decision tree classifier as a feature combination.",
        "We also experimented with adding all partial paths through the tree (as long as they started from the root) in addition to adding all full paths.",
        "Finally, we tried to increase the diversity of our combination features by using a \"bagging\" approach, where we trained a multitude of decision trees on random subsets of the data.",
        "Again, unfortunately, we did not find any consistent improvements.",
        "Two observations that held relatively consistently across our experiments with combination features and different feature sets were: (i) only adding full paths as combination features sometimes helped, while adding partial paths did not, and (ii) bagging hardly ever led to improvements.",
        "Table 1: Approximate span matching/approximate recursive matching on development and test data sets for GENIA Shared Task 1 with our system.",
        "This step is not substantially different from that used in prior systems (BjÃ¶rne et al., 2009).",
        "This phase of the pipeline was again modeled as multi-class classification.",
        "There could be an edge originating from any trigger word and ending in any trigger word or protein.",
        "Looking at the set of all such edges, we trained a classifier to predict the label of this edge, or NONE if the edge was not present.",
        "Here we found that a maximum entropy classifier performed somewhat better than an SVM, so we used an in-house implementation of a maximum entropy trainer to produce the models.",
        "As with trigger detection, our initial feature set for edge detection was strongly influenced by features that were successful in BjÃ¶rne et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "Additionally, we included the same dependency path features to the nearest protein that we used for trigger detection, described in 2.2.1.",
        "Further, for a prospective edge between two entities, where the entities are either a trigger and a protein, or a trigger and a second trigger, we added a feature that indicates (i) if the second entity is in the path to the nearest protein, (ii) if the head of the second entity is in the path to the nearest protein, (iii) the type of the second entity."

        "After two rounds of the BioNLP shared task, in 2009 and 2011, we wonder whether it might be possible to establish an upper-bound on recall and precision.",

        "If this is the case, then those triggers and edges would present an interesting topic for discussion.",
        "This might result either in a modification of the annotation protocols, or an opportunity for all systems to learn more.",
        "After a certain amount of feature engineering, we found it difficult to achieve further improvements in F1.",
        "Perhaps we need a significant shift in architecture, such as a shift to joint inference (Poon and Vanderwende, 2010).",
        "Our system may be limited by the pipeline architecture.",
        "MWEs (multi-word entities) are a challenge.",
        "Better multi-word triggers accuracy may improve system performance.",
        "Multi-word proteins often led to incorrect part-of-speech tags and parse trees.",
        "Cursory inspection of the Epigenetics task shows that some domain-specific knowledge would have been beneficial.",
        "Our system had significant difficulties with the rare inverse event types, e.g. \"demethylation\" (e.g., there are 319 examples for \"methylation\" in the combined training/development set, but only 12 examples for \"demethylation\").",
        "Each trigger type was treated independently, thus we did not share information between an event and its related inverse event type.",
        "Furthermore, our system also failed to identify edges for these rare events.",
        "One approach would be to share parameters between types that differ only in a prefix, e.g., \"de\".",

        "We have described a system designed for finegrained information extraction, which we show to be general enough to achieve good performance across different sets of event types and domains.",
        "The only domain-specific characteristic is the pre-annotation of proteins as a special class of entities.",
        "We formulated some features based on this knowledge, for instance the path to the nearest protein.",
        "This would likely have analogues in other domains, given that there is often a special class of target items for any Information Extraction task.",
        "As the various systems participating in the shared task mature, it will be viable to apply the automatic annotations in an end-user setting.",
        "Given a more specific application, we may have clearer criteria for balancing the trade-off between recall and precision.",
        "We expect that fully-automated systems coupled with reasoning components will need very high precision, while semi-automated systems, designed for information visualization or for assistance in curating knowledge bases, could benefit from high recall.",
        "We believe that the data provided for the shared tasks will support system development in either direction.",
        "As mentioned in our discussion, though, we find that improving recall continues to be a major challenge.",
        "We seek to better understand the data annotations provided.",
        "Our immediate plans to improve our system include semi-supervised learning and system combination.",
        "We will also continue to explore new levels of linguistic representation to understand where they might provide further benefit.",
