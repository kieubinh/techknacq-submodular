        "Recent research in information extraction in the biological domain has focused on extracting semantic events involving genes or proteins, such as binding events or post-translational modifications.",
        "To date, most of the biological knowledge about these events has only been available in the form of unstructured text in scientific articles (Abulaish and Dey, 2007; Ananiadou et al., 2010).",
        "When a biological event is described in text, it can be analyzed by recognizing its type, the trigger that signals the event, and one or more event arguments.",
        "The BioNLP-ST 2009 (Kim et al., 2009) focused on the recognition of semantically typed, complex events in the biological literature.",
        "Although the best-performing system achieved a 51.95% F-score in identifying events across nine types, only 4 of the rest 23 participating teams obtained an F-score in the 40% range.",
        "This suggests that the problem ofbiological event extraction is difficult and far from solved.",
        "Graphs provide a powerful primitive for modeling biological data such as pathways and protein interaction networks (Tian et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2006).",
        "More recently, the dependency representations obtained from full syntactic parsing, with its ability to reveal longrange dependencies, has shown an advantage in biological relation extraction over the traditional Penn Treebank-style phrase structure trees (Miyao et al., 2009).",
        "Since the dependency representation maps straightforwardly onto a directed graph, operations on graphs can be naturally applied to the problem of biological event extraction.",
        "We participated in the BioNLP-ST 2011 (Kim et al., 2011a), and applied a graph matching-based approach (Liu et al., 2010) to tackling the Task 1 of the GENIA event extraction (GE) task (Kim et al., 2011b), and the core task of the Epigenetics and Post-translational Modifications (EPI) task (Ohta et al., 2011), two main tasks of the BioNLP-ST 2011.",
        "Event recognition is performed by searching for an isomorphism between dependency representations of automatically learned event rules and complete sentences in the input texts.",
        "This process is treated as a subgraph matching problem, which corresponds to the search for a subgraph isomorphic to a rule graph within a sentence graph.",
        "While we explored methods such as performance-based rule ranking to improve the precision of the GE and EPI tasks, we merged rules across multiple event types in order to increase the recall ofthe EPI task.",

        "Starting with the dependency graph ofeach training sentence, edge directions are first removed so that the directed graph is transformed into an undirected graph, where a path must exist between any two nodes since the graph is always connected.",
        "For each gold event, the shortest dependency path in the undirected graph connecting the event trigger nodes to each event argument node is selected.",

        "For multi-token event triggers, the shortest dependency path connecting the node of every trigger token to the node of each event argument is selected, and the union of the paths is then computed for each trigger.",
        "For regulation events, when a sub-event is used as an argument, only the type and the trigger ofthe sub-event are preserved as the argument of the main events.",
        "The shortest dependency path is extracted so as to connect the trigger nodes of the main event to the trigger nodes of the sub-event.",
        "In case that there exists more than one shortest path, all of the paths are considered.",

        "A number of algorithms have been designed to tackle the problem of subgraph isomorphism in different applications (Ullmann, 1976; Cordella et al., 2004; Pelillo et al., 1999).",
        "Considering that the graphs of rules and sentences involved in the matching process are small, a simple subgraph matching algorithm using a backtracking approach (Liu et al., 2010) was used in this work.",

        "To further improve the recall, we proposed a rule merging strategy to take advantage of the syntactic structures ofrules across event types.",
        "We first experimented with a \"pairwise flip\" approach which combines rules of the pairwise, positive and negative event types by flipping the type and the trigger of event rules.",
        "For instance, the event rules ofPhosphorylation and Dephosphorylation are merged together and then used to detect events ofthe two types respectively.",
        "Next, the \"pairwise flip\" approach was extended to an \"all in one\" method.",
        "For one event type, the rules of all other PTM event types are processed and merged into the rules of the current type if the trigger of rules of other types contains one of these 12 morphemes: \"acetyl\", \"glycosyl\", \"hydroxyl\", \"methyl\", \"phospho-ryl\", \"ubiqui\", \"deacetyl\", \"deglycosyl\", \"dehydroxyl\", \"demethyl\", \"dephosphoryl\", \"deubiqui\".",
        "We consider that event rules involving these morphemes in trigger are more likely to discuss representative protein post-translational modifications.",
        "Table 6 shows the event extraction results on the development data using different matching criteria and rule merging methods.",
        "The performance is evaluated by the primary evaluation measure.",
        "The two rule merging methods using \"E+P*+T*\" outperform others in terms of F-score.",
        "The \"pairwise flip\" method achieves higher precision as the syntactic structures ofrules to describe the pairwise, positive and negative events tend to be highly similar.",
        "However, when merging all the rules across PTM event types, although more events are captured, rules that involve syntactic structures for expressing very specific events ofcertain types may not generalize well on some other types, resulting in incorrect events.",
        "Thus, the \"all in one\" approach significantly improves the recall while producing many false positive events, leading to a F-score comparable with the \"pairwise flip\" method.",
        "We conducted two runs on the testing data in terms of \"E+P*+T*(pairwise)\" and \"E+P*+T*(all in one)\".",
        "Since the two rule merging methods achieve comparable F-scores, we decided to submit a run with higher recall.",
        "Table 7 shows our results of \"E+P*+T*\" using the \"all in one\" approach on the official metrics.",
        "Only 7 teams participated in this task.",
        "For the core task, our performance ranked 7th, only 0.16% lower in F-score than the 6th team.",
        "When evaluating our results in terms ofthe full task, we ranked 6th.",
        "Compared to the top teams, our F-score is mostly affected by the lower recall.",
        "Although the run we submitted achieves the highest recall among all our runs, our recall is about 20% less than the best performing system.",
        "Considering thatmostofthe eventtypes ofthe EPI task tend to use tokens containing only a small fixed set of domain-specific morphemes as triggers, the recall deficit is assumed to be lack of event rules that describe syntactic structures of expressing a fair amount ofEPI events.",
        "Since the gold event annotation of the testing data is hidden, we examined the event extraction results ofthe development data to analyze the underlying errors.",
        "The detailed analysis is reported in terms of false negative and false positive events.",
        "It is shown that false negative events have a substantial impact on the performance of all 15 participating teams of the GE task.",
        "The best recall, 49.56%, captures less than half of the gold events in the testing set.",
        "In our work, three major causes of false negatives are determined for both tasks.",
        "(1) Low coverage of rule set: For the GE task, the graph matching criteria \"E+P*+A*\" strictly asks every lemmatized token in the patterns to find its exact match in the input sentences.",

        "For instance, when \"lysine\" appears in an event rule, knowing that \"lysine\" is an amino acid, the rule might be further generalized to allow all amino acids to match with each other in order to recognize more events.",
        "For the EPI task, although \"E+P*+T*\" requires tokens ofonly event triggers to be identical, we captured less than half of the gold events.",
        "We noticed that many trigger tokens in the development sentences do not appear as triggers in the training set.",
        "This leads to the failure of extracting the corresponding events.",
        "Since the training data is the only source of triggers in our work, the coverage oftriggers limits the generalization power of event rules.",
        "For both tasks, we found that many gold events are described in grammatical structures that are not covered by the existing rules induced from the training sentences.",
        "These structures tend to be more complex, involving a long dependency path from the trigger to arguments in the graphs of sentences.",
        "Events that consist of these structures are not recognized as no matched rules will be returned from the subgraph matching.",
        "In order to further improve the recall, some postprocessing steps are necessary to be performed on the raw dependency graphs of both rules and sentences instead of using them in the graph matching directly.",
        "By eliminating semantically unimportant nodes and grouping lexically connected nodes together, the rules can be generalized to retain only their skeleton structures while complex sentences can be syntactically simplified to allow event rules to match them.",
        "(2) Compound error effect: In both tasks, regulation and catalysis event types can take sub-events as arguments.",
        "Therefore, if the nested sub-events are not correctly identified, the main events will not be extracted due to the compound error effect.",
        "(3) Anaphora and coreference: Since our system focuses on extracting events from sentences, events that contain protein names spanning multiple sentences will not be captured.",

        "Three major causes of false positives are generalized from our analysis.",
        "(1) Assignment of overlapping event rules: The conditional probability-based method to assign overlapped rules of different event types effectively reduces the number of event candidates but leads to errors.",
        "For instance, \"methylation\" is used as the trigger for two overlapping rules of DNAmethylation and Methyla-tion.",
        "Based on the P(ti\\E), \"methylation\" is classified into DNAmethylation.",
        "An erroneous DNAmethylation event is then detected from a development sentence instead of the gold Methylation event.",
        "Although the trigger and the participant are all identified correctly, the event type is assigned wrongly.",
        "In fact, the same contextual structure and content appear in both DNAmethylation and Methylation events in the training data.",
        "According to the EPI task (Ohta et al., 2011), Methylation is to abbreviate for \"protein methylation\" and thus is different from DNAmethylation.",
        "In this case, the only way to distinguish between the two types is to identify that the biological entity mentioned in the sentence is a gene for DNAmethylation and a protein for Methylation.",
        "Since genes and their products are uniformly annotated as \"Protein\" in the task, it is not possible to assign a correct event type in this case from the perspective ofthe event extraction itself.",
        "(2) Lack of postprocessing rules: Some misidentified events require customized postprocessing rules.",
        "For instance, a Genejexpression event is detected from the phrase \"Tax expression vector\" of a development sentence.",
        "However, since \"Tax expression\" is only used as an adjective to describe \"vector\" in this context, the identified Genejexpression event is not appropriate.",
        "Likewise, \"Sp1 transcription\" should not be identified as an event in the context of\"Sp1 transcription factors\".",
        "(4) Inconsistencies in gold annotation: Some extracted events are considered biologically meaningful but evaluated as false positives due to the inconsistencies in the gold annotation.",
