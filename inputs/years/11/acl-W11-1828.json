        "Event extraction was popularised by the BioNLP'09 Shared Task on Event Extraction (Kim et al., 2009), providing a more detailed alternative for the older approach of binary interaction detection, where each pair of protein names co-occurring in the text is classified as interacting or not.",
        "Events extend this formalism by adding to the relations direction, type and nesting.",
        "Events define the type of interaction, such as phosphorylation, and commonly mark in the text a trigger word (e.g. \"phosphorylates\") describing the interaction.",
        "Directed events can define the role of their protein or gene arguments as e.g. cause or theme, the agent or the target of the biological process.",
        "Finally, events can act as arguments of other events, creating complex nested structures that accurately describe the biological interactions stated in the text.",
        "For example, in the case of a sentence stating \"Stat3 phosphorylation is regulated by Vav\", a phospho-rylation-event would itself be the argument of a regulation-event.",
        "We developed for the BioNLP'09 Shared Task the Turku Event Extraction System, achieving the best performance at 51.95% F-score (Björne et al., 2009).",
        "This system separated event extraction into multiple classification tasks, detecting individually the trigger words defining events, and the arguments that describe which proteins or genes take part in these events.",
        "Other approaches used in the Shared Task included e.g. joint inference (Riedel et al., 2009).",
        "An overall notable trend was the use of full dependency parsing (Buyko et al., 2009; Van Landeghem et al., 2009; Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2009).",
        "In the following years, event extraction has been the subject of continuous development.",

        "Site arguments add detail to core arguments.",
        "(A) In most tasks we link both core and site arguments to given protein nodes.",
        "This minimizes the number of outgoing edges per trigger node, simplifying unmerging, but loses the connection between site and core arguments.",
        "(B) In the EPI task, all events with site-arguments have a single core argument, so linking sites to the trigger node preserves the site/core connection.",
        "(C) To both limit number of arguments in trigger nodes and preserve site information, event arguments using sites could be linked to protein nodes through the site entity.",
        "However, in this approach the core argument would remain undetected if the site wasn't detected.",
        "The BioNLP' Shared Task consists of eight separate tasks.",
        "Most of these follow the BioNLP'09 Shared Task annotation scheme, which defines events as having a trigger entity and one or more arguments that link to other events or protein/gene entities.",
        "This annotation can be represented as a graph, with trigger and protein/gene entities as nodes, and arguments (e.g. theme) as edges.",
        "In our graph representation, an event is defined implicitly as a trigger node and its outgoing edges (see Figure F).",
        "Most of the BioNLP'11 Shared Task tasks define task-specific annotation terminology, but largely follow the BioNLP'09 definition of events.",
        "Some new annotation schemes, such as the bracket notation in the CO-task can be viewed simply as alternative representations of arguments.",
        "The major new feature is relations or triggerless events, used in the REL, REN, BB and BI tasks.",
        "In our graph representation, this type of event is a single, directed edge.",
        "Some event arguments have a matching site argument that determines the part of the protein the argument refers to (Figure 2).",

        "This maximises extraction performance on core events, but losing the connection between site and core arguments limits performance on site arguments.",
        "To further simplify event extraction all sentences are processed in isolation, so events crossing sentence boundaries (intersentence events, Table 2) cannot be detected.",
        "This also limits the theoretical maximum performance of the system (see Figure 3).",
        "In the provided data an event is annotated only once for a set of equivalent proteins.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"Ubiquitination of caspase 8 (casp8)\" a ubiquitination event would be annotated only for \"caspase 8\", \"casp8\" being marked as equivalent to \"caspase 8\".",
        "To improve training data consistency, our system fully resolves these equivalences into new events, also recursively when a duplicated event is nested in another event (Table 2).",
        "Resolved equivalences were used for event extraction in the BioNLP'11 GE, ID, EPI and BB tasks, although based on tests with the GE dataset their impact on performance was negligible.",
        "The machine learning based event detection components classify examples into one of the positive classes or as negatives, based on a feature vector representation of the data.",
        "To make these classifications, we use the SVMmulticlass support vector machine (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) with a linear kernel.",
        "An SVM must be optimized for each classification task by experimentally determining the regularization parameter C. This is done by training the system on a training dataset, and testing a number of C values on a development dataset.",
        "When producing predictions for the test set, the classifier is retrained with combined training and development sets, and the test data is classified with the previously determined optimal value of C.",
        "Unlike in the BioNLP'09 Shared Task where the three main parameters (trigger-detector, recall-adjustment and edge-detector) were optimized in an exhaustive grid search against the final metric, in the new system only the recall-adjustment parameter (see Section 2.5) is optimized against the final metric, edge and trigger detector parameters being optimized in isolation to speed up experiments.",
        "The machine learning features that are used in event detection are mostly derived from the syntactic parses of the sentences.",
        "Parsing links together related words that may be distant in their linear order, creating a parse tree (see Figure 1 B).",
        "We used the Charniak-Johnson parser (Char-niak and Johnson, 2005) with David McClosky's biomodel (McClosky, 2010) trained on the GENIA corpus and unlabeled PubMed articles.",
        "The parse trees produced by the Charniak-Johnson parser were further processed with the Stanford conversion tool (de Marneffe et al., 2006), creating a dependency parse (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",
        "In the supporting tasks (REL, REN and CO) this parsing was done by us, but in the main tasks the organizers provided official parses which were used.",
        "All parses for tasks where named entities were given as gold data were further processed with a protein name splitter that divides at punctuation tokens which contain named entities, such as \"p50/p65\" or \"GATA3-binding\".",
        "To convert text into features understood by the classifier, a number of analyses are performed on the sentences, mostly resulting in binary features stating the presence or absence of some feature.",
        "Applicable combinations of these features are then used by the trigger detection, edge detection and unmerging steps of the event extraction system.",
        "Token features can be generated for each word token, and they define the text of the token, its Porter-stem (Porter, 1980), its Penn treebank part-of-speech-tag, character bi-and trigrams, presence of punctuation or numeric characters etc.",
        "Sentence features define the number of named entities in the sentence as well as bag-of-words counts for all words.",
        "Dependency chains follow the syntactic dependencies up to a depth of three, starting from a token of interest.",
        "They are used to define the immediate context of these words.",
        "Dependency path N-grams, are built from the shortest undirected path of tokens and dependencies linking together two entities, and are used in edge detection.",
        "N-grams join together a token with its two flanking dependencies as well as each dependency with its two flanking tokens.",
        "While these N-grams follow the direction of the entire path, the governor-dependent directions of individual dependencies are used to define token bigrams.",
        "Trigger features can be built in cases where triggers are already present, such as edge detection and event construction.",
        "These features include the types and supertypes of the trigger nodes, and combinations thereof.",
        "External features are additional features based on data external to the corpus being processed.",
        "Such features can include e.g. the presence of a word in a list of key terms, Wordnet hypernyms, or other resources that enhance performance on a particular task.",
        "These are described in detail in Section 3.",
        "Trigger words are detected by classifying each token as negative or as one of the positive trigger classes.",
        "Sometimes several triggers overlap, in which case a merged class (e.g. phosphorylation-regulation) is used.",
        "After trigger prediction, triggers of merged classes are split into their component classes.",
        "Most tasks evaluate trigger detection using approximate span, so detecting a single token is enough.",
        "However, this token must be chosen consistently for the classifier to be able to make accurate predictions.",
        "For multi-token triggers, we select as the trigger word the syntactic head, the root token of the dependency parse subtree covering the entity.",
        "When optimizing the SVM C-parameter for trigger and edge detection, it is optimized in isolation, maximizing the F-score for that classification task.",
        "Edges can be predicted for an event only if its trigger has been detected, but often the C-parameter that maximizes trigger detection F-score has too low recall for optimal edge detection.",
        "A recall adjustment step is used to fit together the trigger and edge detectors.",
        "For each example, the classifier gives a confidence score for each potential class, and picks as the predicted class the one with the highest score.",
        "In recall adjustment, the confidence score of each negative example is multiplied with a multiplier, and if the result falls below the score of another class, that class becomes the new classification.",
        "This multiplier is determined experimentally by optimizing against overall system performance, using the official task metric for cases where a downloadable evaluator is available (GE and BB).",
        "Edge detection is used to predict event arguments or triggerless events and relations, all of which are defined as edges in the graph representation.",
        "The edge detector defines one example per direction for each pair of entities in the sentence, and uses the SVM classifier to classify the examples as negatives or as belonging to one of the positive classes.",
        "As with the trigger detector, overlapping positive classes are predicted through merged classes (e.g. cause-theme).",
        "Task-specific rules defining valid argument types for each entity type are used to considerably reduce the number of examples that can only be negatives.",
        "In the graph representation, events are defined through their trigger word node, resulting in overlapping nodes for overlapping events.",
        "The trigger detector can however predict a maximum ofone trigger node per type for each token.",
        "When edges are predicted between these nodes, the result is a merged graph where overlapping events are merged into a single node and its set of outgoing edges.",
        "Taking into account the limits of trigger prediction, the edge detector is also trained on a merged graph version of the gold data.",
        "To produce the final events, these merged nodes need to be \"pulled apart\" into valid trigger and argument combinations.",
        "In the BioNLP'09 Shared Task, this was done with a rule-based system.",
        "Since then, further research has been done on machine learning approaches for this question (Miwa et al., 2010b; Heimonen et al., 2010).",
        "In our current system, unmerging is done as an SVM-classification step.",
        "An example is constructed for each argument edge combination of each predicted node, and classified as a true event or a false event to be removed.",
        "Tested on the BioNLP'09 Shared Task data, this system performs roughly on par with our earlier rule-based system, but has the advantage of being more general and thus applicable to all BioNLP'11 Shared Task",
        "Figure 3: Ranking of the systems participating in the BioNLP'11 Shared Task.",

        "tasks.",
        "The unmerging step is not required for trig-gerless events which are defined by a single edge.",
        "All of the tasks define varied, detailed limits on valid event type and argument combinations.",
        "A final validation step based on task-specific rules is used to remove structurally incorrect events left over from preceding machine learning steps.",
        "Speculation and negation are detected independently, with binary classification of trigger nodes.",
        "The features used are mostly the same as for trigger detection, with the addition of a list of speculation-related words based on the BioNLP'09 ST corpus."

        "To aid in detecting Bacterium-entities a list of bacteria names from the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature was used (Euzeby, 1997) as external features.",
        "To help in detecting the heterogeneous habitat-entities, synonyms and hy-pernyms from Wordnet were used (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The development set lacked some event classes, so we moved some documents from the training set to the development set to include these.",
        "Our F-score was the lowest of the three participating systems, and detailed results show a consistently lower performance in detecting the entities.",
        "The large number of intersentence events (Table 2) also considerably limited performance (Figure 3).",
        "The BI-task considers events related to genetic processes of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.",
        "This task defines a large number of both entity and event types, but all entities are given as gold-standard data, therefore we start from edge detection (Figure 1 D).",
        "All BI events are triggerless.",
        "In this task manually curated syntactic parses are provided.",
        "As also automated parses were available, we tested them as an alternative.",
        "With the Charniak-Johnson/McClosky parses overall performance was only 0.65 percentage points lower (76.59% vs. 77.24%).",
        "As with the BB task, we moved some documents from the training set to the development set to include missing classes.",
        "Despite this task being very straightforward compared to the other tasks we were the only participant.",
        "Therefore, too many conclusions shouldn't be drawn from the performance, except to note that a rather high F-score is to be expected with all the entities being given as gold data.",
        "In the CO supporting task the goal is to extract anaphoric expressions.",
        "Even though our event extraction system was not developed with corefer-ence resolution in mind, the graph representation can be used for the coreference annotation, making coreference detection possible.",
        "Anaphoras and An tecedents are both represented as Exp-type entities, with Coref type edges linking Anaphora-entities to Antecedent-entities and Target-type edges linking Protein-type entities to Antecedent-entities.",
        "In the CO-task, character spans for detected entities must be in the range of a full span and minimum span.",
        "Therefore in this task we used an alternative trigger detector.",
        "Instead of predicting one trigger per token, this component predicted one trigger per each syntactic phrase created by the Charniak-Johnson parser.",
        "Since these phrases don't cover most of the CO-task triggers, they were further subdivided into additional phrases, e.g. by cutting away determiners and creating an extra phrase for each noun-token, with the aim of maximizing the number of included triggers and minimizing the number of candidates.",
        "Our system placed fourth out of six, reaching an F-score of 23.77%.",
        "Coreference resolution being a new subject for us and our system not being developed for this domain, we consider this an encouraging result, but conclude that in general dedicated systems should be used for coreference resolution.",
        "The REL supporting task concerns the detection of static relationships, Subunit-Complex relations between individual proteins and protein complexes and Protein-Component relations between a gene or protein and its component, such as a protein domain or gene promoter.",
        "In the graph representation these relations are defined as edges that link together given protein/gene names and Entity-type entities that are detected by the trigger detector.",
        "To improve entity detection, additional features are used.",
        "Derived from the REL annotation, these features highlight structures typical for biomolecular components, such as aminoacids and their shorthand forms, domains, motifs, loci, termini and promoters.",
        "Many of the REL entities span multiple tokens.",
        "Since the trigger detector predicts one entity per token, additional features are defined to mark whether a token is part of a known multi-token name.",
        "Our system had the best performance out of four participating systems with an F-score of 57.7%, over 16 percentage points higher than the next.",
        "Development set results show that performance for the two event classes was very close, 66.40% for Protein-Component and 65.23% for Subunit-Complex.",
        "The REN supporting task is aimed at detecting statements of B. Subtilis gene renaming where a synonym is introduced for a gene.",
        "The REL task defines a single relation type, Renaming, and a single entity type, Gene.",
        "All entities are given, so only edge detection is required.",
        "Unlike the other tasks, the main evaluation criterion ignores the direction of the relations, so they are processed as undirected edges in the graph representation.",
        "Edge detection performance was improved with external features based on two sources defining known B. Subtilis synonym pairs: The Uniprot B. Subtilis gene list \"bacsu\" and SubtiWiki, the B. Subtilis research community annotation wiki.",
        "For the 300 renaming relations in the REN training data, the synonym pair was found from the Uniprot list in 66% (199 cases), from SubtiWiki in 79% (237 cases) and from either resource in 81.3% (244 cases).",
        "For the corresponding negative edge examples, Uniprot or SubtiWiki synonym pairs appeared in only 2.1% (351 out of 16640 examples).",
        "At 87.0% F-score our system had the highest performance out of the three participants, exceeding the next highest system by 17.1 percentage points.",
        "If Uniprot and SubtiWiki features are not used, performance on the development set is still 67.85%, close to the second highest performing system on the task."

      "heading": "4. Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "We have developed a system that addresses all tasks and subtasks in the BioNLP'11 Shared Task, with top performance in several tasks.",
        "With the modular design of the system, all tasks could be implemented with relatively small modifications to the processing pipeline.",
        "The graph representation which covered naturally all different task annotations was a key feature in enabling fast system development and testing.",
        "As with the Turku Event Extraction System developed for the BioNLP'09 Shared Task, we release this improved system for the BioNLP community under an open source license at bionlp.utu.fi.",
        "Of all the tasks, the GE-task, which extends the BioNLP'09 corpus, is best suited for evaluating advances in event extraction in the past two years.",
        "Comparing our system's performance on the GE'09 corpus with the current one, we can assume that the two corpora are of roughly equal difficulty.",
        "Therefore we can reason that overall event extraction performance has increased about three percentage points, the highest performance on the current GE-task being 56.04% by team FAUST.",
        "It appears that event extraction is a hard problem, and that the immediate easy performance increases have already been found.",
        "We hope the BioNLP'11 Shared Task has focused more interest in the field, hopefully eventually leading to breakthroughs in event extraction and bringing performance closer to established fields of BioNLP such as syntactic parsing or named entity recognition.",
        "That our system could be generalized to work on all tasks and subtasks, indicates that the event extraction approach can offer working solutions for several biomedical domains.",
        "A potential limiting factor currently is that most task-specific corpora annotate a non-overlapping set of sentences, necessitating the development of task-specific machine learning models.",
        "Training on multiple datasets could mean that positives of one task would be unannotated on text from the other task, confusing the classifier.",
        "On the other hand, multiple overlapping task annotations on the same text would permit the system to learn from the interactions and delineations of different annotations.",
        "System generalization has been successfully shown in the BioNLP'11 Shared Task, but has resulted in a number of separate extraction systems.",
        "It could well be that the future of event extraction requires also the generalization of corpus annotations.",
        "As future directions, we intend to further improve the scope and usability of our event extraction system.",
        "We will also continue our work on PubMed-scale event extraction, possibly applying some of the new extraction targets introduced by the BioNLP'11 Shared Task."
