        "During both training and decoding, we employed the same mention detection and preprocessing steps.",
        "We considered all the noun phrases (NP) and possessive pronouns (PRP$) as mentions.",
        "In order to extract head words from the NP constituents, we converted the constituent trees provided in the data sets to dependency graphs using the Penn treebank converter of Johansson and Nugues (2007).",
        "Using the dependency tree, we extracted the head word of all the NPs by taking the word that dominates the subtree constructed from the NP.",
        "The dependency tree is also used later to extract features of mentions based on dependency tree paths, which is further described in Sec. 3.",
        "In the preprocessing step, we assigned a number and a gender to each mention.",
        "For the pronominal mentions, we used a manually compiled lists of pronouns, where we marked the number and gender.",
        "For nonpronominal mentions, we used the number and gender data (Bergsma and Lin, 2006) provided by the task organizers and queried it for the head word of the mention.",
        "In cases of ambiguity (e.g. the pronoun you), or missing entries in the data for non-pronominals, we assigned an unknown value.",
        "To create a set of training examples, we used pairs of mentions following the method outlined by Soon et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "For each anaphoric mention mj and its closest preceding antecedent mj, we built a positive example: P = {(mi,mj)}.",
        "We constructed the negative examples with noncoreferring pairs of mentions, where the first term is a mention occurring between mi and mj and the second one is mj : N = {(mfc,mj)|i < k < j)}.",
        "The training examples collected from the CoNLL 2011 training set consist of about 5.5% of positive examples and 94.5% of negative ones.",
        "We evaluated two types of classifiers: decision trees and logistic regression.",
        "We used the decision trees and the C4.5 algorithm from the Weka distribution (Hall et al., 2009) for our baseline system.",
        "We then opted for linear logistic regression as it scaled better with the number of features and feature values.",
        "Logistic regression is faster to train and allowed us to carry out an automated feature selection, which is further described in Sec. 3.4.",
        "In addition, the logistic classifiers enabled us to interpret their results in terms of probabilities, which we used for the decoding step.",
        "We trained the logistic regression classifiers using the LIBLINEAR package (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "The decoding algorithm devised by Soon et al.",
        "(2001) selects the closest preceding mention deemed to be coreferent by the classifier.",
        "This clustering algorithm is commonly referred to as closest-first clustering.",
        "Ng and Cardie (2002) suggested a different clustering procedure, commonly referred to as best-first clustering.",
        "This algorithm selects the most likely antecedent classified as coreferent with the anaphoric mention.",
        "During early experiments, we found that while the best-first method increases the performance on nonpronominal anaphoric expressions, it has the opposite effect on pronominal anaphoric expressions.",
        "Consequently, we settled on using the closest-first clustering method for pronominal mentions, and the best-first clustering method otherwise.",
        "For the best-first clustering, we used the probability output from our logistic classifiers and a threshold of 0.5.",
        "After clustering mentions in a document, we discard all remaining singleton mentions, as they were excluded from the annotation in the CoNLL 2011 shared task.",
        "The initial detection of mentions is a direct mapping from two categories of constituents: NP and PRP$.",
        "In the postprocessing step, we reclaim some of the mentions that we missed in the initial step.",
        "The automatically generated constituent trees provided in the data set contain errors and this causes the loss of many mentions.",
        "Another source of loss is the bracketing of complex NPs, where the internal structure uses the tag NML.",
        "In a few cases, these nested nodes participate in coreference chains.",
        "However, when we tried to include this tag in the mention detection, we got worse results overall.",
        "This is possibly due to an even more skewed distribution of positive and negative training examples.",
        "In the postprocessing step, we therefore search each document for sequences of one or more proper noun tokens, i.e. tokens with the part-of-speech tags NNP or NNPS.",
        "If their common ancestor, i.e. the parse tree node that encloses all the tokens, is not already in a mention, we try to match this sequence to any existing chain using the binary features: StringMatch and Alias (cf. Sec. 3).",
        "If either of them evaluates to true, we add this span of proper nouns to the matched chain."

        "We also defined a large number of feature templates based on the syntactic dependency tree, as well as features based on semantic roles.",
        "In the following sections, we describe these features as well as the naming conventions we use.",
        "The final feature set we used is given in Sec. 4.",
        "On the mention level, we considered the head word (HD) of the mention, and following the edges in the dependency tree, we considered the leftmost and rightmost children of the head word (HDLMC and HdRmc), the left and right siblings of the head word (HDLS and HDRS), as well as the governor of the head word (HdGov).",
        "For each of the above mentioned tokens, we extracted the surface form (FORM), the part-of-speech tag (POS), and the grammatical function of the token (FUN), i.e. the label of the dependency edge of the token to its parent.",
        "For head words that do not have any leftmost or rightmost children, or left or right siblings, we used a null-value placeholder.",
        "In each training pair, we extracted these values from both mentions in the pair, i.e. both the anaphor and the tentative antecedent.",
        "Table 3 shows the features we used in our system.",
        "We used a naming nomenclature consisting of the role in the anaphora, where I stands for antecedent and J for anaphor; the token we selected from the dependency graph, e.g. HD or HDLMC; and the value extracted from the token, e.g. POS or FUN.",
        "For instance, the part-of-speech tag of the governor of the head word of the anaphor is denoted: J-HdGovPos.",
        "The baseline features taken from Soon et al.",
        "(2001) include features such as I-Pronoun and J-Demonstrative that are computed using a word list and by looking at the first word in the mention, respectively.",
        "Our assumption is that these traits can be captured by our new features by considering the part-of-speech tag of the head word and the surface form of the leftmost child of the head word, respectively.",
        "Between pairs of potentially coreferring mentions, we also considered the path from the head word of the anaphor to the head word of the antecedent in the syntactic dependency tree.",
        "If the mentions are not in the same sentence, this is the path from the anaphor to the root of its sentence, followed by the path from the root to the antecedent in its sentence.",
        "We differentiate between the features depending on whether they are in the same sentence or in different sentences.",
        "The names of these features are prefixed with SS and DS, respectively.",
        "Following the path in the dependency tree, we concatenated either the surface form, the part-of-speech tag, or the grammatical function label with the direction of the edge to the next token, i.e. up or down.",
        "This way, we built six feature templates.",
        "For instance, DsPathForm is the concatenation of the surface forms of the tokens along the path between mentions in different sentences.",
        "Bergsma and Lin (2006) built a statistical model from paths that include the lemma of the intermediate tokens, but replace the end nodes with noun, pronoun, or pronoun-self for nouns, pronouns, and reflexive pronouns, respectively.",
        "They used this model to define a measure of coreference likelihood to resolve pronouns within the same sentence.",
        "Rather than building an explicit model, we simply included these paths as features in our set.",
        "We refer to this feature template as BergsmaLinPath in Table 3.",
        "We tried to exploit the semantic roles that were included in the CoNLL 2011 data set.",
        "Ponzetto and Strube (2006) suggested using the concatenation of the predicate and the role label for a mention that has a semantic role in a predicate.",
        "They introduced two new features, LSemrole and J_Semrole, that correspond to the semantic roles filled by each of the mentions in a pair.",
        "We included these features in our pool of feature templates, but we could not see any contribution from them during the feature selection.",
        "We also introduced a number of feature templates that only applied to pairs of mentions that occur in the same semantic role proposition.",
        "These templates included the concatenation of the two labels of the arguments and the predicate sense label, and variations of these that also included the head words of either the antecedent or anaphor, or both.",
        "The only feature that was selected during our feature selection procedure corresponds to the concatenation of the argument labels, the predicate sense, and the head word of the anaphor: SemRolePropJHd in Table 3.",
        "In the sentence A lone protestor parked herselfoutside the UN, the predicate park has the arguments A lone protestor, labeled ARG0, and herself, labeled ARG1.",
        "The corresponding value of this feature would be ARG0-park.01-ARG1-herself.",
        "Starting from Soon et al.",
        "(2001)'s feature set, we performed a greedy forward selection.",
        "The feature selection used a 5-fold cross-validation over the training set, where we evaluated the features using the arithmetic mean of MUC, BCUB, and CEAFE.",
        "After reaching a maximal score using forward selection, we reversed the process using a backward elimination, leaving out each feature and removing the one that had the worst impact on performance.",
        "This backwards procedure was carried out until the score no longer increased.",
        "We repeated this forward-backward procedure until there was no increase in performance.",
        "Table 3 shows the final feature set.",
        "Feature bigrams are often used to increase the separability of linear classifiers.",
        "Ideally, we would have generated a complete bigram set from our features.",
        "However, as this set is quadratic in nature and due to time constraints, we included only a subset of it in the selection procedure.",
        "Some of them, most notably the bigram of mention head words (I-HdForm+J-HdForm) were selected in the procedure and appear in Table 3."
