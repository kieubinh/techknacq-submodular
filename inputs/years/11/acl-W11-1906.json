        "there is a coreference between the pronoun \"it\" and the noun phrase \"a good suggestion\".",

        "The strong growth followed year-to-year increases.\"",

        "The CoNLL 2011 Shared Task (Pradhan et al., 2011) is dedicated to modeling unrestricted coref-erence in OntoNotes.",
        "The participants are provided with a large corpus that contains various annotation layers such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, parsing, named entities and semantic role labeling.",
        "The task consists in the automatic identification of core-ferring entities and events given predicted information on other OntoNotes layers.",
        "A previous work on modeling unrestricted coreference using an earlier version of this corpus is presented in (Pradhan et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, we describe the machine learning approach that we used to the closed track of the CoNLL 2011 Shared Task.",
        "Our system follows the common strategy of recasting the problem as a classification task.",
        "First, in a preprocessing step, a set of candidate mentions is constructed.",
        "Next, also in the preprocessing step, pairs ofcandidate co-referring mentions are generated.",
        "Then, each candidate pair of mentions is classified as co-referring or not using a classifier learned from the annotated corpus.",
        "Finally, a postprocessing step (clustering) removes inconsistencies that would result of the pairwise classifications and constructs a partition on the set of mentions.",
        "In our system, the learning module is based on ensemble learning.",

        "In this section we describe some preprocessing and postprocessing steps used in the proposed system.",
        "For each text document, we generate a list of candidate mentions in the following way:",
        "• all the noun phrases (NP) identified in the provided parsing tree are considered as candidate mentions;",
        "• each pronoun is isolatedly considered as a candidate mention even if it is inside a larger NP;",
        "• named entities in the categories Person (PERSON), Organization (ORG) and Geo-Political Entity (GPE) are isolatedly considered as candidate mentions even if they are inside larger NPs.",
        "Additionally, in order to better align with the OntoNotes mention annotation, a processing is performed to include possessive marks \"'s\" and premodifiers such as \"Mr.\".",
        "In the current version, our system does not consider verbs when creating candidate mentions.",
        "Therefore, the system does not resolve coreferences involving events.",
        "In the training phase, we generate positive and negative examples of co-referring pairs using a strategy similar to the one of Soon et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "In their method, the text is examined in a left-to-right manner.",
        "For each anaphoric mention mj, is generated a positive example pair that includes mj and its closest preceding antecedent, mj.",
        "A negative example is created for mj paired with each of the intervening mentions, mi+1, mi+2, mj_1.",
        "We extend the Soon et al.",
        "(2001) approach by also including all positive and negative pairs that can be formed with the mentions in the sentence of the closest preceding antecedent, mi.",
        "In the classification phase, the text is also examined in a left-to-right manner.",
        "For each mention mj, candidate co-referring pairs are generated by pairing it with a limited number of preceding mentions.",
        "When using predicted mentions, we set this limit to 60 (sixty).",
        "For the gold-mentions track, the limit is set to 40 (forty).",
        "We use a set of 80 features to describe each pair of mentions (mi, mj).",
        "The feature set includes lexical, morphological, syntactic, semantic and positional information.",
        "Most of them are borrowed from the works of Ng and Cardie (2002) and Sapena et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "However, we also propose some new features.",
        "In the following, due to space constraints, we briefly describe some of them.",
        "The features marked with * are the new proposed ones.",
        "Lexical: head word of mi/j; String matching of (head word of) mi and mj (y/n); Both are pronouns and their strings match (y/n); Previous/Next two words of mi/j ; Length of mi/j ; Edit distance of head words; mi/j is a definitive NP (y/n); mi/j is a demonstrative NP (y/n).",
        "Morphological: Both are proper names and their strings match (y/n); Basic gender agreement*, which use a list of proper names extracted from the training corpus (y/n); Gender/Number of mi/j ; Gender/Number agreement(y/n), this and the previous feature are generated using the number and gender data provided by Bergsma and Lin (2006).",
        "Syntactic: POS tag of the mi/j head word; Previous/Next two POS tags of mi/j ; mi and mj are both pronouns /proper names (y/n); Previous/Next predicate of mi/j *; Compatible pronouns, which checks whether two pronouns agree in number, gender and person (y/n)*; NP embedding level; Number of embedded NPs in mi/j*.",
        "Semantic: the result of a baseline system; sense of the mi/j head word; Named entity type of mi/j; mi and mj have the same named entity; Semantic role ofmi/j for the prev/next predicate*; Concatenation ofsemantic roles ofmi and mj for the same predicate (if they are in the same sentence)*; Same speaker* (y/n); Alias (y/n); mi and mj have a hy-pernym/hyponym relation (y/n); mi and mj have the same semantic class (y/n); sum ofdistances between mi and mj to their class.",
        "The last three features are generated using WordNet 3.0 (Miller, 1995).",
        "Distance and Position: Distance between mi and mj in sentences; Distance in number of mentions; Distance in number of person names (applies only for the cases where mi and mj are both pronouns or one of them is a person name)*; One mention is in apposition to the other (y/n).",
        "In order to generate the coreference chains, it is needed a strategy to create a partition in the mentions using the predictions for the candidate co-referent pairs.",
        "This part of the coreference resolution system is frequently called clustering strategy (Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "Our system uses an aggressive-merge clustering approach similar to the one proposed by Mccarthy and Lehnert (1995).",
        "In this strategy, each mention is merged with all of its preceding mentions that are classified as coreferent with it.",
        "Additionally, a postprocessing step is employed to remove inconsistencies that would result of the clustering processing, such as an NP being coreferent to its embedded NP."
