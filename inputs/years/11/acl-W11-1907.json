        "Coreference resolution is the task of grouping mentions of entities into sets so that all mentions in one set refer to the same entity.",
        "Most recent approaches to coreference resolution divide this task into two steps: (1) a classification step which determines whether a pair of mentions is coreferent or which outputs a confidence value, and (2) a clustering step which groups mentions into entities based on the output of step 1.",
        "In this paper we present an end-to-end corefer-ence resolution system, COPA, which avoids the division into two steps and instead performs a global decision in one step.",
        "The system presents a document as a hypergraph, where the vertices denote mentions and the edges denote relational features between mentions.",
        "Coreference resolution is then performed globally in one step by partitioning the hypergraph into subhypergraphs so that all mentions in one subhypergraph refer to the same entity (Cai and Strube, 2010).",
        "COPA assigns edge weights by applying simple descriptive statistics on the tranin-ing data.",
        "Since COPA does not need to learn an explicit model, we used only 30% of the CoNLL shared task training data.",
        "We did this not for efficiency reasons, only for convenience.",
        "While COPA has been developed originally to perform coreference resolution on MUC and ACE data (Cai and Strube, 2010), the move to the OntoNotes data (Weischedel et al., 2011) required mainly to update the mention detector and the feature set.",
        "Since several off-the-shelf preprocessing components are used, COPA participated in the open setting of the CoNLL shared task on modeling unrestricted coreference (Pradhan et al., 2011).",
        "We did not make extensive use of information beyond information from the closed class setting."

        "Each document is stored in several XML-files representing different layers of annotations.",
        "These annotations are created by a pipeline of preprocessing components.",
        "We use the Stanford MaxentTagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) for part-of-speech tagging, and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) for annotating named entities.",
        "In order to derive syntactic information, we use the Charniak/Johnson rerank-ing parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) combined with a constituent-to-dependency conversion Tool (http ://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/ treebank_converter).",
        "The preprocessing models are not trained on CoNLL data, so we only participated in the open task.",

        "The COPA system consists of modules which derive hyperedges from features and assign edge weights indicating a positive correlation with the coreference relation, and resolution modules which create a hypergraph representation for the testing data and perform partitioning to produce subhypergraphs, each of which represents an entity.",
        "COPA needs training data only for computing the hyperedge weights.",
        "Hyperedges represent features.",
        "Each hyperedge corresponds to a feature instance modeling a simple relation between two or more mentions.",
        "This leads to initially overlapping sets of mentions.",
        "Hyperedges are assigned weights which are calculated on the training data as the percentage of the initial edges being in fact coreferent.",
        "Due to the simple strategy of assigning edge weights, only a reasonable size of training data is needed.",
        "Unlike pairwise models, COPA processes a document globally in one step, taking care of the preference information among all the mentions simultaneously and clustering them into sets directly.",
        "A document is represented as a single hypergraph with multiple edges.",
        "The hypergraph resolver partitions the hypergraph into several sub-hypergraphs, each corresponding to one set of coreferent mentions.",
        "A single document is represented in a hypergraph with basic relational features.",
        "Each hyperedge in a graph corresponds to an instance of one of those features with the weight assigned by the HyperEdge- Learner.",
        "Instead of connecting nodes with the target relation as usually done in graph models, COPA builds the graph directly out of low dimensional features without assuming a distance metric.",
        "In order to partition the hypergraph we adopt a spectral clustering algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2005).",
        "All experimental results are obtained using symmetric Laplacians (Lsym) (von Luxburg, 2007).",
        "We apply the recursive variant of spectral clustering, recursive 2-way partitioning (R2 partitioner) (Cai and Strube, 2010).",
        "This method does not need any information about the number of target sets (the number k of clusters).",
        "Instead a stopping criterion a* has to be provided which is adjusted on development data.",
        "Since edge weights are assigned using simple descriptive statistics, the time HGResolver needs for building the graph Laplacian matrix is not substantial.",
        "For eigensolving, we use an open source library provided by the Colt projectwhich implements a Householder-QL algorithm to solve the eigenvalue decomposition.",
        "When applied to the symmetric graph Laplacian, the complexity of the eigensolving is given by O(n), where n is the number of mentions in a hypergraph.",
        "Since there are only a few hundred mentions per document in our data, this complexity is not an issue.",
