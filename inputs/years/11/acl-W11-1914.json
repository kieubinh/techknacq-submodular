        "Here we have identified salience factors and assigned weights for each factor.",
        "Before resolving the pronouns we identify whether a given pronoun is anaphoric or not.",
        "In example, (1) below, the pronoun \"It\", does not refer to any entity, and it is a pleonastic \"it\".",
        "In identifying the non-anaphoric pronouns such as \"it\" we use a CRFs engine, a machine learning approach.",
        "We build a language model using the above ML method to identify the non-anaphoric pronouns and the features used in training are word and it's POS in a window of five (two preceding and two following words to the pronoun).",
        "After the non-anaphoric pronoun identification, we resolve the anaphoric pronouns using a pronominal resolution system.",
        "Though we use salience factors based on the Lappin and Leass (1994), we have substantially deviated from the basic algorithm and have also used factors from Sobha (2008), where named entity and ontology are considered for resolution.",
        "For identifying an antecedent for a pronoun we consider all the noun phrases before the pronoun in the current sentence and in the four sentences preceding the current sentence.",
