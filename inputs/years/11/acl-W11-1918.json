        "Coreference Resolution is the process of identifying the linguistic expressions in a discourse that refer to the same real world entity and to divide those expressions into equivalence classes that represent each discourse entity.",
        "For this task, a deeper knowledge of the discourse is often required.",
        "However, such knowledge is difficult to acquire.",
        "For this reason, many systems use superficial information such as string match.",
        "The CoNLL shared task on \"Modeling Unrestricted Coreference in OntoNotes\" (Prad-han et al., 2011) presents challenges that go beyond previous definitions of the task.",
        "On the one hand, mention extraction is part of the task while many previous approaches assumed gold standard mentions.",
        "On the other hand, coreference is not restricted to noun phrases, verbs are also included.",
        "Thus, in Sales of passenger cars grew 22%.",
        "The strong growth followed year-to-year increases., the verb grew has an identity relation with the noun phrase The strong growth.",
        "The system that we used for the shared task is the memory-based machine learning system UBIU (Zhekova and Kiibler, 2010).",
        "We describe the most important components of the system in section 2.",
        "The system was originally developed for robust, multilingual coreference resolution, and thus had to be adapted to this shared task.",
        "We investigate the quality of our mention extraction in section 2.1 and the quality of the features used in the classifier in section 2.2.",
        "In section 3, we present UBIU's results on the development set, and in section 4, UBIU's final results in the shared task.",
        "UBIU (Zhekova and Kubler, 2010) was developed as a multilingual coreference resolution system.",
        "A robust approach is necessary to make the system applicable for a variety of languages.",
        "For this reason, we use a machine learning approach to classify mention pairs.",
        "We use TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2007), a memory-based learner (MBL) that labels the feature vectors from the test set based on the k nearest neighbors in the training instances.",
        "We chose TiMBL since MBL has been shown to work well with small training sets.",
        "A non-exhaustive parameter optimization on the development set led us to use the IB1 algorithm, similarity is computed based on weighted overlap, the relevance weights are computed using gain ratio and the number of nearest neighbors is set to k = 3 (for a description of the algorithm and parameters cf. (Daelemans et al., 2007)).",
        "The classifier is preceded by a mention extractor, which identifies possible mentions, and a feature extractor.",
        "The latter creates a feature vector for each possible pair of a potentially coreferring mention and all possible antecedents in a context of 3 sentences.",
        "Another important step is to separate singleton mentions from coreferent ones since only the latter are annotated in OntoNotes.",
        "Our markable extractor overgenerates in that it extracts all possible mentions, and only after classification, the system can decide which mentions are singletons.",
        "We investigate the performance of the mention and feature extraction modules in more detail below.",
        "UBIU's mention extractor uses part-of-speech (POS), syntactic, and lemma information provided in the OntoNotes data set to detect mentions.",
        "The module defines a mention for each noun phrase, based on syntactic information, as well as for all possessive pronouns and all proper nouns, based on their POS tags.",
        "Since for the shared task, verbs are also potentially coreferent, we included a mention for each of the verbs with a predicate lemma.",
        "An example of the output of the mention extraction module is shown in table 1.",
        "Each mention is numbered with an individual number and thus still represents a distinct entity.",
        "Since singleton mentions are not annotated in the OntoNotes data set, mentions without coreference relations after classification need to be removed from the answer set, which can only be performed after coreference resolution when all coref-erent pairs are identified.",
        "For this reason, the markable extractor is bound to overgenerate.",
        "The latter can clearly be seen when the mention extraction output is compared to the provided gold mentions (cf. the last column in table 1).",
        "We conducted a simple experiment on the development data in order to gain insight into the performance of the mention extraction module.",
        "Using the scorer provided by the shared task, we evaluated the output of the module, without performing coref-erence resolution and without removing singleton mentions.",
        "This led to a recall of 96.55 % and a precision of 18.55%, resulting in an F-score of 31.12.",
        "The high recall shows that the system is very reliable in finding mentions with the correct boundaries.",
        "However, since we do not remove any singletons, UBIU overgenerates and thus the system identified a considerable number of singletons, too.",
        "Nevertheless, the fact that UBIU identified 96.55% of all mentions shows that the performance of the mention extraction module is close to optimal.",
        "2.2 Feature Extraction",
        "Feature extraction is the second important subtask for the UBIU pipeline.",
        "Since mentions are represented by their syntactic head, the feature extractor uses a heuristic that selects the rightmost noun in a noun phrase.",
        "However, since postmodifying prepositional phrases may be present in the mention, the noun may not be followed by a preposition.",
        "For each mention, a feature vector is created for all of its preceding mentions in a window of 3 sentences.",
        "After classification, a filter can optionally be applied to filter out mention pairs that disagree in number, and another filter deletes all mentions that were not assigned an antecedent in classification.",
        "Note that the number information was derived from the POS tags and not from the number/gender data provided by the shared task since the POS information proved more reliable in our system.",
        "Initially, UBIU was developed to use a wide set of features (Zhekova and Kubler, 2010), which constitutes a subset of the features described by Rahman and Ng (2009).",
        "For the CoNLL-201 1 shared task, we investigated the importance of various additional features that can be included in the feature set used by the memory-based classifier.",
        "Thus, we conducted experiments with a base set and an extended feature set, which makes use of lexical semantic features.",
        "Base Feature Set Since the original feature set in Zhekova and Kubler (2010) contained information that is not easily accessible in the OntoNotes data set (such as grammatical functions), we had to restrict the feature set to information that can be derived solely from POS annotations.",
        "Further information as sentence distance, word overlap etc.",
        "was included as well.",
