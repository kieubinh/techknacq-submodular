        "The goal of the Spoken Dialog Challenge (SDC) is to investigate how different dialog systems perform on a similar task.",
        "It is designed as a regularly recurring challenge.",
        "The first one took place in 2010.",
        "SDC participants were to provide one or more of three things: a system; a simulated user, and/or an evaluation metric.",
        "The task chosen for the first SDC was one that already had a large number of real callers.",
        "This had several advantages.",
        "First, there was a system that had been used by many callers.",
        "Second, there was a substantial dataset that participants could use to train their systems.",
        "Finally, there were real callers, rather than only lab testers.",
        "Past work has found systems which appear to perform well in lab tests do not always perform well when deployed to real callers, in part because real callers behave differently than lab testers, and usage conditions can be considerably different [Raux et al. 2005, Ai et al. 2008].",
        "Deploying systems to real users is an important trait of the Spoken Dialog Challenge.",
        "The CMU Let's Go Bus Information system [Raux et al. 2006] provides bus schedule information for the general population of Pittsburgh.",
        "It is directly connected to the local Port Authority, whose evening calls for bus information are redirected to the automated system.",
        "The system has been running since March 2005 and has served over 130K calls.",
        "The software and the previous years of dialog data were released to participants of the challenge to allow them to construct their own systems.",
        "A number of sites started the challenge, and four sites successfully built systems, including the original CMU system.",
        "An important aspect of the challenge is that the quality of service to the end users (people in Pittsburgh) had to be maintained and thus an initial robustness and quality test was carried out on contributed systems.",
        "This control test provided scenarios over a web interface and required researchers from the participating sites to call each of the systems.",
        "The results of this control test were published in [Black et al.",
        "2010] and by the individual participants [Williams et al.",
        "2010, Thomson et al.",
        "2010, Hastie et al., 2010] and they are reproduced below to give the reader a comparison with the later live tests.",
        "Important distinctions between the control test callers and the live test callers were that the control test callers were primarily spoken dialog researchers from around the world.",
        "Although they were usually calling from more controlled acoustic conditions, most were not knowledgeable about Pittsburgh geography.",
        "As mentioned above, four systems took part in the SDC.",
        "Following the practice of other challenges, we will not explicitly identify the sites where these systems were developed.",
        "We simply refer to them as SYS1-4 in the results.",
        "We will, however, state that one of the systems is the system that has been running for this task for several years.",

        "The present live system covers the East End of Pittsburgh.",
        "Although the Port Authority message states that other areas are not covered, callers may still ask for routes that are not in the East End; in this case, the live system must say it doesn't have information available.",
        "Some events that affect the length of the dialog include whether the system uses implicit or explicit confirmation or some combination of both, whether the system has an open-ended first turn or a directed one, and whether it deals with requests for the previous and/or following bus (this latter should have been present in all of the systems).",
        "Just before the SDC started, the Port Authority had removed some of its bus routes.",
        "The systems were required to be capable of informing the caller that the route had been canceled, and then giving them a suitable alternative.",
        "SDC systems answer live calls when the Port Authority call center is closed in the evening and early morning.",
        "There are quite different types and volumes of calls over the different days of the week.",
        "Weekend days typically have more calls, in part because the call center is open fewer hours on weekends.",

        "Figure 1 : average number of calls per hour on weekends (dark bars) and weekdays.",
        "Listed are names of days and times before and after midnight when callers called the system.",
        "The control tests were set up through a simple web interface that presented 8 different scenarios to callers.",
        "Callers were given a phone number to call; each caller spoke to each of the 4 different systems twice.",
        "A typical scenario was presented with few words, mainly relying on graphics in order to avoid influencing the caller's choice of vocabulary.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Figure 2: Typical scenario for the control tests.",
