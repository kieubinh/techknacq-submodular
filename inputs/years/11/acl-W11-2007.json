        "Human dialogue serves as a valuable model for learning the behavior of dialogue systems.",
        "For this reason, corpus-based approaches to dialogue management tasks have been an increasingly active area of research (Bangalore, Di Fabbrizio, & Stent, 2006; Di Eugenio, Xie, & Serafin, 2010; Georgila, Lemon, Henderson, & Moore, 2009; Rotaru & Litman, 2009).",
        "Modeling the dialogue policies that humans employ permits us to directly extract conversational and task-based expertise.",
        "These techniques hold great promise for scaling gracefully to large corpora, and for transferring well across domains.",
        "The richness and flexibility of human dialogue introduce nondeterministic and complex patterns that present challenges for machine learning approaches.",
        "One approach that has been successfully employed in dialogue modeling is the hidden Markov model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989).",
        "These models are well suited to the sequential nature of dialogue (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "Moreover, their theoretical underpinnings are consistent with the conception of dialogue as a stochastic process whose observations are influenced by a layer of implicit, yet highly relevant, structure (Boyer et al., 2009; Woszczyna & Waibel, 1994).",
        "HMMs have been shown to perform well on important dialogue management tasks such as automatic dialogue act classification (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "Our work has employed HMMs for a different goal: learning dialogue policies, or strategies, from corpora (Boyer, Phillips, et al., 2010; Boyer, Phillips, Ingram, et al., in press).",
        "This work can be viewed from two perspectives.",
        "First, a descriptive goal of the work is to learn models that describe the nature of human dialogues in succinct probabilistic terms, in a way that facilitates important qualitative investigations.",
        "The second and complementary goal is predictive: learning models that accurately predict the dialogue moves of humans, in order to capture a dialogue policy that can be used within a system.",
        "Both of these goals are of paramount importance in tutorial dialogue, in which tutors and students engage in dialogue in support of a learning task (Boyer, Ha, et al., 2010; VanLehn et al., 2007).",
        "Descriptive modeling represents a critical step toward more fully understanding the phenomena that contribute to the high effectiveness of human tutoring, which has to date been unmatched by tutorial dialogue systems.",
        "Predictive models, on the other hand, may be used directly as dialogue policies within systems.",
        "The HMMs considered here were learned from an annotated corpus of textual human-human tutorial dialogue.",
        "In this domain, HMMs have been shown to correspond qualitatively to widely held conceptions of tutorial dialogue strategies, and adjacency pair analysis before model learning has been shown to enhance this qualitative correspondence (Boyer et al., 2009).",
        "Moreover, HMMs can identify in an unsupervised fashion structural components that correlate with student knowledge gain (Boyer, Phillips, Ingram, et al., in press).",
        "However, to date, several important questions have not been explored.",
        "The answers to these questions have implications for learning HMMs for task-oriented dialogues.",
        "The questions include the following: 1) How reliably does the HMM learning framework converge to the hyperparameter N, the best-fit number of hidden states?",
        "2) What are the effects of preprocessing approaches, specifically, adjacency pair analysis, on the resulting HMMs?",
        "3) How do different feature sets for task-oriented dialogue impact the descriptive fit and predictive power of learned HMMs?",
        "This paper addresses these questions.",
        "The findings suggest that model stability and predictive power benefit from the richest possible input sequences, which include not only dialogue acts but also information about the task state and the absence of particular tutor dialogue moves.",
        "Additionally, we find that traditional measures of HMM goodness-of-fit may not identify the most highly predictive models under some conditions."

        "HMMs have been used for dialogue modeling tasks for many years.",
        "Early work utilized HMMs to model underlying linguistic structure for the purposes of identifying speech acts and reducing perplexity for speech recognition (Stolcke et al., 2000;",
        "Woszczyna & Waibel, 1994).",
        "These projects treated underlying dialogue structure as the hidden layer, and dialogue utterances as observations.",
        "This treatment is analogous to the work presented in this paper, except that our observations are dialogue act tags only, rather than being constituent words in each utterance.",
        "Our goals are also different: to create a qualitatively interpretable model of dialogue structure that corresponds to widely accepted notions of task-oriented dialogue, and to learn a highly predictive dialogue policy from a human-human dialogue corpus.",
        "HMMs rely on treating dialogue as a sequential Markov process in which each observation depends only on a finite set of preceding observations.",
        "Some other approaches that rely on this assumption treat dialogue as a Markov decision process or partially observable Markov decision process, in which state changes are associated with actions and rewards (e.g., Young et al., 2010).",
        "Such work focuses on learning an optimal policy, typically utilizing a combination of human and simulated dialogue corpora.",
        "Reinforcement learning techniques can then be applied to learn the optimal policy based on the observed rewards.",
        "In contrast, we start with a rich corpus of human-human dialogue, which may have poor coverage in some areas (though the dialogue act tags were empirically derived and therefore mitigate this problem to some extent), and subsequently learn a model that explains the variance in that human corpus as well as possible.",
        "Capturing the dialogue policy implicit within a corpus of human-human dialogue has been explored in other work in a catalogue-ordering domain (Bangalore, Di Fabbrizio, & Stent, 2006).",
        "That work utilized maximum entropy modeling to predict human agents' dialogue moves within a vector-based framework.",
        "Although a vector-based approach differs in many regards from the sequential HMM approach described here, both approaches assume a dependence only on a finite history.",
        "HMMs accomplish this through graphical dependencies, while vector-based approaches accomplish it by including features for a restricted window of left-hand context.",
        "The results of this catalogue-ordering project highlight how challenging it is to predict human agents' dialogue moves in a task-oriented domain."

        "For predictive accuracy, the benefits of richer input sequences are also highlighted.",
        "The most highly predictive models included all three sources of information: dialogue acts, task events, and delayed feedback tags.",
        "However, with the addition of this rich information to the input sequences and the accompanying flatter goodness-of-fit curve as discussed above, we noted an irregular pattern of correlation between goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy that is worthy of future exploration.",
        "Specifically, it appears that the most highly predictive DATASKDELAY ADJPAIR model, which is the most highly predictive of all models in all conditions, does not correspond to the best (lowest) AIC for that condition (Figure 3).",
        "This finding suggests that when a predictive task is the primary goal, a predictive metric should be used to select the best-fit model.",
        "Additional support for such an approach is provided by the close correspondence between training and testing set prediction accuracy."

        "Understanding how HMMs behave under different feature sets is an important step toward learning effective models of task-oriented dialogue.",
        "This paper has examined how HMMs converge to a best number of hidden states under different experimental conditions.",
        "We have also considered how well HMMs under these conditions predict tutor dialogue acts within a corpus of task-oriented tutoring, a crucial step toward learning dialogue policies from human corpora.",
        "The findings highlight the importance of adding rich task-based features to the input sequences in order to learn HMMs that converge tightly on the best-fit number of hidden states.",
        "The results also indicate that caution should be used when utilizing traditional goodness-of-fit metrics, which are appropriate for descriptive applications, if the goal is to learn a highly predictive model.",
        "This line of research is part of a larger research program of learning unsupervised models of human task-oriented dialogue that can be used to define the behavior of dialogue systems.",
        "Developing a framework for learning a dialogue policy from human corpora, as discussed here, is a critical step toward that goal.",
        "Future work should focus on unsupervised dialogue act classification, and address the challenges of user plan recognition.",
