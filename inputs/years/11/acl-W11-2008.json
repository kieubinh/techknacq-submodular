        "Recently, a huge amount of information is accumulated and distributed on the web day by day.",
        "As a result, many people get information via web rather than the conventional mass media.",
        "On the other hand, the amount of information on the web is so huge that we often encounter the difficulty in finding information we want.",
        "Keyword search is the most widely-used means for the web information access.",
        "However, this style is not necessarily the best for information demands of all users who do not have definite goals or just want to know what would be interesting.",
        "To cope with user's vague information demands is an important mission for interactive spoken dialogue systems.",
        "Moreover, supporting user's information collection in a small-talk style is one of the new directions of spoken dialogue systems.",
        "Existing spoken dialogue systems can be classified into two types (T.Kawahara, 2009): those using relational databases (RDB) such as the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) (D.A.Dahl, 1994), and those using information retrieval techniques based on statistical document matching (T.Misu and T.Kawahara, 2010).",
        "The first scheme can achieve a well-defined task by using a structural database, but this scheme cannot be applied to the web information in which the structure and task are not well defined.",
        "The second scheme has been studied to handle large-scale texts such as web, but most of the conventional systems adopt a \"bag-of-words\" model, and naive statistical matching often generates irrelevant responses which have nothing to do with the user's requests.",
        "Our proposed scheme solves this problem by using information extraction based on semantic parsing from web texts, without constructing an RDB.",
        "We adopt the predicate-argument (P-A) structure generated by a parser as a baseline, but every PA structure is not useful for information extraction and retrieval(Y.Kiyota et al., 2002; M.O.Dzikovska et al., 2003; S.Harabagiu et al., 2005).",
        "In fact, the useful information structure is dependent on domains.",
        "Conventionally, the templates for information extraction were hand-crafted (R.Grishman, 2003), but this heuristic process is so costly that it cannot be applied to a variety of domains on the web.",

        "Figure 1 : System overview.",
        "pose a filtering method of predicate-argument (P-A) patterns generated by the parser, in order to automatically define the domain-dependent useful information structure.",
        "We also address flexible matching based on the PA structure, because the exact matching often fails and does not generate any outputs.",
        "In order to retrieve most relevant information, we define similarity measures of predicates and arguments, which are also learned from a domain corpus.",
        "In this paper, the proposed scheme is applied to a domain of baseball news, and implemented as a spoken dialogue system which can reply to the user's question as well as make proactive information presentation using a news website.",

        "The architecture of the proposed spoken dialogue system is depicted in Fig. 1.",
        "First, information extraction is conducted by parsing web texts in advance.",
        "A user's query is also parsed to extract the same information structure, and the system matches the extracted information against the web information.",
        "According to the matching result, the system either answers the user's question or makes proactive presentation of information which should be most relevant to the user's request.",
        "If the system finds some information which completely matches the user's query, the system makes a response using the corresponding web text.",
        "When the system cannot find exact information, it searches for some information which matches partially.",
        "For example, in Fig. 2, when a user asked \"Did Ichiro hit a home-run?",
        "\", the system cannot find exact information \"[Ichiro (agent), home-run (object), hit]\", but finds \"[Lopez (agent), three-run homer (object), hit]\" which is partially matched and most relevant.",
        "This information is used to generate a relevant response that the user would expect.",
        "In the conventional RDB-based dialogue scheme, the system hardly makes relevant responses if it finds no matched entries, thus usually replies \"There is no matched entries\".",
        "In the conventional question-answering scheme, the same situation often happens.",
        "Occasionally, a set of close-matched answers may be found by statistical matching, but the found answers may not be relevant to the user's query.",
        "In the proposed scheme, we guarantee that the answer is at least partially matched to the user's query in terms of the information structure.",
        "We use the predicate argument (P-A) structure to define the information structure from web texts.",
        "The PA structure represents a sentence with a predicate, arguments and their semantic cases, as shown in the previous examples.",
        "There are some required semantic cases depending on the type of the predicate (verb), and also arbitrary semantic cases like time, place, and other modifications.",
        "This structure is a classic concept in natural language processing, but recently, automatic semantic parsing has reached a practical level thanks to corpus-based learning techniques (D.Kawahara and S.Kurohashi, 2006) and has been used for several large-scale tasks (D.Shen and M.Lapata, 2007; R.Wang and Y.Zhang, 2009; D.Wu and P.Fung, 2009).",

        "The PA structure automatically generated by the semantic parser provides useful information structure as a baseline.",
        "However, every PA pair is not meaningful in information navigation; actually, only a fraction of the patterns are useful, and they are domain-dependent.",
        "For example, in the baseball domain, key patterns include \"[A (agent) beat B (object)]\" and \"[A (agent) hit B (object)]\", and in the business domain, \"[A (agent) sell B (object)]\" and \"[A (agent) acquire B (object)]\".",
        "We propose a method to automatically extract these useful patterns given a domain corpus.",
        "We assume each article in the newspaper corpus/websites is annotated with a domain such as sports-baseball and economy-stock.",
        "The method is to filter PA structure patterns (=templates) based on some statistical measure which accounts for the domain.",
        "The filtering process is also expected to eliminate inappropriate patterns caused by parsing errors.",
        "Moreover, in spoken dialogue systems, errors in automatic speech recognition (ASR) may result in erroneous matching.",
        "By eliminating irrelevant patterns, we expect robust information extraction for spoken input.",
        "Specifically, the following two significance measures are investigated in this work.",
        "First, we use the TF-IDF measure to evaluate importance of word wi in a particular domain or topic t.",
        "The TF term is the occurrence probability of word wi, defined as:",
        "where C(wi, t) is the occurrence count of word wi in the domain t in the corpus, and a is a smoothing factor given by the Dirichlet process prior.",
        "The IDF term is the inverse log probability ofdocuments containing word wi:",
        "where C(d) is the number of documents (=newspa-per articles) in the corpus and C(d : wi G d) is the number of documents which contain wi.",
        "ÃŸ is a smoothing factor given by the Dirichlet process prior.",
        "We estimate a and ÃŸ by a likelihood function using the training corpus.",
        "We compute the TF-IDF value for a predicate and each argument, and then compute their geometric mean to define the evaluation measure for a PA template.",
        "The second measure is based on the Naive Bayes model.",
        "Here, 7 is a smoothing factor and Dt is a normalization coefficient of the corpus size of the domain",
        "t.",
        "The evaluation measure for a PA pattern is obtained by taking a geometric mean ofthe component words.",
        "The statistical learning often falls in the data sparseness problem, especially for proper nouns, for example, name of persons.",
        "Moreover, there may be mismatch in the set of named entities between the training corpus and the test phase.",
        "For robust estimation, we introduce classes for named entities (name of persons, organizations, places).",
        "Note that unifying all named entities in the corpus before computing the evaluation measure would weaken the significance of these entities.",
        "Thus, we compute statistics for every proper noun before clustering, and sum up values for the class afterwards.",
        "For example, the score for \"[[person](agent), hit]\" is computed as a sum over all persons of this pattern.",
        "We performed an experimental evaluation to compare the effectiveness of the two significance measures (TF-IDF and Naive Bayes (NB)) in the Japanese professional baseball domain.",
        "The models are trained with the Mainichi Newspaper corpus 2008.",
        "The clustering of named entities is applied to both methods.",
        "The PA templates having larger significance scores are selected.",
        "We determined a threshold for selecting templates using a development set which was held out from the test set by 10%.",
        "The test set was made from Mainichi newspaper's website which talks about games played between April 21-23, 2010.",
        "Manual annotation was made on typical predicates and semantic cases which can be used for question answering and proactive presentation.",
        "The filtering was performed on the test set by matching the patterns defined by each measure, and evaluated against the annotated answers in terms of recall, precision and F-measure (F).",
        "Table 1 lists the result for the two measures using predicate-only, argument-only, and both of them.",
        "In this result, using both predicates and arguments in the Naive Bayes (NB) model performs the best.",
        "Compared with the baseline without any filtering, the proposed methods significantly improved precision with some degradation of recall.",
        "This property is important in realizing informative response generation robust against ASR and parsing errors.",
        "Among the selected templates, we can find typical and important patterns like \"have a win\", \"come into pitch\", and \"make it consecutive wins\".",
        "Most of recall errors are infrequent patterns, and majority of precision errors are those patterns that are frequently observed but not useful for presentation."
