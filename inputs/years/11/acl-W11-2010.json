        "Virtual human characters constitute a promising contribution to many fields, including simulation, training and interactive games (Kenny et al., 2007; Jan et al., 2009).",
        "The ability to communicate using natural language is important for believable and effective virtual humans.",
        "Such ability has to be good enough to engage the trainee or the gamer in the activity.",
        "Nowadays, most conversational systems operate on a dialogue-act level and require extensive annotation efforts in order to be fit for their task (Rieser and Lemon, 2010).",
        "Semantic annotation and rule authoring have long been known as bottlenecks for developing conversational systems for new domains.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for generating virtual instructors from automatically annotated human-human corpora.",
        "Our algorithm, when given a task-based corpus situated in a virtual world, generates an instructor that robustly helps a user achieve a given task in the virtual world of the corpus.",
        "There are two main approaches toward automatically producing dialogue utterances.",
        "One is the selection approach, in which the task is to pick the appropriate output from a corpus ofpossible outputs.",
        "The other is the generation approach, in which the output is dynamically assembled using some composition procedure, e.g. grammar rules.",
        "The selection approach to generation has only been used in conversational systems that are not task-oriented such as negotiating agents (Gandhe and Traum, 2007a), question answering characters (Kenny et al., 2007), and virtual patients (Leuski et al., 2006).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first one proposed for doing corpus based generation and interaction management for task-oriented systems.",
        "The advantages of corpus based generation are many.",
        "To start with, it affords the use of complex and human-like sentences without detailed analysis.",
        "Moreover, the system may easily use recorded audio clips rather than speech synthesis and recorded video for animating virtual humans.",
        "Finally, no rule writing by a dialogue expert or manual annotations is needed.",
        "The disadvantage of corpus based generation is that the resulting dialogue may not be fully coherent.",
        "For non-task oriented systems, dialogue management through corpus based methods has shown coherence related problems.",
        "Shawar and Atwell (2003; 2005) present a method for learning pattern matching rules from corpora in order to obtain the dialogue manager for a chatbot.",
        "Gandhe and Traum (2007b) investigate several dialogue models for negotiating virtual agents that are trained on an unannotated human-human corpus.",
        "Both approaches report that the dialogues obtained by these methods are still to be improved because the lack of dialogue history management results in incoherences.",
        "Since in task-based systems, the dialogue history is restricted by the structure of the task, the absence of dialogue history management is alleviated by tracking the current state of the task.",
        "In the next section we introduce the corpora used in this paper.",
        "Section 3 presents the two phases of our algorithm, namely automatic annotation and dialogue management through selection.",
        "In Section 4 we present a fragment of an interaction with a virtual instructor generated using the corpus and the algorithm introduced in the previous sections.",
        "We evaluate the virtual instructor in interactions with human subjects using objective as well as subjective metrics.",
        "We present the results of the evaluation in Section 5.",
        "We compare our results with both human and rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task.",
        "Finally, Section 7 discusses the weaknesses of the approach for developing instruction giving agents, as well as its advantages and drawbacks with respect to hand-coded systems.",
        "In this last section we also discuss improvements on our algorithms designed as a result of our error analysis."

        "The Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments (GIVE; Koller et al.",
        "(2010)) is a shared task in which Natural Language Generation systems must generate real-time instructions that guide a user in a virtual world.",
        "In this paper, we use the GIVE-2 Corpus (Gargett et al., 2010), a freely available corpus of human instruction giving in virtual environments.",
        "We use the English part of the corpus which consists of 63 American English written discourses in which one subject guided another in a treasure hunting task in 3 different 3D worlds.",

        "The other partner acted as the \"direction giver\" (DG), who was given complete knowledge of the world and had to give instructions to the DF to guide him/her to accomplish the task.",

      "text": [
        "Our algorithm consists of two phases: an annotation phase and a selection phase.",
        "The annotation phase is performed only once and consists of automatically associating the DG instruction to the DF reaction.",
        "The selection phase is performed every time the virtual instructor generates an instruction and consists of picking out from the annotated corpus the most appropriate instruction at a given point.",
        "The basic idea of the annotation is straightforward: associate each utterance with its corresponding reaction.",
        "We assume that a reaction captures the semantics of its associated instruction.",
        "Defining reaction involves two subtle issues, namely boundary determination and discretization.",
        "We discuss these issues in turn and then give a formal definition of reaction.",
        "We define the boundaries of a reaction as follows.",
        "A reaction Rk to an instruction Uk begins right after the instruction Uk is uttered and ends right before the next instruction Uk+1 is uttered.",
        "In the following example, instruction 1 corresponds to the reaction (2, 3, 4), instruction 5 corresponds to (6), and instruction 7 to (8).",
        "DG(1): hit the red you see in the far room DG(5): hit far side green DF(6): [moves next to the wrong green] DF(8): [moves to the right green and pushes it]",
        "As the example shows, our definition of boundaries is not always semantically correct.",
        "For instance, it can be argued that it includes too much because 4 is not strictly part of the semantics of 1.",
        "Furthermore, misinterpreted instructions (as 5) and corrections (e.g., 7) result in clearly inappropriate instruction-reaction associations.",
        "Since we want to avoid any manual annotation, we decided to use this naive definition of boundaries anyway.",
        "We discuss in Section 5 the impact that inappropriate associations have on the performance of a virtual instructor.",
        "The second issue that we address here is discretization of the reaction.",
        "It is well known that there is not a unique way to discretize an action into subactions.",
        "For example, we could decompose action 2 into 'enter the room' or into 'get close to the door and pass the door'.",
        "Our algorithm is not dependent on a particular discretization.",
        "However, the same discretization mechanism used for annotation has to be used during selection, for the dialogue manager to work properly.",
        "For selection (i.e., in order to decide what to say next) any virtual instructor needs to have a planner and a planning problem: i.e., a specification of how the virtual world works (i.e., the actions), a way to represent the states of the virtual world (i.e., the state representation) and a way to represent the objective of the task (i.e., the goal).",
        "Therefore, we decided to use them in order to dis-cretize the reaction.",
        "For the virtual instructor we present in Section 4 we used the planner LazyFF and the planning problem provided with the GIVE Framework.",
        "The planner LazyFF is a reimplementation (in Java) of the classical artificial intelligence planner FF (Hoffmann and Nebel, 2001).",
        "The GIVE framework (Gar-gett et al., 2010) provides a standard PDDL (Hsu et al., 2006) planning problem which formalizes how the GIVE virtual worlds work.",
        "Both the LazzyFF planner and the GIVE planning problem are freely available on the web .",
        "Now we are ready to define reaction formally.",
        "Let Sk be the state of the virtual world when uttering instruction Uk, Sk+1 be the state of the world when uttering the next utterance Uk+1 and Acts be the representation of the virtual world actions.",
        "The reaction to Uk is defined as the sequence of actions returned by the planner with Sk as the initial state, Sk+1 as the goal state and Acts as the actions.",
        "Given this reaction definition, the annotation of the corpus then consists of automatically associating each utterance to its (discretized) reaction.",
        "The simple algorithm that implements this annotation is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Moreover, we provide a fragment of the resulting annotated corpus in Appendix A.",
        "1: Acts ‚Äì world possible actions 2: for all utterance Uk in the corpus do",
        "In this section we describe how the selection phase is performed every time the virtual instructor generates an instruction.",
        "The instruction selection algorithm, displayed in Figure 2, consists in finding in the corpus the set of candidate utterances C for the current task plan P (P is the sequence of actions that needs to be executed in the current state of the virtual world in order to complete the task).",
        "We define C = {U G Corpus | P starts with U.Reaction}.",
        "In other words, an utterance U belongs to C if the first actions of the current plan P exactly match the reaction associated to the utterance U.",
        "All the utterances that pass this test are considered paraphrases and hence suitable in the current context.",
        "Whenever the plan P changes, as a result of the actions of the DF, we call the selection algorithm in order to regenerate the set of candidate utterances C.",
        "2: Plan ‚Äì current task plan 3: for all utterance U in the corpus do 4: if Plan starts with U.Reaction then 8: return C",
        "While the plan P doesn't change, because the DF is staying still, the virtual instructor offers alternative paraphrases of the intended instruction.",
        "Each paraphrase is selected by picking an utterance from C and verbalizing it, at fixed time intervals (every 3 seconds).",
        "The order in which utterances are selected depends on the length of the utterance reaction (in terms of number of actions), starting from the longest ones.",
        "Hence, in general, instructions such as \"go back again to the room with the lamp\" are uttered before instructions such as \"go straight\", because the reaction of the former utterance is longer than the reaction of the later.",
        "It is important to notice that the discretization used for annotation and selection directly impacts the behavior of the virtual instructor.",
        "It is crucial then to find an appropriate granularity of the discretization.",
        "If the granularity is too coarse, many instructions in the corpus will have an empty reaction.",
        "For instance, in the absence of the representation of the user orientation in the planning domain (as is the case for the virtual instructor we evaluate in Section 5), instructions like \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" will have empty reactions making them indistinguishable during selection.",
        "However, if the granularity is too fine the user may get into situations that do not occur in the corpus, causing the selection algorithm to return an empty set of candidate utterances.",
        "It is the responsibility of the virtual instructor developer to find a granularity sufficient to capture the diversity of the instructions he wants to distinguish during selection."

        "In fact, it can be ported to any other instruction giving task (where the DF has to perform a physical task) with the same effort than required to port it to a new GIVE world.",
        "This is not true for the hand-coded GIVE systems.",
        "The inputs of our algorithm are an off-the-shelf planner, a formal planning problem representation of the task and a human-human corpus collected on the very same task the system aims to instruct.",
        "It is important to notice that any virtual instructor, in order to give instructions that are both causally appropriate at the point of the task and relevant for the goal cannot do without such planning problem representation.",
        "Furthermore, it is quite a normal practice nowadays to collect a human-human corpus on the target task domain.",
        "It is reasonable, then, to assume that all the inputs of our algorithm are already available when developing the virtual instructor, which was indeed the case for the GIVE framework.",
        "Another advantage of our approach is that virtual instructor can be generated by developers without any knowledge of generation of natural language techniques.",
        "Furthermore, the actual implementation of our algorithms is extremely simple as shown in Figures 1 and 2.",
        "This makes our approach promising for application areas such as games and simulation training."

        "In this paper we presented a novel algorithm for automatically prototyping virtual instructors from human-human corpora without manual annotation.",
        "Using our algorithms and the GIVE corpus we have generated a virtual instructor for a game-like virtual environment.",
        "A video of our virtual instructor is available in http://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/",
        "-luciana/give-ouR.",
        "We obtained encouraging results in the evaluation with human users that we did on the virtual instructor.",
        "In our evaluation, our system outperforms rule-based virtual instructors hand-coded for the same task both in terms of objective and subjective metrics.",
        "We plan to participate in the GIVE Challenge 2011 in order to get more evaluation data from online users and to evaluate our algorithms on multiple worlds.",
        "The algorithms we presented solely rely on the plan to define what constitutes the context of uttering.",
        "It may be interesting though to make use of other kinds of features.",
        "For instance, in order to integrate spatial orientation and differentiate \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", the orientation can be either added to the planning domain or treated as a context feature.",
        "While it may be possible to add orientation in the planning domain of GIVE, it is not straightforward to include the diversity of possible features in the same formalization, like modeling the global discourse history or corrections.",
        "Thus we plan to investigate the possibility of considering the context of an utterance as a set of features, including plan, orientation, discourse history and so forth, in order to extend the algorithms presented in terms of context building and feature matching operations.",
        "In the near future we plan to build a new version of the system that improves based on the error analysis that we did.",
        "For instance, we plan to take orientation into account during selection.",
        "As a result of these extensions however we may need to enlarge the corpus we used so as not to increase the number of situations in which the system does not find anything to say.",
        "Finally, if we could identify corrections automatically, as suggested in (Raux and Nakano, 2010), we could get an increase in performance, because we would be able to treat them as corrections and not as instructions as we do now.",
        "In sum, this paper presents the first existing algorithm for fully-automatically prototyping task-oriented virtual agents from corpora.",
        "The generated agents are able to effectively and naturally help a user complete a task in a virtual world by giving her him instructions."
