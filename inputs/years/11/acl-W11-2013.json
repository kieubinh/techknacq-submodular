        "The floor shifts from one participant to another as the result of the joint, cooperative floor management actions taken by the participants.",

        "This information is used in conjunction with higher-level dialog context to decide when the system should generate new contributions and which floor action should be produced at each point in time.",

        "However, if the floor is released to someone else after the system is interrupted during a question dialog act, the system will try to quickly reacquire the floor should no one else be speaking, so as to finish or restate its question.",
        "The waiting duration is set in the latter case to 500 milliseconds.",
        "If after 500ms, when the system tries to take the floor another conflict occurs (followed by a floor release to someone else), the waiting duration is increased again to 3.5 seconds.",

        "The system releases the floor at the end of its own outputs.",

        "Once a participant provides an answer, the system seeks confirmation from another participant before moving on.",
        "In some cases, the avatar passes back the floor and seeks confirmation non-verbally, by simply turning towards another participant and raising its eyebrows.",

        "Before diving into the details, we note that we eliminated 7 out of the total 150 interactions from the analysis due to significant problems with acoustic echo cancellation.",
        "In the remaining 143 interactions, we also identified and eliminated 24 utterances in the transitional engagement stages, e.g., when the users were not ready or properly setup in front of the system.",

        "The system uses a voice activity detector which leverages energy, acoustics and grammar to detect spoken utterances.",

        "Another 2% contain background noises incorrectly identified as speech.",
        "Most often these are instances where the system heard itself due to acoustic echo-cancellation problems; the ratio grows to about 6% among all utterances detected while the system is speaking.",
        "The remaining 26% contain overlapping or successive utterances from multiple speakers.",
        "Inspection of the data reveals that some utterances spoken softly by participants were not detected and that segmentation boundary errors are also sometimes present.",
        "While such errors may be mitigated by inferences at higher levels in the turn-taking model, they can significantly influence the system's ability to track the conversational dynamics and make appropriate turn-taking decisions.",

        "These errors influence the quality of turn taking in a variety of ways and underscore the need for more robust inferences about speech source and target, and floor release actions.",
        "We believe that more sophisticated models learned from audiovisual information (e.g., prosody, head and body pose, etc.)",
        "and attributes of the interaction context (e.g., who spoke last, where is the system looking, etc.)",
        "can reduce errors significantly.",
        "Table 1 indicates that in 305 (9%) of the cases the system incorrectly inferred that the floor was being released to it.",
        "In 79% of these cases, the system took the floor and produced a verbal contribution.",
        "Since the floor was not released to the system, such errors can lead to significant turn-taking problems, which often manifest as floor conflicts marked by turn-initial overlaps, where a participant and the system start speaking around the same time (see Figure 3).",
        "Operationally, we define turninitial overlaps as all detected overlaps with an actual onset of less than 300 milliseconds from the beginning of the system's utterance (see discussion in Appendix A); the other overlaps are dubbed turn-internal.",
        "We note that the time at which an overlap is detected by the system lags behind the actual onset of the utterance by an average of about 700 milliseconds, due to core latencies in our audio and speech processing pipeline.",
        "Accounting for these computational lags, and others arising at different places in processing pipelines, raise challenges for turn taking in spoken dialog systems.",
        "42% of the verbal takes performed incorrectly by the system led to turn-initial overlaps.",
        "This is not surprising, as the system starts speaking when the floor was not released to it.",
        "In some of these cases the same participant continues (e.g., diarization errors incorrectly segmented the utterance), or someone else starts speaking.",
        "The cost assessment experiment confirmed the impact of these errors the average estimated cost was 1.76.",
        "If no turninitial overlap occurred after the system incorrectly took the floor, the average cost was 0.42.",
        "Clearly floor conflicts come with a cost.",
        "The specific cost assessments we obtained are perhaps influenced to a degree by the role of game mediator played by the system.",
        "With this role, taking the floor in cases when the system was not addressed is perhaps not as costly as it might be in other domains.",
        "Note that 182 turn-initial overlaps also occur when the system takes the floor after correctly identifying that the floor was released to it (upper-left quadrant in Table 1).",
        "17 of them are created by the system hearing itself as it starts speaking, due to errors in acoustic echo cancellation; these instances are marked Echo in Table 1.",
        "While the relative percentage of turn-initial overlaps is smaller after a floor release to the system (~10%), the majority of all turn-initial overlaps (shaded cells in Table 1) occur in this context, because of the larger incidence of the situation.",
        "Often, these utterances contain an immediate answer or a short confirmation from another participant.",
        "The cost of these turn-initial overlaps is also much lower: 0.25 versus 1.76 (again, the cost structure is probably sensitive to details of the domain).",
        "We believe the turn-initial overlaps that occur when the floor is released to the system can be explained in part by the interpretation of the system's short delay in responding (per processing) as a signal that the system is not taking the floor, leading other participants to take initiative.",
        "As another factor, turn taking is a mixed-initiative process, and other participants might vie for the floor and issue their own contributions immediately after an answer directed to the system.",
        "These observations bring to the fore two questions: (1) how can we minimize the number of turn-initial overlaps, and (2) how can the system gracefully handle such overlaps once they occur?",
        "One approach to minimizing turn-initial overlaps is to reduce the system's response delays via faster processing or via the use of predictive models to anticipate the end of turns (e.g. Ferrer et al., 2003; Schlangen, 2006; Raux and Eskenazi, 2008; Skantze and Schlangen, 2009).",
        "Multiparty settings require methods for forecasting not only when a current speaker will finish, but also whether any participant will try to take (or release) the floor within a small window of time in the future, i.e., accurately modeling all floor intentions.",
        "Our turn-taking framework includes components for representing and modeling floor intentions, but these are not used in the current system.",
        "We believe there is promise in learning models to predict floor intentions and the timing of ends of utterances from interaction data.",
        "The availability of such predictions can fuel additional turn-taking strategies and also pave the way to more graceful handling of turninitial overlaps after they occur.",
        "For instance, if the system can anticipate that someone else might start speaking, it might still decide to take the floor but it might start with a filler, e.g., \"So [pause] What do you think?\"",
        "constructing a natural opportunity for resolving a potential conflict after \"So\" We plan to investigate the use of decision-theoretic methods to anticipate and resolve such conflicts by introducing and modulating an array of strategies, including the use of fillers, restarts, and acknowledgment gestures.",
        "In 21% of the 305 incorrectly detected floor releases to the system, our system immediately performed a non-verbal floor release to another participant by turning the avatar's face towards them and raising its eyebrows (Take + Non-verbal Release in Table 1).",
        "These situations are not costly, as the system's action does not interrupt the flow of the conversation.",
        "Indeed they were never penalized in the cost assessment experiment that we conducted.",
        "However, the same action, performed when the floor is actually released to the system (13% of 2063 cases), has the potential to create problems if not properly recognized by the targeted participant as a floor release by the system; the average cost assessed in this case was 0.42.",
        "The right-hand column in Table 1 shows cases where the system detected that the floor was not released to it.",
        "In these cases, the system waits (performs null) for a specified duration.",
        "The cost assessment indicates that waiting in this situation is overall costly, and the cost depends on the ultimate outcome.",
        "If no one else takes the floor, the system will eventually do so (Delayed System Take cases in Table 1).",
        "In some of these cases, turn-initial overlaps also occur.",
        "The 277 cases in which the system fails to detect that the floor was in fact released to it lead to no immediate response from the system.",
        "In these cases the system can be perceived as unresponsive and the participants eventually repeat themselves.",
        "We believe that performance can be improved with the use of an ongoing decision-theoretic analysis that continuously reassesses the situation while the system waits.",
        "Such an analysis would consider the delay, floor holder's previous actions, inferences about participants' floor intentions, and cost-benefit tradeoffs of different floor actions.",
        "We now turn our attention to the system's decisions to release the floor.",
        "Recall that, according to the current policy, the system performs a floor hold while it is speaking and a floor release at the end of its outputs.",
        "In addition, if an overlap (i.e., barge-in) was detected during question dialog acts, the system performed a floor release immediately, interrupting its own output and allowing for the user barge-in.",
        "Since such barge-ins were allowed only during the question dialog acts, as Table 2 shows, the current policy leads to an abundance of cases in which the system performs hold when an overlap is detected.",
        "Some of these cases are continuers: the overlap only happens at the very end of the system's output.",
        "These cases do not create significant turn-taking problems, as the floor still transitions to the participant relatively quickly (the system releases at the end of its output).",
        "However, in a significant number of cases the system appears to ignore the participants (shaded cells in Table 2).",
        "About three quarters of these overlaps occur while the system is providing an explanation after an incorrect answer.",
        "Observations of the data indicate that in these cases participants may discuss or give their opinion on the answer or some aspect of the system's explanation, while ignoring the system as it blindly continues the explanation.",
        "We have separated in Table 2 turn-initial from turn-internal overlaps.",
        "The two types of overlaps reflect different phenomena.",
        "As we have discussed, turn-initial overlaps mark floor conflicts, and various strategies could be used to negotiate such conflicts (e.g., Yang and Heeman, 2010).",
        "In contrast, turn-internal overlaps may reflect efforts by other participants to take the floor, or might simply be backchannels, laughter, exclamations or other lexical or non-lexical events that do not mark a claim for the floor.",
        "Making appropriate floor control decisions in this case will require models for reliably distinguishing between the two, i.e., between the take or null floor actions of the participants.",
        "This is an especially challenging inference problem as decisions need to be made as early as possible after the onset of an utterance.",
        "We note the relatively large incidence of failures in echo cancellation in our microphone array.",
        "On the utterances marked Echo in Table 2, the system heard itself and thought a user was speaking.",
        "We believe these failures could be significantly reduced with better acoustic echo cancellation.",
        "Finally, we present results from a subjective assessment of the system by participants, based on a post-experiment survey.",
        "The survey included several 7-point Likert scale questions related to turn taking, which are displayed in Figure 4, together with the mean user responses and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.",
        "Generally, participants rated the system's turn-taking abilities favorably, with scores around 4.5-5.",
        "No statistically significant differences were detected in assessments across the participant's gender or previous familiarity with speech recognition systems.",
        "We also note that a parallel human – human interaction study would help us characterize better the system's performance relative to human dialog.",
        "I knew when the avatar was addressing me I knew when the avatar was addressing others I knew whom the avatar was talking to I knew when it was my time to speak The avatar knew when I was speaking to it The avatar knew when I was speaking to others The avatar knew when it was its time to speak The avatar interrupted us at the wrong time The avatar waited too long before taking its turn I felt left out or excluded during the games",

        "Objective measures of system performance and subjective assessments by participants indicate that the approach can enable successful multiparty turn taking in the questions game domain.",
        "When the correct turn-taking decisions are made, the multiparty interaction is seamless and resembles human-human collaboration.",
        "The conversations exhibit fluid exchanges among people and the system, including mixed-initiative, multiparty floor control, fluid back offs and restarts, natural use of non-verbal cues, such as participants' utterances being triggered by a turn of the avatar's head or a lift of the eyebrows.",
        "In contrast, turn-taking failures lead to a striking loss of fluidity and a qualitative jump out of an engaged process, where the system rapidly shifts from a collaborating participant into a distant and uncoordinated appliance.",
        "The results we have discussed are based on an initial set of coarse perceptual and decision-making models and thus reflect an initial baseline; there is significant room for improvements.",
        "A careful dissection of the outcomes demonstrates the subtleties of multiparty turn taking and highlights several directions we plan to address in future work.",
        "First, our experiments have highlighted the importance of accurate diarization in multiparty dialog settings.",
        "Minimizing errors requires rich perceptual and inferential competencies, leveraging audiovisual evidence, general patterns of human discourse, and attributes of the task-specific goals and context.",
        "We plan to explore the use of machine learning procedures for constructing predictive models that harness richer streams of evidence to identify and segment utterances, and to make inferences about their sources and targets, and the floor state, actions and intentions of all participants.",
        "Better turn-taking decisions can also be supported by inferences about social norms, roles and dynamics, pace of interaction, and engagement.",
        "Although handcrafted turn-taking policies went a long way in this domain, enabling more general multiparty turn taking will require continuous inference and decision making under uncertainty that considers subtleties of intention and timing, and that takes into consideration tradeoffs associated with different courses of actions.",
        "We foresee the value of extending the current decision models with richer temporal reasoning for performing such ongoing analyses.",
        "Challenges include a more in-depth understanding of the cost of different types of turn-taking errors; the development of a wider array of graded strategies and behaviors for taking, releasing, or holding the floor, and for gracefully negotiating floor conflicts; and finally, the ability to reason about uncertainty in the world as well as in the system's own processing delays in order to resolve tradeoffs between taking timely action and delaying for additional evidence that promises to enhance the accuracies of decisions.",
        "Much also remains to be done with the corresponding generation of subtle verbal and nonverbal cues for enhanced signaling and naturalness of conversation, including the use of fillers, restarts, backchannels, and envelope feedback.",
        "We are excited about tackling these and other challenges on the path to fielding systems that can engage in fluid multiparty dialog."
