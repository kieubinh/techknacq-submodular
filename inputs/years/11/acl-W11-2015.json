        "Turn completion, that is, finishing a user's ongoing utterance, can be considered an ideal test-case of incremental spoken language processing, as it requires that all levels of language understanding and production are carried out in real time, without any noticeable lags and with proper timing and even with the ability to predict what will come.",
        "Spoken dialogue systems, especially incremental ones, have come a long way towards reducing lags at turn changes (e. g. (Raux and Eskenazi, 2009; Skantze and Schlangen, 2009)), or even predicting upcoming turn changes (Schlangen, 2006; Baumann, 2008; Ward et al., 2010).",
        "Compared to regular turn changes, where short pauses or overlaps occur frequently (Weilhammer and Rabold, 2003), turn completions in natural dialogues are typically precisely aligned and prosodically highly integrated with the turn that is being completed (Local, 2007).",

        "Faculty of Linguistics and Literature Bielefeld University Germany of completion comes into reach for SDSs, and hence questions of micro-timing become important.",
        "While completing someone else's turn - especially for a computer - may be considered impolite or even annoying, being able to do so can be a useful capability.",
        "Some tasks where it might be helpful are",
        "• negotiation training to induce stress in a human trainee as presented by DeVault et al.",
        "(2009), or",
        "• pronunciation aids for language learners, in which hard to pronounce words could be spoken simultaneously by the system.",
        "A system should certainly not try to complete all or even many user turns, but having the capability to do so means that the system has a very efficient interactional device at its disposal.",
        "Furthermore, monitoring the user's timing, as is required for the temporal prediction of turn continuations, can also be used for other conversational tasks such as producing back-channels that are precisely aligned to the user's back-channel inviting cues, to enable micro-alignment of turn-onsets, or to quickly react to deviations in the user's fluency.",
        "In this paper, we concentrate on the temporal aspects of turn completion, that is, the prediction of the precise temporal alignment of a turn continuation and the technical realization of this timing.",
        "We assume the task of predicting the completion itself to be handled by some other system component.",
        "Such components are indeed under development (see Section 2).",
        "However, previous work has left out the question of how the precise timing of turn completions can be accomplished, which is what we try to answer here.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we review literature on turn completion and related work in spoken dialogue systems, before we explain what exactly our task is in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we present our system's overall architecture and the duration modelling technique that we use, before describing the corpus that we use in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6 we first analyse whether enough time to output a completion is available sufficiently often, before turning to the question for the actual subtasks of when and how to complete.",
        "We wrap up with concluding remarks and ideas for future work."

        "The general phenomenon of turn completion can be broken down into cases where the completion is spoken simultaneously with the original speaker (turn sharing, (Lerner, 2002)) and where the floor changes in mid-utterance (collaborative turn sequences (Lerner, 2004) or split utterances (Purver et al., 2009)).",
        "In this paper, a differentiation between the two cases is not important, as we only deal with the question of when to start speaking (for the previously non-speaking system) and not the question of whether the current turn owner will stop speaking.",
        "Moreover, whether the other speaker will stop is beyond the system's control.",
        "Lerner (2004) distinguishes turn co-optation, in which a listener joins in to come first and win the floor, and turn co-completion, in which the completion is produced in chorus.",
        "Both of these phenomena relate to the current speaker's speech: either to match it, or to beat it.",
        "While we focus on matching in this work, the methods described similarly apply to co-optation.",
        "As Lerner (2002) notes, attributing this view to Sacks et al.",
        "(1974), simultaneous speech in conversation is often treated exclusively as a turn taking problem in need of repair.",
        "This is exactly the point of view taken by current spoken dialogue systems, which avoid overlap and interpret all simultaneous speech as barge-in, regardless of content.",
        "However, Lerner (2002) also notes that simultaneous speech systematically occurs without being perceived as a problem, e. g. in greetings, or when saying good bye, which are relevant subtasks in deployed SDSs.",
        "Two corpus studies are available which investigate split utterances and their frequency: Skuplik (1999) looked at sentence cooperations in a corpus of task-oriented German (Poesio and Rieser, 2010) and found 3.4% of such utterances.",
        "Purver et al.",
        "(2009) find 2.8 % of utterance boundaries in the BNC (as annotated by Fernandez and Ginzburg (2002)) to meet their definition of utterances split between speakers.",
        "Thus, while the absolute frequency may seem low, the phenomenon does seem to occur consistently across different languages and corpora.",
        "Local (2007) describes phonetic characteristics at utterance splits (he calls the phenomenon turn co-construction) which distinguish them from regular turn handovers, namely temporal alignment and close prosodic integration with the previous speaker's utterance.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the temporal aspects (both alignment and speech rate) when realizing turn completions, leaving pitch integration to future work.",
        "Cummins (2009) analyses speech read aloud by two subjects at the same time (which he calls synchronous speech): Synchrony is slightly better in a live setting than with a subject synchronizing to a recording of speech which was itself spoken in synchrony and this is easier than to a recording of unconstrained speech.",
        "Cummins (2009) also experiments with reduced stimuli: eliminating f0-contour had no significant impact on synchrony, while a carrier without segmental information (but including f0-contour) fared significantly better than speaking to an uninformative hiss.",
        "(The first sentence of each recording was always left unmodified, allowing subjects to estimate speech rate even in the hiss condition.)",
        "Thus, pitch information does not seem necessary for the task but may help in the absence of segmental information.",
        "On a more technical level and as mentioned above, much work has been put into speeding up end-of-turn detection and reducing processing lags at turn changes (Raux and Eskenazi, 2009) and more recently into end-of-turn prediction: Ward et al.",
        "(2010) present a model of turn-taking which estimates the remaining duration of a currently ongoing turn.",
        "We extend the task to predicting the remaining duration of any currently ongoing word in the turn.",
        "Of course, for this to be possible, words must be recognized while they are still being uttered.",
        "We have previously shown (Baumann et al., 2009) that this can be achieved with incremental ASR for the vast majority of words and with an average of 102 ms between when a word is first recognized and the word's end.",
        "As mentioned above, our work relies on other incremental components to form a meaningful, turn completing application and such components are being developed: Incremental understanding is well underway (Sagae et al., 2009; Heintze et al., 2010), as is decision making on whether full understanding of an utterance has been reached (DeVault et al., 2009), and Purver et al.",
        "(2011) present an incremental semantics component aimed explicitly at split utterances.",
        "In fact, DeVault et al.",
        "(2009) provide exactly the counterpart to our work, describing a method that, given the words of an ongoing utterance, decides when the point of maximum understanding has been reached and with what words this utterance is likely to end.",
        "However, in their system demonstration, Sagae et al.",
        "(2010) use short silence time-outs to trigger system responses.",
        "Our work eliminates the need for such time-outs.",
        "Hirasawa et al.",
        "(1999) present a study where immediate, overlapping back-channel feedback from the system was found to be inferior to acknowledging information only after the user's turn.",
        "However, they disregarded the back-channels' micro-temporal alignment as explored in this study (presumably producing back-channels as early as possible), so their negative results cannot be taken as demonstrating a general shortcoming of the interactional strategy."

        "Ideally, the system will start speaking the continuation precisely when the next word starts and match the user's speech as best as possible.",
        "Thus, our component must estimate the time between decision point and ideal onset (which we call holding time) and the user's speech rate during the following words.",
        "In order for the system to be able to produce a continuation (\"five six seven\" in Figure 1) in time, of course the decision point must come sufficiently early (i. e. during \"four\") to allow for a completion to be output in due time.",

        "The core of our system is a component that incrementally receives rich speech recognition input (words, their durations and a pitch track) from an incremental ASR and computes the timing of completions.",
        "When receiving a new word from ASR, our component queries an understanding component whether a completion can be predicted, and if so, whether such a completion should be performed.",
        "In order to not duplicate the work of DeVault et al.",
        "(2009), we use a mock implementation of an understanding module, which actually knows what words are going to be spoken (from a transcript file) and aims to complete after every word spoken.",
        "We have implemented two strategies for the timing module, which we will describe in turn, after first discussing a simple baseline approach.",
        "Baseline: Speak Immediately A first, very simple approach for our timing component is to never wait between the decision point and outputting a completion right away.",
        "We believe that this was the strategy taken by Hirasawa et al.",
        "(1999) and we will show in our evaluation in Section 6.2 that it is not very good.",
        "Strategy 1: Estimating ASR Lookahead In our",
        "ASR-based strategy (illustrated in Figure 2, top) the system estimates what we call its lookahead rate, i. e. the average time between when a word is first recognized by ASR and the word's end in the signal.",
        "This lookahead is known for the words that have been recognized so far and the average lookahead can then be used as an estimate of the remaining duration of the word that is currently being detected (i. e. its holding time).",
        "Once the currently spoken word is expected to end, the system should start to speak.",
        "The strategy just described, as well as the baseline strategy, only solve half of the task, namely, when the continuation should be started, but not the question of how to speak, which we will turn to now.",
        "Both subtasks can be solved simultaneously by estimating the speech rate of the current speaker, based on what she already said so far, and considering this speech rate when synthesizing a completion.",
        "Speech rate estimation using some kind of duration model thus forms the second strategy's main component.",
        "For the purpose of this work, we focus on duration models in the context of TTS, where they are used to assign durations to the phones to be uttered.",
        "Rule-based approaches (Klatt, 1979) as well as methods using machine learning have been used (primarily CART (Breiman et al., 1984)); for HMM-based speech synthesis, durations can be generated from Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) (Yoshimura et al., 1998).",
        "We are not aware of any work that uses duration models to predict the remaining time of an ongoing word or utterance.",
        "In our task, we need the duration model to make estimations based on limited input (instead of providing plausibility ratings as in most ASR-related applications).",
        "As it turns out, a TTS system in itself is an excellent duration model because it potentially ponders all kinds of syntactic, lexical, post-lexical, phonological and prosodical context when assigning durations to words and their phones.",

        "Strategy 2: Analysis-by-Synthesis As just described, we hence employ the TTS' duration model in an analysis-by-synthesis approach in this second strategy, as illustrated in Figure 2 (bottom): When triggered to complete an ongoing utterance, we query the TTS for the durations it would assign to a production of the predicted full utterance, i. e. the preix that was heard plus the predicted continuation of the turn.",
        "In that way, the TTS can take the full utterance into account when assigning prosodic patterns which may influence durations.",
        "We then compute the factor that is needed to scale the TTS's duration of the words already finished by the user (in the example: \"one two three\") to the duration of the actual utterance and apply this scaling factor to the remaining words in the synthesized completion.",

        "While our results could hence be considered too optimistic, Baumann et al.",
        "(2009) showed that incremental metrics remained stable in the light of varying ASR performance.",
        "We expect that lower ASR performance would not radically change prediction quality itself; rather, it would have an impact on how often continuations could be predicted, since that is based on correct understanding of the preix of the utterance, limiting the amount of data points for our statistics.",
        "Even though we simulated the understanding and prediction module, we built in some constraints that are meant to be representative of real implementations of such a module: it can only ind the right completion if the previous two words are recognized correctly and the overall WER is lower than 10 %.",
        "(Coming back to Figure 1, if the system had falsely recognized \"on two three\", no completion would take place: Even though the last two words \"two three\" were recognized correctly, the WER between \"on two three\" and \"one two three\" is too high.)",

As can be seen in Figure 3, some words are only hypothesized after the fact, or at least too late to account for the inevitable lags, which renders impossible successful turn-completions following these words.",
        "However, the timing component should know when it is too late - the holding time should be negative - and could either not output the completion at this point or e. g. back off to setting in one or more phones or syllables later (actually, back off until the holding time turns positive).",

        "Only our TTS-based strategy is capable of outputting predictions for a future word; our ASR-based approach does not provide this information.",
        "However, both duration and onset estimation (the next onset is identical to the end of the current word as estimated in Section 6.2) together determine the error at the word's end.",

        "However, for the next word's end to occur when the speaker's word ends, correct onset estimation is just as important.",
        "When we combine onset estimation with duration prediction, errors add up and hence the error for the next word's end is somewhat higher than for either of the tasks alone, with a standard deviation of 94 ms and an MAE of 74 ms for the TTS-based model, which again outperforms the ASR-based model.",
        "So far, we have not evaluated the matching of prosodic characteristics such as loudness and intonation (nor implemented their prediction).",
        "We believe that simple matching (as we implemented for onset and speech rate) is not as good a starting point for these as they are more complex.",
        "Instead, we believe these phenomena to mostly depend on communicative function, e. g. a co-optation having a wide pitch-range and relatively high loudness regardless of the current speaker's speech.",
        "Additionally, pitch-range would have to be incrementally speaker-normalized which results in some implementation difficulties."

        "We described the task of micro-timing, or micro-aligning a system response (in our case a turn completion and shadowing a speaker) to the user's speech based on incremental ASR output and with both ASR and symbolic TTS output as duration models to predict when and how a completion should be uttered.",
        "We have shown first of all, that a completion is possible after most words, as an incremental ASR in a small-enough domain can have a sufficient lookahead.",
        "Additionally, we have shown that the TTS-based duration model is better than both the baseline and the ASR-based model.",
        "Both the next word's onset and duration can be predicted relatively well (a = 77 ms and a = 75 ms, respectively), and within the margin of human performance in synchronously reading speech.",
        "It is interesting to note here that synchronous speech is simpliied in prosodic characteristics (Cummins, 2002), which presumably facilitates the task.",
        "Errors in speech rate estimation add up, so that the deviation at the next word's end is somewhat higher (a = 94 ms).",
        "Deviation will likely increase for longer completions, underlining the need for an incremental speech synthesis system which should allow to instantly adapt output to changes in speech rate, content, and possibly sentiment of the other speaker.",
        "Clearly, our duration modelling is rather simplistic and could likely be improved by combining ASR and TTS knowledge, more advanced (than a purely linear) mapping when calculating relative speech rate, integration of phonetic and prosodic features from the ASR, and possibly more.",
        "As currently implemented, improvements to the underlying TTS system (e. g. more \"conversational\" synthesis) should automatically improve our model.",
        "The TTS-based approach integrates additional, non-ASR knowledge, and hence it should be possible to single out those decision points after which a completion would be especially error-prone, trading coverage against quality of results.",
        "Initial experiments support this idea and we would like to extend it to a full error estimation capability.",
        "We have focused the analysis of incrementally comparing expected to actual speech rate to the task of micro-aligning a turn-completion and shadowing a speaker.",
        "However, we believe that this capability can be used in a broad range of tasks, e. g. in combination with word-based end-of-turn detection (Atterer et al., 2008) to allow for swift turn taking.",
        "In fact, precise micro-alignment of turn handovers could be used for controlled testing of linguistic/prosodic theory such as the oscillator model of the timing of turn-taking (Wilson and Wilson, 2005).",
        "Finally, duration modelling can be used to quickly detect deviations in speech rate (which may indicate hesitations or planning problems of the user) as they happen (rather than post-hoc), allowing to take the speaker's fluency into account in understanding and turn-taking coordination as outlined by Clark (2002)."
