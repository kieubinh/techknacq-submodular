        "Generating Temporal Expressions (TE) that are easy to understand, unambiguous, and reasonably short is a challenge for humans and Spoken Dialogue Systems.",
        "Rather than developing handwritten decision rules, we adopt a data-driven approach by collecting user feedback on a variety of possible TEs in terms of task success, ambiguity, and user preference.",
        "The data collected in this work is freely available to the research community.",
        "These data were then used to train a simulated user and a reinforcement learning policy that learns an adaptive Temporal Expression generation strategy for a variety of contexts.",
        "We evaluate our learned policy both in simulation and with real users and show that this data-driven adaptive policy is a significant improvement over a rule-based adaptive policy, leading to a 24% increase in perceived task completion, while showing a small increase in actual task completion, and a 16% decrease in call duration.",
        "This means that dialogues are more efficient and that users are also more confident about the appointment that they have agreed with the system."

        "Temporal Expressions are linguistic expressions that are used to refer to a date and are often a source of confusion in human-human, human-computer and text interactions such as emails and instant messaging.",
        "For example, \"Let's meet next Sunday\"- \"do you mean Sunday this week or a week on Sunday?\".",
        "(Mccoy and Strube, 1999) state that changes in temporal structure in text are often indicated by either cue words and phrases (e.g. \"next Thursday\", \"this week\", \"tomorrow\"), a change in grammatical time of the verb (e.g. present tense versus future tense), or changes in aspect (e.g. atomic versus extended events versus states as defined by (Moens and Steed-man, 1988)).",
        "In this study, we will concentrate on the first of these phenomena, generating TEs with the optimal content and lexical choice.",
        "Much work in the field of Natural Language Processing concerns understanding and resolving these temporal expressions in text (Gerber et al., 2002; Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Ahn et al., 2007; Mazur and Dale, 2007; Han et al., 2006), however, little work has looked at how best to plan and realise temporal expressions in order to minimize ambiguity and confusion in a Spoken Dialogue System (SDS).",
        "(Reiter et al., 2005) presented a data driven approach to generating TEs to refer to time in weather forecast information where appropriate expressions were identified using contextual features using supervised learning.",
        "We adopt an adaptive, data-driven reinforcement learning approach instead.",
        "Similar data-driven approaches have been applied to information presentation (Rieser et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2007) where each Natural Language Generation (NLG) action is a sequential decision point, based on the current dialogue context and expected long-term reward of that action.",
        "A data-driven approach has also been applied to the problem of referring expression generation in dialogue for expert and novice-users of a SDS (Janarthanam and Lemon, 2010).",
        "However, to date, there has been no previous work on adaptive data-driven approaches for temporal referring expression generation, where uncertainty in the stochastic environment is explicitly modelled.",
        "The data-driven approach to temporal expression generation presented here is in the context of appointment scheduling dialogues.",
        "The fact that there are multiple ways that a time slot can be referred to leads to an interesting NLG problem of how best to realise a TE for a particular individual in a particular context for certain domains.",
        "For example, the following expressions all vary in terms of length, ambiguity, redundant information and users' preference: \"next Friday afternoon\" or \"Friday next week at the same time\", or \"in the afternoon, a week on Friday\".",
        "Temporal Expressions contain two types of references: absolute references such as \"Tuesday\" and \"12th January\", and relative references such as \"tomorrow\" and \"this Tuesday\".",
        "Generating TEs therefore, involves both in selecting appropriate pieces of information (date, day, time, month, and week) to present and deciding how to present them (absolute or relative reference).",
        "Our objective here is to convey a target appointment slot to users using an expression that is optimal in terms of the trade-off between understandability, length and user preference."

      "text": [
        "We address the issue of generating TEs by adopting a data-driven approach that has four stages.",
        "Firstly, we define Temporal Expression Units (TEU) as described in Section 2.1.",
        "Secondly, we design and implement a web-based data collection, gathering metrics on the TEUs in various contexts for a variety of date types (Section 3).",
        "Thirdly, we train a user simulation and use it to learn a policy using reinforcement learning techniques that generates the optimal combination of TEUs for each context (Section 4).",
        "Finally, we deploy and evaluate this policy in a Spoken Dialogue System for appointment scheduling and show that our learned policy performs better than a hand-written, adaptive one (results presented in Section 5).",
        "For this study, TEs are broken down into 5 categories or units (TEUs) presented in a fixed order: DAY, DATE, MONTH, WEEK and TIME.",
        "Each of these units can be expressed relative to the current",
        "Table 1: TEU choices where abs is absolute, rel is relative, rc is relative to context and nn is none",
        "day and to the current context (i.e. previously mentioned dates).",
        "Specifically, there are 3 unit attributes: absolute (e.g. DAY=abs \"Tuesday\"); relative to current day (e.g. DAY=rel \"tomorrow\"); and relative to context (e.g. DAY=rc \"the following day\").",
        "Certain restrictions on possible TEU combinations were imposed, for example, DATE=rc and DAY=rel were combined to be just DAY=rel, and some combinations were omitted on the basis that it is highly unlikely that they would be uttered in natural speech, for example WEEK=rel and MONTH=abs would result in \"this week in September\".",
        "Finally, every TE has to contain a time (am or pm for this application).",

        "This realiser generates text from a candidate list for each TEU based on the given date.",
        "For example, if the slot currently being discussed is Tuesday 7th, the realiser would generate \"tomorrow\" for DAY=rel; if the date in discussion was Wednesday 8th then DAY=rel would be realised as \"the day after tomorrow\".",
        "There was potential for overlap of stimuli, as any given TE for any given date may be assessed by more than one participant.",

        "These two graphs represent the state space that the generation policy described in Section 4 is exploring, trading off between various features such as Length, taskSuccess and userPref.",
        "As we can see, there is a tendency for average taskSuccess to increase as absoluteness increases whereas, for relativeness the distribution is more even.",
        "The TE with the greatest taskSuccess has an absoluteness of 4 and zero relativeness: DATE=abs, MONTH=abs, WEEK=abs, TIME=abs (e.g. \"11th September, the week starting the 10th, between 8am and 10am\") and the TE with the least taskSuccess has an absoluteness of only 2, again with no rela-tiveness: DATE=abs, TIME=abs, (e.g. \"8th between 8am and 10am\").",
        "Average userPref stays level and then decreases if absoluteness is 5.",
        "We infer from this that although long utterances that are completely explicit are more clear in terms of taskSuccess, they are not necessarily preferred by users.",
        "This is likely due to TE length increasing.",
        "On average, the inclusion of one relative expression is preferred over none at all or two.",
