        "In recent years, there has been growing interest in identifying speakers' emotional state from speech (Devillers and Vidrascu, 2006; Ai et al., 2006; Lis-combe et al., 2005).",
        "For Spoken Dialog Systems (SDS), the motivation has been to provide users with improved over-the-phone services by recognizing emotions such as anger and frustration and directing users to a human attendant.",
        "Other forms of paralinguistic information which researchers have attempted to detect automatically include other classic emotions, charismatic speech (Biadsy et al., 2008), and deceptive speech (Hirschberg et al., 2005).",
        "More recently, the 2010 Interspeech Paralinguisic Affect Subchallenge sparked interest in detecting a speaker's level of interest (LOI), including both the speaker's interest in the topic and his/her willingness to participating in the dialog (Schuller et al., 2010).",
        "Sensing users' LOI in SDS should be useful in sales domains, political polling, or service subscription.",
        "In this paper, we present a similarity-based hierarchical regression approach to predicting speakers' LOI.",
        "The system has been developed based on the hierarchical fusion learning of lexical and acoustic cues from speech.",
        "We investigate the contribution of a novel source of information, Discriminative TFIDF; lexical affect scoring; and prosodic event features.",
        "Inspired by the successful use of Pseudo Relevance Feedback (Tao and Zhai, 2006) techniques in Information Retrieval and the cosine similarity measure (Salton, 1989) in Data Mining, we design a novel learning model which takes the multistream prediction feedback that is initially returned from seed samples and uses a mean cosine similarity measure to calculate the distance between the new instance and prominent seed data points in the Euclidean Space.",
        "We then add this similarity measure as a new feature to perform a reclassification.",
        "Our main contributions in this paper are: (1) the novel Discriminative TFIDF approach for lexical modeling and keywords spotting; (2) using lexical affect scoring and language modeling techniques to augment lexical modeling; (3) combin-",

        "A third method of combining features is the Hierarchical Fusion approach of fusing multistream information, which involves multiple classifiers and performs classification/regression in multiple stages.",
        "This can be implemented by first training 1st-tier classifiers for each single stream of features, collecting the predictions from these classifiers, and training a 2nd-tier supervector classifier to weight the importance of predictions from the different streams and make a final prediction.",
        "The rationale behind this approach is to solve the cross-domain issue by letting the 2nd-tier classifier weight the streams, as the predictions from 1st-tier classifiers will be in a unified/normalized form (e.g. 0 to 1 in this task).",

        "Our Multistream Prediction Feedback and Mean Cosine Similarity based Hierarchical Fusion approach combines a similarity based two-stage approach with a multistream feedback approach.",
        "Figure 1 shows the architecture of this system.",
        "It is based on the intuition that, if we can identify the prominent samples (e.g. the samples that all 1st-tier classifiers assign high average prediction scores), then we can measure the average distance between a new sample and all these prominent samples in the Euclidean Space.",
        "Furthermore, we can use this average distance (average similarity) as a new feature to improve the 2nd-tier classifier's final prediction.",
        "To implement this process, we first train five 1st-tier Additive Logistic Regression (Friedman et al., 2000) classifiers and a Random Subspace meta learning (Ho, 1998) 1st-tier classifier (for the acoustic stream), using six different feature streams in our training data.",

        "Now we use the mean cosine similarity score to represent how far a new sample Un is from the prominent samples US in the space:",
        "In the next step, we add this mean cosine similarity measure as a new feature and include it in the 2nd-tier classifier for reclassification.",
        "Now, in the reclassification stage, all 1st-tier feature stream predictions will be re-weighted by the new 2nd-tier classifier that incorporated with Multistream Feedback information.",
        "The reason why the Multistream Prediction Feedback is useful in this task is that, like many spoken language understanding tasks, in LOI detection, if we have a different set of speakers with different genders, ages, and speaker styles, the overall feature distribution for lexical, prosodic, and acoustic cues in the test set can be very different from the training set.",
        "Traditional speaker adaptation techniques typically focus only on the acoustic stream and may be very expensive to perform.",
