        "User satisfaction is one of the primary evaluation measures for task-oriented spoken dialogue systems (SDS): the goal of an SDS is to accomplish the task, and to keep the user satisfied, so that they will want to continue using the system.",
        "Typically, the PARADISE methodology (Walker et al., 2000) is used to establish a performance function which relates user satisfaction measured through questionnaires to interaction parameters that can be derived from system logs.",
        "This function can then be used to better understand which properties of the interaction have the most impact on the users, and to compare different system versions.",
        "In contrast, tutorial dialogue systems are typically evaluated in terms of student learning gain, by comparing student scores on standardized tests before and after interacting with the system.",
        "This is clearly an important evaluation metric, since it directly assesses the benefit students obtain from using the system.",
        "However, it is also important to evaluate user satisfaction, since it can influence students' willingness to use computer tutors in a long run.",
        "Thus, recent studies have looked at factors that could influence user satisfaction in tutorial dialogue, such as different tutoring policies (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011), quality of speech output (Forbes-Riley et al., 2006), and students' prior attitudes towards technology (Jackson et al., 2009).",
        "Assessing user satisfaction, however, is not a straightforward task.",
        "As we discuss in more detail in Section 2, user satisfaction is known to be a complex multidimensional construct, composed of largely independent factors such as perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness.",
        "Therefore, questionnaires used for assessing satisfaction need to be validated through user studies, and different satisfaction dimensions should be assessed independently.",
        "Therefore, SDS researchers are now starting to use techniques from psychometrics for this purpose (Hone and Graham, 2000; Moller et al., 2007).",
        "However, user satisfaction studies tutorial dialogue currently rely on simple questionnaires adapted from either task-oriented SDS or non-dialogue intelligent tutoring systems (Michael et al., 2003; Forbes-Riley et al., 2006; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011; Jackson et al., 2009), and these questionnaires have not been validated for tutorial dialogue systems.",
        "In this paper, we make the first step towards developing a better user satisfaction questionnaire for tutorial dialogue systems.",
        "We present a user satisfaction evaluation of the Beetle II tutorial dialogue system.",
        "Starting with a detailed user satisfaction questionnaire, we employ exploratory factor analysis to discover a set of dimensions for the students' satisfaction with a dialogue-based tutor.",
        "We then use the factors we derived to compare user satisfaction between two versions of our computer tutor that use different policies for generating the tutor's feedback.",
        "We investigate the relationships between the subjective satisfaction dimensions and the objective learning gain metric for the two systems.",
        "Finally, we carry out a more detailed investigation of our prior results on the relationship between user satisfaction and interpretation quality in tutorial dialogue.",
        "Our analysis also provides insights for further improving the questionnaire we developed and gives an example of how user satisfaction metrics developed for task-oriented dialogue can be adapted to different dialogue applications.",
        "It also opens new questions about how different properties of the interaction affect user satisfaction in tutorial dialogue, which can be investigated in future work.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We discuss the approaches for assessing user satisfaction with SDS in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the Beetle II tutorial dialogue system used in this evaluation.",
        "We describe our questionnaire design in Section 4, and describe its use in Beetle II evaluation in Section 5.",
        "We conclude by discussing the implication of our analysis for tutorial dialogue system evaluation in Section 6."

        "A typical approach to assessing user satisfaction in dialogue systems is collecting user survey data by asking users to rate their agreement with statements such as \"the system was easy to use\".",
        "In the simplest case of early PARADISE studies, the questionnaires contained 5 items assessing different dimensions of satisfaction, which were then summed to produce a total satisfaction score.",
        "However, using simple questionnaires has drawbacks now recognized by the SDS community.",
        "First, if individual questions are expected to assess different dimensions of user satisfaction, they need to be validated first, or else they may be ambiguous and mean different things to different users.",
        "Second, summing or averaging over questions measuring different satisfaction components may not be the best approach, since it may conflate unrelated judgments (Hone and Graham, 2000).",
        "To address this problem, SDS researchers have started using more complex questionnaires, where each underlying dimension of user satisfaction is assessed through multiple questions.",
        "Factor analysis is then used to determine which questions are related to one another (and therefore are likely to be assessing the same underlying satisfaction dimension), and to discard possibly ambiguous questions.",
        "Then, the PARADISE methodology can be used to relate different interaction parameters to individual components of user satisfaction.",
        "Several such studies have been conducted recently (Hone and Graham, 2000; Larsen, 2003; Moller et al., 2007; Wolters et al., 2009), covering command-and-control and information-seeking dialogue.",
        "The questionnaires in those studies contained 25 to 50 items, and factor analyses typically resulted in 6 or 7-factor solutions, with dimensions such as acceptability, affect, system response accuracy and cognitive demand.",
        "The underlying factors found by those analyses tend to match up well, but not to overlap perfectly.",
        "In comparison, all user satisfaction questionnaires for tutorial dialogue systems that we are aware of contain 10-15 items which are either summed up for PARADISE studies, or compared individually to track system improvement (Michael et al., 2003; Forbes-Riley et al., 2006; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011; Jackson et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we apply the more sophisticated SDS evaluation methodology to the Beetle II tutorial dialogue system.",
        "We devise a more sophisticated user satisfaction questionnaire using SDS questionnaires for guidance and then apply factor analysis to investigate the underlying dimensions.",
        "We compare our results to analyses from two previous studies: SASSI (Hone and Graham, 2000), which is a validated questionnaire intended for use with a variety of task-oriented dialogue systems, and a more recent \"modified SASSI\" questionnaire which is a version of SASSI adapted for use with the INSPIRE home control system (MÃ¶ller et al., 2007).",
        "Henceforth we will refer to this as INSPIRE."

        "The goal of Beetle II (Dzikovska et al., 2010c) is to teach students conceptual knowledge in the domain of basic electricity and electronics.",
        "The system is built on the premise that encouraging students to explain their answers and to talk about the domain will lead to improved learning, a finding consistent with analyses of human-human tutoring in several domains (Purandare and Litman, 2008; Litman et al., 2009).",
        "Beetle II has been engineered to test this hypothesis by eliciting contentful talk through explanation questions.",
        "The BEETLE II learning material consists of two self-contained lessons suitable for college-level students with no prior knowledge of basic electricity and electronics.",
        "The lessons take 4 to 5 hours to complete, and consist of reading materials and interactive exercises.",
        "During the exercises, the students interact with a circuit simulator, building electrical circuits containing bulbs, batteries and switches, and using a multimeter to measure voltage.",
        "Then the tutor asks students to explain circuit behavior, for example, \"Why was bulb A on when switch Y was open and switch Z was closed?\"",
        "In addition, at different points in the lesson the tutor asks \"summary\" questions, asking students to define concepts such as voltage, and verbalize general patterns such as \"What are the conditions that are required for a bulb to light?\".",
        "At present, students use a typed chat interface to communicate with the system.",
        "We built and evaluated two versions of the system (Dzikovska et al., 2010a).",
        "The baseline non-adaptive tutor (BASE) requires students to produce answers, but does not provide any remediation and immediately states the correct answer.",
        "The fully adaptive version (FULL) engages in dialogue with the student, and tailors its feedback to the student's answer by confirming its correct parts and giving hints in order to help students fix missing or incorrect parts.",
        "The FULL system generates feedback automatically based on a detailed analysis of the student's input, and is capable of giving hints at different levels of specificity depending on the student's previous performance.",
        "These two system versions were designed to evaluate the impact of adaptive feedback (within the limitations of current language interpretation technology) on student learning and satisfaction.",
        "Our initial data analysis focused on the differences in student language depending on the condition (Dzikovska et al., 2010a), and on the impact of different types of interpretation errors on learning gain and user satisfaction (Dzikovska et al., 2010b).",
        "However, these initial results were based on an aggregate satisfaction score obtained by averaging over scores for all questions in our user satisfaction questionnaire.",
        "In this analysis, we take a more detailed look at the different factors that contribute to students satisfaction with the system, and their relationship with learning gain and interpretation quality."

        "To support user satisfaction evaluation we developed a satisfaction questionnaire, REVU-IT (Report on the Enjoyment, Value, and Usability of an Intelligent Tutor).",
        "It consists of 63 items which cover all aspects of interaction with the tutoring system: the clarity and usefulness of the reading material; the graphical user interface to the circuit simulator; interaction with the dialogue tutor; and the overall impression of the Beetle II system as a whole.",
        "The reading material, graphical user interface and interaction with the tutor sections are complementary, because they cover separate parts of the Beetle II interface.",
        "We expect that all of these three components contribute to the overall impression score.",
        "For purposes of this paper, we will focus on the part of the questionnaire that relates to the natural language interaction with the tutor (REVU-NL), and its relationship to the overall impression score (REVU-OVERALL).",
        "The REVU-IT questionnaire was developed by experienced cognitive psychologists (two of the authors of this paper).",
        "The REVU-NL section consists of 35 items shown in Appendix A.",
        "Its design was guided by questionnaires used in previous research, including INSPIRE and a questionnaire used to evaluate the ITSPOKE tutorial dialogue system (Forbes-Riley et al., 2006).",
        "REVU-NL contains a number of items from these, but omits items that are not relevant to the Beetle II domain (e.g, \"Domestic devices can be operated efficiently with the system\" or \"The tutor responded effectively after I was uncertain\"), and adds extra questions related to tutoring (e.g., \"Our dialogues quickly led to me having a deeper understanding of the material\"), based on the authors' previous experience in human factors research.",
        "We also slightly rephrased all questions to refer to \"the tutor\" rather than \"the system\".",
        "The REVU-OVERALL section of REVU-IT consists of 5 items assessing the student's satisfaction with their learning as a whole.",
        "The questions are: \"Overall, I am satisfied with my experience learning about electricity from this system.",
        "\"; \"Working in this learning environment was just like working one-on-one with a human tutor\"; \"I would have preferred to learn about electricity in a different way.",
        "\"; \"I would use this system again in the future to continue to learn about electricity.",
        "\"; \"I would like to be able to use a system like this to learn about other topics in the future.\".",
        "We use the averaged score over these 5 items to represent the student's overall satisfaction with the learning environment, referring to it as \"overall satisfaction\".",
        "Adding new questions to the REVU-NL questionnaire on top of already existing questions is the initial step in addressing the issues discussed in Section 2: validating the individual questions and discovering the underlying dimensions of user satisfaction.",
        "Having a large number of questions asking about the same aspects of the interaction will allow us to group related questions together into dimensions (\"factors\"), and also to discover ambiguous questions that will need to be improved in future studies.",
        "The detailed discussion of the technique and issues involved is presented in Hone and Graham (2000).",
        "We used REVU-IT as part of a controlled experiment comparing the base and full versions of the system.",
        "We recruited 87 participants from a university in the Southern US, paid for participation.",
        "Participants had little knowledge of the domain.",
        "Each participant signed consent forms and completed a pre-test, then worked through both lessons (with breaks), and then completed a post-test and a REVU-IT questionnaire.",
        "Each session lasted 3.5 hours on average.",
        "Out of 87 participants that completed the study, 13 had an inordinate amount of trouble with interface: they typed utterances that could not be interpreted by the tutor (defined as having more than 3 standard deviations in interpretation errors compared to the rest), did not follow tutor's instructions or experienced system crashes.",
        "In addition, two participants were learning gain outliers (again, more than 3 standard deviations from average).",

        "For a few items, however, the polarity was reversed (e.g., \"The tutor was not helpful\").",
        "Those items were reverse-coded, with 1 meaning \"fully agree\" and 5 \"completely disagree\", to ensure that a lower score on all questions corresponds to a negative assessment.",
        "Following Hone and Graham (2000), we used exploratory factor analysis to group questionnaire items into clusters representing different dimensions.",
        "One of the standard approaches in determining how many factors (\"question clusters\") to use is the scree test which checks the number of eigenvalues in the question covariance matrix which are greater than 1.",

        "We removed them from our solution, and discuss the implications for survey design in Section 6.",
        "The first component in our analysis lines up well with the Transparency and Cognitive load factors from INSPIRE, and Response accuracy, Cognitive demand and Habitability from SASSI, though it was not split into individual factors as in those analyses.",
        "We will refer to this factor as Transparency.",
        "The second component contains questions specific to tutoring.",

        "In this study, we attempted to apply insights from studies of user satisfaction in spoken dialogue systems to a different type of dialogue application: tutorial dialogue.",
        "We were looking to develop a better user satisfaction questionnaire for evaluating tutorial dialogue systems, and to implement an evaluation methodology which takes into account different underlying dimensions of user satisfaction.",
        "The three dimensions we obtained based on exploratory factor analysis of REVU-NL align well with the dimensions reported in the SDS literature, which provides some evidence of their validity.",
        "However, the results are preliminary because of the small number of participants involved, and need to be replicated with additional participants and different tutoring systems.",
        "Regardless, our analysis highlighted important issues in designing satisfaction surveys for different dialogue genres.",
        "When choosing which questions to include in a satisfaction questionnaire for a new system type, SASSI is a very attractive starting point, because it was validated across multiple SDS in two genres (command and control and information seeking).",
        "This also means that SASSI items are phrased very generally and therefore easier to adapt.",
        "In contrast, INSPIRE contains a number of questions specific to the command and control domain, asking whether the user thinks the system is useful in achieving their goals (i.e., operating the domestic devices).",
        "SASSI includes only one similar item, \"The system was useful\".",
        "It was classed as Affect, most likely because there were no other similar items.",
        "However, we think that such questions represent an important separate dimension, namely the \"perceived usefulness\" factor known to predict technology acceptance (Adams et al., 1989).",
        "Therefore we included several items in REVU-NL with similar intent, asking whether users thought the system was beneficial to their goal (i.e., learning the material).",
        "These items were clustered into a separate dimension by factor analysis, indicating that they should be included in other satisfaction surveys.",
        "Moreover, some of the questions that appeared genre-independent to us proved to be cross-loading in our analysis, which is an indicator of ambiguity.",
        "Apparently, some of the items from task-oriented dialogue questionnaires did not transfer well.",
        "For example, statements like \"The system didn't always do what I expected\" are unambiguous for task-oriented dialogue, where the user is supposed to be in control of the interaction, and therefore has clear expectations of what the system should do.",
        "In contrast, in tutorial dialogue the tutor has control over the learning material.",
        "Thus, it may be more ambiguous as to what, if anything, students are expecting from the interaction.",
        "Overall, our experience shows that it may not be possible, or indeed useful, to create completely generic surveys.",
        "However, we believe that questionnaires can be phrased generally enough to apply to a range of systems with similar goals, and REVU-NL in particular is useful starting point for comparing dialogue-based tutoring systems.",
        "We believe that the 18 questions that we retained as unambiguous in our analysis provide adequate assessment of user satisfaction, and are grouped into factors consistent with results of previous research.",
        "However, the questionnaire could be further improved by revisiting the cross-loading items we rejected as ambiguous, and seeing if their wording could be improved.",
        "We are also intending to use REVU-IT in evaluating a spoken version of Beetle II, thus providing additional validation data on a different version of the interface.",
        "With respect to evaluation methodology, our results highlight the need to look at different satisfaction dimensions separately.",
        "We used our factors to further investigate a pattern that we discovered in previous research, namely, that students who speak in a way that is difficult for the system to interpret tend to be less satisfied with the tutor, even when they are not told of the interpretation problems.",
        "Looking at correlations with individual dimensions shows that this relationship is primarily explained by the Affect dimension.",
        "Our working hypothesis is that the lack of alignment between incorrect student answers and the answers supplied by the system caused students to perceive the system as a less likeable or cooperative conversational partner.",

        "We also observed that Acceptability, but no other dimensions, were correlated with learning gain in full.",
        "One possible explanation is that students who are learning more believe that the system is helping them reach their goals (our definition of Acceptability).",
        "The full condition provides students with more explicit feedback as to their learning; whereas in base students may have a less accurate estimate of how well they are doing, and hence no satisfaction dimensions are correlated with learning gain.",
        "It is worth noting that an earlier study investigating the relationship between user satisfaction and learning in two different tutorial dialogue systems (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2009) found little correlation between the answers to individual questions on their satisfaction questionnaire and learning gain.",
        "Only one correlation, with the question \"The tutor helped me to concentrate\", reached significance in only one of the 4 conditions they investigated.",
        "This adds further evidence that the relationship between learning gain and satisfaction is not straightforward.",
        "However, our results are difficult to compare since the questionnaires used are different, and Forbes-Riley and Litman (2009) are studying correlations with individual questions rather than grouping related questions together.",
        "Developing better validated questionnaires will make such results easier to compare and interpret, and we believe that REVU-NL makes a significant step in that direction."

        "In this paper, we proposed an improved questionnaire (REVU-NL) for evaluating user satisfaction in tutorial dialogue systems, which is an important evaluation metric alongside learning gain.",
        "We used the methodology from SDS evaluations to investigate different dimensions of user satisfaction, and their relationship to learning gain and different interaction properties.",
