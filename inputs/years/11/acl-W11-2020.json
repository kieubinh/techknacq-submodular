        "For years, the research community has been trying to model quality of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) with statistical approaches.",
        "Most vividly discussed has been the PARADISE approach which tries to map objective performance metrics of an SDS to subjective user ratings (Walker et al., 2000).",
        "The paradigm assumes that task success and dialogue costs contribute to user satisfaction which is the target variable in the model.",
        "By that, an automatic evaluation of an SDS should be enabled.",
        "While the intention of PARADISE is to evaluate and compare SDS or different system versions among each other, it is not suited to evaluate a spoken dialogue at arbitrary points during an interaction.",
        "Such a model can be helpful for a number of reasons: Firstly, it allows for a prediction of critical dialogue situations.",
        "These predictions could be employed to adapt the dialogue strategy or - in telephone applications with human assistance - escalate to human operators.",
        "Secondly, it could help to uncover potentially weak dialogue design and point out problematic turns that need a re-design.",
        "Thirdly, user satisfaction models help understand the satisfaction of the users.",
        "In this study we present such a statistical model that is trained with a large set of domain-independent features taken from system logs and use additional manually created features, such as emotional state and dialogue acts, to create an upper baseline.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present related work and discuss afterwards in Section 3 further issues that need to be addressed in this field.",
        "There, we also disambiguate the term user satisfaction from Interaction Quality.",
        "After that, we describe the annotation scheme as well as the rating process for modeling IQ and present, how we derive a generic label from the different raters' opinions in Section 4.",
        "The input feature groups along with their features are presented in Section 5.",
        "We anticipate that the problem is best modeled with Support Vector Machines (SVM), which is addressed in Section 6.",
        "Ensuing, the performance of the model is evaluated.",
        "In the first place, we analyze the impact of different feature groups on the SVM classifier in Section 7 and secondly, we optimize the model and determine the most relevant features for predicting the IQ score in Section 8.",
        "A linear modeling approach of IQ by use of multivariate linear regression will be presented and discussed in Section 9 to obtain comparability with PARADISE.",
        "This study closes with a conclusion and a discussion in Section 10."

        "Models predicting user satisfaction at any point in an SDS have only been deficiently explored to date.",
        "(Engelbrecht et al., 2009) modeled user satisfaction as process evolving over time with Hidden Markov Models (HMM).",
        "In the experiment, users were asked to interact with a Wizard-of-Oz restaurant information system.",
        "Each participant followed dialogues which have previously been defined following predefined scripts, i.e. specific scenarios.",
        "This resulted in equally long dialogue transcripts for each scenario.",
        "The users were constrained to rate their satisfaction on a 5-point scale with \"bad\", \"poor\", \"fair\", \"good\" and \"excellent\" after each dialogue step.",
        "The interaction was halted while the user voted.",
        "In a similar spirit, (Higashinaka et al., 2010a) developed a model for predicting turn-wise ratings, which was evaluated on human-machine and human-human dialogues.",
        "The data employed was not spoken dialogue but text dialogues from a chat system and a transcribed conversation between humans.",
        "The labels in the model originated from two expert raters that listened to the recorded interactions and provided turn-wise scores from 1-7 on smoothness (\"Smoothness of the conversation\"), closeness (\"Closeness perceived by the user towards the system\") and willingness (\"Willingness to continue the conversation\").",
        "Rater-independent performance scores of the model reached about 0.2-0.24 unweighted average recall, which is about 0.1 points above the baseline of app.",
        "0.14.",
        "(Hara et al., 2010) created n-gram models from dialogue acts (DA) to predict user satisfaction based on dialogues from real users interacting with a music retrieval system.",
        "The model is based on overall ratings from the users measuring their satisfaction on a five point scale after the interaction.",
        "The best result could be achieved with a 3-gram model that reached 34% accuracy in distinguishing between six classes at any point in the dialogue.",
        "It seems that the prediction of turn-level user satisfaction scores given only one overall dialogue-level score seems hardly possible and is close to random: The prediction of the five user satisfaction classes reach an average F-score as low as 0.252, which is only 0.052 score points above the baseline of 0.20.",
        "A similar result as (Hara et al., 2010) was obtained by (Higashinaka et al., 2010b).",
        "Using HMMs they derived turn-level ratings from dialogue-wide ratings.",
        "The model's performance when trained on dialogue-level ratings was closer to random than when trained on turn-level ratings.",

      "heading": "3. Issues",
      "text": [
        "Our aim is to create a general model that may be used to predict the quality of the interaction - or ideally the actual satisfaction of the user - at arbitrary system-user exchanges in an SDS.",
        "It has become obvious from the cited work that current models are not suited for deployment due to low prediction accuracy.",
        "Crucial for a successful recognition of user satisfaction is the choice and appropriateness of the input variables.",
        "(Higashinaka et al., 2010a), (Higashinaka et al., 2010b) and (Hara et al., 2010) employ a - mostly hand annotated - \"dialogue act\" feature to predict the target variable.",
        "Dialogue acts are frequently highly system-dependent and do not model the full bandwidth of the interaction.",
        "(Engelbrecht et al., 2009) additionally employed contextual appropriateness, confirmation strategy and task success, of which many require hand annotation.",
        "Yet it is mandatory for an automatic prediction of user satisfaction to design and derive completely automatic features that do not require manual intervention.",
        "It is further easy to comprehend that the modeling of user satisfaction in ongoing dialogues starts with a dilemma: tracking user satisfaction from real users in real environments performing real tasks is virtually impracticable.",
        "Consequently data for deriving models can either be obtained under laboratory conditions with real users performing fake tasks in an artificial environment, cf. (Engelbrecht et al., 2009), or by manual annotation of real-life data from experts that pretend to be the users.",
        "It is thus vital for modeling \"user satisfaction\" to understand the term itself.",
        "In the literature there exists no rigorous definition, however, it seems obvious that it is the user himself who determines the satisfaction - and not expert annotators.",
        "According to (Doll and Torkzadeh, 1991) \"user satisfaction\" is the opinion of users about a specific computer application, which they use.",
        "Other terms for \"user satisfaction\" are common, such as \"user information satisfaction\", which is defined as \"the extent to which users believe the information system available to them meets their information requirements\" (Ives et al., 1983).",
        "User satisfaction and usability are closely interwoven.",
        "(ISO, 1998) subsumes under the definition \"usability\" a compound of efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction.",
        "Yet satisfaction is often seen as a by-product of great usability in HCI literature (Lindgaard and Dudek, 2003).",
        "They could also show that user satisfaction ratings are subject to large fluctuations among different users and it can be further assumed that those fluctuations do also occur within a single dialogue of a user.",
        "As a result, general prediction models that mirror a universal, unbiased understanding of satisfaction can presumably hardly be derived from user's impressions.",
        "Large influence of subjectivity - and also randomness in assigning the scores - would prevent such a general model.",
        "Consequently, it seems unavoidable to employ expert annotations.",
        "In the proper meaning of the word, the scores then do not exactly mirror the subjective impression of users but the more objective impression of expert raters.",
        "Thus we decide against the use of the term user satisfaction in the course of this work in contrast to (Higashinaka et al., 2010a) and instead opt for the expression Interaction Quality.",
        "It can be assumed that basic attitudes towards dialogue systems in general, opinions about the TTS voice, environmental factors etc.",
        "that would typically influence user satisfaction scores, and which are not of interest for our prediction, are not dominant in expert satisfaction scores in a series of annotated dialogues.",
        "Experts are expected to fade out such system-dependent and environment-dependent influences and instead focus on the dialogue behavior (i.e. the Interaction Quality) only.",
        "As a result, two key issues are addressed in this work: First of all, the input feature set has to be designed as a generic, domain-independent set that can be derived from any spoken dialogue system log and that takes into account a maximum of available information about the interaction.",
        "Secondly, the target variable, i.e. the IQ score, needs to be determined in a guided rating process in order to be reproducible in future work and has to be empirically derived from several expert annotators that provide scores for each single system-user turn of an interaction."

        "Every dialogue is initially rated with a score of 5 since every interaction at the beginning can be considered as good until the opposite eventuates.",
        "Our model assumes that users are initially interacting with an SDS without bias, i.e. the basic attitude towards a dialogue system is positive.",
        "Other assumptions would not be statistically predictable.",
        "An example dialogue is depicted in Table 5 along with the ratings (cf.",
        "Figure 2 in the Appendix).",
        "(Higashinaka et al., 2010b) and (Higashinaka et al., 2010a) report low correlation among the ratings (Spearman's p 0.04-0.32), which motivated us to develop a set of basic guidelines that should be used by the raters (cf. Table 6 in the Appendix).",
        "The guidelines have been designed in such a way that the raters still have sufficient level of freedom when choosing the labels but preventing them from too strong variations among the neighboring system-user exchanges.",
        "The distribution of the labels provided by the single raters is depicted in Figure 3.",
        "As expected, the distribution is skew towards label \"5\" since every dialogue initially is assumed to have a good IQ.",
        "The inter-rater agreement shows that Interaction Quality is still a subjective metric, although guidelines seem to synchronize the labels to a certain extent.",
        "The overall mean agreement can be reported with Cohen's k = 0.31 and the correlation among the raters can be reported with Spearman's p = 0.72 which depicts a by 0.4 points higher correlation as reported by (Higashinaka et al., 2010a).",
        "Since we aim to model a general opinion on Interaction Quality, i.e. the model should mirror the IQ score other raters - and in the last instance users - agree with, we determine the final label empirically.",
        "A majority voting for the distinction of the final label cannot be used since in 21% of the exchanges all three raters opted for different scores.",
        "Thus we consider the mean of all rater opinions as possible candidates for the final class label:",
        "where IQ is the Interaction Quality score provided by rater r. LyJ denotes the biggest integer value smaller than y.",
        "Every value IQr contributes equally to the result that is finally rounded half up to an integer value.",

        "The compliance of the single user ratings with the final label (calculated on mean and median) is depicted in Table 1.",
        "As can be seen, the agreement of the three raters with the median label is significantly higher than with the mean label.",
        "Consequently the median label represents the most objective measurement of Interaction Quality and commends itself for creating the model."

        "In this work we have developed a statistical model that predicts Interaction Quality, an objective measure of user satisfaction, at arbitrary points in an SDS.",
        "The model targets on predicting critical situations on exchange level in ongoing dialogues.",
        "The classifier, an SVM, reaches a performance of 61.6% MR/R (k = 0.563, p = 0.786) by use of an optimized feature set that can be automatically derived during the interaction.",
        "It could be further shown that linear modeling with multivariate linear regression is not appropriate for predicting IQ and reaches merely 45.5.% MR/R.",
        "Among all five feature groups comprising altogether 52 features, the ASR and DM groups contribute the most, while the Emotional State underperforms.",
        "We could further show that features requiring manual annotation, such as dialogue acts, do not signiicantly improve the model's performance.",
        "The model has been evaluated with 200 dialogues from the cMu Let's Go corpus comprising 4885 system-user exchanges where three annotators labeled the Interaction Quality on a score from 1-5.",
        "We could show that the median of all three opinions depicts the most generic view on the IQ and is thus chosen as inal score for the model.",
        "Some issues have to be addressed in future work: In the current study we assume that Interaction Quality is an objective metric for determining the satisfaction of users during the interaction.",
        "How far this assumption is justiied has to be empirically proven in a laboratory study with real users.",
        "A corresponding study is in preparation and the results will be published in a follow-up work.",
        "Although the model's performance can be considered as satisfying, the direct deployment in dialogue systems cannot be recommended at this stage.",
        "For enabling a dialogue system to react on poor interaction quality, a correct prediction of the low IQ scores 1,2 and 3 is urgent, i.e. the classiier has to be optimized to deliver a very high precision on such low scores rather than towards a high general MR/R value.",
        "We assume that the performance can be further driven up by extending the feature space to the last n exchanges, which would take into account a larger dialogue history for the decision (cf. (Schmitt et al., 2010b)).",
        "The presented model can principally be trained on data from any dialogue system; however, we did not yet deliver the proof that the present model trained on Let's Go data is general enough for cross-domain and cross-system application without significant performance loss.",
        "Due to the general character of the ten most relevant features (cf. Table 3), portability can at least be assumed - without the need for domain-dependent and system-dependent re-training."

        "Due to system design, the latter is not always present.",
        "The IQ score is defined on a 5-point scale with \"1=bad\", \"2=poor\", \"3=fair\", \"4=good\" and \"5=excellent\".",
        "The Interaction Quality is to be rated for each exchange in the dialogue.",
        "The history of the dialogue should be kept in mind when assigning the score.",
        "For example, a dialogue that has proceeded fairly poor for a long time, should require some time to recover.",

        "The first user input should also be rated with 5, since until this moment, no rateable interaction has taken place.",
        "A request for help does not invariably cause a lower Interaction Quality, but can result in it.",
        "In general, the score from one exchange to the following exchange is increased or decreased by one point at the most.",
        "Exceptions, where the score can be decreased by two points are e.g. hot anger or sudden frustration.",
        "The rater's perception is decisive here.",

        "The rater should try to figure out whether anger was caused by the dialogue behavior or not.",
        "In the case a user realizes that he should adapt his dialogue strategy to obtain the desired result or information and succeeded that way, the Interaction Quality score can be raised up to two points per turn.",
        "In other words, the user realizes that he caused the poor Interaction Quality by himself.",
        "If the system does not reply with a bus schedule to a specific user query and prompts that the request is out of scope, this can nevertheless be considered as \"task completed\".",
        "Therefore this does not need to affect the Interaction Quality.",
        "If a dialogue consists of several independent queries, each query's quality is to be rated independently.",
        "The former dialogue history should not be considered when a new query begins.",
        "However, the score provided for the first exchange should be equal to the last label of the previous query.",
        "If a dialogue proceeds fairly poor for a long time, the rater should consider to increase the score more slowly if the dialogue starts to recover.",
        "Also, in general, he should observe the remaining dialogue more critical.",
        "If a constantly low-quality dialogue finishes with a reasonable result, the Interaction Quality can be increased."
