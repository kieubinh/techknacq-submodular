        "One of the largest growth areas in communication is the Short Message Service (SMS) or text messaging, as it is more popularly known.",
        "SMS grew out of what was initially a by-product of the mobile phone industry (Agar, 2003; Goggin, 2006).",
        "In fact, by 2009 text messaging has become the most frequently used communication means among teens in the US, supported by the mobile phone industry offering unlimited texting plans (Lenhart et.",
        "al., 2010).",
        "For many reasons, voice enabled texting has become a desirable alternative in a variety of mobile scenarios.",
        "The number of speech applications for mobile phones including texting by voice is constantly growing.",
        "However, the challenges for SMS dictation by voice are multifold, from particular noise conditions, to the use of vocabulary and domain specific language, the dialogical nature of text messaging (Thurlow and Poff, 2009), and to error correction of imperfect recognition results.",
        "Achieving a high and robust performance is crucial for the success of the application.",
        "For this purpose additional contextual factors can be integrated into the recognition process.",
        "One possible factor, the conversed topic, has influence on the speaker's choice of words.",
        "Hence, it is an important contextual factor for the prediction of the speaker's wording, since it originates in the speaker's mental concepts during a dialog situation, which is the nature of texting.",
        "To date, research on text messaging has primarily examined sociolinguistic phenomena (e.g., Thurlow, 2003).",
        "With respect to language and communication, text messaging is still an under-examined research area.",
        "Thurlow and Poff (2009) provide a comprehensive overview of existing literature about SMS in linguistics.",
        "Moreover, there exists noteworthy work on SMS text normalization (Aw et.",
        "al., 2006; Fairon and Paumier, 2006; Cook and Stevenson, 2009; Kobus et.",
        "al., 2008; Pennell and Liu, 2010), for instance for the purpose of Machine Translation, Text-to-Speech engines or spell checking, work on SMS based question answering services (Kothari, 2009), and work on predefined SMS replies in automobiles (Wu et.",

        "However, conversed topics in the context of SMS discourse have not been examined in the literature, neither in linguistics nor for any Natural Language Processing applications.",

        "SMS data was collected from 250 participants who conversed with another 900.",
        "Participants were distributed almost evenly across gender, two age groups, and four US regions.",
        "Participants under 30 years comprised 48% of the dataset, and participants over 30 years comprised 52% of the dataset.",
        "Within each of these two age groups, there were equal number of men and women.",
        "The demographic spread contained datasets from participants from the various regions in the USA: east coast 19%, west coast 24%, central 29%, and south 28%.",
        "The corpus dataset contains a total number of more than 51,000 messages, chosen randomly from a significantly larger set of data, for which participants provided authentic SMS conversations from their mobile phones to online SMS backup services.",
        "Besides demographic constraints, all text messages are part of SMS conversations, each composed at least by one message and a textual response, to preserve a contextual authentic situation.",
        "A conversation is considered to be ended if a time frame of 4 hours elapses without a response.",
        "The average length of SMS conversations in the corpus is between 8-9 messages, distributed over a notably higher number of shorter conversions than longer dialogs.",
        "Altogether the corpus contains more than 5800 conversations.",
        "Personal information of the SMS conversations was removed.",
        "Nonetheless the corpus itself is currently not published, because identifying information can be indirectly present in SMS dialogs.",
        "The SMS corpus is semi-automatically normalized following a general guideline to transform each texted message into one which could be dictated by the user.",
        "For all following research the normalized rather than the raw SMS textual utterances are used.",
        "A key point for usefulness of an annotated corpus is the abstraction which maps SMS conversations present in the corpus to an abstract model serving the research goals (Wallis and Nelson, 2001; Mc Enery et.",
        "al., 2006).",
        "In our research, the corpus shall be used to explore to what extent the knowledge of one or more discussed topics, for which both SMS dialog partners try to make progress, can contribute to the performance of a speech recognition engine, where we expect the engine to be based on Statistical Language Models (SLM).",
        "Consequently, the annotation needs to enable us to trace a path from discussed topics to the choice of words and phrases in SMS conversations.",
        "This abstraction leads to our definition of the term topic and to guidelines for the annotation which are identified to be essential, when incorporating topics into speech recognition.",
        "Other than an agreement on \"what is being talked about\", the definition of topic in linguistics is a matter of viewpoint and dispute (Levinson,",
        "Molnâr, 1993; Stutterheim, 1997).",
        "Moreover, a literature review has not revealed existing topic annotations which can be used for our purpose (Mc Enery et.",
        "al., 2006; Meyer, 2002).",
        "Since the intention is to build a task driven, problem oriented annotation scheme we further specify a discourse topic as observable content or story line which discourse partners follow up in an SMS conversation.",
        "Hence, we understand a topic foremost as an attribute of an SMS dialog rather than of a single SMS, or of a phrase within the dialog.",
        "We assign at least one topic to each dialog.",
        "Since dialogs can in fact contain several distinct topics, we assign all explicitly mentioned topics to a conversation and mark separately all SMS which belong doubtlessly to each topic in the context of the conversation,",

        "Ok sounds good.",
        "Figure 1 : Example of SMS dialog about \"meeting arrangement\".",
        "Discourse topics are highly domain dependent in their nature and may differ from the SMS domain to other domains, even to computer mediated communication services, like e-mail, Twitter, or Instant Messaging.",
        "Because of that, the list of SMS relevant topics evolves from the data itself.",
        "Additionally the list of possible topics always remains an open tag list, although one can expect recurring topics after a while with sparse extension of an existing topic list.",
        "Hence, the approach for annotating the SMS corpus must be manual.",
        "For this purpose a team of four annotators marked the conversations with the help of an annotation tool developed specifically for the topic annotation.",
        "To ensure annotator agreement a linguist verified and confirmed the growing topic list and all topic assignments in several iterations.",
        "Further annotation of a larger corpus may be semi-automated based on the achieved topic list.",
        "Assigning topics to a dialog remains intuitive to a certain extent, because any mutual understanding of the dialog's content and pragmatic meaning is supported by social cues, situation awareness and world knowledge of dialog partners (Levinson, 1983; Lambert and Carberry, 1992).",
        "These knowledge dimensions need to be reconstituted during the annotation process, when assigning a new topic.",
        "One criterion is to ask if the topic is distinct from other topics with regard to describing pieces of our world knowledge dimensions, e.g. scripts and events that people repeatedly experience, or subjects, they are recurrently dealing with.",
        "Furthermore, a task driven approach demands to determine the level of specialization and detail for topics.",
        "Even if broad topics, such as \"food\" or \"appointment\", may prove themselves to be distinct and meaningful enough for speech recognition, the annotation is done to one degree more detailed.",
        "Each topic is composed by a term and one restrictive attribute which divides a major topic into more distinctive topics.",
        "Thus \"appointment\" appears in the corpus divided into \"cancel appointment\", \"attending an appointment\", \"meeting arrangements\", and other.",
        "The advantage of the annotation procedure is twofold; it leads to a list of topics, which can be depicted in a tree structure with several levels of specialization, and, even though the annotation is targeted to a special problem, there is sufficient information to make the corpus useful for a broader range of research.",
        "Corpus Analysis for Topic Usage",
        "SMS conversations may follow up on one or more topics.",
        "Multiple topic conversations may make progress on topics even in parallel, either switching topics or addressing both within the same SMS.",
        "In general, we avoid topics which are suspected to describe the intention or strategy for the conversation rather than the content.",
        "There are a few exceptions, where the topic is implicitly or explicitly present in the dialog not only on content level but also as driving force for texting, e.g. \"maintain friendship/relationship\" or \"small talk\" (see example (2) in figure 2).",
        "The border cannot be clearly drawn in these cases.",
        "Two topic assignments require explanation.",
        "\"Small talk\" is used for a group of short SMS dialogs, for which one cannot identify a topic.",
        "One is able to understand the dialog as a short form of friendship maintenance though, where both parties achieve mutual positive feedback about their current situation, e.g. via salutation.",
        "Therefore \"small talk\" is expected to be of interest regarding word usage contrary to \"undefined topic\".",
        "The latter is assigned to all conversations, where we do not share enough knowledge about the background and situation of the texters to understand and identify the topic of the dialog (example (3) in figure 2).",

        "The second most discussed topic is \"activities & events\" (14% of all messages), such as \"going out\" (32% of \"activities & events\" labeled messages), or \"going shopping\" (15%).",
        "Interestingly, the topic of \"appointment & scheduling\" is only the third most popular, consisting of less than 13% of all text messages.",

        "Thurlow (2003) has presented a study about the communicative intent of US English text messages, describing their functional orientation rather than the content.",
        "Thurlow's findings concur in that the amount of SMS with relational and intimate orientation vs. transactional orientation is similar to the amount of SMS with interpersonal and emotional content vs. all other topic clusters.",

        "While interpersonal and emotional text messages together are present in fairly equal quantity for both gender groups, females tend to express their \"emotion\" via text messages much more frequently than males (12.5% compared to 8.5%); likely on the expense of non-emotional \"human relations\" messages (46.8% for males compared to 41.9%).",

        "After creating an annotated corpus and developing a classification method based on topic distinctive word lists, we have presented initial, promising results, which encourage further research.",
