        "Advances in robotics and autonomous systems are paving the way for the development of robots that can take on increasingly complex tasks without the need of minute human supervision.",
        "As a result of this greater autonomy, the interaction styles between humans and robots are slowly shifting from those of humans micromanaging robot behaviors (e.g., via remote controls) to more higher-level interactions (e.g., verbal commands) which are required for many mixed initiative tasks where humans and robots work together in teams (e.g., in search and rescue missions).",
        "In order for these joint human-robot interactions to be productive and efficient, robots must have the ability to communicate in natural and human-like ways (Scheutz et al., 2007).",
        "Natural human-like communication in robots, however, requires us to tackle several challenges, including the development of robust natural language (NL) competencies and the ability to understand and utilize a variety of affective, gestural, and other nonlinguistic cues that are indicative of the interlocutor's mental states.",
        "Hence, natural human-like interaction also requires the construction and maintenance of mental models of other agents, especially in the context of collaborative team tasks where actions among multiple agents must be coordinated, often through natural language dialogues.",
        "Several recent efforts are aimed at endowing robots with natural language processing capabilities to allow for verbal instructions as a first step (e.g., (Brenner, 2007; Dzifcak et al., 2009; Kress-Gazit et al., 2008; Rybski et al., 2007; Kollar et al., 2010)).",
        "Independently, user modeling has been extensively explored in order to generate more natural and productive human-machine interactions (Kobsa, 2001), including adapting the natural language output of dialogue systems based on mental models of humanusers (Wahlster and Kobsa, 1989).",
        "However, there is currently no integrated robotic architecture that includes explicit mechanisms for efficiently conveying natural language information about the robot's \"mental states\" (i.e., beliefs, goals, intentions) to a human teammate.",
        "Yet, such mechanisms are not only desirable to make the robot's behavior more intuitive and predictable to humans, but can also be crucial for team success (e.g., quick updates on goal achievement or early corrections of wrong human assumptions).",
        "We propose a novel integrated belief revision and expression algorithm that allows robots to track and update the beliefs of their interlocutors in a way that respects Gricean maxims about language usage.",
        "The algorithm explicitly models and updates task-relevant beliefs and intentions of all participating agents.",
        "Whenever a discrepancy is detected between a human belief (as implied in a natural language expression uttered by the human) and the robot's mental model of the human, the robot generates a natural language response that corrects the discrepancy in the most effective way.",
        "To achieve effectiveness, the robot uses linguistic rules about the pragmatic implications of adverbial modifiers like \"yet\", \"still\", \"already\", and others that are used by humans to effectively communicate their beliefs and intentions.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We start with a motivation of our approach based on Gricean maxims.",
        "Then, we introduce formalizations of linguistic devices that humans use to generate effective task-based dialogue interactions and present our algorithm for generating appropriate utterances in response to human queries.",
        "Next we use a simple remote human-robot interaction scenario to demonstrate the operation of the algorithm, followed by a discussion and summary of our contributions."

        "Joint activity often requires agents to monitor and keep track of each others' mental states to ensure effective team performance.",
        "For example, searchers during rescue operations in disaster zones typically coordinate their (distributed and remote) activities through spoken natural language interactions via wireless audio links to keep team members informed of discoveries and plans of other team members.",
        "Coordination as part of joint activities requires two important processes in an agent: (1) building and maintaining a mental model of the other agents' beliefs and intentions (based on perceived, communicated, and inferred information), which is critical for situational awareness (Lison et al., 2010); and (2) actively supporting the maintenance of others' mental models of oneself (e.g., by proactively communicating new information to the other agents in ways that will allow them to update their mental models).",
        "Cohen et al.",
        "(1990), for example, discuss the necessity of various communicative acts that serve to synchronize agent belief-models.",
        "These communicative acts include both linguistic and non-linguistic cues, such as utterances of confirmation (\"okay.\")",
        "or signals that indicate intention (putting on a turn-signal).",
        "In addition to utilizing explicit cues to synchronize belief-models, humans employ various other mechanisms to convey information about one's own belief-state, in particular, various linguistic devices.",
        "A simple, but very powerful linguistic mechanism is the use of adverbial cues.",
        "Consider a scenario where one agent wants to know the location of another agent, e.g., whether the agent is at home.",
        "A straightforward way to obtain this information is to simply ask \"Are you at home?\"",
        "The other agent can then answer \"yes\" or \"no\" accordingly.",
        "Now, suppose the first agent knew that the second agent was planning to be at home at some point.",
        "In that case, the agent might ask \"Are you at home yet?\"",
        "Note that semantically both questions have the same meaning, but their pragmatic implications are different as the second implies that that agent 1 knows that agent 2 was planning to be at home, while no such implication can be inferred from the first query.",
        "Conversely, suppose that agent 2 responded \"not yet\" in the first example (instead of \"no\").",
        "While the semantic meaning is the same as \"no\", \"not yet\" communicates to agent 1 that agent 2 has the goal to be home.",
        "In general, adverbs like \"yet\" can be used to convey information about one's (or somebody else's) beliefs concerning mutually-recognized goals and intentions.",
        "Not surprisingly, humans use them regularly and with ease to aid their interlocutors with maintaining an accurate model of their beliefs and goals.",
        "The challenges that need to be addressed to allow robots to have the above kinds of linguistic exchanges are: (1) how to formalize the functional roles of adverbial modifiers in different sentence types, and how to use the formalized principles to (2) perform belief updates and (3) generate effective natural language responses that are natural, succinct, and complete.",
        "To tackle these three challenges, we turn to Gricean principles that have long be used in pragmatics as guiding principles of human communicative exchanges."

        "Phrased as rules, it is unsurprising that they have been used as an inspiration for NL generation systems before.",
        "Dale and Reiter (1995) have enlisted the maxims in their design of an algorithm to generate referring expressions, while others have cited Gricean influence in utterance selection for intelligent tutor systems (Eugenio et al., 2008).",
        "The particular maxims we considered are the maxims of quality (G1), quantity (G2), and relevance (G3): (G1) requires one to not say what one believes is false or for which one lacks adequate evidence; (G2) requires one to make contributions as informative as necessary for the current purposes of the exchange, but not more informative; and (G3) tersely states \"be relevant.\"",
        "Our approach to belief-model synchronization and utterance selection is based on the above maxims and attempts to select the most appropriate response to another agent's query based on relevance of semantic content.",
        "It uses speech pragmatic meaning postulates for linguistic devices such as adverbial modifiers to search for a succinct and natural linguistic representation that captures the intended updates.",
        "Rather than explicitly communicating each and every proposition that needs to be communicated to a human to allow the person to update their mental model of the robot, the algorithm makes heavy use of \"implied meanings\", i.e., propositions that humans will infer from the way the information is phrased linguistically.",
        "This allows for much shorter messages to be communicated than otherwise possible and addresses the second maxim of quantity.",
        "We start by introducing four types of sentences as they are found in typical dialogue interactions: statements (expressed through declarative sentences), questions (expressed through interrogative sentences), commands (expressed through imperative sentences) and acknowledgments (expressed through words like \"okay\", \"yes\", \"no\", etc.).",
        "For simplicity, we restrict the discussion to one predicate at (a, A) which states that agent a is in location A.",

        "For example, Stmt(A2, Ai, – at(A2, home), yet) means that agent A2 tells Ai that it is not at home yet.",

        "If a informs ß that it is at A without any adverbial modifiers or additional contextual information, then we can assume using (G1) that a is indeed at that location:",
        "Here we use [[..]]c to denote the \"pragmatic meaning\" of an expression in context c, which includes task, goal, belief and discourse aspects.",
        "Next, we inductively define the pragmatic meanings for several adverbial modifiers \"still\", \"already\", \"now\", and \"not yet\" (the meanings of compound expressions such as at(a, Ai) A – at(a, A2) are defined recursively in the usual way).",
        "If a states that it is \"still\" at A, one can infer that a is at A and that a will not be at A at some point in the future:",

        "If a states that it is \"not...yet\" at A, one can infer that a is not at A, but has an intention to be at A.",
        "Even in our limited domain, one must be cognizant of the ambiguities that arise from how adverbial cues are deployed.",
        "In addition to the simple presence of an adverbial cue, the location of the adverb in a sentence and prosodic factors may affect the intended meaning of the utterance.",
        "For instance, consider the statements: (a) I am now at A; (b) I am at A now; (c) I am still at A; and (d) I am still at A.",
        "Statement (a) is a simple situational update utterance as described above, while (b) could be construed as a statement akin to \"I am already at A.",
        "Statement (d) could be interpreted as additionally signaling the frustration of the agent, beyond conveying the information from (c).",
        "It should also be noted that our analysis of these adverbial cues is to be understood in the limited context of these simple task-related predicates (e.g. at (a, A)).",
        "Formal definition of these adverbial cues in general cases is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "For instance, \"yet\" could be used in a context when the predicate is not intended by the agent to which it applies (e.g. \"Has Bill been fired yet?\").",
        "In this case, it would probably be incorrect to infer that the agent Bill had a goal to be fired.",
        "Instead an inference could be made regarding the probabilistic judgments of the interlocutors regarding the topic agent's future state.",
        "However, in the context of this paper, it is assumed that \"yet\" is used in the context of goals intended by agents.",
        "Here we will limit the discussion to two question types, the \"where\" question (regarding locations) and simple \"Yes-No\" questions.",

        "These belief update rules would be problematic, for instance, when agents have incorrect beliefs (and proceed to communicate them), as no method for belief disputation exists.",
        "For the purpose of illustrating the implementation and utility of adverbial cues, however, they should suffice.",
        "We set up our environment and rule sets such that the autonomous agent has perfect information about itself (specifically location), and no utterances exists to communicate propositions that are not about oneself.",
        "Depending on the sentence type a received (and the extent to which meanings can be resolved, an issue we will not address in this paper), different response sentence types are appropriate (e.g., a yes-no question requires a statement answering the question).",
        "The generation of an appropriate response proceeds in two steps.",
        "First, based on the agent's current set of beliefs Belseif, we determine the set of propositions $comm that the agent has an interest in conveying.",
        "Second, we attempt to find the smallest utterance Utt given a set of pragmatic principles (as specified in Section 3.1) that communicates one or more of these propositions and implies the rest for recipient ß.",
        "In obtaining a set $comm of propositions to communicate, a may obey the Gricean maxim of quality by adding a proposition 0 to $comm only if 0 G Belseif.",
        "The maxims of relevance and quantity are heeded by restricting believed propositions to be conveyed solely to those that either correct a false belief of ß or provide ß some piece of information it wants to know.",
        "Specifically, we find the set of all propositions used to correct false beliefs $rev, defined as:",
        "The set of all propositions other agents want to know, $/k, can be defined as:",
        "p G &JK &3ß,0 : p G Belseif A",
        "The final set of propositions to convey is obtained by merging these two sets, $comm = $rev U .",

        "Once $comm has been obtained, a must select potential utterances to produce.",
        "It starts by generating an initial set Utt0 of utterances that in the present context c imply some subset of $comm:",
        "Currently, this is achieved by searching through the set of all utterances defined by rules such as those found in Section 3.1.",
        "Note that while this approach is feasible for our quite limited domain, more efficient methods for identifying candidate utterances must be developed as the number of understood utterances grows.",
        "Applying the maxim of quality, this set can be pruned of all utterances that are defined by additional propositions that we either have no evidence for (\"unsupported\") or explicitly believe to be false:",
        "Using these conditions, we can generate a new subset of utterance candidates Utt\\:",
        "Applying the maxim of quantity, utterances that revise or add the most beliefs to other agent belief-spaces ought to be favored:",
        "Using these definitions, we can derive the \"correction-score\" of an utterance by counting the number of propositions 0 G [[u]]c that revise or add a belief for ß.",
        "If multiple candidate utterances still exist at this point, we can again apply the maxim of quantity to favor utterances that convey the most (true) information.",
        "Because all definitions with false propositions have been eliminated, we can simply count the number of true propositions derived from the utterance, thereby favoring semantically richer utterances.",
        "At this point, if multiple candidate utterances are still available, the difference is of stylistic nature only and we may choose an arbitrary one.",
        "Note that the correct usage of adverbial modifiers emerges naturally from these rules as utterances that include inappropriate adverbs are removed in Uttl, while utterances that include appropriate adverbial cues are subsequently favored."

        "Second, we showed how one can perform belief updates based on implied meanings of adverbial modifiers.",
        "And third, we introduced a novel algorithm for generating effective responses that obey three Gricean maxims and aid the listener in appropriate belief updates.",
        "The core properties of the algorithm are that it corrects false or missing beliefs in other agents, that it provides an agent with information that is wanted, that it never generates an utterance that implies false propositions, and that it first favors utterances that convey more (true) propositions after favoring utterances that revise or add more beliefs to the listener's belief-space.",
        "Finally, we demonstrated our algorithm responding to basic operator queries in a simple case study, correctly using adverbial cues to sound more natural and convey more information regarding its beliefs.",
        "There are extensive avenues to pursue future work.",
        "For instance, we plan to extend the algorithm to include multi-modal perceptual integration as well as multi-agent multi-dialogue capabilities.",
        "A variety of empirical evaluations would be desirable to evaluate the efficacy and naturalness of the proposed adverbial cues in simulated and real HRI tasks.",
        "Additionally, empirical evaluations could also be performed to observe additional cues to incorporate into the system."
