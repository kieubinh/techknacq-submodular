        "We seek to develop spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) that communicate effectively despite uncertain input.",

        "The SDS described here uses FORRSooth, a semi-synchronous architecture under development for task-oriented human-computer dialogue.",
        "Our immediate goals are to reduce non-understandings of user utterances (where the SDS produces no interpretation) and to eliminate misunderstandings (where the SDS misinterprets user utterances).",
        "The experiment recounted here investigates subdialogues consisting of an initial user response to a system prompt, and any subsequent turns that might be needed to result in full understanding of the original response.",
        "Our principal finding is that a FORRSooth-based SDS learns to build on partial understandings and to eliminate misunderstandings despite noisy ASR.",
        "A FORRSooth-based SDS is intended to interact effectively \"without the luxury of perfect components\" (Paek and Horvitz, 2000), such as high-performance ASR.",
        "FORRSooth relies on portfolios of strategies for utterance interpretation and grounding, and learns to balance them from its experience.",
        "Its confidence in its interpretations is dynamically calibrated against its past experience.",
        "At each user utterance, FORR-Sooth selects grounding actions modulated to build upon partial interpretations in subsequent exchanges with the user.",
        "The experiment presented here bootstraps the SDS with human expertise.",
        "In a Wizard of Oz (WOz) study, a person (the wizard) replaces selected SDS components.",
        "Knowledge is then extracted from the wizard's behavior to improve the SDS.",

        "Despite increasingly accurate ASR methods, dialogue systems often contend with noisy ASR, which can arise from performance phenomena such as filled pauses (er, um), false starts (fir-last name), or noisy transmission conditions.",
        "SDSs typically experience a higher WER when deployed.",
        "For example, the WER reported for Carnegie Mellon University's Let's Go Public!",
        "went from 17% under controlled conditions to 68% in the field (Raux et al., 2005).",
        "To limit communication errors, an SDS can rely on strategies to detect and recover from incorrect recognition output (Bohus, 2007).",
        "One such strategy, to ask the user to repeat a poorly understood utterance, can result in hyperarticulation and decreased recognition (Litman, Hirschberg and Swerts, 2006).",
        "Prior work has shown that users prefer explicit confirmation over dialogue efficiency (fewer turns) (Litman and Pan, 1999).",
        "We hypothesize that this results from an inherent tradeoff between efficiency and user confidence.",
        "We assume that evidence of partial understanding increases user confidence more than evidence of non-understanding does.",
        "FORRSooth learns to ask more questions that build on partial information, and to make fewer explicit confirmations and requests to the user to repeat herself.",
        "While many techniques exist in the literature for semantic interpretation in task-oriented, information-seeking dialogue systems, there is no single preferred approach.",
        "SDSs rarely combine a portfolio of NLU (natural language understanding) resources.",
        "FORRSooth relies on \"multiple processes for interpreting utterances (e.g., structured parsing versus statistical techniques)\" as in (Lemon, 2003).",
        "These range from voice search (querying a database directly with ASR results) to semantic parsing.",
        "Dialogue systems should ground their understanding of the user's objectives.",
        "To limit communication errors, an SDS can rely on strategies to detect and recover from incorrect recognition output (Bohus, 2007).",
        "In others' work, the grounding status of an utterance is typically binary (i.e., understood or not) (Allen, Ferguson and Stent, 2001; Bohus and Rudnicky, grounding decisions rely on a mixture of strategies, are based on degrees of evidence (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2009; Roque and Traum, 2009), and disambiguate among candidate interpretations.",

        "FORRSooth's approach differs from supervised confidence annotation methods that learn a fixed confidence threshold from a corpus of human-machine dialogues (Bohus, 2007).",
        "The role of Grounding is to monitor the system's confidence in its interpretation of each user utterance, to provide evidence to the user of its interpretation, and to elicit corroboration, further information, or tacit agreement.",
        "To ground a target concept, FORRSooth considers one or more hypotheses for the value the user intended, and chooses a grounding action commensurate with its understanding and confidence.",
