        "Many dialogue system developers use data gathered from previous versions of a system to train models for analyzing users' interactions with later versions of the system in new ways, e.g. detecting users' affect enables the system to respond more appropriately.",
        "However, this training data does not always accurately reflect the current version of the system.",
        "In particular, differences in the levels of automation and the presentation of dialogue content commonly vary between versions.",
        "For example, Raux et al. (2006) changed dialogue strategies for their Let's Go bus information system after real-world testing.",
        "Previous work in dialogue systems with regards to analyzing the impact ofusing differing training data has primarily been in the domain adaptation field, and has focused on two areas.",
        "First, previous work empirically analyzed the need for domain adaptation, i.e. methods for porting existing classifiers to unrelated domains.",
        "For example, Webb and Liu (2008) developed a cue-phrase-based dialogue act classifier using the Switchboard corpus, and tested on call center data.",
        "While this performed reasonably, training on the call center corpus and testing on Switchboard performed poorly.",
        "The second research direction involves proposing methods for domain adaptation.",
        "Margolis et al.",
        "(2010) observed similar poor performance when porting their dialogue act classifier between three corpora: Switchboard, the Meeting Recorder Dialog Act corpus, and a machine-translated version of the Spanish Callhome corpus.",
        "They report promising results through varying their feature set.",
        "Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) also observed poor performance and the need for adaptation when porting product review sentiment classifiers.",
        "They used four review corpora from Amazon (books, DVDs, electronics, and small appliances), which yielded 12 cross-domain training/testing pairs.",
        "Their algorithmic adaptation methods showed promising results.",
        "Our work is in the first direction, as we also empirically analyze the impact of differences in training and testing corpora to demonstrate the need for adaptation methods.",
        "However, our work differs from domain adaptation, as the corpora in this experiment all come from one intelligent spoken physics tutor.",
        "Instead, we analyze differences resulting from varying levels of automation and small changes in dialogue content between versions of our system.",
        "With respect to analyzing automation, we empirically compare the impact of differences in training on data from wizarded (WOZ) versus fully automated systems.",
        "Though many systems use data from a WOZ version of the system to train models which are then used in fully automated versions of the system, the effectiveness of this method of dialogue system development has not been tested.",
        "We hypothesize that models built with automated data will outperform models built with wizarded data.",
        "Additionally, minor dialogue content changes typically exist between versions of systems.",
        "While large changes, like changing domains, have been shown to affect model performance, no work has investigated the impact of these more minute changes.",
        "We hypothesize that these differences in dialogue content presentation will also affect the models.",
        "Finally, the amount of training data is a well known factor which affects performance of models built using supervised machine learning.",
        "We hypothesize that combining some, but not all, types of training corpora will improve the performance ofthe trained models, e.g. adding automated data to WOZ data will improve performance, as this provides fully automated examples.",
        "We hypothesize only providing more WOZ data will not be as useful.",
        "The data used for this work comes from two prior experiments using itspoke, a spoken tutorial dialogue system, which tutors physics novices.",
        "Table 1 describes all data used, displaying the number of users per data set, the number of dialogues between the system and each user, the total number of user turns per corpus, and the percentage ofturns labeled uncertain.",
        "See Appendix A for more information.",
        "The first experiment, in 2007, compared two dialogue-based strategies for remediating user uncertainty over and above correctness (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011b).",
        "The goal of this work was to not only test the hypothesis that this uncertainty remediation would improve users' learning, but to investigate what types of dialogue remediation would improve users' learning the most.",
        "Since this experiment, WOZ-07, was designed to be a gold-standard case of uncertainty remediation, all natural language understanding and uncertainty annotation was performed by a human wizard, in real time (WOZ).",
        "All annotations were made at the turn-level.",
        "For WOZ-07, users' dialogue interactions with the system would change based on which remediation strategy they were assigned to.",
        "There were two different dialogue-based remediation strategies.",
        "In addition to varying the strategies, the two control conditions in this experiment also varied when the remediation strategy was applied.",
        "The simple remediation dialogue strategy provided additional information about the physics concept the user was struggling with, or asked them further questions about the concept.",
        "Both control conditions used the simple remediation strategy; one only applied the strategy when the user was incorrect, the other applied it if the user was incorrect and randomly when the user was correct.",
        "The simple remediation experimental condition applied the remediation when the user was incorrect, or correct but uncertain about their answer.",
        "The fourth condition in WOZ-07 used the second dialogue strategy, complex remediation.",
        "This strategy changed the way the remediation was presented, depending on a combination of the user's correctness and certainty in their answer.",
        "Only users in the simple remediation experimental condition learned more than users in other conditions.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of simple remediation; the tutor acknowledges that the user is incorrect, saying \"Well...\", and then explains the concept the previous question tested.",
        "Appendix B compares simple and complex remediation strategies.",
        "Another experiment was performed in 2008, where users interacted with either a fully automated (ASR) version of itspoke or a wizarded version.",
        "The goal of this experiment was to see if the learning gains found in the 2007 experiment would hold in the ASR version of the system.",
        "To mimic the WOZ-07 experiment, the wizarded version (WOZ-08) only used the simple remediation experimental condition found in WOZ-07, while the ASR version contained the simple remediation experimental condition and both simple remediation control conditions.",
        "The complex remediation strategy was not included due to its poor performance in WOZ-07.",
        "Thus, WOZ-08 and ASR-08 used identical dialogue strategies, with minor differences in where the reme-",
        "TUTORp5: (Response to an incorrect answer) Well... We just discussed that by Newton's Third law, when two objects collide, the forces they exert on each other are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.",
        "This is true regardless of the objects' differing masses.",
        "So the first question's answer is that the impact forces on the truck and the car will have the same magnitude but opposite direction.",
        "Now, the second question asks about the vehicles' change in motion.",
        "We can use Newton's Second law to answer this.",
        "What does this law say?",

        "For the ASR conditions, all models were trained on WOZ-07 data; users were randomly assigned to the WOZ-08 or ASR-08 condition as they participated.",
        "In addition to eliminating the complex remediation condition, a sixth dialogue, completely isomorphic to the fifth dialogue, was added to all conditions.",
        "See Appendix B dialogue examples, highlighting their content differences.",
        "Figure 1 displays two ASR-08 tutor turns with the same user.",
        "These turns are from the fifth problem, and the isomorphic sixth problem.",
        "Note that two things change between these two answers.",
        "First, the system responds to the user's incorrectness in the first example.",
        "Had the user been correct and uncertain, this is also the dialogue s/he would have seen.",
        "Second, notice that problem five discusses a car, while problem six discusses a motorcycle.",
        "To create a completely isomorphic problem, the scenario for the dialogue was changed from a car to a motorcycle.",
        "For both the 2007 and 2008 corpora, all goldstandard uncertainty annotations were performed by a trained human annotator.",
        "Development and previous testing of the annotation scheme between this annotator and another trained annotator resulted in kappa = 0.62.",
        "All wizarded conditions were annotated in real-time; all ASR conditions were annotated in a post-hoc manner.",
        "In sum, the main differences between the two systems' data are differences in automation (i.e. WOZ and ASR) and content (i.e. presentation of content, reflected by differing dialogue strategies, and number of physics dialogues)."
