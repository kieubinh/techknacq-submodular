        "The PARADISE method for evaluating task-based spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) assumes that user satisfaction can be modeled as a multivariate linear regression on measures of task success and dialogue costs (Walker, et al.",
        "1998).",
        "Dialogue costs address efficiency, such as length of time on task, and effort, such as number of times the SDS fails to understand an utterance and re-prompts the user.",
        "It has been used to compare subjects performing the same or similar tasks across distinct SDSs (Sanders, et al.",
        "2002).",
        "To our knowledge, it has not been applied to human-human dialogue.",
        "For human-human task-based dialogues, we hypothesized that user satisfaction would not be predicted well by measures of success and dialogue costs alone.",
        "We expected that qualitative characteristics of human-human dialogue, such as the manner in which a dialogue goal is pursued, could counterbalance high dialogue costs.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we performed a PARADISE-like evaluation of a corpus of human-human library transaction dialogues that was originally collected to support the design of our SDS (Passonneau, et al.",
        "2010).",
        "The communicative task we examine is to identify a specific set of books of interest from the library's holdings.",
        "This can be straightforward if the patron requests a book by catalogue number.",
        "It can be complex if the patron does not have complete bibliographic information, or if the request is non-specific.",
        "A book request is successful when the librarian identifies a specific book that addresses the patron's request.",
        "Task success was predictive on a training set, but not on a held-out test set.",
        "Dialogue costs were less reliably predictive.",
        "Two additional factors we found to be moderate predictors pertained to the number of book requests that were non-specific in nature, and the amount and location of overlapping turns.",
        "We refer to these as qualitative features.",
        "A non-specific book request can lead to a collaborative identification of a specific book, and the costs incurred can be worth the effort.",
        "We speculate that overlapping turns during non-task-oriented subdialogue reflects positive rapport between the speakers, while the role of overlapping turns during task-oriented subdialogue is contingent on other characteristics of the task, such as whether the goal is specific or non-specific.",
        "The three following sections discuss related work, our corpus, and our annotation procedures and reliability.",
        "We then present how we measure user satisfaction, informational task success on book requests, and various dialogue costs.",

        "1976), which in turn leads to communicative success.",
        "A similar idea is seen in the origins of media richness theory (Daft and Lengel 1984), which defines media with more \"richness\" as having more communication cues, and thus enhancing task success.",
        "A key component of this assumption is that, if computers are created with human-like qualities then people will view computers similarly to humans.",
        "We hypothesize that human-machine dialogue need not resemble human-human dialogue in all respects, thus we earlier proposed a method to investigate human-machine dialogue despite the large disparity in the spoken language processing abilities of humans versus machines (Levin and Passonneau 2006), and applied it work described in this proceedings (Gordon, et al.",
