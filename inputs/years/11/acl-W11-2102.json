        "Statistical machine translation systems can perform poorly on distant language pairs such as English and Japanese.",
        "Reordering errors are a major source of poor or misleading translations in such systems (Isozaki et al., 2010).",
        "Unfortunately the standard evaluation metrics used by the statistical machine translation community are relatively insensitive to the long-distance reordering phenomena encountered when translating between such languages (Birchetal., 2010).",
        "The ability to rapidly evaluate the impact of changes on a system can significantly accelerate the experimental cycle.",
        "In a large statistical machine translation system, we should ideally be able to experiment with separate components without retraining the complete system.",
        "Measures such as perplexity have been successfully used to evaluate language models independently in speech recognition eliminating some of the need for end-to-end speech recognition experiments.",
        "In machine translation, alignment error rate has been used with some mixed success to evaluate word-alignment algorithms but no standard evaluation frameworks exist for other components of a machine translation system (Fraser and Marcu, 2007).",
        "Unfortunately, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and other metrics that work with the final output of a machine translation system are both insensitive to reordering phenomena and relatively time-consuming to compute: changes to the system may require the realignment of the parallel training data, extraction of phrasal statistics and translation of a test set.",
        "As training sets grow in size, the cost of end-to-end experimentation can become significant.",
        "However, it is not clear that measurements made on any single part of the system will correlate well with human judgments of the translation quality of the whole system.",
        "Following Collins et al.",
        "(2005a) and Wang (2007), Xu et al.",
        "(2009) showed that when translating from English to Japanese (and to other SOV languages such as Korean and Turkish) applying reordering as a preprocessing step that manipulates a source sentence parse tree can significantly outperform state-of-the-art phrase-based and hierarchical machine translation systems.",
        "This result is corroborated by Birch et al.",
        "(2009) whose results suggest that both phrase-based and hierarchical translation systems fail to capture long-distance reordering phenomena.",
        "In this paper we describe a lightweight framework for measuring the quality of the reordering components in a machine translation system.",
        "While our framework can be applied to any translation system in which it is possible to derive a token-level alignment from the input source tokens to the output target tokens, it is of particular practical interest when applied to a system that performs reordering as a preprocessing step (Xia and McCord, 2004).",
        "In this case, as we show, it allows for extremely rapid and sensitive analysis of changes to parser, reordering rules and other reordering components.",
        "In our framework we evaluate the reordering proposed by a system separately from its choice of target words by comparing it to a reference reordering of the sentence generated from a manually word-aligned translation.",
        "Unlike previous work (Isozaki et al., 2010), our approach does not rely on the system's output matching the reference translation lexically.",
        "This makes the evaluation more robust as there may be many ways to render a source phrase in the target language and we would not wish to penalize one that simply happens not to match the reference.",
        "In the next section we review related work on reordering for translation between distant language pairs and automatic approaches to evaluating reordering in machine translation.",
        "We then describe our evaluation framework including certain important details of how our reference reorderings were created.",
        "We evaluate the framework by analyzing how robustly it is able to predict improvements in subjective translation quality for an English to Japanese machine translation system.",
        "Finally, we describe ways in which the framework has facilitated development of the reordering components in our system."

        "The ability to automatically evaluate machine translation output has driven progress in statistical machine translation; however, shortcomings of the dominant metric, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), particularly with respect to reordering, have long been recognized (Callison-burch and Osborne, 2006).",
        "Reordering has also been identified as a major factor in determining the difficulty of statistical machine translation between two languages (Birch et al., 2008) hence BLEU scores may be most unreliable precisely for those language pairs for which statistical machine translation is most difficult (Isozaki et al., 2010).",
        "There have been many results showing that metrics that account for reordering are better correlated with human judgements of translation quality (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009; Birch and Osborne, 2010; Isozaki et al., 2010).",
        "Examples given in Isozaki et al.",
        "(2010) where object and subject arguments are reversed in a Japanese to English statistical machine translation system demonstrate how damaging reordering errors can be and it should therefore not come as a surprise that word order is a strong predictor of translation quality; however, there are other advantages to be gained by focusing on this specific aspect of the translation process in isolation.",
        "One problem for all automatic evaluation metrics is that multiple equally good translations can be constructed for most input sentences and typically our reference data will contain only a small fraction of these.",
        "Equally good translations for a sentence may differ both in terms of lexical choice and word order.",
        "One of the potential advantages of designing a metric that looks only at word order, is that it may, to some extent, factor out variability along the dimension of the lexical choice.",
        "Previous work on automatic evaluation metrics that focus on reordering, however, has not fully exploited this.",
        "The evaluation metrics proposed in Isozaki et al.",
        "(2010) compute a reordering score by comparing the ordering of unigrams and bigrams that appear in both the system's translation and the reference.",
        "These scores are therefore liable to overestimate the reordering quality of sentences that were poorly translated.",
        "While Isozaki et al.",
        "(2010) does propose a workaround to this problem which combines the reordering score with a lexical precision term, this clearly introduces a bias in the metric whereby poor translations are evaluated primarily on their lexical choice and good translations are evaluated more on the basis of their word order.",
        "In our experience word order is particularly poor in those sentences that have the lowest lexical overlap with reference translations; hence we would like to be able to compute the quality of reordering in all sentences independently of the quality of their lexical choice.",
        "Birch and Osborne (2010) are closer to our approach in that they use word alignments to induce a permutation over the source sentence.",
        "They compare a source-side permutation generated from a word alignment of the reference translation with one generated from the system's using various permutation distances.",
        "However, Birch and Osborne (2010) only demonstrate that these metrics are correlated with human judgements of translation quality when combined with BLEU score and hence take lexical choice into account.",
        "Birch et al.",
        "(2010) present the only results we are aware of that compute the correlation between human judgments of translation quality and a reordering-only metric independently of lexical choice.",
        "Unfortunately, the experimental set-up there is somewhat flawed.",
        "The authors 'undo' reorderings in their reference translations by permuting the reference tokens and presenting the permuted translations to human raters.",
        "While many machine translation systems (including our own) assume that reordering and translation can be factored into separate models, e.g. (Xia and McCord, 2004), and perform these two operations in separate steps, the latter conditioned on the former, Birch et al.",
        "(2010) are making a much stronger assumption when they perform these simulations: they are assuming that lexical choice and word order are entirely independent.",
        "It is easy to find cases where this assumption does not hold and we would in general be very surprised if a similar change in the reordering component in our system did not also result in a change in the lexical choice of the system; an effect which their experiments are unable to model.",
        "Another minor difference between our evaluation framework and (Birch et al., 2010) is that we use a reordering score that is based on the minimum number of chunks into which the candidate and reference permutations can be concatenated similar to the reordering component of METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009).",
        "As we show, this is better correlated with human judgments of translation quality than Kendall's t. This may be due to the fact that it counts the number of 'jumps' a human reader has to make in order to parse the system's order if they wish to read the tokens in the reference word order.",
        "Kendall's t on the other hand penalizes every pair of words that are in the wrong order and hence has a quadratic (all-pairs) flavor which in turn might explain why Birch et al.",
        "(2010) found that the square-root of this quantity was a better predictor of translation quality.",
        "To create the word-aligned translations from which we generate our reference reordering data, we used a novel alignment-oriented translation method.",
        "The method (described in more detail below) seeks to generate reference reorderings that a machine translation system might reasonably be expected to achieve.",
        "Fox (2002) has analyzed the extent to which translations seen in a parallel corpus can be broken down into clean phrasal units: they found that most sentence pairs contain examples of reordering that violate phrasal cohesion, i.e. the corresponding words in the target language are not completely contiguous or solely aligned to the corresponding source phrase.",
        "These reordering phenomena are difficult for current statistical translation models to learn directly.",
        "We therefore deliberately chose to create reference data that avoids these phenomena as much as possible by having a single annotator generate both the translation and its word alignment.",
        "Our word-aligned translations are created with a bias towards simple phrasal reordering.",
        "Our analysis of the correlation between reordering scores computed on reference data created from such alignment-oriented translations with scores computed on references generated from standard professional translations of the same sentences suggests that the alignment-oriented translations are more useful for evaluating a current state-of-the-art system.",
        "We note also that while prior work has conjectured that automatically generated alignments are a suitable replacement for manual alignments in the context of reordering evaluation (Birch et al., 2008), our results suggest that this is not the case at least for the language pair we consider, English-Japanese."

        "We now present our lightweight reordering evaluation framework; this consists of (1) a method for generating reference reordering data from manual word-alignments; and (2) a reordering metric for scoring a sytem's proposed reordering against this reference data; and (3) a standalone evaluation tool.",
        "We follow Birch and Osborne (2010) in using reference reordering data that consists of permuations of source sentences in a test set.",
        "We generate these from word alignments of the source sentences to reference translations.",
        "Unlike previous work, however, we have the same annotator generate both the reference translation and the word alignment.",
        "We also explicitly encourage the translators to generate translations that are easy to align even if this does result in occasionally unnatural translations.",
        "For instance in English to Japanese translation we require that all personal pronouns are translated; these are often omitted in natural Japanese.",
        "We insist that all but an extremely small set of words (articles and punctuation for English to Japanese) be aligned.",
        "We also disprefer non-contiguous alignments of a single source word and require that all target words be aligned to at least one source token.",
        "In Japanese this requires deciding how to align particles that mark syntactic roles; we choose to align these together with the content word (jiritsu-go) of the corresponding constituent (bunsetsu).",
        "Asking annotators to translate and perform word alignment on the same sentence in a single session does not necessarily increase the annotation burden over standalone word alignment since it encourages the creation of alignment-friendly translations which can be aligned more rapidly.",
        "Annotators need little special background or training for this task, as long as they can speak both the source and target languages.",
        "To generate a permutation from word alignments we rank the source tokens by the position of the first target token to which they are aligned.",
        "If multiple source tokens are aligned to a single target word or span we ignore the ordering within these source spans; this is indicated by braces in Table 2.",
        "We place unaligned source words immediately before the next aligned source word or at the end of the sentence if there is none.",
        "Table 2 shows the reference reordering derived from various translations and word alignments.",
        "To evaluate the quality of a system's reordering against this reference data we use a simple reordering metric related to METEOR's reordering component (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) .",
        "Given the reference permutation of the source sentence aref and the system's reordering of the source sentence asys either generated directly by a reordering component or inferred from the alignment between source and target phrases used in the decoder, we align each word in asys to an instance of itself in aref taking the first unmatched instance of the word if there is more than one.",
        "We then define C to be the number chunks of contiguously aligned words.",
        "If M is the number of words in the source sentence then the fuzzy reordering score is computed as,",
        "This metric assigns a score between 0 and 1 where 1 indicates that the system's reordering is identical to the reference.",
        "C has an intuitive interpretation as the number of times a reader would need to jump in order to read the system's reordering ofthe sentence in the order proposed by the reference.",
        "While the framework we propose can be applied to any machine translation system in which a reordering of the source sentence can be inferred from the translation process, it has proven particularly useful applied to a system that performs reordering as a separate preprocessing step.",
        "Such pre-ordering approaches (Xia and McCord, 2004; Collins et al., 2005b) can be criticized for greedily committing to a single reordering early in the pipeline but in practice they have been shown to perform extremely well on language pairs that require long distance reordering and have been successfully combined with other more integrated reordering models (Xu et al., 2009).",
        "The performance of a parser-based pre-ordering component is a function of the reordering rules and parser; it is therefore desirable that these can be evaluated efficiently.",
        "Both parser and reordering rules may be evaluated using end-to-end automatic metrics such as BLEU score or in human evaluations.",
        "Parsers may also be evaluated using intrinsic treebank metrics such as labeled accuracy.",
        "Unfortunately these metrics are either expensive to compute or, as we show, unpredictive of improvements in human perceptions of translation quality.",
        "Having found that the fuzzy reordering score proposed here is well-correlated with changes in human judgements of translation quality, we established a standalone evaluation tool that takes a set of reordering rules and a parser and computes the reordering scores on a set of reference reorderings.",
        "This has become the most frequently used method for evaluating changes to the reordering component in our system and has allowed teams working on parsing, for instance, to contribute significant improvements quite independently."

        "We have presented a lightweight framework foreval-uating reordering in machine translation and demonstrated that this is able to accurately distinguish significant changes in translation quality due to changes in preprocessing components such as the parser or reordering rules used by the system.",
        "The sentence-level correlation of our metric with judgements of human translation quality was shown to be higher than other standard evaluation metrics while our evaluation has the significant practical advantage of not requiring an end-to-end machine translation experiment when used to evaluate a separate reordering component.",
        "Our analysis has also highlighted the benefits of creating focused evaluation data that attempts to factor out some of the phenomena found in real human translation.",
        "While previous work has provided meta-analysis of reordering metrics across quite independent systems, ours is we believe the first to provide a detailed comparison of systems that differ only in small but realistic aspects such as parser quality.",
        "In future work we plan to use the framework to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the reordering capabilities of a broad range of machine translation systems.",
