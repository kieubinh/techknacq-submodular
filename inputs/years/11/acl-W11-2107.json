        "However, previous versions of the metric are still limited by lack of punctuation handling, noise in paraphrase matching, and lack of discrimination between word types.",
        "We introduce new resources for all WMT languages including text normalizers, filtered paraphrase tables, and function word lists.",
        "We show that the addition of these resources to Meteor allows tuning versions of the metric that show higher correlation with human translation rankings and adequacy scores on unseen test data.",

        "We also conduct a MT system tuning experiment on Urdu-English data to compare the effectiveness of using multiple versions of Meteor in minimum error rate training.",
        "While versions tuned to various types of human judgments do not perform as well as the widely used BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002), a balanced Tuning version of Meteor consistently outperforms BLEU over multiple end-to-end tune-test runs on this data set.",

        "Whereas previous versions of Meteor simply strip punctuation characters prior to scoring, version 1.3 includes a new text normalizer intended specifically for translation evaluation.",
        "The normalizer first replicates the behavior of the tokenizer distributed with the Moses toolkit (Hoang et al., 2007), including handling of non-breaking prefixes.",
        "After tok-enization, we add several rules for normalization, intended to reduce meaning-equivalent punctuation styles to common forms.",
        "The following two rules are particularly helpful:",
        "• Remove dashes between hyphenated words.",
        "(Example: far-off – far off)",
        "• Remove full stops in acronyms/initials.",
        "(Example: U.N. – UN)",
        "Consider the behavior of the Moses tokenizer and Meteor normalizers given a reference translation containing the phrase \"u.S.-based organization\":",
        "Moses: U.S.-based organization",
        "Meteor <1.2: U S based organization Meteor 1.3: US based organization",
        "Of these, only the Meteor 1.3 normalization allows metrics to match all of the following stylizations:",
        "U.S.-based organization US-based organization U.S. based organization US based organization",
        "While intended for Meteor evaluation, use of this normalizer is a suitable preprocessing step for other metrics to improve accuracy when reference sentences are stylistically different from hypotheses.",
        "The original Meteor paraphrase tables (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010b) are constructed using the phrase table \"pivoting\" technique described by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005).",
        "Many paraphrases suffer from word accumulation, the appending of unaligned words to one or both sides of a phrase rather than finding a true rewording from elsewhere in parallel data.",
        "To improve the precision of the paraphrase tables, we filter out all cases of word accumulation by removing paraphrases where one phrase is a substring of the other.",
        "Table 1 lists the number of phrase pairs found in each paraphrase table before and after filtering.",
        "In addition to improving accuracy, the reduction of phrase table sizes also reduces the load time and memory usage of the Meteor paraphrase matcher.",
        "The tables are a modular resource suitable for other MT or NLP software.",
        "Commonly used metrics such as BLEU and earlier versions of Meteor make no distinction between content and function words.",
        "This can be problematic for ranking-based evaluations where two system outputs can differ by a single word, such as mistranslating either a main verb or a determiner.",
        "To improve Meteor's discriminative power in such cases, we introduce a function word list for each WMT language and a new ö parameter to adjust the relative weight given to content words (any word not on the list) versus function words (see Section 3).",
        "Function word lists are estimated according to relative frequency in large monolingual corpora.",
        "For each language, we pool freely available WMT 2011 data consisting of Europarl (Koehn, 2005), news (sentence-uniqued), and news commentary data.",

        "We have presented Ranking, Adequacy, and Tuning versions of Meteor 1.3.",
        "The Ranking and Adequacy versions are shown to have high correlation with human judgments except in cases of overfitting due to skewed tuning data.",
        "We believe that these overfitting issues are lessened when tuning to combined 2009 and 2010 data due to increased variety in translation characteristics.",
        "The Tuning version of Meteor is shown to outperform BLEU in minimum error rate training of a phrase-based system on small Urdu-English data and we believe that it will generalize well to other tuning scenarios.",
        "The source code and all resources for Meteor 1.3 and the version of Z-MERT with Meteor integration will be available for download from the Meteor website.",
