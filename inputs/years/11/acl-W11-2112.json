        "The automatic evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) is a long-standing problem.",
        "A number of metrics have been proposed in the last two decades, mostly measuring some form of matching between the MT output (hypothesis) and one or more human (reference) translations.",
        "However, most of these metrics focus on fluency aspects, as opposed to adequacy.",
        "Therefore, measuring whether the meaning of the hypothesis and reference translation are the same or similar is still an understudied problem.",
        "The most commonly used metrics, BLEU (Pap-ineni et al., 2002) and alike, perform simple exact matching of n-grams between hypothesis and reference translations.",
        "Such a simple matching procedure has well known limitations, including that the matching of non-content words counts as much as the matching of content words, that variations of words with the same meaning are disregarded, and that a perfect matching can happen even if the order of sequences of n-grams in the hypothesis and reference translation are very different, changing completely the meaning of the translation.",
        "A number of other metrics have been proposed to address these limitations, for example, by allowing for the matching of synonyms or paraphrases of content words, such as in METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010).",
        "Other attempts have been made to capture whether the reference translation and hypothesis translations share the same meaning using shallow semantics, i.e., Semantic Role Labeling (Gimenez and Marquez, 2007).",
        "However, these are limited to the exact matching of semantic roles and their fillers.",
        "We propose TINE, a new metric that complements lexical matching with a shallow semantic component to better address adequacy.",
        "The main contribution of such a metric is to provide a more flexible way of measuring the overlap between shallow semantic representations that considers both the semantic structure of the sentence and the content of the semantic elements.",
        "The metric uses SRLs such as in (Gimenez and Marquez, 2007).",
        "However, it analyses the content of predicates and arguments seeking for either exact or \"similar\" matches.",
        "The inexact matching is based on the use of ontologies such as VerbNet (Schuler, 2006) and distributional semantics similarity metrics, such as Dekang Lin's thesaurus (Lin, 1998) .",
        "In the remainder of this paper we describe some related work (Section 2), present our metric - TINE - (Section 3) and its performance compared to previous work (Section 4) as well as some further improvements.",
        "We then provide an analysis of these results and discuss the limitations of the metric (Section 5) and present conclusions and future work (Section 6)."

      "heading": "3. Metric Description",
      "text": [
        "The rationale behind TINE is that an adequacy-oriented metric should go beyond measuring the matching of lexical items to incorporate information about the semantic structure of the sentence, as in (Gimenez et al., 2010).",
        "However, the metric should also be flexible to consider inexact matches of semantic components, similar to what is done with lexical metrics like METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010).",
        "We experiment with TINE having English as target language because of the availability of linguistic processing tools for this language.",
        "The metric is particularly dependent on semantic role labeling systems, which have reached satisfactory performance for English (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "TINE uses semantic role labels (SRL) and lexical semantics to fulfill two requirements by: (i) compare both the semantic structure and its content across matching arguments in the hypothesis and reference translations; and (ii) propose alternative ways of measuring inexact matches for both predicates and role fillers.",
        "Additionally, it uses an exact lexical matching component to reward hypotheses that present the same lexical choices as the reference translation.",
        "The overall score s is defined using the simple weighted average model in Equation (1):",
        "where H represents the hypothesis translation, R represents a reference translation contained in the set of available references R; L defines the (exact) lexical match component in Equation (2), A defines the adequacy component in Equation (3); and a and ß are tunable weights for these two components.",
        "If multiple references are provided, the score of the segment is the maximum score achieved by comparing the segment to each available reference.",
        "The lexical match component measures the overlap between the two representations in terms of the cosine similarity metric.",
        "A segment, either a hypothesis or a reference, is represented as a bag of tokens extracted from an unstructured representation, that is, bag of unigrams (words or stems).",
        "Cosine similarity was chosen, as opposed to simply checking the percentage ofoverlapping words (POW) because cosine does not penalize differences in the length of the hypothesis and reference translation as much as POW.",
        "Cosine similarity normalizes the cardinality of the intersection |H n R| using the geometric mean \\J\\H !",
        "* |R| instead of the union |H UR|.",
        "This is particularly important for the matching of arguments which is also based on cosine similarity.",
        "If an hypothesized argument has the same meaning as its reference translation, but differs from it in length, cosine will penalize less the matching than POW.",
        "That is specially interesting when core arguments get merged with modifiers due to bad semantic role labeling (e.g. [AO I] [Thought] [A1 something to eat yesterday] instead of [AO I] [T bought] [A1 something to eat] [AM-TMP yesterday]).",
        "J2vev verbscore(Hv, Rv)",
        "In the adequacy component, V is the set of verbs aligned between H and R, and \\ Vr \\ is the number of verbs in R. Hereafter the indexes h and r stand for hypothesis and reference translations, respectively.",
        "Verbs are aligned using VerbNet (Schuler, 2006) and VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).",
        "A verb in the hypothesis vh is aligned to a verb in the reference vr if they are related according to the following heuristics: (i) the pair of verbs share at least one class in VerbNet; or (ii) the pair of verbs holds a relation in VerbOcean.",
        "For example, in VerbNet the verbs spook and terrify share the same class amuse-31.1, and in VerbO-cean the verb dress is related to the verb wear.",
        "argscore(Ha, Ra)",
        "The similarity between the arguments of a verb pair (vh ,vr) in V is measured as defined in Equation (4), where Ah and At are the sets of labeled arguments of the hypothesis and the reference respectively and |Ar | is the number of arguments of the verb in R. In other words, we only measure the similarity of arguments in a pair of sentences that are annotated with the same role.",
        "This ensures that the structure of the sentence is taken into account (for example, an argument in the role of agent would not be compared against an argument in a role of experi-encer).",
        "Additionally, by restricting the comparison to arguments of a given verb pair, we avoid argument confusion in sentences with multiple verbs.",
        "The arg_score(Ha, Ra) computation is based on the cosine similarity as in Equation (2).",
        "We treat the tokens in the argument as a bag-of-words.",
        "However, in this case we change the representation of the segments.",
        "If the two sets do not match exactly, we expand both of them by adding similar words.",
        "For every mismatch in a segment, we retrieve the 20-most similar words from Dekang Lin's distributional thesaurus (Lin, 1998), resulting in sets with richer lexical variety.",
