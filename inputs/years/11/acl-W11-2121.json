      "text": [
        "Given the outputs of multiple MT systems, we would like to reorder and align the words of different hypothesis in a way such that an objective function is optimized, thus reaching better translations by making use of more information.",
        "In our system combination scheme, the objective function was based on Translation-Edit-Rate Plus (TER-plus).",
        "TER-plus is an extension of Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "TER is an evaluation metric for machine translation; it generalizes Word Error Rate (WER) by allowing block shifts in addition to the edit distance operations.",
        "However, one problem with TER is that only exact match of word blocks are allowed for shifting; this constraint might be too strict as it sometimes prevents reasonable shifts if two blocks have similar meanings.",
        "TER-plus remedies this problem by introducing new flexible matches between words, thus allowing word substitutions and block shifts with costs much lower than that of TER.",
        "Specifically, substitution costs are now dependent on whether the words have the same stem (stem matches) or are synonyms (synonym matches).",
        "These operations relax the shifting constraints of TER; shifts are now allowed if the words of one string are synonyms or share the same stem as the words of the string they are compared to (Snover et al., 2009).",
        "TER-plus identifies words with the same stem using the Porter stemming algorithm (Porter et al., 1980), and identifies synonyms using the WordNet database (Miller et al., 1995).",
        "Originally, TER-plus was designed for aligning together word strings.",
        "However, similar to the work of (Karakos et al., 2010), who extended ITG to allow bilingual parsing of two confusion networks (by treating each confusion network bin as a multi-word entity), we converted the basic TER-plus code to take into account multiple words present in confusion network bins.",
        "Specifically, we define the cost of aligning two confusion network bins as (Karakos in which b1,b2 are the confusion network bins which are candidates for alignment, | • | is the size of a bin, w1, w2 are words in b1 and b2 respectively, and C(w1, w2) is defined as follows:",
        "0 w1 matches w20.5 w2 is deleted 0.6 w2 is inserted 0.2 w1 and w2 are synonyms 0.2 w1 and w2 share stems"

        "Furthermore, the bin shift cost is set to 1.5.",
        "These numbers are empirically determined based on experimental results.",
        "Similar to (Karakos et al., 2010), when a bin gets \"deleted\", it gets replaced with a NULL arc, which simply encodes the empty string, and is otherwise treated as a regular token in the alignments."

        "The confusion networks are built in two stages:",
        "1.",
        "Within-system combination: (optional, only applicable in the case where per-system n-best lists are available.)",
        "the within-system combination generates system-specific confusion networks based on the alignment of the n-best translations.",
        "2.",
        "Between-system combination: incremental alignment of the confusion networks of different systems generated in step 1, starting from 2-system combination up to the combination of all systems.",
        "The order with which the systems are selected is based on the individual BLEU scores (i.e., the best two systems are first combined, then the 3rd best is aligned to the resulting confusion network, etc.)",
        "For the between-system combination we made use of TER-plus as described in section 2.2.",
        "3.2 Language model Rescoring with Finite-State Transducer Operations",
        "Once the between-system confusion networks are ready (one confusion network per sentence), a path through each of them has to be selected as the combination output.",
        "In order to pick out the the most fluent word sequence as the final translation, we need to rescore the confusion networks using a language model.",
        "This task can be performed efficiently via finite state transducer (FST) operations (Allauzen et al., 2002).",
        "First, we build an FST for each confusion network, called CN-FST.",
        "Since the confusion network is just a sequence of bins and each bin is a superposition of single words, the CN-FST can be built as a linear FST in a straightforward way (see Figure 1).",
        "A 5-gram language model FST (LM-FST) is then built for each sentence.",
        "To build the LM-FST, we refer to the methodology described in (Allauzen et al., 2003).",
        "In brief, the LM-FST is constructed in the following way:",
        "1.",
        "Extract the vocabulary of each segment.",
        "2.",
        "Each state of the FST encodes an n-gram history (n – 1 words).",
        "Each (non-null) arc that originates from that state corresponds uniquely to a word type (i.e., word that follows that history in the training data).",
        "3.",
        "The cost of each word arc is the corresponding language model score (negative log-probability, based on the modified Kneser-Ney formula (Kneser, 1995) for that n-gram).",
        "4.",
        "Extra arcs are added for backing-off to lower-order histories, thus allowing all possible word strings to receive a non-zero probability.",
        "In order to deal with the situation where a word in the confusion network is not in the vocabulary of the language model, we need to build another simple transducer, namely, the \"unknown word\" FST (UNK-FST), to map this word to the symbol <unk> that encodes the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "Note that this is useful only if one builds open-vocabulary language models which always give a non-zero probability to OOV words; e.g., check out the option -unk of the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "(Obviously, the UNK-FST leaves all other words unmodified.)",
        "After all these three transducers have been built, they are composed in the following manner (for each sentence):",
        "Note that a possible re-weighting of the arc costs of the CN-FST can be done in order to better account for the different dynamic ranges between the CN costs and the LM-FST costs.",
        "Furthermore, to avoid too many word deletions (especially in regions of the confusion network where the words disagree most) an additive word deletion penalty can be added to all NULL arcs.",
        "The best (minimum-cost) path from this resulting FST is selected as the output translation of the system combination for that sentence.",
        "We now summarize the JHU system combination end-to-end pipeline as follows(since BLEU score is a key metric in the WMT11 translation evaluation, we use BLEU score as the system ranking criteria.",
        "The BLEU score we computed for the experiments below are all case-insensitive):",

        "5.",
        "Rescore the confusion network and start tuning on the parameters: convert the between-system confusion network into FST, compose it with the UNK-FST and with the LM-FST.",
        "When composing with LM-FST, try different CN arc coefficients (we tried the range {5,...,21}), and unknown word insertion penalties (we tried the values {0.3,0.5,0.7,1}).",
