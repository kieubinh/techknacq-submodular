        "When using phrase pairs it is complicated to use different kinds of bilingual contexts, since the context of the POS-based phrase pairs should be bigger than the word-based ones to make the most use of them.",

        "No bilingual information outside the phrase pair is used for selecting the target word.",
        "The effect can be shown in the following example sentence:",
        "Ein gemeinsames Merkmal aller extremen Rechten in Europa ist ihr Rassismus und die Tatsache, dass sie das Einwanderungsproblem als politischen Hebel benutzen.",
        "Using our phrase-based SMT system, we get the following segmentation into phrases on the source side: ein gemeinsames, Merkmal, aller, extremen Rechten.",
        "That means, that the translation of Merkmal is not influenced by the source words gemeinsames or aller.",
        "However, apart from this segmentation, other phrases could have been conceivable for building a translation:",
        "ein, ein gemeinsames, ein gemeinsames Merkmal, gemeinsames, gemeinsames Merkmal, Merkmal aller, aller, extremen, extremen Rechten and Rechten.",
        "As shown in Figure 1 the translation for the first three words ein gemeinsames Merkmal into a common feature can be created by segmenting it into ein gemeinsames and Merkmal as done by the and fJ = fi ...fj and the corresponding word alignment A = {(i, j)} the following tokens are created:",
        "phrase-based system or by segmenting it into ein and gemeinsames Merkmal.",
        "In the phrase-based system, the decoder cannot make use of the fact that both segmentation variants lead to the same translation, but has to select one and use only this information for scoring the hypothesis.",
        "Consequently, if the first segmentation is chosen, the fact that gemeinsames is translated to common does effect the translation of Merkmal only by means of the language model, but no bilingual context can be carried over the segmentation boundaries.",
        "To overcome this drawback of the phrase-based approach, we introduce a bilingual language model into the phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Table 1 shows the source and target words and demonstrates how the bilingual phrases are constructed and how the source context stays available over segment boundaries in the calculation of the language model score for the sentence.",
        "For example, when calculating the language model score for the word feature P ( fea-ture_Merkmal l common_gemeinsames) we can see that through the bilingual tokens not only the previous target word but also the previous source word is known and can influence the translation even though it is in a different segment."

        "More formally, given a sentence pair e{ = ei...ej",
        "Therefore, the number of bilingual tokens in a sentence equals the number of target words.",

        "This probability is then used in the log-linear combination of a phrase-based translation system as an additional feature.",
        "It is worth mentioning that although it is modeled like a conventional language model, the bilingual language model is an extension to the translation model, since the translation for the source words is modeled and not the fluency of the target text.",
        "To train the model a corpus of bilingual tokens can be created in a straightforward way.",
        "In the generation of this corpus the order of the target words defines the order of the bilingual tokens.",

        "While no word inside a tuple can be aligned to a word outside the tuple, the bilingual tokens are created based on the target words.",

        "We saw that when translating the phrase ein gemeinsames Merkmal using a phrase-based system, the translation of gemeinsames into common can only be influenced by either the preceeding ein # a or by the succeeding Merkmal # feature, but not by both of them at the same time, since either the phrase ein gemeinsames or the phrase gemeinsames Merkmal has to be chosen when segmenting the source sentence for translation.",
        "If we now look at the context that can be used when translating this segment applying the bilingual language model, we see that the translation of gemeinsames into common is on the one hand influenced by the translation of the token ein # a within the bilingual language model probability P (common_gemeinsames | a_ein, <s>).",
        "On the other hand, it is also influenced by the translation of the word Merkmal into feature encoded into the probability P(feature_Merkmal | common_gemeinsames).",

        "In Tables 2 and 3 the results for translation performance on the German-to-English translation task are summarized.",
        "As it can been seen, the improvements of translation quality vary considerably between the two different test sets.",
        "While using the bilingual language model improves the translation by only 0.15 BLEU and 0.21 TER points on Test 1, the improvement on Test 2 is nearly 1 BLEU point and 0.5 TER points.",
        "One intention of using the bilingual language model is its capability to capture the bilingual contexts in a different way.",
        "To see, whether additional bilingual context is used during decoding, we analyzed the context used by the phrase pairs and by the n-gram bilingual language model.",
        "However, a comparison of the different context lengths is not straightforward.",

        "For phrase pairs, normally the average target phrase pair length (avg.",

        "And these two numbers cannot be compared directly.",
        "To be able to compare the context used by the phrase pairs to the context used in the n-gram language model, we calculated the average left context that is used for every target word where the word itself is included, i.e. the context of a single word is 1.",
        "In case of the bilingual language model the score for the average left context is exactly the average length of applied n-grams in a given translation.",
        "For phrase pairs the average left context can be calculated in the following way: A phrase pair oflength 1 gets a left context score of 1.",
        "In a phrase pair of length 2, the first word has a left context score of 1, since it is not influenced by any target word to the left.",
        "The second word in that phrase pair gets a left context count of 2, because it is influenced by the first word in the phrase.",

        "If we compare the average n-gram length of the bilingual language model to the one of the target language model, the n-gram length of the first is of course smaller, since the number of possible bilingual tokens is higher than the number of possible monolingual words.",
        "This can also be seen when looking at the perplexities of the two language models on the generated translations.",
        "While the perplexity of the target language model is 99 and 101 on Test 1 and 2, respectively, the perplexity of the bilingual language model is 512 and 538.",
        "An additional advantage of the n-gram-based approach is the possibility to have overlapping context.",
        "If we would always use phrase pairs of length 2 only half of the adjacent words would influence each other in the translation.",
        "The others are only influenced by the other target words through the language model.",
        "If we in contrast would have a bilingual language model which uses an n-gram length of 2, this means that every choice of word influences the previous and the following word.",
        "To analyze this influence, we counted how many borders of phrase pairs are covered by a bilingual n-gram.",
        "For Test 1, 16783 of the 27785 borders between phrase pairs are covered by a bilingual n-gram.",
        "For Test 2, 9995 of 16735 borders are covered.",
        "Consequently, in both cases at around 60 percent of the borders additional information can be used by the bilingual n-gram language model.",
        "For the German-to-English translation task we performed an additional experiment comparing different n-gram lengths of the bilingual language model.",
        "To ensure comparability between the experiments and avoid additional noise due to different optimization results, we did not perform separate optimization runs for for each of the system variants with different n-gram length, but used the same scaling factors for all of them.",
        "Of course, the system using no bilingual language model was trained independently.",
        "In Tables 4 and 5 we can see that the length of the actually applied n-grams as well as the BLEU score increased until the bilingual language model reaches an order of 4.",
