        "In practice, however, merging decisions will need be taken on the noisy output of the SMT system, and not on the clean training data.",

        "Experiments showed that this method can lead to large improvements over systems using no compound processing, and over previously known compound processing methods.",
        "For merging, we improved an existing list-based heuristic, consisting in checking whether the first of two consecutive words has been observed in a corpus as a compound modifier and their combination has been observed as a compound, introducing the additional constraint that words are merged only if their corpus frequency as a compound is larger than their frequency as a bigram.",
        "We observed that the false negatives of this improved list-based heuristic and of another, known, heuristic based on part-of-speech tags were complementary, and proposed a logical OR of them that generally improves over both.",
