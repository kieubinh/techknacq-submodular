        "In phrase-based machine translation (PBMT), the standard approach is to express the probability distribution p(a,e\\f ) (where f is the source sentence and (a, e) is the aligned target sentence) in terms of a linear model based on a small set of feature functions",
        "The feature functions [hi] typically include log probabilities of generative models such as translation, language and reordering, as well as non-probabilistic features such as word, phrase and distortion penalties.",
        "The feature weights w = [wi] are normally trained using MERT (minimum error rate training) (Och, 2003), to maximise performance as measured by an automated metric such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "MERT training uses a parallel data set (known as the tuning set) consisting of about 1000-2000 sentences, distinct from the data set used to build the generative models.",
        "Optimising the weights in Equation (1) is often referred to as tuning the MT system, to differentiate it from the process of training the generative models.",
        "MERT's inability to scale beyond 20-30 features, as well as its instability (Foster and Kuhn, 2009) have led to investigation into alternative ways of tuning MT systems.",
        "The development of tuning methods is complicated, however by, the use of bleu as an objective function.",
        "This objective in its usual form is not differentiable, and has a highly non-convex error surface (Och, 2003).",
        "Furthermore bleu is evaluated at the corpus level rather than at the sentence level, so tuning methods either have to consider the entire corpus, or resort to a sentence-level approximation of BLEU.",
        "It is unlikely, however, that the difficulties in discriminative MT tuning are due solely to the use of bleu as a metric because evaluation of translation is so difficult, any reasonable gain function is likely to have a complex relationship with the model parameters.",
        "Gradient-based tuning methods, such as minimum risk training, have been investigated as possible alternatives to MERT.",
        "Expected BLEU is normally adopted as the objective since it is differentiable and so can be optimised by a form of stochastic gradient ascent.",
        "The feature expectations required for the gradient calculation can be obtained from n-best lists or lattices (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Li and Eisner, 2009), or using sampling (Arun et al., 2010), both of which can be computationally expensive.",
        "Margin-based techniques such as perceptron training (Liang et al., 2006) and MIRA (Chiang et al., 2008; Watanabe et al., 2007) have also been shown to be able to tune MT systems and scale to large numbers of features, but these generally involve repeatedly decoding the tuning set (and so are expensive) and require sentence-level approximations to the bleu objective.",
        "In this paper we present an alternative method of tuning MT systems known as SampleRank, which has certain advantages over other methods in use today.",
        "SampleRank operates by repeatedly sampling pairs of translation hypotheses (for a given source sentence) and updating the feature weights if the ranking induced by the MT model (1) is different from the ranking induced by the gain function (i.e. bleu).",
        "By considering the translation hypotheses in batches, it is possible to directly optimise corpus level metrics like bleu without resorting to sentence level approximations.",
        "Tuning using SampleRank does not limit the size of the feature set in the same way as MERT does, and indeed it will be shown that SampleRank can successfully train a model with several hundred features.",
        "Using just the core PBMT features and training using SampleRank will be shown to achieve bleu scores which equal or exceed those produced by MERT trained models.",
        "Since SampleRank does not require repeated decoding of the tuning set, and is easily parallelisable, it can run at an acceptable speed, and since it always maintains a complete translation hypothesis, it opens up the possibility of sentence or document level features."

        "The algorithm works by considering each training example (xi, yi) in turn, and repeatedly sampling pairs of outputs from a neighbourhood defined in the space of all possible outputs, updating the weights when the ranking of the pair due to the model scores is different from the ranking due to the gain function.",
        "So if the sampled pair of outputs for xi is (y,yr), where p(y'\\xi) > p(y\\xi), the weights are updated iff gain(y', yi) < gain(y,yi).",

        "For each word in the source, the most likely translation option (according to the weighted phrase-internal score) is selected, and these translations are joined together monotonically.",

        "Whilst MERT (Och, 2003) is still the dominant algorithm used for discriminative training (tuning) of SMT systems, research into improving on MERT's line search has tended to focus either on gradient-based or margin-based techniques.",
        "Gradient-based techniques require a differentiable objective, and expected sentence bleu is the most popular choice, beginning with Smith and Eisner (2006).",
        "They used n-best lists to calculate the feature expectations required for the gradient, optimising a second order Taylor approximation of expected sentence bleu.",
        "They also introduced the idea of deterministic annealing to the SMT community, where an entropy term is added to the objective in training, and has its temperature progressively lowered in order to sharpen the model probability distribution.",
        "The work of Smith and Eisner was extended by Li and Eisner (2009) who were able to obtain much better estimates of feature expectations by using a packed chart instead of an n-best list.",
        "They also demonstrated that their method could extend to large feature sets, although their experiments were only run on small data sets.",
        "An alternative method of calculating the feature expectations for expected bleu training is Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approximation, and this was explored in (Arun et al., 2009) and (Arun et al., 2010).",
        "The sampling methods introduced in this earlier work form the basis of the current work, although in using the sampler for expected bleu training, many samples must be collected before making a parameter weight update, as opposed to the current work where weights may be updated after every sample.",
        "One novel feature of Arun et al.",
        "(2010) is that they were able to train to directly maximise corpus bleu, instead of its sentence-based approximation, although this only made a small difference to the results.",
        "The training methods in (Arun et al., 2010) are very resource intensive, with the experiments running for 48 hours on around 40 cores, on a pruned phrase table derived from Europarl, and a 3-gram language model.",

        "The results presented in Table 6 show that Sam-pleRank is a viable method of parameter tuning for phrase-based MT systems, beating MERT in many cases, and equalling it in others.",
        "It is also able to do what MERT cannot do, and scale to a large number of features, with the phrase boundary feature of",
        "Section 3.4 providing a \"proof-of-concept\".",
        "A further potential advantage of SampleRank is that it allows training with features which depend on the whole sentence, or even the whole document, since a full set of hypotheses is retained throughout training.",
        "Of course adding these features precludes decoding with the usual dynamic programming based decoders, and would require an alternative method, such as MCMC (Arun et al., 2009).",
        "As with the other alternatives to MERT mentioned in this paper, SampleRank training presents the problem of determining convergence.",
        "With MERT this is straightforward, since training (normally) comes to a halt when the estimated tuning bleu stops increasing and the weights stop changing.",
        "With methods such as minimum risk training, MIRA and SampleRank, some kind of early stopping criterion is usually employed, which lengthens training unnecessarily, and adds costly decodes to the training process.",
        "Building up sufficient practical experience with each of these methods will offset these problems somewhat.",
        "Another important item for future work is to compare SampleRank training with MIRA training, in terms of performance, speed and ability to handle large feature sets.",
        "The code used for the experiments in this paper is available under an open source license."
