        "An alternative approach to bilingual topic modeling has been presented that integrates the PLSA framework with MDI adaptation that can effectively adapt a background language model when given a document in the source language.",
        "Rather than training two topic models and enforcing a one-to-one correspondence for translation, we use the assumption that parallel texts refer to the same topics and have a very similar topic distribution.",
        "Preliminary experiments show a reduction in perplexity and an overall improvement in BLEU and NIST scores on speech translation.",
        "We also note that, unlike previous works involving topic modeling, we did not remove stop words and punctuation, but rather assumed that these features would have a relatively uniform topic distribution.",
        "One downside to the MDI adaptation approach is that the computation of the normalization term z(h) is expensive and potentially prohibitive during continuous speech translation tasks.",
        "Further investigation is needed to determine if there is a suitable approximation that avoids computing probabilities across all n-grams."
