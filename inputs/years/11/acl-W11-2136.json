        "Hierarchical models are known to produce high coverage rules, once they are only constrained by the word alignment.",
        "Nevertheless the lack of specialized vocabulary also leads to spurious ambiguity (Chiang, 2005).",
        "Syntax-based models are hierarchical models whose rules are constrained by syntactic informa-tion.The syntactic constraints have an impact in the rule extraction process, reducing drastically the number of rules available to the system.",
        "While this may be helpful to reduce ambiguity, it can lead to poorer performance (Ambati and Lavie, 2008).",
        "Motivated by the fact that syntactically constraining a hierarchical model can decrease translation quality, some attempts to overcome the problems at rule extraction time have been made.",
        "Venugopal and Zollmann (2006) propose a heuristic method to relax parse trees known as Syntax Augmented Machine Translation (SAMT).",
        "Significant gains are obtained by grouping nonterminals under categories when they do not span across syntactic constituents.",
        "Hoang and Koehn (2010) propose a soft syntax-based model which combines the precision of a syntax-constrained model with the coverage of an unconstrained hierarchical model.",
        "Instead of having heuristic strategies to combine nonterminals in a parse tree, whenever a rule cannot be retrieved because it does not span a constituent, the extraction procedure falls back to the hierarchical approach, retrieving a rule with unlabeled nonterminals.",
        "Performance gains are reported over standard hierarchical models using both full parse trees and shallow syntax.",
        "Moving beyond syntactic information, some attempts have recently been made to add semantic annotations to SMT.",
        "Wu and Fung (2009) present a two-pass model to incorporate semantic information to the phrase-based SMT pipeline.",
        "The method performs conventional translation in a first step, followed by a constituent reordering step seeking to maximize the cross-lingual match of the semantic role labels of the translation and source sentences.",
        "Liu and Gildea (2010) add features extracted from the source sentences annotated with semantic role labels in a tree-to-string SMT model.",
        "They modify a syntax-based SMT system in order to penalize/reward role reordering and role deletion.",
        "The input sentence is parsed for semantic roles and the roles are then projected onto the target side using word alignment information at decoding time.",

        "(2010) propose to graft semantic information, namely named entities and modalities, to syntactic tags in a syntax-based model.",
        "The vocabulary of nonterminals is specialized using the semantic categories, for instance, a noun phrase (NP) whose head is a geopolitical entity (GPE) will be tagged as NPGPE, making the rule table less ambiguous.",
        "Similar to (Baker et al., 2010) we specialize a vocabulary of syntactic nonterminals with semantic information, however we use shallow syntax (base-phrases) and semantic role labels instead of constituent parse and named entities.",
        "The resulting shallow trees are relaxed following SAMT (Venugopal and Zollmann, 2006).",
        "Different from previous work we add the semantic knowledge at the level of the corpus annotation.",

        "3 Proposed Method",
        "The proposed method is based on an extension of the hierarchical models in Moses using source language information.",
        "Our submission included systems for two language pairs: English-Spanish (en-es) and English-German (en-de) and was constrained to using data provided by WMT11.",
        "Phrase and rule extraction were performed using the entire en-es and en-de portions of Europarl.",
        "Model parameters were tuned using the news-test2008 dataset.",
        "Three 5-gram Spanish and German language models were trained using SRILM with the News Commentaries (~ 160K sentences), Europarl (~ 2M sentences) and News (~ 5M sentences) corpora.",
        "These models were interpolated using scripts provided in Moses (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).",
        "At preprocessing stage, sentences longer than 80 tokens were filtered from the training/development corpus.",
        "The parallel corpus was then tokenized and truecased.",
        "Additionally, for en-de, compound splitting of the German side of the corpus was performed using a frequency based method described in (Koehn and Knight, 2003).",
        "This method helps alleviate sparsity, reducing the size of the vocabulary by decomposing compounds into their base words.",
        "Recas-ing and detokenization, along with compound merging of the translations into German, were handled at post-processing stage.",
        "Compound merging was performed by finding the most likely sequences of words to be merged into previously seen compounds (Stymne, 2009).",
        "For rule extraction, training and test, the English side of the corpus was annotated with Semantic Role Labels (SRL) using the toolkit SENNA, which also outputs POS and base-phrase (without prepositional attachment) tags.",

        "Semantic roles are assigned to each predicate independently.",
        "As a consequence, the resulting annotation cannot be considered a tree and there is not an obvious hierarchy of predicates in a sentence.",

        "He intends to donate this money to charity, but [A0 he]",
        "Arguments of a single predicate never overlap, however in longer sentences, the occurrence of multiple verbs increases the chances that arguments of different predicates overlap, that is, the argument of a verb might contain or even coincide with the argument of another verb and depending on the verb the argument role might change.",
        "For example, in Figure 2: i) He is both the agent of intend and donate; ii) this money is the donated thing and also part of the chunk which express the intention (to donate this money to charity).",
        "In a different example we can see that arguments might overlap and their roles change completely depending on their target predicates (e.g in I gave you something to eat, you is the recipient of the verb give and the agent of the verb eat).",
        "For this reason, why semantic role labels are usually annotated individually in different structures, as shown in Figure 2, each annotation focusing on a single target verb.",
        "In order to convert the predicates and arguments of a sentence into a single tree, we enrich the POS-tags and base-phrase annotation as follows:",
        "• Semantic labels are directly grafted to the basephrase annotation whenever possible, that is, if a predicate argument coincides with a single base-phrase, the base-phrase type is specialized with the argument role.",
        "In Figure 3, the noun-phrase (NP) the money is specialized into NP:A1:donate, since that single NP is the argument A1 of donate.",
        "• If a predicate argument groups multiple base-phrases, the semantic label applies to a node in a new level of the tree subsuming all these base-phrases.",
        "In Figure 3, the base-phrases to (PP) and charity (NP) are grouped by A2:donate.",
        "• We add the labels sequentially from the shortest chunks to the largest ones.",
        "If two labels spanning the same number of tokens: i) overlap completely, we merge them so that no hierarchy is imposed between their targets (e.g. in Figure 3, the noun-phrase He is specialized into NP:A0:donate,intend); ii) overlap partially, we merge them so that the resulting label will compete against other labels in a different length category.",
        "If a label spanning a larger chunk overlaps partially with a label spanning a shorter chunk, or contains it, we stack them in a way that the first subsumes the second (e.g in Figure 3, A1:intend subsumes VP:T:donate, NP:A1:donate,intend and A2:donate).",

        "On the one hand this finding is somewhat disappointing as we expected that tree-based models would benefit from linguistic annotation.",
