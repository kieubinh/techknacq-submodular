        "We describe the German-English translation system submitted to the shared translation task in the Sixth Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT11) by the ARK research group at Carnegie Mellon University.",
        "The core translation system is a hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system (Chiang, 2007) that has been extended in several ways described in this paper.",
        "Some of our innovations focus on modeling.",
        "Since German and English word orders can diverge considerably, particularly in non-matrix clauses, we focused on feature engineering to improve the modeling of long-distance relationships, which are poorly captured in standard hierarchical phrase-based translation models.",
        "To do so, we developed features that assess the goodness of the source language parse tree under the translation grammar (rather than of a \"linguistic\" grammar).",
        "To train the feature weights, we made use of a novel two-phase training algorithm that incorporates a probabilistic training objective and standard minimum error training (Och, 2003).",
        "These segmentation features were supplemented with a 7-gram class-based language model, which more directly models long-distance relationships.",
        "Together, these features provide a modest improvement over the baseline and suggest interesting directions for future work.",
        "While our work on parse modeling was involved and required substantial changes to the training pipeline, some other modeling enhancements were quite simple: for example, improving how out-of-vocabulary words are handled.",
        "We propose a very simple change, and show that it provides a small, consistent gain.",
        "On the training side, we had two improvements over our baseline system.",
        "First, we were inspired by the work of Madnani (2010), who showed that when training to optimize BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), overriding is reduced by supplementing a single human-generated reference translation with additional computer-generated references.",
        "We generated supplementary pseudo-references for our development set (which is translated into many languages, but once) by using MT output from a secondary Spanish-English translation system.",
        "Second, following Foster and Kuhn (2009), we used a secondary development set to select from among many optimization runs, which further improved generalization.",
        "We largely sought techniques that did not require language-specific resources (e.g., treebanks, POS annotations, morphological analyzers).",
        "An exception is a compound segmentation model used for preprocessing that was trained on a corpus of manually segmented German.",
        "Aside from this, no further manually annotated data was used, and we suspect many of the improvements described here can be had in other language pairs.",
        "Despite avoiding language-specific resources and using only the training data provided by the workshop, an extensive manual evaluation determined that the outputs produced were of significantly higher quality than both statistical and rule-based systems that made use of language-specific resources (Callison-Burch et al., 2011)."

      "text": [
        "Our translation system is based on a hierarchical phrase-based translation model (Chiang, 2007), as implemented in the cdec decoder (Dyer et al., 2010).",
        "Since German is a language that makes productive use of \"closed\" compounds (compound words written as a single orthographic token), we use a CRF segmentation model of to evaluate the probability of all possible segmentations, encoding the most probable ones compactly in a lattice (Dyer, 2009).",
        "For the purposes of grammar induction, the single most probable segmentation of each word in the source side of the parallel training data under the model was inferred.",
        "The parallel data were aligned using the Giza++ implementation of IBM Model 4 run in both directions and then symmetrized using the grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Och and Ney, 2002; Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "The aligned corpus was encoded as a suffix array (Lopez, 2008) and lattice-specific grammars (containing just the rules that are capable of matching spans in the input lattice) were extracted for each sentence in the test and development sets, using the heuristics recommended by Chiang (2007).",
        "A 4-gram modified Kneser-Ney language model (Chen and Goodman, 1996) was constructed using the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) from the English side of the parallel text, the monolingual English data, and the English version 4 Giga-word corpus (Parker et al., 2009).",
        "Since there were many duplicate segments in the training data (much of which was crawled from the web), duplicate segments and segments longer than 100 words were removed.",
        "Inference was carried out using the language modeling library described by Heafield (2011).",
        "The newstest-200 9 set (with the 500 longest segments removed) was used for development, and newstest-2010 was used as a development test set.",
        "Results in this paper are reported on the dev-test set using uncased bleu4 with a single reference translation.",
        "Minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) was used to optimize the parameters of the system to maximize bleu on the development data, and inference was performed over a pruned hypergraph representation of the translation hypothesis space (Kumar et al., 2009).",
        "For the experiments reported in this paper, Viterbi (max-derivation) decoding was used.",
        "The system submitted for manual evaluation used segment-level MBR decoding with 1 â€“ bleu as the loss function, approximated over a 500-best list for each sentence.",
        "This reliably results in a small but consistent improvement in translation quality, but is much more time consuming to compute (Kumar and Byrne, 2004) ."

      "heading": "3. Source parse structure modeling",
      "text": [
        "Improving phrase-based translation systems is challenging in part because our intuitions about what makes a \"good\" phrase or translation derivation are often poor.",
        "For example, restricting phrases and rules to be consistent with syntactic constituents consistently harms performance (Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006; Koehn et al., 2003), although our intuitions might suggest this is a reasonable thing to do.",
        "On the other hand, it has been shown that incorporating syntactic information in the form of features can lead to improved performance (Chiang, 2010; Gimpel and Smith, 2009; Marton and Resnik, 2008).",
        "Syntactic features that are computed by assessing the overlap of the translation parse with a linguistic parse can be understood to improve translation because they lead to a better model of what a \"correct\" parse of the source sentence is under the translation grammar.",
        "Like the \"soft syntactic features\" used in previous work (Marton and Resnik, 2008; Chiang et al., 2008), we propose features to assess the tree structure induced during translation.",
        "However, unlike that work, we do not rely on linguistic source parses, but instead only make use of features that are directly computable from the source sentence and the parse structure being considered in the decoder.",
        "In particular, we take inspiration from the model of Klein and Manning (2002), which models constituency in terms of the contexts that rule productions occur in.",
        "Additionally, we make use of salient aspects of the spans being dominated by a nonterminal, such as the words at the beginning and end of the span, and the length of the span.",
        "Importantly, the features do not rely on the target words being predicted, but only look at the structure of the translation derivation.",
        "As such, they can be understood as monolingual parse features?",
        "Table 1 lists the feature templates that were used.",
        "Table 1: Context feature templates for features extracted from every translation rule used; i and j indicate hypothesized constituent span, x is its nonterminal category label (in our grammar, X or S), and fk is the kth word of the source sentence, with f<1 = (s) and f>|f| = (/s).",
        "If a word fk is not among the 1000 most frequent words in the training corpus, it is replaced by a special unknown token.",
        "The SMALLCAPS prefixes prevent accidental feature collisions.",
        "The parse features just introduced are numerous and sparse, which means that MERT can not be used to infer their weights.",
        "Instead, we require a learning algorithm that can cope with millions of features and avoid overfitting, perhaps by eliminating most of the features and keeping only the most valuable (which would also keep the model compact).",
        "Furthermore, we would like to be able to still target the bleu measure of translation quality during learning.",
        "While large-scale discriminative training for machine translation is a widely studied problem 2007; Arun and Koehn, 2007; Liang et al., 2006), no tractable algorithm exists for learning a large number of feature weights while directly optimizing a corpus-level metric like bleu.",
        "Rather than resorting to a decomposable approximation, we have explored a new two-phase training algorithm in development of this system.",
        "The two-phase algorithm works as follows.",
        "In phase 1, we use a non-bleu objective to train a translation model that includes the large feature set.",
        "Then, we use this model to compute a small number of coarse \"summary features,\" which summarize the \"opinion\" of the first model about a translation hypothesis in a low dimensional space.",
        "Then, in the second training pass, MERT is used to determine how much weight to give these summary features together with the other standard coarse translation features.",
        "At test time, translation becomes a multi-step process as well.",
        "The hypothesis space is first scored using the phase-1 model, then summary features are computed, then the hypothesis space is rescored with the phase-2 model.",
        "As long as the features used factor with the edges in the translation space (which ours do), this can be carried out in linear time in the size of the translation forest.",
        "For the first model, which includes the sparse parse features, we learn weights in order to optimize penalized conditional log likelihood (Blunsom et al., 2008).",
        "We are specifically interested in modeling an unobserved variable (i.e., the parse tree underlying a translation derivation), this objective is quite natural, since probabilistic models offer a principled account of unobserved data.",
        "Furthermore, because our features factor according to edges in the translation forest (they are \"stateless\" in standard MT terminology), there are efficient dynamic programming algorithms that can be used to exactly compute the expected values of the features (Lari and Young, 1990), which are necessary for computing the gradients used in optimization.",

        "Since we not only want to prevent over fitting but also want a small model, we use R(6) = k |, the l1 norm, which forces many parameters to be exactly 0.",
        "Although L is not convex in 6 (on account of the latent derivation variable), we make use of an online stochastic gradient descent algorithm that imposes an li penalty on the objective (Tsuruoka et al., 2009).",
        "Online algorithms are often effective for non-convex objectives (Liang and Klein, 2009).",
        "We selected 12,500 sentences randomly from the news-commentary portion of the training data to use to train the latent variable model.",
        "Using the standard rule extraction heuristics (Chiang, 2007), 9,967 of the sentence pairs could be derived.",
        "In addition to the parse features describe above, the standard phrase features (relative frequency and lexical translation probabilities), and a rule count feature were included.",
        "Training was run for 48 hours on a single machine, which resulted in 8 passes through the training data, instantiating over 8M unique features.",
        "The regularization strength A was chosen so that approximately 10,000 (of the 8M) features would be non-zero.",
        "As outlined above, the phase 1 model will be incorporated into the final translation model using a low dimensional \"summary\" of its opinion.",
        "Because we are using a probabilistic model, posterior probabilities (given the source sentence f) under the parsing model are easily defined and straightforward to compute with dynamic programming.",
        "We made use of four summary features: the posterior log probability log pe (e, d|f) ; for every rule r G d, the probability of its span being a constituent under the parse model; the probabilities that some span starts at the r's starting index, or that some rule ends at r's ending index.",
        "Once these summary features have been computed, the sparse features are discarded, and the summary features are reweighted using coefficients learned by MERT, together with the standard MT features (language model, word penalty, etc.).",
        "This provides a small improvement over our already very strong baseline, as the first two rows in Table 2 show.",
        "The parsing features above were intended to improve long range reordering quality.",
        "To further support the modeling of larger spans, we incorporated a 7-gram class-based language model.",
        "Automatic word clusters are attractive because they can be learned for any language without supervised data, and, unlike part-of-speech annotations, each word is in only a single class, which simplifies inference.",
        "We performed Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992) on 900k sentences from our language modeling data (including the news commentary corpus and a subset of Gigaword).",
        "We obtained 1,000 clusters using an implementation provided by Liang (2005),as Turian et al.",
        "(2010) found that relatively large numbers clusters gave better performance for information extraction tasks.",
        "We then replaced words with their clusters in our language modeling data and built a 7-gram LM with Witten-Bell smoothing (Witten and Bell, 1991).",

        "To ensure that such elements are well-modeled, we augment our translation grammar so that every token in the input can translate as itself and add a feature that counts the number of times such self-translation rules are used in a translation hypothesis.",
        "This is in contrast to the behavior of most other decoders, such as Moses, which only permit a token to translate as itself if it is learned from the training data, or if there is no translation in the phrase table at all.",

        "These computer-generated paraphrases are just used to compute \"better\" bleu scores, but not directly as examples of target translations.",
